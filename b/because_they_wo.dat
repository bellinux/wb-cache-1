"So off I sot, {{and there}} wos a crowd o' {{about two hundred}} miners round a tree; and, jest as I come up, <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> puttin' the rope round the neck of a poor wretch of an old grey-haired red-skin, whose limbs trembled so that <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> scarce able to hold him up.|$|R

'Tis said the first hunters used to wonder greatly at these myster'ous circles, and they invented all sorts o' stories to account for 'em.

If <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> paupers, it wouldn't {{be a big}} sum for 'em to give out o' any pocket-money they might chance to git from their pauper friends, but they're well-dressed people, Dick, and they seems to be well off! Four an' fourpence a year! think o' that--not to mention the {{deduction}} w'en they goes {{for a month or}} two to the country each summer. Four an' fourpence a year, Dick! Some of 'em even goes so low as a halfpenny, which makes two an' twopence a year--7 pounds, 11 shillings, 8 pence in a seventy-year lifetime, Dick, supposin' their liberality began to flow the day <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> born!' ...|$|R

If <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> a pair o' patent double million magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra power, p'raps I {{might be}} able to see through a flight o' stairs and a deal door; but bein' only eyes, you see, my wision 's limited.' ...|$|R

"Faix, that's true," [...] replied Jerry; [...] "there's two {{philosophers}} aboord of {{this here}} light, an' the luminous power of our united intellicks {{is so strong}} that I've had it in my mind more than wance to suggest that if <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> to hoist you and me to the masthead together, the Gull would git on first-rate without any lantern at all." ...|$|R

The fact is, they can't bust. They're too useless even for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{object to}} givin' dogs names on principle. It's {{too much like}} treatin' them as if <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> Christians; and, you know, they couldn't be Christians {{if they wanted to}} ever so much. Besides, wotever name you gives 'em, there must be so many other dogs with the same name, that you stand a chance o' the wrong dog comin' to 'e ven you calls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? {{because from}} my {{earliest}} years I always {{was fond of}} animals. No matter what sort <b>they</b> <b>wos,</b> I liked 'em all--birds an' beasts an' fishes, flyers and creepers, an' squeakers and flutterers," [...] said the boy, clasping both hands over one knee, and rocking himself to and fro on the counter, while he gazed into the owl's face with the air of one whose mind is rambling far away into the remote past.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure? In coorse I is--sartin sure. Didn't he lamp two on 'em with a rope's-end once till <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> fit to bust, and all for nothin' but skylarkin'?

6000|$|... "I axe your pardon, sir," [...] {{said the}} man, a little abashed by Will's grave manner; [...] "didn't know <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> friends of yours. No offence, I 'ope.

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] remarked Buzzby, as {{he stood}} with folded arms by the capstan, [...] "many and many a good ship has {{been sent to the}} bottom by that same. I've see'd a brig, with my own two eyes, {{squeezed}} together a'most flat by two big floes of ice, and after doin' it they jist separated agin an' let her go plump down to the bottom. Before she was nipped, the crew saved themselves by jumpin' on to the ice, and <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> picked up by our ship that wos in company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I dunno," [...] {{rejoined the}} farrier, [...] "it don't seem nateral for white men to quarrel {{with each other}} about the way to treat an Injin, and that Injin lyin' in ambush to shoot 'em both. And ef gov'ment would only make up its mind how to treat 'em, instead of one day pretendin' to be their 'Great Father' and treatin' them like babies, and the next makin' {{treaties}} with 'em like as <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> forriners, and the next sendin' out a handful of us to lick ten thousand of them--Wot's the use of ONE regiment--even two--agin a nation--on their own ground?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Both,' replied Sam; 'easy shavin' was his natur', and cuttin' and curlin' was {{his pride}} and glory. His whole delight wos in his trade. He spent {{all his money}} in bears, and run in debt for 'em besides, and there <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> a {{growling}} avay down in the front cellar all day long, and ineffectooally gnashing their teeth, vile the grease o' their relations and friends wos being re-tailed in gallipots in the shop above, and the first-floor winder wos ornamented vith their heads; not to speak o' the dreadful aggrawation {{it must have been}} to 'em to see a man alvays a walkin' up and down the pavement outside, vith the portrait of a bear in his last agonies, and underneath in large letters, [...] "Another fine animal wos slaughtered yesterday at Jinkinson's!"

6000|$|Mr Sloppy having shaken {{his head}} to a {{considerable}} extent, proceeded to remark that he thought Johnny 'must have took 'em from the Minders.' Being asked what he meant, he answered, them that come out upon him and partickler his chest. Being requested to explain himself, he stated {{that there was some}} of 'em wot you couldn't kiver with a sixpence. Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case, he opined that <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> about as red as ever red could be. 'But as long as they strikes out'ards, sir,' continued Sloppy, 'they ain't so much. It's their striking in'ards that's to be kep off.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir, they warn't all of 'em lost. A brig saw 'em at daylight, {{but just}} as <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> being picked up, one wos so {{exhausted}} he slipped off the wreck an wos drownded. 'Nother time," [...] continued Moy, as he paced slowly to and fro, [...] "we seed a corp float past, and tried to 'ook it with the boat-'ook, but missed it.

6000|$|But Pansy, {{responding}} {{again to}} the company rather than her guardian's counsel, and as if appealing to them, went on half poutingly: [...] "Yes!

5000|$|According to Lightfoot, [...] "the Christianized Essennes … {{condemned}} {{the slaughter of}} victims on grounds very different from those alleged in the Epistle of Hebrews, not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have been superseded by the Atonement, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are in their very nature repulsive to God; not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have ceased to be right, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> never were right from the beginning".|$|R
60|$|From a {{very early}} age, indeed, this false note in Dolly had begun to make itself heard. While she was yet quite a child, Herminia noticed with a certain tender but {{shrinking}} regret that Dolly seemed to attach undue importance to the mere upholsteries and equipages of life,--to rank, wealth, title, servants, carriages, jewelry. At first, to be sure, Herminia hoped this might prove but the passing foolishness of childhood: as Dolly grew up, however, it became clearer each day that the defect was in the grain--that Dolly's whole mind was incurably and congenitally aristocratic or snobbish. She had that mean admiration for birth, position, adventitious advantages, which is {{the mark of the}} beast in the essentially aristocratic or snobbish nature. She admired people <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were rich, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were high-placed, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were courted, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were respected; not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were good, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were wise, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were noble-natured, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were respect-worthy.|$|R

60|$|Everything {{was to be}} {{done very}} systematically. She would have Leghorns, Brahmas, and common fowls.
