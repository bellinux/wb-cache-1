Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a <b>beer</b> <b>wagon</b> {{similar to that used}} before the invention of the modern motorized truck.|$|E

25|$|Much of Tobin's {{presidency}} was consumed by a long-running and sometimes physically violent jurisdictional {{battle with the}} National Union of United Brewery Workmen. The Teamsters had challenged the Brewery Workmen's right to organize <b>beer</b> <b>wagon</b> drivers in 1903 and 1905. At Tobin's insistence, in 1907 the AFL revoked the Brewery Workers' charter, but a firestorm of protest from local unions around the country led the AFL to reinstate the charter in 1909. In 1933, the AFL Executive Council agreed to strip the brewery workers' union, {{now known as the}} United Brewery Workers, of the beer drivers. The United Brewery Workers filed suit in federal court in 1936 seeking to bar their suspension and the transfer of workers to the Teamsters. As the case worked its way to the Supreme Court of the United States the AFL attempted to mediate the dispute to no avail. The Supreme Court found in the AFL's favor, and the United Brewery Workers were suspended from the AFL.|$|E
25|$|Tobin {{undertook}} long jurisdictional {{battles with}} many unions during this period. Fierce disputes occurred between the Teamsters and the Gasoline State Operators' National Council (an AFL federal union of gas station attendants), the International Longshoremen's Association, the Retail Clerks International Union, and the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks. The most significant disagreement, however, {{was with the}} United Brewery Workers over the right to represent <b>beer</b> <b>wagon</b> drivers. While the Teamsters lost this battle in 1913, when the AFL awarded jurisdiction to the Brewers, they won when the issue came before the AFL Executive Board again in 1933, when the Brewers were still recovering from their near-elimination during Prohibition. The raids and new member organizing in the 1930s led to significant membership increases. Teamster membership stood at just 82,000 in 1932. Tobin {{took advantage of the}} wave of pro-union sentiment engendered by the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and by 1935 union membership had increased nearly 65 percent to 135,000. By 1941, Tobin had a dues-paying membership of 530,000—making the Teamsters the fastest-growing labor union in the United States.|$|E

50|$|As of January 1, 2009, {{there were}} 233 {{registered}} horses, including 84 brood mares and 6 breeding stallions. At that point, concerns were raised about {{increasing amounts of}} inbreeding leading to decreased health and reproductive efficiency and increasing amounts of undesirable traits. All six of the breeding stallions were considered inbred, and three were closely related to each other. Because of these low population numbers and limited breeding stock, further inbreeding is almost inevitable. As of 2011, the breed {{is considered to be}} endangered and is found mainly in the Lääne-Viru and Ida-Viru counties. The Estonian Draft is one of three recognized horse breeds in Estonia; the others being the Tori and the Estonian Native horse. The Estonian Horse Breeders' Society is responsible for the monitoring and conservation of the breed. Although originally bred for agricultural uses, in the 21st century they are mainly used for small-scale gardening. A few are employed in forestry, while others appear in horse shows and pulling <b>beer</b> <b>wagons.</b> The breed is the least populous of the three Estonian breeds.|$|R
500|$|The Jutland horse (...) is a {{draft horse}} breed {{originating}} in Denmark, {{named after the}} Jutland Peninsula which forms {{the western part of}} the country. [...] Usually chestnut, they are a compact, muscular breed known for their calm and willing temperament. The breed was originally developed for use in agriculture, but today is more often seen in urban settings and at horse shows. Some of the best known members of the breed pull <b>beer</b> <b>wagons</b> for the Carlsberg brewery around Copenhagen, as well as at competitions and for demonstrations. Images from the 9th century show a horse similar to the Jutland being used by Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain. The first written record is from the 12th century, when they were popular as war horses. Some infusion of bloodlines from other breeds occurred in the 18th century, but the modern Jutland type only began about 1850 with the addition of blood from several other breeds, mainly draft horses. A stud book was created in the late 19th century, and the Jutland population grew to a maximum of around 15,000 by 1950. Numbers subsequently declined, and as of 2011 it is estimated that there are only about 1,000 horses remaining.|$|R

Several professional handlers accompany each team. Often, one handler has night duty to provide round-the-clock care for the horses. Transportation for each hitch requires three 50-foot semis. Two carry the horses, the third transports a red, white and gold <b>beer</b> <b>wagon</b> and other equipment. The horses' comfort is enhanced with air-cushion suspension and thick rubber flooring, and cameras in the trailers enable the drivers to watch the horses during transport.

Many deaths in Cambria resulted from disease (most of these victims were children) and mining disasters. The mining company later placed a prohibition on all alcohol stronger than beer, and saloons and dance halls were banned. This resulted in bootlegging. Fatal brawls were not uncommon in the town.
