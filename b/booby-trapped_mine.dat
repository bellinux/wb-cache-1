25|$|The Führungsstelle or Kommandoturm ("command tower") was {{a shorter}} and rarer type of tower {{that served as}} the command centre of a border sector. It {{contained}} monitoring and control equipment to open border gates remotely, turn on and off fence lighting and alert lights, rotate searchlights and so on. Disturbances of the signal wire and detonations of SM-70 <b>booby-trap</b> <b>mines</b> would be detected by the command tower. The towers were topped with long-range radio antennae to communicate via R-105 radio to other units. A distinctive feature of this type of tower was the prominent air intake box at ground level.|$|R

50|$|The Army EOD {{mission is}} to support {{national}} security strategy by providing the capability to neutralize hazards from conventional UXO, NBC and associated materials, and IED (both explosive and NBC), that present a threat to operations, installations, personnel, and/or material. Army EOD forces also may dispose of hazardous foreign or US ammunition, UXO, individual <b>mines,</b> <b>booby-trapped</b> <b>mines,</b> and chemical mines.

EOD provides the Army with a rapidly deployable support package for the elimination of hazards from UXO in any operational environment. The EOD force serves as a combat multiplier by neutralizing UXO that is restricting freedom of movement and denying access to supplies, facilities, and other critical assets. Army EOD forces equip, train, and organize to support tactical land forces across the spectrum of operations, to include peacekeeping, military operations other than war (MOOTW),and MTW.|$|R

2500|$|By 14 August the {{division}} had {{pushed to the}} north bank of the River Noireau, where the crossings had been measured by the RE Reconnaissance Party. During the night of 15/16 August the infantry waded across and established a bridgehead, while 204 Fd Co advanced with a waterproofed bulldozer, three tipper lorries of flexboards, four landing stage units and two boat units, and No 1 Platoon got to work on clearing mines, building a tank ford and a trestle bridge. Downstream the river split into two streams, but No 2 Platoon erected two Class 9 trestle bridges. Meanwhile, 553 Fd Co began work on {{the division}}'s first Bailey bridge across the demolished road bridge. They found that the bridge abutments were too small to take the baseplates, {{which had to be}} set back, meaning that a 120-foot (37m) span rather than 80 foot (25m) was required. Work could not be started until daylight [...] and it took two days to clear all the <b>booby-trapped</b> <b>mines,</b> 204 Fd Co losing a complete section of men. Lieutenant Martin and Sapper Murphy discovered that the mines had a new tamper-proof TMIZ 43 igniter, which led to a new recovery drill throughout the army, probably saving hundreds of lives.|$|R

50|$|At 07:00 on 13 January the Marines {{landed on}} the {{peninsula}} meeting negligible resistance. Once ashore the Marines linked up with Task Force Cooksey and then pushed east forcing the Vietcong towards the sea. While encounters with the Vietcong were minimal, the Marines encountered extensive networks of <b>mines,</b> <b>booby-traps</b> and fortifications. On 19 January 2/26 Marines captured 56 Vietnamese of military age, under interrogation they {{were found to be}} members of the C-95th Sapper Company. The Marines evacuated numerous civilians for screening, eventually totaling some 11,900 people.|$|R
50|$|The Irgun {{subsequently}} {{carried out}} its threat to hang Sergeants Martin and Paice; {{the two men}} were killed and their bodies were hanged from trees and <b>booby-trapped</b> with a <b>mine</b> that injured an officer trying to cut one of them down. This incident shocked and enraged the British authorities and public, and led to violent reprisals by British troops that killed five Jews in Tel Aviv and several days of antisemitic rioting in British cities. However, it also led to the suspension of the death penalty in Palestine, and has been cited as a major catalyst for the eventual British withdrawal from Palestine.|$|R
50|$|The Guard {{was charged}} with putting down the guerrilla {{activities}} of the local anti-treaty IRA. They were perhaps embittered by the killing of their erstwhile commander in chief, Michael Collins, and of their comrades in several ambushes. As a result, they acted with great severity in Kerry. Over 40 Republicans died in custody during the war or were summarily shot when captured. On at least three occasions in March 1923, Dublin Guard troops massacred republican prisoners after five of their men {{had been killed by}} <b>booby-trap</b> (trap <b>mine)</b> bomb at Knocknagoshel. Particularly notorious was the Ballyseedy Massacre, where nine Republican prisoners were tied to a landmine which was then detonated. One of the prisoners survived to recount the incident. However, reprisals by the Dublin Guard against local civilians were rare. One recorded instance came in February 1923, when three individuals later identified as National Army officers shot dead two railway drivers whom they suspected of republican sympathies. Another feature of the Dublin Guard was the high number of combat injuries sustained by its senior officers.|$|R
50|$|On 11 April {{news came}} {{that a large}} convoy of Pak {{soldiers}} consisting of two hundred vehicles was coming to Rajshahi from Dhaka. To resist them defence array was formed in Baneswar, Arani and Biraldaha. Barricades were made {{on the road with}} trees. Few <b>booby-trap</b> and <b>mines</b> were set inside the barricade. Pak soldiers tried to remove the barricades and the mines exploded resulting in death and injury of a number of Pak soldiers. On the evening of 12 April Pak soldiers came forward towards Baneswar and a company of freedom fighters tried to resist them. They shot 30 inch mortar shell on the enemy forces. Both groups fought the whole night at Charghat. But freedom fighters couldn’t cope up with heavily armed Pak soldiers. In that battle Assistant Teacher Abu Bakar Siddique who was a company commander of the freedom fighters fought to death with an LMG in a trench near Charghat Bazar. His graveyard is located near Charghat thana. This patriotic and brave freedom fighter was awarded with ‘Bir Bikram’ title.|$|R
50|$|Protocol II on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of <b>Mines,</b> <b>Booby-Traps</b> and Other Devices was amended on May 3, 1996, to {{strengthen}} its provisions and extend the scope of application to cover both international and internal armed conflicts. The protocol regulates, but does not ban, land mines. It prohibits the use of non-detectable anti-personnel mines and their transfer; prohibits the use of non-self-destructing and non-self-deactivating mines outside fenced, monitored and marked areas; prohibits directing mines and booby traps against civilians; requires parties to the conflict to remove mines and booby traps when the conflict ends; broadens obligations of protecting peacekeeping and other missions of the United Nations and its agencies; requires States to enforce compliance with its provisions within their jurisdiction; and calls for penal sanctions in case of violation.|$|R
25|$|Physicians for Human Rights {{describe}} one tactic {{employed by}} Barre's troops {{used in their}} campaign against the Isaaq people of the north:One of the cruelest – and clearly unlawful – tactics used by Siad Barre's troops was the deliberate mining of civilian homes. In 1988, government forces shelled and bombed the capital of Hargeisa. Before fleeing, many residents buried their valuables in holes dug in the floors or courtyards of their homes. Upon discovering these stashes, soldiers removed the jewellery and other valuables and placed <b>booby-traps</b> or <b>mines</b> in these hiding places. After the fighting ceased, {{many of those who}} had fled returned to their homes in the first months of 1991 only to be injured or killed by these hidden explosives... Some families were said to be squatting outside their houses because they were afraid to enter.... Siad Barre's forces deliberately mined wells and grazing lands in an effort to kill and terrorize nomadic herders whom the army viewed as protectors of the SNM. While direct evidence is not available, most observers agree that Siad Barre's forces undertook this extensive mining to prevent resettlement by the predominantly Isaak nomads and agriculturists. The British mine-clearing company Rimfire, contracted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to conduct de-mining activities has identified land-mines from 24 different countries in Somalia. The majority were from the Czech Republic, Russia, Pakistan and Belgium.|$|R
50|$|Rice {{is brought}} in by Captain Stuart (Michael Gough) to help {{solve the problem of}} small <b>booby-trapped</b> {{explosive}} devices (<b>mines)</b> being dropped by Nazi bombers, which have killed four people, including three children. They receive some useful information from a critically wounded young soldier (Bryan Forbes in his debut). Two further mines are found at Chesil Beach: they look like common thermos flasks. Stuart is first on the scene but has difficulty getting Rice on the telephone in his flat because Rice is alone following his breakup, angry, drunk and destructive. Rice quickly sobers up, and travels to Chesil Beach only to find that Stuart tried to defuse one of the mines and has been blown up. Rice sets to work on the second mine after listening to the notes Stuart dictated to an ATS corporal (Renée Asherson) during his effort earlier in the day. He discovers that the mine has two booby traps, not one, and manages to defuse them both.|$|R
50|$|It {{became the}} task of the U.S. 34th (Red Bull) Division (joined {{temporarily}} by the 142nd Infantry Regiment of the 36th Division, which had been held in reserve and unused during the Rapido crossing) to fight southward along the linked hilltops towards the intersecting ridge on the south end of which was Monastery Hill. They could then break through down into the Liri valley behind the Gustav Line defences. It was very tough going: the mountains were rocky, strewn with boulders and cut by ravines and gullies. Digging foxholes on the rocky ground {{was out of the question}} and each feature was exposed to fire from surrounding high points. The ravines were no better since the gorse growing there, far from giving cover, had been sown with <b>mines,</b> <b>booby-traps</b> and hidden barbed wire by the defenders. The Germans had had three months to prepare their defensive positions using dynamite and to stockpile ammunition and stores. There was no natural shelter and the weather was wet and freezing cold.|$|R
50|$|The CCW is a {{framework}} convention with five protocols, which ban or restrict {{the use of}} various types of weapons that are deemed to cause unnecessary suffering, or affect either soldiers or civilians indiscriminately. The weapons covered include: weapons that leave undetectable fragments in the body (Protocol I - 1980); <b>mines,</b> <b>booby-traps</b> and other devices (Protocol II - 1980, amended in 1996); incendiary weapons (Protocol III - 1980); blinding laser weapons (Protocol IV - 1995); and explosive remnants of war (Protocol V - 2003). As of 1 February 2011, 113 States had joined the Convention. The GICHD has observer status at the High Contracting Parties meetings {{taking place in the}} framework of the CCW.The Centre has an observer status and assists High Contracting Parties, at their request, in their efforts to minimise human suffering caused by landmines, booby traps and other devices, explosive remnants of war and cluster munitions, which are covered by the ongoing work of the CCW and its Group of Governmental Experts. Since 1999, the GICHD has supported the CCW, primarily by providing expert advice in order to promote the development of, and compliance with, the obligations contained in CCW. In addition, the GICHD is administering the CCW Sponsorship Programme, as mandated by the High Contracting Parties at the CCW Third Review Conference in November 2006.|$|R
