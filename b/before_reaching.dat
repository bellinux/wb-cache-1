40|$|ABSTRACT: Adult hand {{preference}} {{emerges from}} complex developmental changes in arm and hand use during childhood. Recent reports have highlighted {{the importance of}} understanding arm and hand use {{during the first year}} of life including the period <b>before</b> <b>reach</b> onset. This longitudinal study tested the hypothesis that significant right–left differences exist in pre-reaching arm movements. We examined right and left hand kinematics from 13 healthy infants during trials with and without a toy present from 8 weeks of age through the week of reach onset. Significant right–left differences were found, however there was no clear pattern within a condition or across conditions. Without a toy present, the right hand moved faster, yet ended further from midline, and displayed more movements during the Late phase compared to other phases. With a toy present, the right hand moved longer lengths, yet ended movements further away from the toy. When left and right hand kinematics were combined, previous findings of right hand kinematics alone were supported. Although infants begin adapting their pre-reaching kinematics many weeks <b>before</b> <b>reach</b> onset, we did not find evidence of a systematic right–left difference <b>before</b> <b>reach</b> onset in movements with or without a toy present. Our results, coupled with other reports, suggest hand asymmetries begin to emerge over the year following reach onset amid developmental changes both within the infant...|$|R
5|$|Bringing {{dead and}} seriously wounded {{down from the}} top was {{difficult}} for both sides. UN litter-bearing teams of six men had to carry each wounded man on a stretcher down the mountain. A medical aide was also needed to administer care during the trip if the man was critically wounded, and riflemen often accompanied the groups to protect them from North Korean snipers along the trail. Critically wounded men often died <b>before</b> <b>reaching</b> the bottom where full medical care could be administered. This possibility was one of the factors that lowered morale in the 24th Infantry units fighting on Battle Mountain. Many men were afraid that if they were wounded there they would die <b>before</b> <b>reaching</b> adequate medical care. North Korean troops often did not have time to move dead and wounded from the peak at all, forcing both sides to bury casualties in shallow graves along the peak.|$|E
