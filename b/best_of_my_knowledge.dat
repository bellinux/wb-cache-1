2500|$|Under the new {{whistleblower}} program, the SEC {{is authorized}} to make monetary awards to whistleblower who voluntarily provide original information {{that leads to}} successful enforcement actions resulting in monetary sanctions over $1,000,000. Under the program, a whistleblower may receive an award of between 10 to 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. The SEC's new whistleblower program also allows whistleblower to submit anonymous complaints if represented by an attorney. This represents a major benefit over other whistleblower reward programs that do not allow anonymous submissions, such as the IRS whistleblower program.

2500|$|Thomas Haigh, a {{historian}} {{of information technology}} at the University of Wisconsin, wrote that [...] "Ayyadurai is, to the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> {{the only person to}} have claimed for him or herself the title 'inventor of email'." [...] Haigh argued that while EMAIL was impressive for a teenager's work, it contained no features that were not present on previous electronic mail systems and had no obvious influence on later systems. [...] "The most striking thing about Ayyadurai's claim to have invented electronic mail is how late it comes. Somehow it took him thirty years to alert the world to [...] greatest achievement". Haigh wrote that by 1980, [...] "electronic mail had been in use at MIT for 15 years, Xerox had built a modern, mouse-driven graphical email system for office communication, Compuserve was selling email access to the public, and email had for many years been the most popular application on what was soon to become the Internet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{purchase}} by the Northern Pacific of the stock, the Lake Shore, finding {{it impossible to}} provide adequate terminal facilities at Spokane from the proceeds of [...] main line bonds, organized a company under {{the title of the}} Spokane Union Depot Company, to which the Washington and Idaho Railroad (a branch of the Union Pacific System), were admitted to half ownership. Bonds were issued amounting to a little over $400,000. The stock issue of $500,000 was divided equally between the two companies. The Lake Shore was reimbursed for the work on that portion of their main line within the limits of the depot grounds from the proceeds of the depot bonds, but to the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> and belief, the railway bonds were never cancelled. This property I have nominally estimated at $600,000 ... but its real value is probably at least $1,000,000. It is used by the Oregon Railway and Navigation [...] and the Great Northern systems, and these companies would have to expend at least $1,000,000 to provide equivalent facilities of less actual value. I have made repeated efforts for several years past to have this matter investigated, but owing to the circumstances have thus far been unsuccessful. If this depot stock does not come under the line of the Lake Shore bonds, it could doubtless be attached to satisfy some claims of the Northern Pacific against the Lake Shore.|$|E

40|$|Professor A. Strekalovsky (Irkutsk) {{has made}} me {{aware of the fact}} that in [4], Comtet merely reformulates (with proper credit) the Motzkin/Straus result [7] on the {{connection}} between the Maximum Clique Problem and global solutions to a certain standard quadratic optimization problem (QP), the so-called Motzkin/Straus program. Motivated by an (overly modest?) citation in [5], I erroneously related Comtet to the regularization of the Motzkin/Straus program put forward in my articles [1, 2]. To the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> current <b>knowledge,</b> however, the first references to which this regular-ization can be related is indeed the 1988 textbook by Hofbauer and Sigmund itself [5] and (independently as it seems) the article by Cannings and Vickers [3] (note that [3] is cited in the follow-up 1998 book by Hofbauer and Sigmund [6]). While Hofbauer and Sigmund explicitly introduce in [5, 6] what I termed Comtet-regularized adjacency matrix ÂG in [1, 2], Cannings and Vickers use in [3] the matrix A = 2 ÂG −E instead, and in a slightly different context (E denotes the suitable all-ones matrix). Obviously the standard QPs based on both 1 matrices, ÂG and 2 ÂG −E, are equivalent (see, e. g. [2]). Also the terminology Comtet class I used in [2] for C(w,G), a class of certain symmetric matrices, can be misleading for the same reason. I apologize for any irritations these mishaps may have caused. Nevertheless, all the results on ÂG and C(w,G) which were claimed to be new in [1, 2], appear to be formulated and proved for the first time there...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} patterns of computer interaction by gifted children who use computers extensively. There were two objectives: (a) To examine how these particular children came to learn various computer applications and programming, where they began, and how; and (b) To explore {{the number and}} variety of uses these gifted children have for their various computer interactions. The study led to several conjectures about the interactions of gifted children and computers. There is evidence that schools do not well serve gifted children regarding computer use. As a result, many gifted children learn {{what they know about}} computers and computer applications at home or elsewhere. Further evidence indicates that, without formal instruction in school, these children have constructed their own ideas of what computers are for and what they are able to do with them. Though many of these uses are no different from the ones that other children and adults have discovered, the study found some idiosyncratic uses and meanings. Along with the `what` of research, {{there is the question of}} `why` it is important and worth pursuing. This research has the promise of contributing to knowledge in the area of gifted and talented education, in that by understanding better how gifted children come to learn various computer applications and computer programming, and by understanding better the uses they have for these interactions, educators may be able to develop curricula, environments, and instruction to enhance these learning experiences in technology. This study establishes, to the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> the <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> a precedent in the field of research into gifted and talented children and their use of computers...|$|R
40|$|In my honors thesis project, Lovers, Liars, and Clowns, I set out {{to create}} an {{original}} piece of art that would feature some of Sondheim's finest songs, while simultaneously telling a brand new story using new dialogue and new characters. Theatre is an art form based on creation and collaboration. This was at {{the very core of}} the process <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cast and crew. We selected the musical pieces, created the story, wrote the text, blocked the scenes, choreographed the dances, designed the sets, and much more! It truly was a labor of love. This experience is the capstone <b>of</b> <b>my</b> undergraduate career because it incorporated all of the facets of theatre that I have studied while in school. As the director, I was able to utilize <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> as a musical theatre artisan as well as infusing the rehearsal process with my experience in stagecraft, costuming, and make-up. Lovers, Liars, and Clowns is the <b>best</b> demonstration <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the theatre thus far in my career and I am proud to present it as my Honors Thesis Project. In my binder, I have included a CD of music from which we drew our inspiration, our original script, a poster, an explanation of the process, a program, an archive photo CD, and a DVD of our final dress rehearsal. Lovers, Liars, and Clowns is a simple story. It is the story of one man and his relationships with three women: his fiancé, his best friend, and a one-night-stand. Though these seem like archetypal stock character labels, these characters were fully developed and infused with the personalities of the women playing the roles. This is a story of self-exploration, self-acceptance, and self-realization. It is a coming of age story that juxtaposes the simplicity of the human desire to find love with the complexity of relationships and romantic situations as a young adult. Honors CollegeThesis (B.
