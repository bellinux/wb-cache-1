5|$|Most 50-point triple-doubles in {{a single}} season: Russell Westbrook (Oklahoma City Thunder) {{recorded}} three 50-point triple-doubles in the 2016–17 season. James Harden is the other player to record more than one 50-point triple double with two in the same season. It is more than likely that Wilt Chamberlain recorded many 50-point triple-doubles during his historic 1961-62 NBA season, but they remain unofficial, as steals and <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> were not yet recorded as official statistics.|$|E

5|$|On November 26, he {{recorded}} 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and a career-high six <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> in a 115–102 {{win over the}} Minnesota Timberwolves. It was the Warriors' first time ever having someone finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and five blocks. Two days later, he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, November 21 through Sunday, November 27. Durant helped Golden State to a 4–0 week behind averages of 24.8 points, 8.3 rebounds, 6.3 assists, and 2.75 <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> per game. On December 1, he matched his season high with 39 points to go with 13 rebounds, three steals, and three blocks in a 132–127 double overtime loss to the Houston Rockets.

5|$|When the Anteaters {{defeated}} the Washington Huskies men's basketball team on November 14, 2013, N'Diaye recorded a season-high 18 points. He also added 8 rebounds and 9 blocks. The game was also his first {{experience in the}} 2K Sports Classic. His <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> total broke the school's single-game record under the category. He recorded his first career double-double with Irvine on December 28, 2013 against Arizona State, with 12 points, 4 blocks, and a career-high 12 rebounds. In January, in a game at rival Long Beach State, coach Dan Monson told reporters that he believed his team was still afraid to attack the paint even when N'Diaye {{was sitting on the}} bench. In early February, N'Diaye broke the school's single-game block record {{for the second time in}} the season, totaling with 11 <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> and 10 rebounds against Long Beach State. N'Diaye also broke the conference's all-time record. It was his first career game in which he recorded a double-double without scoring over ten points.|$|E

The emergence of younger defenseman Matt Hunwick was partly responsible for his expandability. Alberts became {{an integral part of}} the Flyers' defensive corps, leading the team in hits (157) and ranking third in <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> (133). His 12 assists and 13 points were career-highs.|$|E

5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVP's by that time. Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles. He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, <b>blocked</b> <b>shots,</b> and minutes played. The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.|$|E
5|$|During the offseason, the Rockets {{went for}} a change of visual identity, making navy blue and silver the new primary colors while {{adopting}} a new cartoon-inspired logo and pinstriped jerseys.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Tracy McGrady or Kobe Bryant, Duncan stayed at college {{for a full}} four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and a three-time NABC Defensive Player of the Year. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997, and was named Most Valuable Player of the 1996 ACC Tournament. Further, 1996 was the year where he led the conference in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and <b>blocked</b> <b>shots,</b> becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the all-time leading rebounder in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (later surpassed by Kenneth Faried). He remains one of only ten players with more than 2,000 career points and 1,500 career rebounds. He {{was also the first}} player in NCAA history to reach 1,500 points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> and 200 assists. He left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—at the time second in NCAA annals behind Colgate's Adonal Foyle and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds. After earning his college degree, Duncan became automatically eligible for the 1997 NBA draft.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{joining the}} NBA, Abdur-Rahim was the USA's leading scorer and rebounder at the 1994 COPABA Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament held in Argentina. He {{averaged}} a double-double of 16.8 points and 10.1 rebounds. While trying {{for a team}} high in <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> averaging 1.6 blocks per game, he helped push the American squad to an 8–0 record, the gold medal, and a qualifying berth in the 1995 FIBA Junior World Championship. The following May he was named to USA Basketball's 1995 Junior Select Team that captured an 86–77 victory over an International Select Team in the inaugural Hoop Summit Game.|$|E
5|$|Quadruple-doubles {{have only}} been {{possible}} since the 1973–74 season, when the NBA started recording both <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> and steals. It is often speculated by observers that other all-time greats, namely Oscar Robertson (all time triple-doubles leader with 181), Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell and Jerry West could conceivably have had quadruple-doubles. West's biography at NBA.com claims that he once recorded an unofficial quadruple-double with 44points, 12rebounds, 10assists and 10blocks. A biography of Wilt Chamberlain claims that he also recorded an unofficial quadruple-double in Game1 of the 1967 Eastern Division Finals against the Boston Celtics, when he had 24points, 32rebounds, 13assists and 12blocks.|$|E
50|$|In basketball, a <b>block</b> or <b>blocked</b> <b>shot</b> {{occurs when}} a {{defensive}} player legally deflects a field goal attempt from an offensive player. The defender {{is not allowed to}} make contact with the offensive player's hand (unless the defender is also in contact with the ball) or a foul is called. In order to be legal, the block must occur while the shot is traveling upward or at its apex. A deflected field goal that is made does not count as a <b>blocked</b> <b>shot</b> and simply counts as a successful field goal attempt for shooter plus the points awarded to the shooting team. Every successful <b>blocked</b> <b>shot</b> is counted as a missed field goal attempt for the shooter. Also, on a shooting foul, a <b>blocked</b> <b>shot</b> cannot be awarded or counted, even if the player who deflected the field goal attempt is different from the player who committed the foul. If the ball is heading downward when the defender hits it, it is ruled as goaltending and counts as a made basket. Goaltending is also called if the block is made after the ball bounces on the backboard (NFHS excepted; the NCAA also used this rule until the 2009-10 season).|$|R
50|$|A {{shot that}} is {{deflected}} wide or blocked by an opponent does not count as a shot on goal, {{rather it is}} recorded as a <b>blocked</b> <b>shot.</b> The player who <b>blocks</b> the <b>shot</b> is credited with a 'blocked shot', and the player who shoots the puck is credited with an 'attempt blocked'.|$|R

5|$|Young {{attended}} Highland Park High School, {{where he}} played basketball and baseball. He lettered three times in basketball, in a career in which he scored over 1,000 points, and accumulated 500 rebounds and 200 blocks. He was a two-year letterman in baseball, compiling a 14–3 record with 180 strikeouts. In basketball, he averaged 16 points, 12 rebounds, and 3 <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> a game, and in baseball he had an 8–3 record with a 1.70ERA and 95strikeouts in 80innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} {{months of}} rehabilitation {{on his left}} knee and helping the U.S. Olympic team win a {{gold medal at the}} 2008 Olympics, in which he led the team in scoring, Wade returned to the starting lineup {{at the start of the}} 2008–09 season. Early in the season, Wade became the second player in NBA history to tally at least 40 points, 10 assists and five <b>blocked</b> <b>shots</b> in a game since Alvan Adams did so in the 1976–77 season. With a healthy Wade leading the league in scoring and the Heat making a push for a playoff position, Wade was elected to his fifth consecutive All-Star game appearance.|$|E
5|$|Barkley also possessed {{considerable}} defensive talents led by {{an aggressive}} demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position {{and leader of the}} highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in <b>blocked</b> <b>shots.</b> His speed and leaping ability {{made him one of the}} few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block.|$|E
