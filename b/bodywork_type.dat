50|$|In Great Britain, the RE {{was most}} {{commonly}} fitted with bodywork by ECW, but several other manufacturers also built bodywork on the chassis. Some coaches were fitted with Duple Commander, Plaxton Panorama Elite or Alexander M <b>Type</b> <b>bodywork.</b> In Northern Ireland, the RE was bodied by Alexander (Belfast), with the X <b>Type</b> <b>bodywork.</b>|$|R

50|$|Drivers {{also tend}} to be French with Bruno Boccard and David Dusseau being two of the more famous. Debora use an LMP Le Mans Prototype type 1 body shell over a {{mid-engined}} chassis with open driving seat in the <b>bodywork.</b> Their <b>Type</b> 2 LMP with closed bodywork owes much to the Courage and is a truly beautiful piece of engineering.|$|R
5000|$|Production of the 356 {{ended in}} 1965, {{but there was}} still a market for a 4-cylinder car, {{particularly}} in the US. The Porsche 912, introduced the same year, served as a direct replacement, offering the de-tuned version of 356 SC's 4-cylinder, 1582 cc, [...] boxer four Type 616/36 engine inside the 911 <b>bodywork</b> with <b>Type</b> 901 four speed transmission (5-speed was optional).|$|R
50|$|This term {{refers to}} an Aquabike {{designed}} to be stood upon and is powered by rear jet propulsion with a completely closed system. Skis, by definition, are the most demanding to ride as they require high fitness levels and great physical strength as well as agility in the legs and arms. According to the different degrees of modifications to the engine and <b>bodywork,</b> this <b>type</b> of Aquabike is used for 3 different categories: GP1, GP2 and Stock. Another category (GP3) also exists in which younger drivers, {{between the ages of}} 11-14, compete.|$|R
50|$|Several {{operators}} purchased single-deck Fleetlines (Birmingham was the first, in 1965). Rotherham Corporation purchased two 33' {{single deck}} fleetlines with 45 seat Willowbrook dual purpose bodies. Mexborough and Swinton Traction Company ordered three similar vehicles with Marshall bodywork for White Rose Express services. However they were delivered to Yorkshire Traction following the takeover in October 1969. In late 1970, Yorkshire Traction purchased nine 36' Fleetlines with dual door Walter Alexander W <b>type</b> <b>bodywork.</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the problematics of varnish {{degradation}} due to maintanance of a car or more precisely due to washing of a car bodywork and searching for a gentle washing of a car. The first section of this thesis discusses {{the creation of a}} protection layer of the car <b>bodywork</b> or <b>types</b> of varnishing, particular layers of varnish and additional products enhancing the qualities of car varnish. Second part of thesis analyses the measuring and evaluation of the state of varnish layers and uses the results for valuation of estetical and functional advantages and disadvantages. In third part we deal with description and categorisation of types and technologies of car washing. Fourth part focuses on experimentation and comparison of varnish degradation due to selected types of car washing using tests simulating real conditions of regular service. Particularly we evaluate portal washing units and hand washing. Consequently we subjectively and objectively analyse all the information and finaly we project this information to time and economical perspective...|$|R
50|$|The 9000 was {{launched}} to the motoring press {{at a conference}} at Kolmården Game Park on 24 May 1984. This original model was a five-door liftback, sharing much of its appearance and <b>bodywork</b> with the <b>Type</b> Four platform relatives—the Fiat Croma and Lancia Thema. Drag resistance for the original model is Cd 0.34, very competitive for the time. Later in 1987 for model year 1988, Saab released a sedan variant of the 9000 known as the CD. This {{was followed by the}} 1991 release of a partially redesigned five-door liftback for the 1992 model year, known as the CS. At the release of the CS, the original liftback variant was retrospectively designated CC to differentiate it from the newer version, which it continued to sell alongside in some markets as an entry-level model.|$|R
50|$|A {{double-decker}} {{version of}} the B10M was developed for Strathclyde PTE in 1981. It was launched in early 1982, with a downrated engine from the coach, and was named Citybus (also known unofficially as B10MD or D10M). Most early examples were bodied by Alexander Coachbuilders, who provided a modified version - common to all Volvo double-deck chassis bodied by the company after 1980 - of their popular and attractive R <b>type</b> <b>bodywork.</b> Eastern Scottish and Fife Scottish bought many of these early versions in 1985-1987. Two were exported in 1984, {{one of them to}} Singapore Bus Service and the other to Kowloon Motor Bus, but was destroyed by fire in 1988. The Citybus lasted until the end of B10M production but fell out of favour after Volvo re-engineered the Leyland Olympian as the Volvo Olympian in 1993.|$|R
50|$|The name Duple is {{intended}} to convey the principle of a single vehicle being suitable for a dual role, an idea Herbert White developed. The first vehicle of this type was called the Bifort. Subsequently, former military Ford Model Ts were fitted with the newly designed dual-purpose bodywork. The bodies looked like a small touring car, but could {{be transformed into a}} van by removing the decking {{at the rear of the}} car and fitting a van top. This type of vehicle had enormous appeal to the owners of small businesses, who were able to obtain a working vehicle and private car for little extra, and soon <b>bodywork</b> of this <b>type</b> was being produced in substantial numbers. The 'convertible' body as it was known internally was built on Morris Cowley and Oxford chassis as well as the Ford T; as well as the standard van top there was a pick-up and even a version with raising sides and slide-out display shelves for use in markets, production ceasing around the end of the 1920s although Duple continued to repair and service examples for many years afterward.|$|R
