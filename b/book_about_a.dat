5|$|Soeman {{began writing}} in 1923, shortly after {{finishing}} his studies. Inspired by his father, who stopped using the clan name Hasibuan in Malay-dominated Bengkalis, {{he took the}} pen name Soeman Hs. He submitted his first novel, Kasih Tak Terlarai (Undivided Love), to the state publisher Balai Pustaka. The <b>book,</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> young orphan who elopes with his beloved but must remarry her in disguise after she returns home, was published in 1929. Soeman received a total of 37gulden for the publication.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, the Soviet studio Mosfilm {{approached}} the filmmaker {{to ask if}} he would be interested in working with them. Kurosawa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev's autobiographical work Dersu Uzala. The <b>book,</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Goldi hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization, was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s. In December 1973, the 63-year-old Kurosawa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides, beginning a year-and-a-half stay in the country. Shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia, with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding. The picture wrapped in April 1975, with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kurosawa returning to Japan and his family in June. Dersu Uzala had its world premiere in Japan on August 2, 1975, and did well at the box office. While critical reception in Japan was muted, the film was better reviewed abroad, winning the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival, as well as an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Today, critics remain divided over the film: some see it as an example of Kurosawa's alleged artistic decline, while others count it among his finest works.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, American anglers, such as Theodore Gordon in the Catskill Mountains of New York, began using fly tackle to fish the region’s brook trout-rich streams {{such as the}} Beaverkill and Willowemoc Creek. Many of these early American fly anglers also {{developed}} new fly patterns and wrote extensively about their sport, increasing the popularity of fly fishing {{in the region and}} in the United States as a whole. Albert Bigelow Paine, a New England author, wrote about fly fishing in The Tent Dwellers, a <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> three-week trip he and a friend took to central Nova Scotia in 1908.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, Ed Ricketts {{strongly}} influenced Steinbeck's writing. Steinbeck frequently took small trips with Ricketts along the California coast {{to give himself}} time off from his writing and to collect biological specimens, which Ricketts sold for a living. Their joint <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> collecting expedition to the Gulf of California in 1940, which was part travelogue and part natural history, published just as the U.S. entered World War II, never found an audience and did not sell well. However, in 1951, Steinbeck republished the narrative portion of the book as The Log from the Sea of Cortez, under his name only (though Ricketts had written some of it). This work remains in print today.|$|E

25|$|Neville {{returned}} to Australia {{where he met}} his future partner, the journalist Julie Clarke. He began work on a new magazine, The Living Daylights, reporting on youth cultures, social inventions, and {{the shape of the}} future. He was a regular broadcaster on ABC Radio and wrote for an array of newspapers and magazines. He moved to New York City in 1977 to join Clarke, and wrote for The New York Times, New York magazine, and The Village Voice. Due to his experience on the hippie trail, publishers Random House commissioned Neville to write a <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> serial killer who preyed upon Western backpackers, incarcerated in New Delhi, India. The resulting biography of Charles Sobhraj, co-authored by Clarke, was a global best-seller. It inspired several TV drama documentaries, including Shadow of the Cobra.|$|E
500|$|Gossip {{made his}} living {{primarily}} as a journalist, author, and translator. He wrote for publications in England, France, Australia, and the United States.

In 1898 and 1899, two publishers issued Gossip's sole <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> subject other than chess, The Jew of Chamant.

500|$|The episode {{continues}} the story {{arc of the}} Adena Watson murder case, which {{was introduced in the}} final scene of series premiere [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] and dominates much of the Homicide: Life on the Street first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. The investigation into Calpurnia Church was inspired by the real-life case of Geraldine Parrish, which was featured in Simon's book. Parrish was accused of killing five husbands for insurance money and was eventually convicted for three of their deaths. The shooting of Officer Thormann was also adapted from true-life events in Simon's book, although Homicide writers added the twist of Crosetti taking the case personally based on his close friendship with the victim.|$|E

500|$|During {{one scene}} in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", Munch and Bolander force a suspect {{to take a}} [...] "electrolyte neutron {{magnetic}} scan test", which involved placing his hand on a copy machine and photocopying his hand as they asked him questions. Prior to giving the exam, the detectives loaded papers with the words [...] "True" [...] and [...] "False" [...] into the machine, so when the final copies came out it appeared the machine was giving answers to the questions. The detectives pretended the test was radioactive and dangerous to further make the suspect nervous. This scene {{was based on a}} real-life trick used by Baltimore Police Department detectives in 1988. The real-life instance was featured in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. This hoax was also used in [...] "More with Less", the fifth season premiere episode of David Simon's later police drama series, The Wire.|$|E
500|$|Running {{the episode}} out of {{sequence}} produced several notable continuity errors. For example, Bayliss and Pembleton are still working on the Adena Watson murder, which they had stopped investigating in the earlier episode [...] "Three Men and Adena". Additionally, Officer Thormann is seen onscreen working and healthy, although he was blinded in the earlier episode [...] "" [...] {{as a result of}} a gunshot wound to the head that forced him to leave the police department. These consistency errors were addressed by Homicide producers by adding the words [...] "One hot night, last September..." [...] to the beginning of the episode, thus establishing the events of the episode took place within the correct timeline of the series, even though the episodes are shown out of order. The Watson case depicted in the episode was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series.|$|E
500|$|... "Ghost of a Chance" [...] {{was written}} by Noel Behn based on a story by {{executive}} producer Tom Fontana, and was directed by Martin Campbell. It marked the first major developments the story arc of the Adena Watson murder case, which {{was introduced in the}} final scene of series premiere [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] and dominates much of the Homicide: Life on the Street first season. The Watson case was based on the real-life 1988 Baltimore slaying of Latonya Kim Wallace, which is chronicled in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. [...] "Ghost of a Chance" [...] introduced the concept of a [...] "red ball", which is a police jargon phrase used in the episode to describe the Adena Watson murder. A red ball is a high-profile case that draws such close media and political attention, that it diverts time and attention away from other cases in the homicide department. The phrase, which came directly from Simon's book, would be used frequently in future Homicide: Life on the Street episodes.|$|E

[...] "A Dog and Pony Show" [...] in particular refers to the Adena Watson murder, which was featured in five previous episodes and resolved in [...] "Three Men and Adena", as well as the romance between Bolander and Blythe, which had been progressing throughout the first season.

500|$|Series creator Rob Thomas was {{initially}} worried about including the reunion between Apollo and Kizza {{because he thought}} that such scenes did not play to his strengths as a storyteller. However, he {{was pleased with the}} result because of the two actors' performances. The two performers had never met each other prior to this scene, and they were filming within four minutes of setup time. One quip by Vinnie (Ken Marino) about the office's secretaries was a callback to a similar joke in [...] "Of Vice and Men". Thomas was inspired to focus an episode on a former Ugandan child soldier by two incidents. The first was when he {{was initially}} informed about the situation by a former student of his mother's, while at Christmas the previous year, Hansen had given books about Ugandan child soldiers to all the writers. In the episode, Apollo is scheduled to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show; Oprah's Book Club was discussing a <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> child soldier at the time, but this was a coincidence. In the episode, Piz states that he has been given an internship with Pitchfork Media at their headquarters in New York City; however, the location is incorrect.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E

500|$|Juster {{quit his}} job {{so that he could}} work on the book. His {{imagination}} fired by a boy who approached him on the street and with whom he discussed the nature of infinity, Juster wanted to finish the story about [...] "a boy who asked too many questions" [...] before returning to the book on cities. Juster shared his house in Brooklyn Heights with cartoonist Jules Feiffer whose bedroom was immediately below, and who could hear him pacing in the night. Feiffer was surprised to learn that his friend's insomnia was not caused by the cities book, but by a <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> boy. Juster showed Feiffer the draft to date and, unbidden, the artist began sketching illustrations. Feiffer knew Judy Sheftel, who put deals together in the publishing trade and was his future bride. Sheftel got Jason Epstein, an innovative editor at Random House with a deep appreciation for children's literature, to agree to review the manuscript. Some at Random House considered the book's vocabulary too difficult: at the time, educators advised against children's literature containing words the target audience did not already know, fearing the unfamiliar would discourage young learners. Based on seven chapters of manuscript, plus a three-page outline {{of the rest of the}} story, Epstein bought the book.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson {{murder trial}} {{is based on}} a real-life trial {{featured}} in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction <b>book</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. In that real-life trial, a Baltimore detective misspeaks during his testimony and nearly jeopardizes the outcome of the case. This is mirrored by the actions of Kay Howard, who accidentally says the victim was dead at least 24 hours when she meant to say 12 hours, leaving an opening for defense attorney Darin Russom to question her recollection and expertise. The defense attorney in the real-life trial lost the case for himself with a procedural misstep similar to the one portrayed in [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare". In the episode, Russom asks Howard whether she had ever seen a murder victim killed by both a knife and a gun. This allows Howard to mention a second victim police suspect [...] "Pony" [...] Johnson murdered, which she would not have been allowed to mention had Russom not asked her. Homicide filmmakers sought to portray the trial scenes in a far more realistic light than most police drama shows, particularly with the inclusion of less dramatic courtroom elements such as Howard's waiting anxiously to testify and the awkward pauses during her testimony.|$|E
