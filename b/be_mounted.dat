5|$|A 1905 {{review of}} the Falmouth defences {{concluded}} that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> at combination of Pendennis and the recently re-established battery at St Anthony's instead. Disarmed, St Mawes was then used as a barracks in the First World War. In 1920 the castle {{was transferred to the}} control of the government's Office of Works, and was opened to visitors, being promoted as a tourist destination by the Great Western Railway company who hoped to profit by increased numbers of visitors to Falmouth.|$|E
5|$|Iron Duke was {{the first}} British {{battleship}} to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> with anti-aircraft weaponry. In 1914, two 3in (7.62cm) QF guns were fitted to the aft superstructure, primarily to defend against German airships. The guns fired between 1214 rounds per minute, and were expected to fire approximately 1,250 shells before replacement or repair was necessary. The shells fired were 12.5lb (5.67kg) with a high-explosive warhead. They were manually operated, and had a maximum effective ceiling of 23,500ft (7,160m).|$|E
5|$|The Tornado is {{cleared to}} carry the {{majority}} of air-launched weapons in the NATO inventory, including various unguided and laser-guided bombs, anti-ship and anti-radiation missiles, as well as specialised weapons such as anti-personnel mines and anti-runway munitions. To improve survivability in combat, the Tornado is equipped with onboard countermeasures, ranging from flare and chaff dispensers to electronic countermeasure pods that can <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> under the wings. Underwing fuel tanks and a buddy store aerial refuelling system that allows one Tornado to refuel another are available to extend the aircraft's range.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} invasion threat passed, but {{the castle}} was reinforced in 1558, due to fresh concerns of a French attack. Around 1570, the main bastions {{were filled with}} earth, probably to allow heavier guns to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on them, and Queen Elizabeth I inspected the castle in 1573. The defences along the coast were mobilised in 1588 {{in response to the}} threat posed by the Spanish armada, and were probably kept ready for action throughout the rest of Elizabeth's reign.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|When Phillpotts's next comedy, Yellow Sands, was to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> at the Haymarket Theatre in the West End, Richardson and {{his wife}} were both cast in good roles. The play opened in November 1926 and ran until September 1928; with 610 {{performances}} it was the longest London run of Richardson's entire career. During the run Muriel Hewitt began to show early symptoms of encephalitis lethargica, a progressive and ultimately fatal illness.|$|E

50|$|Bellerophon was {{the first}} British ironclad to carry the 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading gun. All ten of the 9 in guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on the main deck, five on each side. Five 7-inch rifled muzzle-loaders <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> outside the battery as chase guns. Four of these <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in pairs fore and aft on the main deck; the last gun <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on the upper deck at the stern. The ship also had four breech-loading 12-pounder Armstrong guns for use as saluting guns.|$|R
5000|$|Also in 1853, the American Ebenezer Talbot also {{patented}} a TBM {{that employed}} Wilson's cutting discs, although they <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on rotating arms, {{which in turn}} <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on a rotating plate. [...] In the 1870s, John D. Brunton of England built a machine employing cutting discs that <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on rotating plates, which in turn <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> eccentrically on a rotating plate, so that the cutting discs would travel over {{almost all of the}} rock face that was to be removed.|$|R
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three other pieces of equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{developments}} in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service too small to be useful. Modern weapons systems and their supporting logistics facilities such as munitions stores could not fit within the 16th-century designs. A 1905 review of the Falmouth defences concluded that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> at combination of Pendennis and newer sites along the coast, and the castle was disarmed. A review in 1913 concluded that keeping naval artillery at Calshot was also unnecessary, and the site was turned into an experimental seaplane station instead.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with this}} evidence, the General Board sent a formal request in October 1903 to C, asking it {{to draw up}} plans for a {{battleship}} including these characteristics. No progress {{had been made by}} 26 January 1904, when the General Board asked C for a design including four 12-inch guns, eight 10-inch or larger guns, and no intermediate armament beyond 3-inch anti-destroyer guns. The move to only 10-inch weaponry was the result of doubt among naval authorities that heavier guns could physically <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on a ship's broadside. No action was taken on this request until September, when C began planning a ship with four 12-inch guns in dual turrets along with eight dual 10-inch or four single 12-inch guns.|$|E
5|$|For five months, Henry took {{no action}} on the accusations against his archbishop. The {{conspiracy}} was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself. According to Cranmer's secretary, Ralph Morice, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him. An investigation was to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer {{at the end of}} November, the nobles were stymied by the symbol of the king's trust in him. Cranmer's victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.|$|E
5|$|In September 2006, Dugan {{produced}} the Model E, the E standing for economy. This half-rack-sized automixer was much smaller {{and less expensive}} than previous ones. It could be linked with another Model E to control up to 16 channels; two units could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> side-by-side in only 1U of rack space. The Model E's popularity came with many critical requests for features, and in May 2008 the Model E-1 was introduced; an incremental improvement to replace the Model E. It allowed ADAT Lightpipe interconnections between linked units and a digital mixing console, helpful with Yamaha, Mackie and other digital audio gear containing ADAT inputs and outputs. Its user interface was a simple web browser page, accessible by computer connected with Category 5 cable.|$|E
2500|$|A small {{platform}} that carried a [...] rangefinder <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> above the rear torpedo locker and a [...] searchlight <b>was</b> <b>mounted</b> on a tower behind the rear funnel. The two license-built Vickers [...] (pom pom) anti-aircraft guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on an elevated platform {{at the front}} of the rear funnel. Curiously they were another case where the designer exceeded the requirements laid down by the Navy.|$|R
50|$|Final drives <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> in {{the front}} and the idler {{sprockets}} with track tensioners <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> at the rear. The running gear has six road wheel stations per side, which guide a lightweight steel or segmented rubber band-type track. The road wheels <b>are</b> <b>mounted</b> on a suspension system comprising swing arms with conventional torsion bars and damper systems, this set-up is proven to be reliable and cost-efficient.|$|R
500|$|The seven [...] 35-caliber guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{broadside}} pivot mounts in hull embrasures, {{except for}} one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. The eight [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in small embrasures in the hull to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Four [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water [...] torpedo tubes, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes <b>were</b> <b>mounted</b> on each broadside forward and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{ordered the}} attack to <b>be</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the night}} of 6/7 August. To avoid {{alerting}} American forces to the attack, there would be no preparatory artillery bombardments. The intention was to hit the U.S. 30th Infantry Division, commanded by Major-General Leland Hobbs, east of Mortain, then cut through American defenses to reach the coast. Had surprise been achieved, the attack might well have succeeded, but Allied decoders at Ultra had intercepted and decrypted the orders for Operation Lüttich by August 4. As a result, Bradley was able to obtain air support from both the US 9th Air Force and the RAF.|$|E
