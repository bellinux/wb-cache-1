5|$|The {{smell of}} fire brings back <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> for Ben, who confesses to Clara {{that his father}} was a real barn-burner. He tells her how, at age ten, he warned a farmer {{that his father was}} about to set another fire. Ben's father got away, never seen again. Ben tells her he is leaving town, but Clara makes it clear she has fallen in love with him. An elated Will confides to Minnie that life is so good, he may have to live forever.|$|E
5|$|Kotarou becomes {{disillusioned with}} Guardian's tactics {{and returns to}} Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must {{initiate}} re-evolution, but since this {{would lead to a}} dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> caused by war and conflict. Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop this from occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.|$|E
25|$|It was {{important}} to erase the <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> of the former league. Its financial system was not adopted, with no tribute being paid. Instead, syntaxeis were used, irregular contributions as and when Athens and its allies needed troops, collected for a precise reason and spent as quickly as possible. These contributions were not taken to Athens— unlike the 5th century BC system, there was no central exchequer for the league— but to the Athenian generals themselves.|$|E

The second place was enough for the Oreca team to be crowned as the 2010 champions, who were using a Peugeot instead their own race winning chassis from the 2009 event. This time Lapierre was co-driven by Stéphane Sarrazin. Audi were third with the R15 TDI of Capello and Timo Bernhard.|$|E
500|$|As Rollins rose to {{prominence}} with the Rollins Band, {{he began to}} present and appear on television. These included Alternative Nation and MTV Sports in 1993 and 1994 respectively. Rollins also co starred in The Chase with Charlie Sheen. In 1995 Rollins appeared on an episode of Unsolved Mysteries that explored {{the murder of his}} best friend Joe Cole and present State of the Union Undressed on Comedy Central. Rollins began to present and narrate VH1 Legends in 1996. Rollins, busy with the Rollins Band, did not present more programs until 2001, but made appearances on a number of other television shows, including Welcome to Paradox in 1998 in the episode [...] "All Our Sins Forgotten", as a therapist who develops a device that can erase the <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> of his patients.

500|$|While inside KOS-MOS's memory, {{the group}} are guided through a dream-like realm {{constructed}} from their repressed <b>bad</b> <b>memories,</b> {{all the way}} observed by Nephilim, with whom chaos is acquainted. Shion also meets a vision of Febronia, a Realian woman killed in the Miltian Conflict, who asks Shion to [...] "free" [...] her sisters Cecily and Cathe {{for the sake of}} both humans and Realians. Before fulfilling their mission, Nephilim tells them that KOS-MOS was designed to stop the energies of U-DO from entering their reality, an event which caused the original planet Miltia to vanish into a space-time void and could potentially destroy the universe. Due to surviving a Gnosis encounter and remaining human, Shion has the capacity to change the future for the better. During these events, Albedo captures and psychologically tortures MOMO before triggering the [...] "Song of Nephilim", a song which attracts swarms of Gnosis.|$|E

500|$|She {{was active}} and visible in her husband's second presidential {{campaign}} during 2007 and 2008, despite not wanting {{her husband to}} run initially due to <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> of their 2000 experience and worries the effect on her children, especially son Jimmy who was headed {{to serve in the}} Iraq War. [...] She eventually supported her husband in his goals, but defined her own campaign roles; she frequently returned to Arizona to attend to domestic duties or interrupted campaigning for her overseas charitable work. She preferred to travel with her husband and introduce him rather than act as a campaign surrogate with a separate schedule. She wore her hair in a fashionable but severe style and was sometimes seen with an unsmiling countenance in her appearances. In August 2008, a member of the public shook her hand very vigorously, aggravating her existing carpal tunnel syndrome condition and causing her to slightly sprain her wrist. [...] The campaign exacerbated her migraine headaches and she sometimes had to wear dark glasses to shield herself from bright lights. [...] The pressures of the campaign also brought out a range of behaviors between her and her husband, varying from moments of great tenderness and concern to raging arguments that dismayed their staffs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{score to}} The Punisher was {{composed}} and conducted by Italian composer Carlo Siliotto. Director Jonathan Hensleigh wanted {{the music to}} be very emotional, and was aware of Siliotto's previous work which led to him being chosen. When scoring the film Siliotto saw Frank Castle as a tragic figure stating, [...] "This man, Frank Castle, is somebody who has a slaughtered family. He comes through that slaughter, and becomes a punisher. But he's a sad man - he drinks, and has <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> always coming to him. There's {{a lot in the}} film, and at times it is like a modern version of a classic tragedy - like Othello." ...|$|E

[...] On 26 April 2007, an Indian court in Rajasthan issued a warrant for Shetty and Gere's arrest. A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice of India subsequently dismissed the suit and suspended the arrest warrants. Gere has since expressed regret for causing any offence and Shetty has said: [...] "so much has been blown out of proportion".|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fall}} of Fascism and {{following}} {{the birth of the}} Republic, the interest of scholars and politicians, and in general of the masses in Italian nationalism was relatively low, mainly because of the connections that it had with Fascism and consequently with the <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> of World War II. The only notable and active political party who clearly declared Italian nationalism as its main ideology was the Italian Social Movement which became the fourth largest party in Italy by the early 1960s. In these years, Italian nationalism was considered an ideology totally linked to the right-wing political parties and organisations. Nevertheless, two significant events seemed to revitalise Italian nationalism among Italians, the first one in 1953 during the Question of Trieste when the claim of Italy on the full control of the city of Trieste was largely endorsed by most of the Italian society with patriotic demonstrations, the second one in 1985 during the Sigonella crisis between Italy and United States.|$|E

Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back <b>bad</b> <b>memories,</b> but you cop it sweet and anyone decent you respond by telling them what you think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'.

2500|$|Survivors found {{themselves}} stigmatized, often denied {{their rights to}} property and inheritance as well as opportunities for employment. It is estimated by the National Population Office of Rwanda that between 2,000 and 5,000 children were born {{as a result of}} forced impregnation. However, victims groups believe this is underestimated and the number exceeds 10,000. These children are themselves stigmatized and referred to as les enfants mauvais souvenir (children of <b>bad</b> <b>memories)</b> or enfants indésirés (lit. [...] "unwanted children", glossed as [...] "children of hate" [...] by M. Mukangendo). Victims also suffered from survivor's guilt, and anxiety due to their assailants not being held accountable. In 1995, widows of the genocide founded Association des Veuves du Genocide (AVEGA, Widows of the Genocide of April) to see to the needs of female survivors who had been widowed or raped. The extent of the rapes was quickly recognized by human rights groups, with one report, Shattered Lives: Sexual Violence During the Rwandan Genocide and Its Aftermath written by Binaifer Nowrojee, becoming one of the most highly cited human rights reports in up to thirty years.|$|E
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{released}} on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, and Eminem's newly founded label, Shady Records in the United States, and on September 11, 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP {{was released}} with two different album covers. The original features Eminem {{sitting on the porch}} of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, [...] "I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. [...] " [...] The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a [...] "dysfunctional Little Rascal", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: [...] "Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked." ...|$|E

2500|$|When she {{was asked}} how Callum does not {{remember}} Sonya, Morey explained that Sonya had fallen in with a bad crowd, was an alcohol and drugs addict and was suffering from post-natal depression. She chose to leave Callum with her grandmother, Hilda, {{so she could get}} herself cleaned up. Hilda then had everything related to Sonya removed from the family. Callum was around four or five when Sonya left and Morey believed that he had blocked out the <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> of her. Morey commented that Sonya's relationship with Callum would have been [...] "a love-hate one" [...] because she was only 16 when she had him. He would have become like a younger brother to her rather than a son. Executive producer Susan Bower defended the storyline when asked why Sonya and Callum's history had been rewritten. She told an Inside Soap columnist that they worked with the character's established backgrounds and found reasons and motivations for Sonya to act the way she did. Bower admitted that the only discrepancy that could be pointed out was Callum's age. When Hilda dies, Sonya becomes concerned that her secret will be revealed when Callum attends the funeral. However, Callum chooses to say goodbye to his great-grandmother privately, much to Sonya's relief.|$|E
2500|$|The character’s second exit was {{the climax}} to a storyline {{that has been}} {{described}} as one of the show's “most dramatic”. Natalie’s ex-husband Barry remarried and was killed off by his evil new bride Janine Evans (Charlie Brooks) on their honeymoon. The character was embroiled in a bid to uncover Janine as Barry’s killer, and became romantically involved with the character Paul Trueman (Gary Beadle) – Janine’s repentant accomplice in Barry’s downfall, who was also her former lover. A BBC insider said: “Natalie is Janine’s arch rival. She smelt a rat as soon as Janine returned to Walford playing the grieving widow. And she is determined {{to find out what happened}} to Barry and get justice for him.” [...] After discovering the truth from Paul, Natalie realised she was powerless to bring Janine to justice and decided to leave the Square in March 2004. Speed commented “Natalie just wants herself and Jack out of Walford. It's full of <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> Natalie is devastated by the revelations about Barry's death. She can’t believe Paul still thinks they could be together. She did care for him, but now she knows about his scheming with Janine, he's history. She leaves without saying goodbye to him”. [...] The character returned briefly in May to ensure Janine received her comeuppance and made her final screen appearance on 10 May 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Mireille {{performed}} {{poorly in}} elementary school because of dyslexia, requiring an extra year to graduate. She was born left-handed, and her teachers used a ruler to strike her hand each time she was caught writing with it. She became right-handed, although her left hand remains quite animated while singing. She has a fantastic memory, and never uses a prompter on stage. Abandoning higher education, at age 14 (1961), and after moving to Croix des Oiseaux, she began work in a local factory in Montfavet (a suburb southeast of town) where she helped with the family income and paid for her singing lessons. Popular at work, she often sang songs at lunch, or while working. Like her parents, she is a short woman at 1.52 m (5 feet) in height. Her sister Monique (...) , born on 8 July 1947, began work at the same factory a few months later. Both were given bicycles on credit to commute with, making for very long days, and many <b>bad</b> <b>memories</b> of riding against the Mistral winds. The factory went out of business, so Mireille and two sisters (Monique, and Christiane) became youth counselors at a summer camp before her rise to fame, a summer where she had her fortune told by Tarot cards by an old Gypsy woman, saying she would soon mingle with Kings and Queens.|$|E
