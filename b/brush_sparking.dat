Marine alternators {{are designed to be}} explosion proof so that <b>brush</b> <b>sparking</b> will not ignite explosive gas mixtures in an engine room environment. They may be 12 or 24 volt {{depending on the type of}} system installed. Larger marine diesels may have two or more alternators to cope with the heavy electrical demand of a modern yacht. On single alternator circuits, the power may be split between the engine starting battery and the domestic or house battery (or batteries) by use of a split-charge diode (battery isolator) or a voltage-sensitive relay.|$|E
6000|$|... 1591. To {{produce the}} current, the {{electric}} intensity must rise and continue at one spot, namely, at {{the origin of}} the current, higher than elsewhere, and then, air having a uniform and ready access, the current is produced. If no current be allowed (1574.), then discharge may take place by <b>brush</b> or <b>spark.</b> But whether it be by <b>brush</b> or <b>spark,</b> or wind, it seems very probable that the initial intensity or tension at which a particle of a given gaseous dielectric charges, or commences discharge, is, under the conditions before expressed, always the same (1410.).|$|R

6000|$|... 1553. The {{occurrence}} of dark discharge {{in any case}} shows at how low a tension disruptive discharge may occur (1548,), and indicates that {{the light of the}} ultimate <b>brush</b> or <b>spark</b> is in no relation to the intensity required (1368. 1370.). So to speak, the discharge begins in darkness, and the light is a mere consequence of the quantity which, after discharge has commenced, flows to that spot and there finds its most facile passage (1418. 1435.). As an illustration of the growth generally of discharge, I may remark that, in the experiments on the transition in oxygen of the discharge from <b>spark</b> to <b>brush</b> (1518.), every <b>spark</b> was immediately preceded by a short brush.|$|R

6000|$|... 1539. The {{transition}} from glow, {{on the one}} hand, to <b>brush</b> and <b>spark,</b> on the other, and, therefore, their connexion, may be established in various ways. Those circumstances which tend to facilitate the charge of the air by the excited conductor, and also those which tend to keep the tension at the same degree notwithstanding the discharge, assist in producing the glow; whereas those which tend to resist the charge of the air or other dielectric, and those which favour the accumulation of electric force prior to discharge, which, sinking by that act, has to be exalted before the tension can again acquire the requisite degree, favour intermitting discharge, and, therefore, the production of <b>brush</b> or <b>spark.</b> Thus, rarefaction of the air, the removal of large conducting surfaces from the neighbourhood of the glowing termination, the presentation of a sharp point towards it, help to sustain or produce the glow: but the condensation of the air, {{the presentation of the}} hand or other large surface, the gradual approximation of a discharging ball, tend to convert the glow into <b>brush</b> or even <b>spark.</b> All these circumstances may be traced and reduced, in a manner easily comprehensible, to their relative power of assisting to produce, either a continuous discharge to the air, which gives the glow; or an interrupted one, which produces the brush, and, in a more exalted condition, the spark.|$|R

6000|$|... 1216. There {{are many}} forms of old {{experiments}} which might be quoted as favourable to, and consistent with the view I have adopted. Such are most cases of electro-chemical decomposition, electrical <b>brushes,</b> auras, <b>sparks,</b> &c.; but as these might be considered equivocal evidence, inasmuch as they include a current and discharge, (though they have long been to me indications of prior molecular action (1230.)) I endeavoured to devise such experiments for first proofs as should not include transfer, but relate altogether to the pure simple inductive action of statical electricity.|$|R
6000|$|... 1359. The next form of {{discharge}} has been distinguished by the adjective disruptive (1319.), as it {{in every case}} displaces {{more or less the}} particles amongst and across which it suddenly breaks. I include under it, discharge in the form of <b>sparks,</b> <b>brushes,</b> and glow (1405.), but exclude the cases of currents of air, fluids, &c., which, though frequently accompanying the former, are essentially distinct in their nature.|$|R

6000|$|... 1533. It {{is curious}} {{to observe the}} {{relation}} of glow, <b>brush,</b> and <b>spark</b> to each other, as produced by positive or negative surfaces; thus, beginning with spark discharge, it passes into brush much sooner when the surface at which the discharge commences (1484.) is negative, than it does when positive; but proceeding onwards {{in the order of}} change, we find that the positive brush passes into glow long before the negative brush does. So that, though each presents the three conditions in the same general order, the series are not precisely the same. It is probable, that, when these points are minutely examined, as they must be shortly, we shall find that each different gas or dielectric presents its own peculiar results, dependent upon the mode in which its particles assume polar electric condition.|$|R
6000|$|... 1552. Hence I {{conclude}} that dark disruptive discharge may occur (1547. 1550.); and also, that, in the luminous brush, the visible ramifications may not show {{the full extent}} of the disruptive discharge (1444. 1452.), but that each may have a dark outside, enveloping, as it were, every part through which the discharge extends. It is probable, even, that there are such things as dark discharges analogous in form to the <b>brush</b> and the <b>spark,</b> but not luminous in any part (1445.).|$|R
6000|$|... 1448. The <b>brush</b> and <b>spark</b> {{gradually}} {{pass into}} one another, Making a small ball positive {{by a good}} electrical machine with a large prime conductor, and approaching a large uninsulated discharging ball towards it, very beautiful variations from the <b>spark</b> to the <b>brush</b> may be obtained. The drawings of long and powerful sparks, given by Van Marum[A], Harris[B], and others, also indicate the same phenomena. As far as I have observed, whenever the spark has been brushy in air of common pressures, {{the whole of the}} electricity has not been discharged, but only portions of it, more or less according to circumstances; whereas, whenever the effect has been a distinct spark throughout the whole of its course, the discharge has been perfect, provided no interruption had been made to it elsewhere, in the discharging circuit, than where the spark occurred.|$|R
40|$|The work {{concerns}} the constructive characteristics optimization of brushless D. C. (direct current) motors used in electromechanical spacecraft drives. The spacecraft electromechanical drives and units use rather widely the brushless D. C. motors {{in which a}} motor commutator is replaced with more reliable semiconductor commutator controlled by the rotor position sensors. However, these motors are of low power. Electrohydraulic actuators (EHA) use simple permanent-magnet motors (PMM) of rather high power and commutator motors with graphite brush variable contacts. High reliability of brush motors, and, therefore a reliability of EHA in general, substantially depends {{on the quality of}} motor commutator operation. There are different reasons for a possible impact on the normal motor commutator operation. One of them is <b>brush</b> wear. <b>Sparking</b> <b>brushes</b> and burning commutator bars are possible in case brushes are poorly grinded to fit, brushes cannot freely move true in the brush holder box, and in case an incorrect force to clamp brushes to the commutator is chosen. It is established that drive wear resistance and operability depends on the gas environment composition being under sealed motor housing. In dry nitrogen environment brush wear suddenly raises because of the changing tribological performances of the commutator thus leading to essentially falling isolation resistance and no motor start. It is recommended to fill a space under sealed motor housing with air. Positive experience of operating spacecraft device containers with mobile electromechanical couples allowed us to find that in this case a dew point of filled air must be minus 20 ˚C. The paper offers an electromechanical alternative of design to the electrohydraulic actuators, with a ball-screw gear of the actuation mechanism, possessing a number of advantages. </p...|$|R
25|$|An {{induction}} motor is an AC electric motor {{in which the}} electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is induced by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding instead of using mechanical commutation (<b>brushes)</b> that caused <b>sparking</b> in earlier electric motors. They are also self-starting. The Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla explored {{the idea of using}} a rotating magnetic induction field principle, using it in his invention of a poly-phase {{induction motor}} using alternating current which he received a patent for on May 1, 1888. The rights to Tesla's invention were licensed by George Westinghouse for the AC power system his company was developing.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to compare {{properties}} of Sliding Mode Controlled (SMC) versus classical Proportional Integral (PI) controlled brushless DC motor (BLDC) in applications where the speed constancy is demanded. The micromotors mostly used in the past were brush-type DC motors (BDC), induced by their low market price and appropriateness for mass production. However, they exhibit limitations both in the rotating speed and in the torque {{as a consequence of the}} <b>sparking</b> <b>brushes</b> and because the driving windings are located at the rotating part. BLDC micromotors are working at higher speeds, accelerate faster, dissipate lower heat power supporting higher torque and are much lighter, [1]. In dental applications speed constancy and low vibrations are the must, thus BLDC completely suppress BDC, [2], [3]...|$|R
25|$|Many of the {{limitations}} of the classic commutator DC motor are due to the need for brushes to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by the brushes making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as the brushes cross the insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include the brushes shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, the inductance of the rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing the <b>sparking</b> of the <b>brushes.</b> This <b>sparking</b> limits the maximum speed of the machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area of the brushes, in combination with their resistivity, limits the output of the motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; <b>sparking</b> generates RFI. <b>Brushes</b> eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|R
6000|$|... 1405. Having {{considered}} {{these various}} cases of sustained insulation in non-conducting dielectrics {{up to the}} highest point which they can attain, we find that they terminate at last in disruptive discharge; the peculiar condition of the molecules of the dielectric which was necessary to the continuous induction, being equally essential to the occurrence of that effect which closes all the phenomena. This discharge is not only in its appearance and condition different to the former modes by which the lowering of the powers was effected (1320. 1343.), but, whilst really the same in principle, varies much from itself in certain characters, and thus presents us with the forms of <b>spark,</b> <b>brush,</b> and glow (1359.). I will first consider the spark, limiting it for the present {{to the case of}} discharge between two oppositely electrified conducting surfaces.|$|R
6000|$|... 1502. If, now, a small ball {{be made to}} give <b>brushes</b> or brushy <b>sparks</b> by a {{powerful}} machine, we can, in some measure, understand and relate the difference perceived when it is rendered positive or negative. It is known to give when positive a much larger and more powerful spark than when negative, and with greater facility (1482.): in fact, the spark, although it takes away so much more electricity at once, commences at a tension higher only in a small degree, if at all. On the other hand, if rendered negative, though discharge may commence at a lower degree, it continues but for a very short period, very little electricity passing away each time. These circumstances are directly related; for {{the extent to which}} the positive spark can reach, and the size and extent of the positive brush, are consequences of the capability which exists of much electricity passing off at one discharge from the positive surface (1468. 1501.).|$|R

60|$|I {{must say}} that {{for the next three}} months I threw myself into my {{unlawful}} trade with a sort of desperation, dogged and hopeless, like a fairly decent fellow who takes deliberately to drink. The business was getting dangerous. The bands in the South were not very well organized, worked with no very definite plan, and now were beginning to be pretty closely hunted. The arrangements for the transport of supplies were going to pieces; our friends ashore were getting scared; and it was no joke to find after a day of skilful dodging that there was no one at the landing place and have to go out again with our compromising cargo, to slink and lurk about the coast for another week or so, unable to trust anybody and looking at every vessel we met with suspicion. Once we were ambushed by a lot of “rascally Carabineers,” as Dominic called them, who hid themselves among the rocks after disposing a train of mules well in view on the seashore. Luckily, on evidence which I could never understand, Dominic detected something suspicious. Perhaps it was by virtue of some sixth sense that men born for unlawful occupations may be gifted with. “There is a smell of treachery about this,” he remarked suddenly, turning at his oar. (He and I were pulling alone in a little boat to reconnoitre.) I couldn’t detect any smell and I regard to this day our escape on that occasion as, properly speaking, miraculous. Surely some supernatural power must have struck upwards the barrels of the Carabineers’ rifles, for they missed us by yards. And as the Carabineers have the reputation of shooting straight, Dominic, after swearing most horribly, ascribed our escape to the particular guardian angel that looks after crazy young gentlemen. Dominic believed in angels in a conventional way, but laid no claim to having one of his own. Soon afterwards, while sailing quietly at night, we found ourselves suddenly near a small coasting vessel, also without lights, which all at once treated us to a volley of rifle fire. Dominic’s mighty and inspired yell: “A plat ventre!” and also an unexpected roll to windward saved all our lives. Nobody got a scratch. We were past in a moment and in a breeze then blowing we had the heels of anything likely to give us chase. But an hour afterwards, as we stood side by side peering into the darkness, Dominic was heard to mutter through his teeth: “Le métier se gâte.” I, too, had the feeling that the trade, if not altogether spoiled, had seen its best days. But I did not care. In fact, for my purpose it was rather better, a more potent influence; like the stronger intoxication of raw spirit. A volley in the dark after all was not such a bad thing. Only a moment before we had received it, there, in that calm night of the sea full of freshness and soft whispers, I had been looking at an enchanting turn of a head in a faint light of its own, the tawny hair with snared red <b>sparks</b> <b>brushed</b> up from the nape of a white neck and held up on high by an arrow of gold feathered with brilliants and with ruby gleams all along its shaft. That jewelled ornament, which I remember often telling Rita was of a very Philistinish conception (it was in some way connected with a tortoiseshell comb) occupied an undue place in my memory, tried to come into some sort of significance even in my sleep. Often I dreamed of her with white limbs shimmering in the gloom like a nymph haunting a riot of foliage, and raising a perfect round arm to take an arrow of gold out of her hair to throw it at me by hand, like a dart. It came on, a whizzing trail of light, but I always woke up before it struck. Always. Invariably. It never had a chance. A volley of small arms was much more likely to do the business some day—or night.|$|R
