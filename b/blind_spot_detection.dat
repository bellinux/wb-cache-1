40|$|Spin-independent {{cross-section}} for neutralino {{dark matter}} scattering off nuclei is investigated in the NMSSM. Several classes of <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> for direct <b>detection</b> of singlino-Higgsino dark matter are analytically identified, including such {{that have no}} analog in the MSSM. It is shown that mixing of the Higgs doublets with the scalar singlet has {{a big impact on}} the position of <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> in the parameter space. In particular, this mixing allows for more freedom in the sign assignment for the parameters entering the neutralino mass matrix, required for a <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> to occur, as compared to the MSSM or the NMSSM with decoupled singlet. Moreover, <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> may occur for any composition of a singlino-Higgsino LSP. Particular attention is paid to cases with the singlet-dominated scalar lighter than the 125 GeV Higgs for which a vanishing tree-level spin-independent scattering cross-section may result from destructive interference between the Higgs and the singlet-dominated scalar exchange. Correlations of the spin-independent scattering cross-section with the Higgs observables are also discussed. Comment: 34 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} spin-independent neutralino Dark Matter {{scattering}} off heavy nuclei in the MSSM. We identify analytically the <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> in direct <b>detection</b> for intermediate values of m_A. In {{the region where}} μ and M_ 1, 2 have opposite signs, there {{is not only a}} reduction of the lightest CP-even Higgs coupling to neutralinos, but also a destructive interference between the neutralino scattering through the exchange of the lightest CP-even Higgs and that through the exchange of the heaviest CP-even Higgs. At critical values of m_A, the tree-level contribution from the light Higgs exchange cancels the contribution from the heavy Higgs, so the scattering cross section vanishes. We denote these configurations as <b>blind</b> <b>spots,</b> since they provide a generalization of the ones previously discussed in the literature, which occur at very large values of m_A. We show that the generalized <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> may occur in regions of parameter space that are consistent with the obtention of the proper neutralino relic density, and can be tested by non-standard Higgs boson searches and EWino searches at the LHC and future linear colliders.

40|$|AbstractThree {{competing}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed for the cortical representation of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> These are: (i) the regions surrounding the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> maintain their spatial values; (ii) the {{opposite sides of the}} <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are represented adjacently at the cortex, so that the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is “sewn-up”; and (iii) the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is sewn-up with compensation occurring in the immediate surround of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> so that spatial values are distorted only in the immediate surround of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> To distinguish between these hypotheses we used a two-dot alignment task, with the two dots straddling the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> at varying dot separations. Thresholds in the two-dot alignment task are limited by the cortical separation of the two dots. When thresholds for alignment across the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are compared with thresholds over intact retina at the same eccentricity, the three hypotheses predict: (i) no change in thresholds; (ii) a lowering of thresholds; and (iii) a lowering of thresholds but only at separations slightly greater than the diameter of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Thresoolds across the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were closely similar to thresholds across intact retina. The results do not support a sewing-up (with or without compensation) of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Rather, our results are consistent with a preservation of spatial values around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{usually do}} not notice the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> a receptor-free region on the retina. Stimuli {{extending}} through the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> appear filled in. However, if an object does not reach through but ends in the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> it is perceived as "cut off" at the boundary. Here we show that even {{when there is no}} corresponding stimulation at opposing edges of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> well known motion-induced position shifts also extend into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> and elicit a dynamic filling-in process that allows spatial structure to be extrapolated into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> We presented observers with sinusoidal gratings that drifted into or out of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> or flickered in counterphase. Gratings moving into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were perceived to be longer than those moving out of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> or flickering, revealing motion-dependent filling-in. Further, observers could perceive more of a grating's spatial structure inside the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> than would be predicted from simple filling-in of luminance information from the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> edge. This is evidence for a dynamic filling-in process that uses spatiotemporal information from the motion system to extrapolate visual percepts into the scotoma of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Our findings also provide further support for the notion that an explicit spatial shift of topographic representations contributes to motion-induced position illusions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reliability}} of visual filling-in at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{and how it}} is influenced by the distribution of spatial attention in and around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were studied. Our data suggest that visual filling-in at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is 1) less reliable than it has been assumed, and 2) easier under diffused attention around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> than under focal attention restricted in the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> These findings put important constraints on understanding the filling-in in terms of its neural substantiation. Recent neurophysiological studies suggest that V 1 neurons corresponding to the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> in retinotopic map extend their receptive fields far beyond the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> and are not silent during the filling-in (Komatsu, Kinoshita, and Murakami, 2000). For those neurons to subserve filling-in, it may be crucially important for top-down attention to match their receptive fields. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe human natural <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{is usually}} filled in {{based on the}} contextual information. When two {{sufficiently}} different images are presented to the two eyes, observers typically perceive an alternation between the two images (binocular rivalry). Both the filling-in process and binocular rivalry {{have been the subject}} of considerable research. This study investigates whether filled information in one eye's natural <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> can contribute to binocular rivalry. A radial grating (D= 12 °) was presented to one eye, centered on the natural <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Observers perceived a complete figure in monocular view; the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> area was filled-in based on the surrounding information. Simultaneously, a circular grating smaller than the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> (D= 4 °), was presented to the fellow eye in the region corresponding to the other eye's <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> The amount of rivalry as indexed by how often the smaller circular grating remained visible was measured. The results suggest that the filled information in the area of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> does contribute to the rivalry process...|$|R
40|$|The neural {{mechanism}} that mediates perceptual filling-in of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{is still under}} discussion. One hypothesis proposes that the cortical representation of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is activated only under conditions that elicit perceptual filling-in, and requires congruent stimulation {{on both sides of}} the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Alternatively, the passive remapping hypothesis proposes that inputs from regions surrounding the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> infiltrate the representation of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> in cortex. This theory predicts that independent stimuli presented to the left and right of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> should lead to neighboring/overlapping activations in visual cortex when the blind-spot eye is stimulated, but separated activations when the fellow eye is stimulated. Using functional MRI, we directly tested the remapping hypothesis by presenting flickering checkerboard wedges to the left or right of the spatial location of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> either to the blind-spot eye or to the fellow eye. Irrespective of which eye was stimulated, we found separate activations corresponding to the left and right wedges. We identified the centroid of the activations on a cortical flat map and measured the distance between activations. Distance measure...|$|R
