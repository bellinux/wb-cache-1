50|$|Livestock may be {{castrated}} {{when used}} for food to increase growth or weight {{or both of}} individual male animals {{and because of the}} undesirable taste and odor of the meat from sexually mature males. In domestic pigs the taint, called <b>boar</b> <b>taint,</b> is caused by androstenone and skatole concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity. <b>Boar</b> <b>taint</b> is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection, diet and management. It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers. Consequently, in commercial meat production, male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity. Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the 'boar taint'. This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{method to}} control <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> {{is to use}} sex sorted semen for artificial insemination.

5000|$|For centuries, pigs {{have been}} {{castrated}} to prevent <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Castration rates vary {{from country to}} country, and most still do not use anesthesia or analgesia when castrating pigs.

5000|$|By {{stimulating}} {{production of}} antibodies specific to GnRH, the vaccine stops {{the chain of}} events that lead to the release of testosterone and other steroids from the testes, including androstenone, one of the two causes of <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> The other major taint-causing compound, skatole, is also eliminated because the lower steroid levels allow the liver to more efficiently metabolise it.|$|E
5000|$|The company uses [...] "natural farming methods", {{also known}} as permaculture. They only use {{antibiotics}} if a pig gets sick. The farm does not use castration to control <b>boar</b> <b>taint,</b> relying on other methods such as selective breeding, diet, and pasturing males away from females. They raised sheep and pigs until 2009, when the farm focused on pork due to lower demand for lamb and wool.|$|E
5000|$|Each pig must be immunised {{twice to}} {{successfully}} control <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> The {{timing of the}} first dose is relatively flexible, {{but there must be}} a minimum of four weeks between the two doses, with the second taking place four to six weeks before slaughter. After the second dose, the boar's testicles stop growing. The handler should be trained {{in the use of the}} vaccine and the vaccinator with enhanced safety features.|$|E
50|$|<b>Boar</b> <b>taint</b> {{is caused}} by the {{accumulation}} of two compounds - androstenone and skatole - in the fat of male pigs. Androstenone (a male pheromone) is produced in the testes as male pigs reach puberty, while skatole (a byproduct of intestinal bacteria, or bacterial metabolite of the amino acid tryptophan) is produced in both male and female pigs. However levels are much higher in intact boars because testicular steroids inhibit its breakdown by the liver. As a result, skatole accumulates in the fat of male pigs as they mature.|$|E
5000|$|As {{castration}} {{has received}} criticism in recent years, due to welfare reasons, some producers and producer associations are seeking alternative methods to control <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Some producers are breeding out the taint and avoiding the few breeds of pigs that {{are high in}} taint.

[...] When pigs are raised on pasture in a rotational grazing system, similar to cattle, goats and sheep, the skatole based taint does not occur because the pigs are on fresh ground and not inhaling and eating their own feces., unfortunately this pasture grazing practice is not conducive to commercial pig production.|$|E

50|$|Ireland {{has a low}} {{density of}} pig {{production}} {{when compared to the}} larger pig producing regions across Europe.Irish pig producers finish their pigs at lower carcase weights compared to most countries across Europe. As a result, Irish producers do not castrate their male pigs. Castration is carried out across most of Europe as male pigs are generally brought to heavier carcase weights and, without castration, 'boar taint' may become an issue. <b>Boar</b> <b>taint</b> refers to the unpleasant odour and flavour characteristics noted in pork derived from males boars as they reach sexual maturity. Taint is only found in a small minority of boars and can be found in sows as it is actually caused by two different chemicals, one produced in the male testes and the other produced in the intestines. As the castration of pigs has also become an animal welfare issue across Europe, non-castration is considered a double advantage, as it benefits the welfare of the animal and entire boars produce leaner and better quality meat. Taint can be controlled through breeding away from the few lines that have it (genetics), feed management (higher fibre) and housing management (out on pasture instead of confinement).|$|E
40|$|A {{reduction}} in <b>boar</b> <b>taint,</b> an unpleasant odor arising in pork from some intact males, is desirable if routine castration of piglets {{needs to be}} stopped. Commercial slaughter pigs are typically crosses between sire lines mainly selected for finishing traits and dam lines mainly selected for reproduction traits. Previous studies suggest the possibility of reducing <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> in sire lines due to favorable genetic correlations between <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> and finishing traits. However, there are indications of unfavorable genetic associations between <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> and female reproduction traits, but a lack of genetic correlation estimates remain a major roadblock in reducing <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> in dam lines. This {{study was conducted to}} estimate genetic correlations between <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> traits and female reproduction traits, investigate differences in these genetic relationships among sire and dam lines, and evaluate possible consequences of selection against <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> in dam lines. The data consisted of 32, 549 reproduction records from a Landrace dam line, 23, 874 records from a Yorkshire dam line, and 3, 745 records from a Pietrain sire line. Androstenone, skatole, and indole were measured on 1, 896 carcasses, and human nose scores were recorded on 7, 742 carcass samples. In general, the level of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) in the two dam lines than in the sire line. A majority of genetic correlations of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds with reproduction traits were either low or nonsignificant, except for those of skatole and indole, with age at first insemination in dam lines that were – 0. 32 and – 0. 46, respectively. Genetic correlations also differed (P < 0. 05) between sire and dam lines. The consequences of selection against <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> in dam lines were evaluated, using selection indexes based on reproduction traits only, <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> traits only, and both <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> and reproduction traits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} measures of boar (Sus scrofa) taint as potential selection criteria to reduce <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> so that castration of piglets will become unnecessary. Therefore, genetic parameters of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> measures and their genetic correlations with finishing traits were estimated. In particular, the usefulness of a human panel assessing <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> (human nose score) was compared with chemical assessment of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds, androstenone, skatole, and indole. Heritability estimates for androstenone, skatole, and indole were 0. 54, 0. 41, and 0. 33, respectively. The heritability for the human nose score using multiple panelists was 0. 12, and ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 19 for individual panelists. Genetic correlations between scores of panelists were generally high up to unity. The genetic correlations between human nose scores and the <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds ranged from 0. 64 to 0. 999. The <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds and human nose scores had low or favorable genetic correlations with finishing traits. Selection index estimates indicated that the effectiveness of a breeding program based on human nose scores can be comparable to a breeding program based on the <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds themselves.

The reproducibility of HNS ranged from 0. 19 to 0. 32 reflecting natural variation in the ability of human beings to detect different odors. The correlations of HNS with androstenone ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 52, while those with skatole ranged from 0. 31 to 0. 89, suggesting that skatole is a better predictor of <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Considering (1) the relationship of HNS with the <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds, (2) the ability of HNS to capture variation not accounted for by the <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds, (3) low estimation costs and (4) low time requirements, HNS can be used in large scale evaluations of <b>boar</b> <b>taint...</b>|$|E
40|$|There is a {{commitment}} by the European pig sector to ban surgical castration of male piglets in the European Union in 2018. One alternative to castration {{is to raise}} entire male pigs, with {{an increased risk of}} <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> A field study was performed to 1) evaluate inter- and intra-farm variation in <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence, 2) investigate factors measured at slaughter influencing <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> and 3) evaluate the relationship between sensorial scoring by a trained panel and the concentration of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> components. From 34 farms, neck fat samples were collected from all entire male pigs in at least 2 slaughter batches per farm (78 batches; 9167 animals). In addition to olfactory <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> analysis, data was also collected on fresh skin lesions (score 0 - 3) at the slaughter line, slaughter weight, lean meat percentage, duration of transport, time spent in lairage, total delivery duration, day length, shortening of days and outdoor mean temperature. Using the hot iron method, neck fat samples were scored (8 -point scale) for <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Average <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence (score ≥ 3) was 5. 6 ± 2. 5 % and the mean difference between the maximum and minimum prevalence per farm was 4. 3 ± 3. 2 %. Androstenone (AND), skatole (SKA) and indole (IND) concentrations were measured for a subset (n= 254) of the samples. According to binomial univariate mixed models, entire male pigs with a higher skin lesion score had higher odds of having <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> (P= 0. 031), as did fatter entire male pigs (P< 0. 001). In the binomial multivariate mixed model lean meat percentage (P< 0. 001) and outdoor mean temperature (P= 0. 005) remained as only significant factors.

40|$|<b>Boar</b> <b>taint</b> is an {{off-odour}} and off-flavour {{that can}} occur when meat or fat from entire males is heated. The main compounds responsible for this odour are skatole and androstenone {{and to a lesser}} degree indole. However, the concentration levels of these compounds do not completely account for the occurrence of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> as determined by sensory analyses. A plausible explanation for this would be the contribution of other ‘unknown’ compounds to <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> In this study, a two-way strategy was followed to explore this hypothesis. Firstly, a targeted post-acquisition re-interrogation of a dataset of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> samples was performed using high resolution MS.

40|$|Since {{surgical}} castration of male piglets without anaesthesia is under heavy societal pressure, finding a sustainable solution to reduce <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> has become urgent. One way to circumvent this animal welfare violation is raising entire male pigs whilst selecting against the tainted phenotype through marker-assisted selection. Since slaughtering {{at a lower}} weight is often suggested to reduce <b>boar</b> <b>taint,</b> selection using a marker for that trait could be a promising strategy. Therefore, in this study a melanocortin 4 receptor (MC 4 R) mutation, frequently described in different pig breeds as marker for fat content, weight gain and feed intake, was examined in relation to <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> in pig breeds used in Belgian pig farms.

40|$|Genetically {{reducing}} <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> using low-taint {{lines is}} considered the most sustainable and economic long-term alternative to surgical castration of male pigs. Owing to the high heritability of the main <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> components (androstenone, skatole and indole), breeding is an excellent tool for {{reducing the number of}} tainted carcasses. To incorporate <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> into breeding programmes, standardized performance testing is required. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop and formally present a performance test for the main <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compounds on live breeding candidates. First, a standardized performance test for <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> was established. A biopsy device was developed to extract small tissue samples (200 to 300 mg) from breeding candidates. Quantification of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> components from these small samples using specialized chemical extraction methods proved accurate and repeatable (r = 0. 938). Following establishment of the method, biopsy samples of 516 live boars (100 to 130 kg live weight) were collected in the second step. Various mixed linear models were tested for each <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> compound; models were ranked in terms of their information content. Pedigree information of 2245 ancestors of biopsied animals was included, and genetic parameters were estimated using univariate and multivariate models. Androstenone (in μg/g liquid fat (LF) : mean = 0. 578, σ = 0. 527), skatole (in μg/g LF: mean = 0. 033, σ = 0. 002) and indole (in μg/g LF: mean = 0. 032, σ = 0. 002) levels obtained by biopsy were plausible. Heritability estimates for androstenone calculated with univariate (0. 453) and multivariate (0. 452) analyses were comparable to those in the literature. Heritabilities for skatole (0. 495) and indole (0. 550) were higher than that for androstenone. Genetic and phenotypic correlations were similar to those published previously.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research program that was aimed at evaluating: (1) sensory evaluation of meat from entire male pigs, (2) preventive measures to reduce <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence, (3) accuracy of detection for <b>boar</b> <b>taint,</b> and (4) the relationship between farm management characteristics and levels of mounting and aggressive behaviour of boars. Using observational and experimental studies data were collected in various segments of the pork supply chain. Consumer acceptance of meat from entire male pigs was evaluated. The effectiveness of preventive measures to reduce <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence was determined. The relationship of farm (management) characteristics with <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence, animal behaviour, skin lesions and lameness respectively was analysed. The similarity of the rank order between consumer perception of odour and human nose scores, skatole and androstenone levels respectively was determined. Consumers evaluate meat that passed the <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection test comparable to meat from gilts. Meat samples that did not pass this test were evaluated less favourable. Ranking AI boars on their genomic breeding values for low <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> resulted in a reduction in <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence of 40 %. The skatole level is lower in boars fed via a long trough than in boars fed by a single space feeder. Few eating places, restricted feeding, a low level of amino acids in the diet, insufficient water supply of the drinking system, illness of the pigs, a suboptimal climate and fear for humans were associated with a higher level of sexual and aggressive behaviour and more skin lesions. A partly open pen wall, clean pens and pigs, wider gaps of the slats, feeding by a long trough, and feeding wet by-products were associated with less sexual and aggressive behaviour and less skin lesions. Having more than 30 animals per pen was associated with a higher probability of high <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence levels. Hygienic conditions were associated with lower <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> prevalence levels. Assessing similarity of the rank order comparison between consumer perception and three selected <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection parameters for the consumer perception attribute odour of meat resulted in the highest Kendall's W values for the human nose scores. In conclusion, boar tainted meat was rated as less pleasant by consumers compared to meat of gilts and non-tainted boar meat, indicating the need of detection as a safety net at the slaughter line. Breeding was an effective preventive measure to reduce <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Farms with appropriate management, feeding and housing conditions have reduced levels of mounting and aggressive behaviour.

40|$|In {{preparation}} to the European ban on surgical castration of male piglets on 1 th January 2018, Belgian slaughterhouses were questioned about their current use of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection methods and their future perspectives. Slaughterhouses were selected on {{basis of their}} annual number of slaughtered pigs, which {{should be at least}} 10 200. This criterion was fulfilled by 19 out of 38 pork slaughterhouses in Belgium. Ten of them were interested to participate and questionnaires were sent and filled in by 8 slaughterhouses. Following topics were asked for: -	Number of intact / immunocastrated boars slaughtered each week + reasons for this -	Presence of a <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection system and its characteristics -	Requirements for a <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection system if not present yet -	Destination of carcasses with <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> Six out of 8 slaughterhouses accepted intact or immunocastrated boars and the numbers of these animals per week ranged from 180 to 3200 for individual slaughterhouses. Based on numbers of weekly slaughterings of all male pigs, 3. 3 % were intact boars and 4. 9 % immunocastrated boars. Main reasons for the decision of slaughtering intact or immunocastrated boars is on demand of the customer. One of the 2 abattoirs slaughtering only castrated males does not consider to change its strategy in the future {{because of a lack of}} a potential market. The other will change its strategy in 2014. The results of the questionnaire indicated a clear need for a reliable <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection system which should score on a 2 -point scale; presence of absence of <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> It should be preferably located immediately after veterinary inspection at the slaughter line. Results should be reported to the pig producer. Other preferred characteristics of a future detection system should be: -	easy adaptation to changing <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> parameters; -	easy to clean and safe; -	no interference with food safety; -	full automatic; -	acceptable for customers buying the intact boar meat; -	results available immediately after analysis. Only 2 slaughterhouses currently used a <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection system, which twice was the sensory method. Both abattoirs analyze all intact males, one does the analysis on the carcass, the other in the laboratory. Slaughterhouses abilities to change over towards more weekly slaughtering of intact boars is mainly controlled by the consumers market. The absence of reliable <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> detection systems at the slaughterhouse acts as a brake. Notwithstanding these limitations, Belgium has a unique position in Western-Europe as the only country marketing intact boars and immunocastrates. nrpages: 225 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, about 1. 3 million boars were surgically castrated, most of {{them without}} anaesthesia. Castration is {{performed}} to avoid the occurrence of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> and aggressive and sexual behaviour. There {{is a growing concern}} about the welfare of the piglets and the Swedish Board of Agriculture is working to find efficient and functional alternatives to castration without anaesthesia. The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain an overall picture of the latest research about the alternatives to castration without anaesthesia, with focus on vaccination against <b>boar</b> <b>taint,</b> and how they affect the welfare of the pigs. The alternative methods that are available today are surgical castration with anaesthesia and/or analgesia, rearing entire males and vaccination against <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Surgical castration is efficient in preventing <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> and aggressive and sexual behavior, but incomplete or inadequate anaesthesia and/or analgesia can have negative effects on the welfare of the pig. Rearing entire males improves welfare of these animals early in life when they aren’t subjected to the pain of castration. Later in life their welfare might be impaired due to stress and injuries caused by aggressive and sexual behavior. Entire males have leaner carcasses and higher protein content compared to surgical castrated pigs which is more profitable. Vaccination against <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> is efficient in preventing <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> The pigs are considered as entire males until the second injection is administered, and are then more likely to show aggressive and sexual behavior compared to surgical castrates. This may result in stress and injuries compromising animal welfare. After the second injection the pigs express less aggressive and sexual behavior, and have a leaner carcass compared to surgical castrates. In order to reduce the time period during which the pigs are subjected to aggressive and sexual behavior the vaccine can be administered earlier. More research is needed to investigate if vaccination against <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> may be a long term and profitable method in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|This diploma work {{is focused}} on the {{processing}} of information concerning meat quality and <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> The use of boar meat is in recent years a very common theme in the area of animal welfare. In addition to traditional castration of pigs, for piglets which is physically and mentally exhausting, are now new alternatives previous occurrence of <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> In {{the first part of this}} work there are listed aspects of breeding pigs and boars, <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> problems and ways to eliminate objectionable taint. Using selected methods of sensory analysis were assessed for weight samples graded boar meat. The aim was to determine the acceptability of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> threshold for the consumer. For the purposes of veterinary inspection in slaughterhouses in the Czech republic uses boil test to identify <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> In the practical part was used boil test, when evaluated in some samples found unpleasant taint. Women were more sensitive to the taint of the meat than men, wichic is caused by steroid hormones. In further tests of sensory consumer panel evaluations submitted samples according to their preferences from best to worst and then in pairs test described the intensity differences between samples. The test results were processed according to the methodology and standard of ČSN. Between samples of boar meat were found statistically significant differences at a confidence level of 95 %...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of social {{criticism}} on castration, the Netherlands intend to start fattening boars. The great obstacle to a ban on castration is the expected negative effect on international trade because {{of the fear of}} <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Consumers’ perception of <b>boar</b> <b>taint</b> is investigated, and a summary is presented of the knowledge gained up to the present to reduce <b>boar</b> <b>taint.</b> Advantaged and drawbacks of several alternatives are assessed. An economic chain- and import/export model has been developed to estimate economic consequences. The total added value of the pig farmers' chain will significantly reduce, but there is much uncertainty of the estimation of market acceptance and prices. A further elaboration of the model is proposed, with an assessment of the optimal mix of alternative...|$|E
