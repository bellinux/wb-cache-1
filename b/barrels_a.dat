5|$|A £10 million {{expansion}} {{project was}} embarked upon at the brewery in 1988. Construction {{of a new}} plant increased brewing capacity from 1 million to 1.3 million <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year. In 1989, the derelict former maltings building was converted into brewery offices in a £4 million project. Also, a new distribution depot was constructed in Elland.|$|E
5|$|The trail {{connects to}} the Binnewater Historic District in Rosendale. The {{district}} was the location of several local quarries which opened throughout the region after the 1825 discovery of rocks capable of producing Rosendale cement in the nearby hamlet of High Falls. At its peak, the district was producing 4,000,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year and employed 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s White Shield {{had become}} a cult drink brewed in small {{quantities}} for a dedicated following; production in 1965 was just 15,000 barrels as drinkers switched to filtered and pasteurised bottled and keg beers. It found renewed popularity in the early 1970s as the demand for real ale grew, but lost this position as cask ale became easier to find. Bass moved production from Burton to their Hope & Anchor brewery in Sheffield in 1981. The Hope & Anchor brewery closed in 1992, and production was moved to Cape Hill in Birmingham, before being contracted to King and Barnes of Sussex in 1998. By this time, production was down to just 1,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year, and the beer's long-term survival was in doubt. The King and Barnes brewery closed in 2000, and production moved to the Bass owned White Shield microbrewery in Burton upon Trent.|$|E

5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces {{from a variety of}} nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E
5|$|Kent is {{the centre}} of hop-growing in England, being centred on nearby Canterbury and Faversham has been the home of several breweries. The Shepherd Neame Brewery was officially founded in 1698, though brewing {{activities}} in Faversham pre-date this. The brewery {{claims to be the}} oldest in Britain and continues to be family-owned. The Rigden brewery was founded in the early 18th century by Edward Rigden. It subsequently merged with the Canterbury-based George Beer in 1922 to become George Beer & Rigden before being purchased by the Maidstone based Fremlin's. Whitbread bought out Fremlin's in 1967, and closed the Faversham brewery in 1990. The site is now a Tesco superstore. Shepherd Neame remains a significant regional brewer despite a decline in consumption of traditional bitter beer, producing around 230,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year. It now also makes India Pale Ale under licence. Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Neame, recipient of the Victoria Cross, was born in Faversham and a memorial to him was placed in the town centre in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Mired in {{economic}} problems, Cuba was {{aided by the}} election of socialist and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> day. That same year, Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some economic problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel.|$|E

5|$|Strangeways Brewery {{was founded}} in 1778 by two grain merchants, Thomas Caister and Thomas Fry, just north {{of what is now}} Manchester city centre. Their {{principal}} customers were the cotton workers of Manchester, then a burgeoning mill town. Henry Boddington, born in 1813 in Thame, Oxfordshire, joined the brewery in 1832 as a travelling salesman when the brewery was in the possession of Hole, Potter and Harrison. Like most Manchester breweries at the time, it was a modestly sized operation. Boddington had become a partner by 1848, alongside John and James Harrison, and by this time the company went under the name John Harrison & Co. In January 1853, Boddington borrowed money to become its sole owner. Between Boddington's takeover until 1877, the brewery's output increased tenfold from 10,000 to 100,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year, making it not only Manchester's largest brewery but {{one of the largest in}} the North of England, with over 100 tied houses. By 1883 Henry Boddington & Co. was a limited liability company. Henry Boddington's estate was valued at almost £150,000 when he died in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Team Razer was {{acknowledged}} {{for having}} devised and popularised the crushing and piercing arm weapon. Razer's success spawned {{a number of}} imitations: SuicidalTendencies, Ming3 and Tiberius are amongst the other heavyweight robots to have adopted such a weapon, whilst the featherweight robot Venom is a scaled-down replica of Razer. In 2001, Razer appeared in cartoon form on the front cover of the seventeenth issue of Robot Wars Magazine. It was {{also included in the}} Robot Wars video games. The version of Razer which competed in the fourth series of Robot Wars was used as the model for a pull-back toy powered by friction motors. This was sold alongside a model stunt ramp and <b>barrels.</b> <b>A</b> small metal toy based on Razer was available as part of the Robot Wars minibots range and, alongside Chaos 2 and Hypno-Disc, Razer was one of three competitor robots chosen to appear on a personalised DVD as part of the Robot Wars Ultimate Warrior Collection series.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Boddingtons {{bought the}} Oldham Brewery for £23million, hoping to combine Oldham's {{strength}} in lager and keg bitter {{with their own}} expertise in cask ales. After the acquisition, the company owned 272 public houses, 70 per cent of which were within 20 miles of its Manchester brewery. In 1983, Boddingtons Bitter was distributed in the Home Counties for the first time. In 1985 Boddingtons paid £27.5million for the 160,000 barrel capacity Higsons Brewery in Liverpool and its tied estate of 160 public houses to form a combine with a £65million turnover. The Guardian commented {{that the company had}} paid mere asset value for Higsons as the company had been reporting poor profits. There was virtually no overlap between the two companies, and the takeover brought Boddingtons to Merseyside for the first time. By this time Strangeways was producing only two beers, a bitter and a mild, with bitter constituting over 90 per cent of production. In 1986, the company employed 280 people and operated 530 tied houses, and while Strangeways Brewery had a capacity of 500,000 <b>barrels</b> <b>a</b> year, it was operating at around 50 per cent capacity. That year the company introduced its own lager, brewing Kaltenberg under licence.|$|E
