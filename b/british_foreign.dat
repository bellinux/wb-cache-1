5|$|As {{requested}} by Walpole, George revived the Order of the Bath in 1725, which enabled Walpole to reward or gain political supporters by offering them the honour. Walpole became extremely powerful and was largely able to appoint ministers {{of his own}} choosing. Unlike his predecessor, Queen Anne, George rarely attended meetings of the cabinet; most of his communications were in private, and he only exercised substantial influence with respect to <b>British</b> <b>foreign</b> policy. With the aid of Lord Townshend, he arranged for the ratification by Great Britain, France and Prussia of the Treaty of Hanover, {{which was designed to}} counterbalance the Austro-Spanish Treaty of Vienna and protect British trade.|$|E

5|$|At this conference, {{which was}} {{organised}} by Britain with American support, Van der Byl {{rejected the idea}} of an interim British presence in Rhodesia during a transition to majority rule, which was identified {{as one of the few}} ways of persuading the Patriotic Front to endorse a settlement.

The nationalist leaders said they would not return to Geneva or take part in any further talks unless immediate black rule were made the only topic for discussion.

5|$|Britain, {{with its}} {{commitment}} to South Arabia and its base in Aden, considered the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition of the republic posed a problem to several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the South Arabian Federation. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were some in the <b>British</b> <b>Foreign</b> Office who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe also withheld recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of West Germany, Italy, Canada and Australia, {{as well as the}} remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc.|$|E
5|$|Douglas-Home {{accepted}} the foreign affairs portfolio in Heath's shadow cabinet. Many expected {{this to be}} a short-lived appointment, a prelude to Douglas-Home's retirement from politics. It came at a difficult time in <b>British</b> <b>foreign</b> relations: events in the self-governing colony of Rhodesia (formerly Southern Rhodesia), which had been drifting towards crisis for some years, finally erupted into open rebellion against British sovereignty. The predominantly white minority government there opposed an immediate transfer to black majority rule before the colony had achieved sovereign statehood, and in November 1965 it unilaterally declared independence. Douglas-Home won the approval of left-wing Labour MPs such as Wedgwood Benn for his unwavering opposition to the rebel government, and for ignoring those on {{the right wing of the}} Conservative party who sympathised with the rebels on racial grounds.|$|E
