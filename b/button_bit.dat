40|$|Drill & Blast is a {{commonly}} used excavation method {{for the construction}} of underground openings (e. g. tunnels, caverns) in hardrock conditions worldwide. Wear of the employed tools may take place during dif-ferent steps of the working cycle, affecting a wide range of machinery and materials. Although excavators, dump trucks or conveyor belts are also permanently exposed to the excavated rock mass and therefore un-dergoing geologically influenced wear, the wear of the rock cutting tools (i. e. drilling bits, excavator chisels, picks) is the most expensive wear phenomenon. Drilling equipment and bit tool wear Common blasthole diameters range from 38 to 48 mm and are typically drilled by use of hydraulic rotary percussive drilling hammers (impact power of about 15 to 20 kW). In most geological conditions, predomi-nantly button bits are used which consist of a number of cemented carbide buttons inserted and/or solded into holes of a steel body (Figure 1). The properties of the <b>button</b> <b>bit</b> can be adjusted effectively to the local cir-cumstances by variation of the amount of inserted buttons, button composition, button geometry, solding and steel quality or the bit's flushing system.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a numerical method {{based on the}} finite element method for modeling rock fracture in dynamic bit-rock interaction during percussive drilling. A continuum approach based on a combined damage-viscoplastic material model for rock is chosen for modeling the fractures under the bit buttons. In this approach the fracturing is indicated by the damage and plastic strain distributions in the failing fi-nite elements. The failure surface consists of Rankine type of criterion accounting for tensile failure, the Drucker-Prager criterion indicating shear failure and a parabolic cap function governing the rock behavior under highly confined conditions. Rock hetero-geneity is taken into consideration mesoscopically, i. e. at the finite element level, by a statistical approach based on the Weibull distribution. The drill bit is modeled as a rigid body and the bit-rock interaction due the compressive wave causing the bit but-tons to penetrate into the rock is modeled using contact mechanics. The equation of motion of the bit {{is added to the}} system of equations of motion which is solved in time by explicit time integration. The bit-rock interaction due to a multiple <b>button</b> <b>bit</b> is simulated as a numerical example. The interactions between the bit buttons as well as the bit penetration-resisting force response are realistically captured by the present model...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: After {{introducing}} basic {{ideas on}} tools, rock fragmentation and wear mechanisms {{this paper presents}} and discusses options to classify bit wear types and to predict the rate of <b>button</b> <b>bit</b> wear. Results show that model tests, such as the CERCHAR scratch test may only give {{an idea of the}} rocks abrasivity but show no distinct correlation between encountered tool wear rates. Based on conventional rock parameters and taking into account the whole range of scale from grain mineral to rock mass, the presented schemes may help to predict tool wear rates and hint at possible problems in excavation and specific requirements for the tools used RÉSUMÉ: According to Point 6. 5. 2 of the IAEG bylaws all papers must be preceded by an abstract in both English and French.

His skin, wherever it was exposed, was burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face. Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. He was clothed with tatters of old ship's canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings, brass <b>buttons,</b> <b>bits</b> of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin. About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, drill <b>bit</b> <b>buttons</b> with cobalt, {{nickel and}} iron binders in {{different}} compositions {{have been tested}} against granite and sandstone and the wear and friction have been measured. Furthermore, the wear and degradation of the buttons have been categorized. Buttons with cobalt binder were tested against granite and sandstone and buttons with alternative binders (Ni, Fe, Co) were tested against granite. Cobalt buttons were used as a reference and the wear and friction of the alternative binders was compared to the reference. The amount of worn rock was also measured. Furthermore, post treated drill <b>bit</b> <b>buttons</b> with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co were compared to buttons with the same composition {{that had not been}} post treated The results show that buttons with an alternative composition of Fe-Co-Ni and Fe- Ni wears less than the cobalt reference. The post treatment process does not decrease the wear of the drill bit but lowers the deviation from the mean wear. The amount of worn rock does not differ between the samples except for between the post treated and not post treated buttons with a composition of Fe-Ni-Co. The post treated buttons produces more rock debris than the not post treated. No apparent difference could be seen {{on the surface of the}} tested buttons after the test. However, composition specific cracks could be found underneath the surface of the samples. EDS-analysis showed signals of oxygen inside of all of the investigated cracks. For some compositions at depths of 20 micrometers. The curves of friction shows similar appearance but the values of the coefficient of friction differs. No apparent correlation was found between the wear and friction of the samples. Furthermore, no apparent correlation was found between the hardness and the wear of the buttons. ...|$|R
