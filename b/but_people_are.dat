25|$|Overall, {{intensity}} of aphasia treatment {{is an area}} that requires more research. Current research suggests that intense treatment is effective, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> more likely to drop-out of high intensity treatments. Most importantly, {{intensity of}} treatment should be determined on a case by case basis and should depend upon recency of stroke and the patient’s stamina, tolerance for therapy, motivation, overall health status, and treatment goals.|$|E

His letters are laced with puns, oblique classical and [...] allusions, and droll asides, {{such as this one}} about Melbourne {{in a letter to his}} brother Cedric: [...] "Everything is dull here, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> kept alive by people getting shot at in the streets". The overall effect is one of [...] "a mind full of energy and histrionic ideas without a centre".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Jacqui {{embarked}} on a [...] "surprise" [...] relationship with Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss). Moss first hinted at their romance months prior stating: [...] "I think Rhys is going {{to fall in love}} again. It's a character already in the village. It's quite surprising. It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going to work, because people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible." [...] She also adopted a [...] "couple name" [...] for the pair titled [...] "Ja-Rhys".|$|E

500|$|On several occasions, {{people within}} the {{television}} and entertainment industry have suggested that Holby City {{is a waste of}} the television licence fee, with some suggesting that it ought to be cancelled. In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being [...] "humdrum" [...] and [...] "formulaic", saying of Holby City and the police procedural Mersey Beat: [...] "One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing this to us. Let's have something a bit different." [...] Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were [...] "highly selective" [...] as well as [...] "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like Holby City – week in, week out". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told The Guardian: [...] "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> increasingly voting with their on-buttons." [...] Also in 2002, David Cox of the New Statesman criticised BBC One's 2001 Christmas schedule, for airing Holby City against a contemporary version of Othello. On this basis, Cox advocated the abolition of the licence fee, explaining: [...] "The BBC was invented in a period when the elite decided what the population should know. If that has gone, then the licence fee should go too." [...] At the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that Holby City be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: [...] "This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold." [...] In June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of Holby City, and in January 2010, Janet Street-Porter of The Independent, opined Holby City had [...] "come to the end of [...] natural life" [...] and should be cancelled.|$|E

2500|$|One {{disadvantage}} {{of any new}} reactor technology is that safety risks may be greater initially as reactor operators have little experience with the new design. Nuclear engineer David Lochbaum has explained that almost all serious nuclear accidents have occurred with what {{was at the time}} the most recent technology. He argues that [...] "the problem with new reactors and accidents is twofold: scenarios arise that are impossible to plan for in simulations; and humans make mistakes". As one director of a U.S. research laboratory put it, [...] "fabrication, construction, operation, and maintenance of new reactors will face a steep learning curve: advanced technologies will have a heightened risk of accidents and mistakes. The technology may be proven, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> not".|$|E

2500|$|The {{last step}} is that {{effectively}} capitalist market society develops {{human beings in}} an inverted way. The capitalist economy is not primarily organized for the people, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> organized for the capitalist economy, to serve others who already have plenty of wealth. In an increasingly complex division of labour offering little job security, there {{is more and more}} external pressure forcing people to act in all kinds of different roles, masking themselves in the process; by this act, they also acquire more and more behavioural and semiotic flexibility, and develop more and more relational skills and connections. The necessity to work and relate in order to survive thus accomplishes the [...] "economic formation of society" [...] at the same time, even if in this society people lack much control over the social relations in which they must participate. It is just that the whole development occurs in an imbalanced, unequal and uncoordinated way, in which the development of some becomes conditional on the lack of development by others.|$|E
2500|$|La Torre {{wrote the}} lyrics to [...] "Don't Look Back", {{predominantly}} basing them on a poem about moving on, which he wrote many years prior when he was [...] "in a really weird place personally". He explains that the song is about [...] "taking charge of [...] own life and not making up excuses for why life is such {{a pain in the}} ass sometime," [...] because La Torre believes that we control our own destiny, and are responsible for our own successes and failures. He has also said: [...] "It's about scenarios of despair, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> finding the beauty in the very simple things in life." [...] Looking for [...] "some kind of resolver or conclusion" [...] to make the lyrics make sense, he came up with a chant: [...] "Magnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become things", a thought process based on the law of attraction from the book The Secret. The chant is repeated three times near the end of the song; La Torre says [...] "it used to build up even more" [...] in the original demo.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987 Dr. Joyce Williams, the {{chairperson}} of the Southeast Area Council, an organization within the Mayor's Citizens Assistance Council, said that her group stopped referring to the area as the [...] "Third Ward." [...] The practice became official on Wednesday June 3, 1987 The group itself was formerly named the Third Ward Area Council. Williams said [...] "The city has become a cosmopolitan city. The term ‘ward’ is stagnant, unsophisticated, and places areas in isolation." [...] Williams hoped that fellow Houstonians would also stop referring to sections {{of the city as}} [...] "wards." [...] Kim Cobb of the Houston Chronicle explained that [...] "She's particularly concerned about the Riverside-MacGregor area near the Medical Center that her group represents. She thinks the term [...] "Third Ward" [...] implies an economic division that will {{get in the way of}} the benefits that will come to the rest of the city from the opening of the George Brown Convention Center." [...] Betty Chapman, a historian, said in 2007 [...] "The wards haven’t had any real meaning since 1905. <b>But</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> very interested in them. They’re an important part of our history." ...|$|E

This was a recording of their 1993 appearance at the NEC in Birmingham, England. Recordings of this show have previously been released without assistance from Gillan or any {{other members of the}} band, but he said: [...] "It was one of the lowest points of my life – all of our lives, actually". In 2009, Ian Gillan said, [...] "Record sales have been steadily declining, <b>but</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> prepared to pay a lot for concert tickets." [...] In addition, Gillan stated [...] "I don't think happiness comes with money." [...] In 2011, Deep Purple did concert tours in 48 countries. The Songs That Built Rock Tour used a 38-piece orchestra, and included a performance at London's O2 Arena. Until May 2011, the band members had disagreed about whether to make a new studio album, because it would not really make money any more. Roger Glover stated that Deep Purple should make a new studio album [...] "even if it costs us money." ...|$|E
