25|$|The book of Samuel records Hannah's {{prayer to}} God. She rejoices and exalts the Holy One {{there is no}} father like God, therefore, the nation should rejoice also in this Holy One. This story of Hannah intertwines itself with {{the culture of the}} nation of Israel. Eli is the high priest (kohen gadol) of Shiloh, the second-to-last Israelite judge (succeeded only by Samuel - see 1 Samuel 7:15) before the rule of the kings, therefore, the Shiloh {{tradition}} will become an old and lost tradition that when the prophet Jeremiah comes on the scene in the history of God's people, he will seek to renew and to bring <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> of the Shiloh tradition to the people of Israel because the kings have become wicked defiling the temple and tradition of God.|$|E
25|$|London {{has been}} on the circuit since the beginning, and this was the last chance for athletes the run the Olympic course. The swim {{consisted}} of one 1.5km lap in The Serpentine. The athletes then completed seven laps of the cycle circuit taking in Hyde Park Corner, before leaving Hyde Park itself and down Constitution Hill to Buckingham Palace, where the circuit looped itself and sent the athletes <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they came from towards transition. The run section had the field complete four 2.5km around the Serpentine. The course differs from that of previous editions, most notably one swim loop instead of two {{and for the first time}} the course ventured outside of Hyde Park on the bike section as the athletes passed through transition a total of 12 times.|$|E

At Baltimore, Brutus loaded cargo, stores, and coal {{for her own}} bunkers. On 16 April, the collier put to sea on the long voyage around Cape Horn to Samoa, in the South Pacific. She made stops at San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Montevideo, Uruguay, and arrived in Tutuila on 11 July. She remained there exactly one month, heading <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she came on 11 August. After repeating her stops at Montevideo and San Juan, she entered Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 27 October.

25|$|Shortly before Lugosi's {{death in}} August 1956, {{he had been}} working with Wood on {{numerous}} half-realized projects, variously titled Tomb of the Vampire or The Ghoul Goes West. Scenes unconnected to Plan 9, featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking {{in and out of the}} side door of the Johnson home at nighttime, and a daylight scene on a patch of scrub land near a highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he came, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects. It is not certain for which projects the Lugosi footage was intended, and Wood's own account of the affair in his written memoirs seems to suggest that the director had something like Plan 9 in mind when the material was filmed. This claim stands in apparent contradiction to the Vampires' Tomb/Ghoul Goes West theory, backed up by a comment Lugosi made about Ghoul being his next project in a filmed interview upon his release from drug rehabilitation.|$|E
500|$|A {{possible}} Mirror Universe {{version of}} Vic Fontaine appears in [...] "The Emperor's New Cloak". This version of Fontaine {{appears to be}} human (no explanation for this is given), and is shot dead during a phaser battle. Fontaine is forced out of his club in [...] "Badda-Bing Badda-Bang" [...] by the American Mafia, who {{turn it into a}} casino. The rest of the crew want Fontaine's bar <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was, and are faced with either resetting the program and losing the hologram's memory of the crew or playing along with the story and returning the bar to Vic. So Captain Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) leads a team to steal the casino's takings. Upon their success, the program restores the bar to the way it was, and Fontaine celebrates by singing [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] to the crew. During the finale of Deep Space Nine, [...] "What You Leave Behind", Quark passes the time during the attack on Cardassia Prime by playing Go Fish with Fontaine. Later, after the victory and the defeat of the Dominion, the crew return to Vic's bar for a celebratory party.|$|E
500|$|The British {{plan for}} Gaza {{required}} the ANZAC Mounted Division to circle around by night and block Turkish reinforcements {{getting to the}} town. On 26 March at 02:30, the brigade left camp in a heavy fog and crossed the Wadi Ghuzze [...] south-east of Gaza. They soon reached their positions with the brigade, between the 2nd Light Horse and 22nd Mounted Brigades, {{and waited for the}} infantry divisions to assault the town. At 14:00, as the infantry were having problems, the brigade were ordered to attack. The regiment galloped towards the town, with the Wellington Mounted Rifles on their right and the Auckland Mounted Rifles in reserve. Once there, the regiment moved south along a ridge and attacked the garrison at Ali Muntar. This hilltop could command the approaches into Gaza. They soon captured the outlying Turkish trenches, forcing the defenders back towards the town. At 18:40 the 10th Squadron reached the hill top {{at the same time as}} the 53rd (Welsh) Division, who had been trying all day to take the position from the other side. Despite having captured a commanding position, both the regiment and the infantry division were ordered to withdraw. Turkish reinforcements had been reported en route, and the overall commander did not believe they could hold what they had captured. The regiment retired <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they had come, and reached Belah just after midnight the next day. Casualties for the day were one dead and six wounded.|$|E

Then there was silence for half an hour, followed by the same singing going <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it had come. Owin at first did nothing, but about an hour later Chad called him in and told him to fetch the seven brothers from the church. Chad gave his final address to the brothers, urging them to keep the monastic discipline they had learnt. Only after this did he tell them that he knew his own death was near, speaking of death as [...] "that friendly guest who is used to visiting the brethren". He asked them to pray, then blessed and dismissed them. The brothers left, sad and downcast.|$|E

2500|$|In the book, Judy's {{involvement}} in Madeleine's {{death was not}} revealed until the denouement. At the script stage, Hitchcock suggested revealing the secret {{two-thirds of the way}} through the film, so that the audience would understand Judy's mental dilemma. After the first preview, Hitchcock was unsure whether to keep the [...] "letter writing scene" [...] or not. He decided to remove it. Herbert Coleman, Vertigos associate producer and a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, felt the removal was a mistake. However, Hitchcock said, [...] "Release it just like that." [...] James Stewart, acting as mediator, said to Coleman, [...] "Herbie, you shouldn't get so upset with Hitch. The picture's not that important." [...] Hitchcock's decision was supported by Joan Harrison, another member of his circle, who felt that the film had been improved. Coleman reluctantly made the necessary edits. When he received news of this, Paramount head Barney Balaban was very vocal about the edits and ordered Hitchcock to [...] "Put the picture <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it was." [...] As a result, the [...] "letter writing scene" [...] remained in the final film.|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge {{suffered}} severe damage, as a [...] {{section of}} the upper deck on the eastern cantilever side fell onto the deck below. The quake caused the Oakland {{side of the bridge}} to shift [...] to the east, and caused the bolts of one section to shear off, sending the [...] section of roadbed crashing down like a trapdoor. Traffic on both decks came to a halt, blocked by the section of roadbed. Police began unsnarling the traffic jam, telling drivers to turn their cars around and drive <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they had come. Eastbound drivers stuck on the lower deck between the collapse and Yerba Buena Island were routed up to the upper deck and westward back to San Francisco. A miscommunication made by emergency workers at Yerba Buena Island routed some drivers the wrong way; they were directed to the upper deck where they drove eastward toward the collapse site. One of these drivers did not see the open gap in time; the car plunged over the edge and smashed onto the collapsed roadbed. The driver, Anamafi Moala, died, and the passenger was seriously injured. Caltrans removed and replaced the collapsed section, and re-opened the bridge on November 18.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the series}} four opener [...] "Partners in Crime" [...] (2008), Donna has become {{dissatisfied}} with regular life {{for two years}} and more interested in the bigger picture after her father died.

[...] The two-parter episodes of [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead" [...] introduces River Song and the Doctor accidentally shoves Donna into a cyberworld while attempting to keep her safe from the Vashta Nerada. [...] "Midnight" [...] gives Donna a break with a spa day while the Doctor has the most terrifying bus ride of his life. [...] The episode [...] "Turn Left" [...] features a parallel universe wherein Donna never met the Doctor; consequently, the Doctor died and the world comes to an end much sooner. In finale episodes [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] and [...] "Journey's End", Donna touches the Doctor's energised severed hand and is imbued with the totality of his knowledge, using which, she is able to stop Davros (Julian Bleach) and his plan to destroy reality. However, because her mind cannot handle the knowledge, the Doctor is forced to wipe her memory of him against her wishes when she tries to begs him not to send her <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she was and hope that they never meet again, lest she remember and her mind [...] "burn up". Donna reappears in the two-part The End of Time (2009–10). Early in the story, she buys her grandfather a book written by the episode's villain, which the Doctor takes to mean that the [...] "DoctorDonna" [...] is still trying to subconsciously lend a hand. When every member of the human race (apart from herself and Wilf) becomes a clone of the Doctor's nemesis the Master (John Simm), Donna's memories are nearly restored; however, a fail-safe installed by the Doctor protects her. In the story's concluding moments, Donna is last seen when she marries new fiancé Shaun Temple (Karl Collins), becoming Donna Temple-Noble; the dying Doctor anonymously delivers her a winning lottery ticket to ensure her financial future, having borrowed the purchase price from Donna's late father in the past, making it a present from both him and the Doctor.|$|E
