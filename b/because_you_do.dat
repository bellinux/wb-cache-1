500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson Benson {{believes}} Hemingway used autobiographical {{details as}} framing devices {{about life in}} general—not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with [...] "what if" [...] scenarios: [...] "what if I were wounded {{in such a way}} that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" [...] Writing in [...] "The Art of the Short Story", Hemingway explains: [...] "A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit." ...|$|E
500|$|By February 1671, John Churchill {{was back}} in London and duelling with Sir John Fenwick. Churchill's {{handsome}} features and manner – described by Lord Chesterfield as [...] "irresistible to either man or woman" [...] – had soon attracted the ravenous attentions {{of one of the}} King's most noteworthy mistresses, Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland. But his liaisons with the insatiable temptress were indeed dangerous. One account has it that upon the King's appearance Churchill leapt out of his lover's bed and hid in the cupboard, but the King, himself wily in such matters, soon discovered young Churchill, who promptly fell to his knees. [...] "You are a rascal", said Charles, [...] "but I forgive you <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it to get your bread". The story may be apocryphal – another version has Churchill jumping out of the window – but it is widely accepted that he was the father of Cleveland's daughter, Barbara, born on 16 July 1672 (O.S.). However, Churchill never formally acknowledged her.|$|E

I don't know why I'm always to be looked upon as different from other women,--as though I were half a savage." ...|$|R
5000|$|The bible links {{happiness}} and {{joy in the}} context of the service of God. All these curses will befall you, pursuing you and overtaking you to destroy <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not obey the Lord.... <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not serve God, your God, with joy and gladness of the heart. Deuteronomy, 28:45, 28:47. [...] Worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful song. Psalms, 100:2.|$|R

2500|$|For his 1995 release ...I Care <b>Because</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> James used {{an image}} of his face for the album cover, a motif which would be {{repeated}} on many of his later records. The tracks on this album were composed between 1990 and 1994 {{in a range of}} Aphex Twin musical styles. This was James' last record during the 1990s to emphasise analogue synthesizers. He commissioned Western classical-music composer Philip Glass to create an orchestral version of [...] "Icct Hedral" [...] (a song on this album), which appeared on the Donkey Rhubarb EP. Also in 1995, James released his Hangable Auto Bulb EP, which spearheaded the shortlived drill 'n' bass style.|$|E
2500|$|... "So the {{question}} is: 'How to win?' That's when I {{began to develop}} what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick with the most important thing' —the mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument {{in such a way}} that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cover of}} ...I Care <b>Because</b> <b>You</b> <b>Do</b> {{features}} {{a painting of}} James, and that of Richard D. James Album has a close-up photograph. His face is superimposed on the bodies of {{other people in the}} music videos for [...] "Come to Daddy" [...] and [...] "Windowlicker". Near {{the end of the second}} track of the [...] "Windowlicker" [...] single (known as [...] "Equation"), a photo of James' face is a steganogram which is revealed as a spectrogram. Another image of James and collaborator Tom Jenkinson is embedded (in SSTV format) with text in the third track of 2 Remixes by AFX, [...] "Bonus High Frequency Sounds". He has used his own photography for some releases, including the album sleeve for Selected Ambient Works Volume II.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} fools enter the synagogue, and seeing people occupying {{themselves}} with the law, ask how a person learns the law. They answer that first a person reads from children’s materials, then from the Torah, then from the Prophets ( [...] , Nevi'im), and then from the Writings ( [...] , Ketuvim). Then the person learns the Talmud, then the law ( [...] , halachah), and then the Midrash ( [...] , haggadot). Hearing this, fools ask themselves when they can learn all that, and turn to leave. Rabbi Jannai compared this to a loaf suspended in the air. The fool exclaims {{that no one can}} bring it down. But the wise person says that someone put it there and takes a ladder or stick and brings it down. So fools complain that they are unable to read all the law. But wise people learn a chapter every day until they read all the law. God said in [...] "it is not too hard for you," [...] but if you find it too hard, it is your own fault, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not study it.|$|E
2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone told me, if you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
