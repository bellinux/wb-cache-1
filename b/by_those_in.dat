5|$|Technically, kulintang is the Maguindanao, Ternate and Timor {{term for}} the idiophone of metal gong kettles which are laid {{horizontally}} upon a rack to create an entire kulintang set. It is played by striking the bosses of the gongs with two wooden beaters. Due to its use across a wide variety groups and languages, the kulintang is also called kolintang by the Maranao and those in Sulawesi, kulintangan, gulintangan <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Sabah and the Sulu Archipelago and totobuang <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> central Maluku.|$|E
5|$|The Bomber Mafia were {{a close-knit}} group of American {{military}} men {{who believed that}} long-range heavy bomber aircraft in large numbers were able to win a war. The derogatory term 'Bomber Mafia' was used before and after World War II <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the military who did not share their belief, and who were frustrated by the insistence of the men that the heavy bomber should take a primary position in planning and funding.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the mosque}} had regained its {{standing}} in Cairo, repairs and additional work {{were carried out}} <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> positions lower than sultan. This changed {{under the rule of}} al-Zahir Barquq, the first sultan of the Burji dynasty. The resumption of direct patronage <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the highest positions of government continued through to the end of Mamluk rule. Improvements and additions were made by the sultans Qaytbay and Qansuh al-Ghuri, each of whom oversaw numerous repairs and erected minarets. It was common practice among the Mamluk sultans to build minarets, perceived as symbols of power and the most effective way of cementing one's position in the Cairo cityscape. The sultans wished to have a noticeable association with the prestigious al-Azhar.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5|$|Families {{throughout}} Han China made ritual sacrifices {{of animals}} and food to deities, spirits, and ancestors at temples and shrines, {{in the belief that}} these items could be utilized <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the spiritual realm. It was thought that each person had a two-part soul: the spirit-soul (hun 魂) which journeyed to the afterlife paradise of immortals (xian), and the body-soul (po 魄) which remained in its grave or tomb on earth and was only reunited with the spirit-soul through a ritual ceremony. These tombs were commonly adorned with uniquely decorated hollow clay tiles that function also as a doorjamb to the tomb. Otherwise known as tomb tiles, these artifacts feature holes in {{the top and bottom of}} the tile allowing it to pivot. Similar tiles have been found in the Chengdu area of Sichuan province in south-central China.|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria had {{instructed}} the War Office {{to strike a}} new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal {{was meant to be}} a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the military services. To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of Prince Albert, vetoed the suggestion that the award be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London.|$|E
5|$|The 15th and 16th centuries saw a {{small number}} of British castles develop into still grander structures, often drawing on the Renaissance views on {{architecture}} that were increasing in popularity on the continent. Tower keeps, large solid keeps used for private accommodation, probably inspired <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> France had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth. In the 15th century the fashion spread with the creation of very expensive, French-influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps at Wardour, Tattershall and Raglan Castle. In central and eastern England castles began to be built in brick, with Caister, Kirby Muxloe and Tattershall forming examples of this new style. North of the border the construction of Holyrood Great Tower between 1528 and 1532 picked up on this English tradition, but incorporated additional French influences to produce a highly secure but comfortable castle, guarded by a gun park.|$|E

Bo's leadership in Chongqing dramatically raised his profile, both nationally and internationally. In 2010, {{he was named}} {{as one of the}} 'World's 100 Most Influential People in 2010' by Time. Observers noted that, in China's non-electoral political system, Bo's high-profile presence and bold political maneuvers essentially amounted to a public 'election campaign' for the top leadership. However, he drew the ire of some of the country's leaders; President Hu and Premier Wen were reluctant to acknowledge Bo publicly, ostensibly due to a discomfort over his leadership style.|$|E
5|$|The average house {{price in}} Poole is high {{compared}} {{to the rest of}} the UK and the surrounding south west region. The average price of a property in Poole in 2008 was £274,011; detached houses were on average £374,150, semi-detached and terraced houses were cheaper at £226,465 and £217,128 respectively. An apartment or flat costs on average £216,097, more than any other part of Dorset. The average house prices in Poole are boosted <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Sandbanks which had the fourth most expensive house prices in the world in 2000; in 2007 the average house price was £488,761.

5|$|The book's {{central theme}} {{is a warning}} that, in times of strife and {{increased}} fear, {{there is a danger}} of repression and suppression of dissent <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> government who seek to limit freedom of speech. In an interview with the author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|The {{iconography}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti {{was influenced by}} Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the Vishnu {{iconography of}} Gupta art. They and the earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} of Texas was changed {{as a result}} of some Spanish policies. As early as the 1690s, Spaniards brought European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, with them on their expeditions throughout the province. Some of the livestock strayed or stayed behind when the Spanish retreated from the territory in 1693, allowing the Indian tribes to begin loosely managing herds of the animals. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing mesquite, which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Although the introduced livestock were able to adapt to the changing conditions, the buffalo had a more difficult time grazing among the new vegetation, beginning the decline in their numbers. Spanish farmers also introduced tilling and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape. Spanish architectural concepts were also adopted <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Texas, including the addition of patios, tile floors and roofs, arched windows and doorways, carved wooden doors, and wrought iron grillwork.|$|E
5|$|This {{subfield}} {{of sociology}} studies, broadly, {{the dynamics of}} war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions. As a subset of this subfield, military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group {{rather than as an}} organization. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.|$|E

5|$|Specter {{died from}} {{complications}} of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, aged 82, on October 14, 2012, {{at his home}} in Philadelphia. Statements of condolence were issued by President and Mrs. Obama, Vice President and Mrs. Biden, the Office of the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by many of his colleagues and former opponents in the U.S. Congress, the Pennsylvania legislature, and the city of Philadelphia, among many others. Senator Specter, while he had been accused of alienating both parties due to certain positions he took and due to the two times he switched parties, among other issues, was nonetheless respected by many as a principled statesman who did much for his state and country, including <b>by</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> politics and the legislature, both in Pennsylvania and his home state, Kansas, as well as across the U.S. and beyond. He was the longest-serving of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators, and it was said that he had done more for the state than anyone else, {{with the possible exception of}} Benjamin Franklin himself. As a sign of this respect and out of mourning, President Obama ordered U.S. flags to be lowered to half-staff at public institutions and military bases in Washington, D.C. and the rest of the country on his day of interment.|$|E
