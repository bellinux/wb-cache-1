5|$|Despite his {{dissatisfaction with}} McClellan's failure to {{reinforce}} Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, {{to the dismay}} of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an Emancipation Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> as the product of desperation.|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it <b>being</b> <b>perceived</b> as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E

5000|$|Although, historically, Jain {{authors have}} adopted {{different}} views on truth, {{the most prevalent}} is the system of anekantavada or [...] "not-one-sidedness". This idea of truth {{is rooted in the}} notion that there is one truth, but only enlightened <b>beings</b> can <b>perceive</b> it in its entirety; unenlightened <b>beings</b> <b>perceive</b> only one side of the truth (ekanta). Anekantavada works around the limitations of a one-sided view of truth by proposing multiple vantage points (nayas) from which truth can be viewed (cf. Nayavāda). Recognizing that there are multiple possible truths about any particular thing, even mutually exclusive truths, Jain philosophers developed a system for synthesizing these various claims, known as syadvada. Within the system of syadvada, each truth is qualified to its particular view-point; that is [...] "in a certain way", one claim or another or both may be true.|$|R

40|$|As I {{stated in}} my {{previous}} paper, Each narrative's violence derives from its impenetrability, when we form a narrative about an incident, {{we would not}} allow another narrative to be formed. This is what I call the impenetrability of a narrative, from which each narrative works as non-active violence toward another narrative told at the same time: the former inevitably excludes the latter and the reverse is also true. But when we make a false or incorrect narrative about an incident or someone, the narrative will work as active violence because, excluding some correct narratives about them, we deal with them unfairly. In this paper, I name such a false or incorrect narrative 'a narrative told by intellect'. By the word 'intellect' Bergson means the perception without quality. As Bergson said, we, human <b>beings,</b> <b>perceive</b> objects with both quality and quantity, while animals, except human <b>beings,</b> <b>perceive</b> them mainly with quality. Consequently, such animals cannot manage {{them as well as}} we can because, as Bergson said, the ability to perceive objects with quantity enables us to manage them, using mainly language. From my point of view, this ability also enables us to use violence on others, making false or incorrect narratives about them. Therefore, if we really want to realize non-violence, we should not make such false or incorrect narratives. In this paper, I try to make clear how to avoid telling false or incorrect narratives about others...|$|R

Hornig’s work is frequently described as incorporating a philosophy of Minimalism, frequently incorporating windows or doors that frame barren city landscapes as well as the viewer's own image reflected in the object's surface.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contributes}} to a more enlightened conception of location and thus enables design of more suitable location-based applications.

On the basis of this understanding, the paper proposes a new framework of place. The framework supposes the ability to inform the development of location-based applications. As a proof-of-concept the framework is used as a source of knowledge in the conceptual design of two different location-based applications. ...|$|R
