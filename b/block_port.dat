In this paper, we present a scalable and flexible architecture and a novel algorithm, to detect and <b>block</b> <b>port</b> scans in real time. The proposed architecture detects fast scanners as well as stealth scanners having large inter-probe periods. FPGA implementation of the proposed system gives an average throughput of 2 Gbps with a system clock frequency of 100 MHz on Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA. Experimental results on real network trace show the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting and blocking network scans with very low false positives and false negatives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The Communications-based train control(CBTC) {{system has}} {{gradually}} {{become the first}} choice for signal systems of urban mass transit. However, how to guarantee its safety has become a research hotspot in safety fields. The generic test system with high efficiency has become the main means to verify the function and performance of CBTC system. This paper discusses a composable modeling method for the generic test platform for CBTC system based on the port object. This method defines the port object(PO) model as the basic component for composable modeling, verifies its port behavior and generates its compositional properties. Based on the port description and the test environment description, it builds port sets and environment port cluster, respectively. Then it analyzes and extracts possible crosscutting concerns, and finally generates a variable PO component library. It takes the modeling of <b>block</b> <b>port</b> objects in line simulation of generic test platform for CBTC systems as an example to verify the feasibility of the method.

40|$|Abstract — The area-I/O {{flip-chip}} package {{provides a}} high chip-density {{solution to the}} demand of more I/O’s in VLSI designs; it can achieve smaller package size, shorter wirelength, and better signal and power integrity. In this paper, we introduce the routing problem for chip and package co-design and present the first work in the literature to handle the multiple Re-Distribution Layer (RDL) routing problem for flip-chip designs, considering pin and layer assignment, total wirelength minimization, and chip-package co-design. Our router adopts a two-stage technique of global routing followed by RDL routing. The global routing assigns each <b>block</b> <b>port</b> to a unique bump pad via an I/O pad and decides the RDL routing among I/O pads and bump pads. Based on the minimum-cost maximum-flow algorithm, we can guarantee 100 % RDL routing completion after the assignment and the optimal solution with the minimum wirelength. The RDL routing efficiently distributes the routing points between two adjacent bump pads and then generates a 100 % routable sequence to complete the routing. Experimental results based on 10 industry designs demonstrate that our router can achieve 100 % routability and the optimal routing wirelength under reasonable CPU times, while related works cannot.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel measurement-based effort to {{quantify}} the prevalence of Internet “port <b>blocking.</b> ” <b>Port</b> <b>blocking</b> {{is a form of}} policy control that relies on the coupling between applications and their assigned transport <b>port.</b> Networks <b>block</b> traffic on specific ports, and the coincident applications, for technical, economic or regulatory reasons. Quantifying <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> is technically interesting and highly relevant to current network neutrality debates. Our scheme induces a large number of widely distributed hosts into sending packets to an IP address and port of our choice. By intelligently selecting these “referrals, ” our infrastructure enables us to construct a per-BGP prefix map of the extent of discriminatory blocking, with emphasis on contentious ports, i. e. VPNs, email, file sharing, etc. Our results represent some of the first measurements of network neutrality and aversion. ...|$|R

50|$|While {{the network}} {{neutrality}} debate continues, network providers often enter into peering arrangements among themselves. These agreements often stipulate how certain information flows should be treated. In addition, network providers often implement various policies such as <b>blocking</b> of <b>port</b> 25 to prevent insecure systems from serving as spam relays, or other ports commonly used by decentralized music search applications implementing peer-to-peer networking models. They also present {{terms of service}} that often include rules {{about the use of}} certain applications as part of their contracts with users. Most consumer Internet providers implement policies like these. The MIT Mantid <b>Port</b> <b>Blocking</b> Measurement Project is a measurement effort to characterize Internet <b>port</b> <b>blocking</b> and potentially discriminatory practices. However, the effect of peering arrangements among network providers are only local to the peers that enter into the arrangements and cannot affect traffic flow outside their scope.|$|R
