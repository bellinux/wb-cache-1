50|$|The Pleurodira {{are one of}} the two living suborders of turtles, {{the other}} being the Cryptodira. In many cases in the {{nomenclature}} of animals, ranks such as suborder are considered of little importance apart from nomenclatural or taxonomic reasons. However, {{this is not the case}} with the suborders of the turtles. This division represents a very deep evolutionary divide between two very different types of turtles. The physical differences between them, although anatomical and largely internal, are nonetheless significant, and the zoogeographic implications of them are substantial. The Pleurodira are known more commonly as the <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> and the name Pleurodira quite literally translates to side neck, whereas the Cryptodira are known as hidden-necked turtles. The Pleurodira turtles are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, largely to Australia, South America, and Africa. Within the Pleurodira, two living families are represented: Chelidae, also known as the Austro-South American <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> and the Pelomedusidae, also known as the Afro-South American <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R

50|$|The related Podocnemididae {{are either}} {{treated as a}} {{distinct}} family, or as a subfamily (Podocnemidinae) in the Pelomedusidae. The African <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles</b> are then also demoted to subfamily rank, as the Pelomedusinae.|$|R

50|$|Dahl's toad-headed turtle (Mesoclemmys dahli) is a {{medium-sized}} species of <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> in the Chelidae family. This freshwater turtle is endemic to small pools, streams, and swamps in northern Colombia, but it aestivates on land.|$|R

50|$|Members of Chelidae have unique shell morphology. The {{carapace}} {{often has}} reduced surface exposure of neural bones, or even none at all. This {{is due to}} less requirement for enlarged longissimus dorsi muscles in <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} snake-necked turtle (Chelodina oblonga) is {{a species}} of turtle in the Chelidae family or Austro-South American <b>Side-necked</b> <b>Turtles.</b> The species was described in 1841 from material collected during an expedition across northern Australia. The type location was restricted to Port Essington in the Northern Territory of Australia. The species has in recent years had several species of turtle synonymised with it, the distribution includes northern Australia, Indonesia and Pitcairn. As {{a member of the}} sub-family Pleurodira this species is a <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtle</b> and also a snake-necked strike and gape predator. This carnivorous turtle will consume fish, tadpoles, hatchling turtles, worms, crickets, etc.|$|R

50|$|Podocnemis unifilis {{is a type}} of <b>side-necked</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{so called}} because they do not pull their heads {{directly}} into their shells, but rather bend their necks sideways to tuck their heads under the rim of their shells.
