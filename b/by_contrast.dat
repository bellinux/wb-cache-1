Furthermore, to maximize profit and ensure proper resource allocation management, efforts can be made through improving influential factors. Therefore, it is a scenario that is worth considering in this case.|$|R
5000|$|From 1919 to 1922, Itten {{taught at}} the Bauhaus, {{developing}} the innovative [...] "preliminary course" [...] which was to teach students the basics of material characteristics, composition, and color. [...] "Itten theorized seven types of color contrast and devised exercises to teach them. His color contrasts included (1) <b>contrast</b> <b>by</b> hue, (2) <b>contrast</b> <b>by</b> value, (3) <b>contrast</b> <b>by</b> temperature, (4) <b>contrast</b> <b>by</b> complements (neutralization), (5) simultaneous contrast (from Chevreuil), (6) <b>contrast</b> <b>by</b> saturation (mixtures with gray), and (7) <b>contrast</b> <b>by</b> extension (from Goethe)."(de) In 1920 Itten invited Paul Klee and Georg Muche to join him at the Bauhaus. He also published a book, The Art of Color, which describes these ideas as a furthering of Adolf Hölzel's color wheel. Itten's so called [...] "color sphere" [...] went on to include 12 colors. In 1924, Itten established the “Ontos Weaving Workshops” near Zurich, {{with the help of}} Bauhaus weaver Gunta Stölzl.|$|R
