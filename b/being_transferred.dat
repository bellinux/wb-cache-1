40|$|Microbes {{encounter}} {{a broad spectrum}} of antimicrobial compounds in their environments and often possess metabolic strategies to detoxify such xenobiotics. We have previously shown that Fusarium verticillioides, a fungal pathogen of maize known for its production of fumonisin mycotoxins, possesses two unlinked loci, FDB 1 and FDB 2, necessary for detoxi-fication of antimicrobial compounds produced by maize, including the γ-lactam 2 -benzoxa-zolinone (BOA). In support of these earlier studies, microarray analysis of F. verticillioides exposed to BOA identified the induction of multiple genes at FDB 1 and FDB 2, indicating the loci consist of gene clusters. One of the FDB 1 cluster genes encoded a protein having domain homology to the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) superfamily. Deletion of this gene (MBL 1) rendered F. verticillioides incapable of metabolizing BOA and thus unable to grow on BOA-amended media. Deletion of other FDB 1 cluster genes, in particular AMD 1 and DLH 1, did not affect BOA degradation. Phylogenetic analyses and topology testing of the FDB 1 and FDB 2 cluster genes suggested two horizontal transfer events among fungi, one <b>being</b> <b>transfer</b> of FDB 1 from Fusarium to Colletotrichum, and the second <b>being</b> <b>transfer</b> o...|$|R
