40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the isolation of}} the furanocassane-type diterpene, named vinhaticoic acid, along with <b>beta-farnesene</b> and spatulenol from fruit shells of D. lacunifera. Structural determinations were accomplished by chemical derivatization and spectral analysis, including 1 D and 2 D NMR and X-ray crystallography. The fatty portion was extracted from the fruit kernels, transesterfied and analysed by HRGC/MS. Oleic acid (75. 8 ± 4. 3 %) was the major component. Essential oil extracted from the fruit shells of D. lacunifera was analysed by HRGC/MS and nine sesquiterpenes were identified; <b>beta-farnesene</b> (48. 6 %) and spatulenol (21. 61 %) were the major constituents...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{strains of}} Fusarium sambucinum grown on wheat kernels were {{examined}} for trichothecene {{production and the}} synthesis of volatile sesquiterpenes. The volatiles were purged with air and collected on Tenax traps. Adsorbed compounds were eluted from the traps and injected into a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer. Ten strains isolated from potato tubers produced high amounts of diacetoxyscirpenol and its derivatives. These strains were characterized by the production of high amounts of diverse sesquiterpenes. In 10 cultures, 19 compounds were detected, of which 6 were predominant and composed as much as 82 % of the volatile sesquiterpene fraction (e. g., <b>beta-farnesene,</b> beta-chamigrene, beta-bisabolene, alpha-farnesene, trichodiene, and an unidentified compound). Fifteen strains isolated from various sources that did not produce trichothecenes produced much less volatile sesquiterpenes, with less chemical diversity. No more than six compounds were present in cultures. Two of these compounds {{were present in the}} toxigenic strains isolated from potatoes (<b>beta-farnesene</b> and acoradiene), but four were unique to the strains not producing trichothecenes (longifolene, isocaryophyllene, delta-elemene, and an unidentified one). The pattern of volatile sesquiterpenes was characteristic and distinctive for both toxic and nontoxic strains...|$|E
40|$|Mice {{lacking the}} melanocortin- 5 {{receptor}} (MC 5 R) exhibit decreased {{sensitivity to the}} stimulatory effects of systemic melano-cortin injections on aggressive behavior. Because the pheromone-producing preputial gland expresses the MC 5 R, we tested the hypothesis that decreases in preputial pheromones underlie the behavioral deficit. Here we show that MC 5 R deficiency decreases preputial and urine levels of the sex pheromones, alpha- and <b>beta-farnesene,</b> relative to wild-type mice. We also demonstrate that farnesenes potently stimulate aggression in mice. Moreover, farnesene-stimulated aggression is reduced in MC 5 R-deficient mice, relative to wild-type mice. Our results suggest that activation of the MC 5 R promotes aggression by increasing farnesene signaling...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{with mass}} spektrometry and gas chromatography with {{flame ionization detector}} {{were used for the}} determination of volatile compounds in raw material for beer production, in intermediate products and in beer. Isolation of compounds with low boiling point was optimized using purge and trap analysis, solid phase microextraction, liquid extraction, and static headspace. Solid phase microextraction was proved to be the most useful for determination of Maillard reaction products that are formed during kilning and roasting of malt, hop essential oils and volatile substances produced by fermentation. The ratio of hop essentials oils with lower boiling point (alfa-humulene, <b>beta-farnesene</b> and beta-caryophyllene) decrease during wort boiling. Maillard reaction products are formed during wort boiling, although the content of 3 -methylbutanal and maltol is reduced by evaporation. Higher concentration of volatile substances contained top-fermented beer except 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol. The Dudák Premium proved the best results of the analyzed bottled beers. The Stella Artois contained the lowest concentration of volatile compounds...|$|E
40|$|Artemisinin {{has been}} proven to be an {{effective}} antimalarial compound, especially for chloroquine-resistant and cerebral malaria. However, its biosynthesis pathway is still not completely clear. In order to get new clues about artemisinin biosynthesis, metabolic profiling by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was applied to compare the secondary metabolites of two Artemisia annua L., genotype SP 18 and 001, for some phenotypic and agricultural trait differences, including artemisinin content, existed between the two genotypes. Samples at 7 time points of three growth stages were studied. The data of profiles were subjected to multivariate analysis with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The results indicated that there were clear differences in terpenoids and artemisinin metabolism between different growth stages and genotypes. Twenty-one compounds, including artemisinin and its related precursors, were selected as the market compounds of the PLS-DA between the two genotypes. Among them, artemisinic acid, arteannuin 13, borneol, <b>beta-farnesene</b> and an unidentified sesquiterpenoid (peak 48) were abundant in 001, while camphor, methyl artemisinic acid and lanceol accumulated mainly in SP 18. The relationship between these differences and artemisinin biosynthesis in the two genotypes of A. annua were discussed...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{reported}} that plants emit volatile compounds {{when they are}} attacked by herbivorous insects, which may be used by parasitoids and predators to locate their host or prey. The study of herbivore-induced plant volatiles and their role in mediating interactions between plants, herbivores and their natural enemies have been primarily based on aboveground systems, generally ignoring the potential interactions between above and belowground infochemical- and food webs. This study examines whether herbivory by Delia radicum feeding on roots of Brassica nigra (black mustard) affects the behaviour of Cotesia glomerata, a parasitoid of the leaf herbivore Pieris brassicae, mediated by changes in plant volatiles. In a semi-field experiment with root-damaged and root-undamaged plants C. glomerata prefers to oviposit in hosts feeding on root-undamaged plants. In addition, in a flight-cage experiment the parasitoid also prefers to search for hosts on plants without root herbivores. Plants exposed to root herbivory were shown to emit a volatile blend characterized by high levels of specific sulphur volatile compounds, which are reported to be highly toxic for insects, combined {{with low levels of}} several compounds, i. e. <b>beta-farnesene,</b> reported to act as attractants for herbivorous and carnivorous insects. Our results provide evidence that the foraging behaviour of a parasitoid of an aboveground herbivore can be influenced by belowground herbivores through changes in the plant volatile blend. Such indirect interactions may have profound consequences for the evolution of host selection behaviour in parasitoids, and may {{play an important role in}} the structuring and functioning of communities. ...|$|E
40|$|Current {{monitoring}} {{methods for}} walnut husk flies (WHFs), Rhagoletis completa Cresson, (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major pest of commercial walnuts, are ineffective at predicting {{the onset of}} damage, since the initiation of oviposition is determined by walnut phenology, and not fly population levels. The {{purpose of this study}} was to initiate the development of a new monitoring lure for WHFs by identifying walnut leaf volatiles that are kairomonally attractive to WHFs. One laboratory and three field experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that walnut volatiles are selectively attractive to the flies. Laboratory electroantennogram (EAG) experiments were performed to record WHF responses to three groups of volatile compounds: seven monoterpenes and four sesquiterpenes found in walnut leaves and husks, and nine aliphatic green leaf volatiles. The aliphatic compounds elicited the largest EAG responses, with 8 of 9 of the aliphatics ranked in the top 10 of 21 compounds tested. The monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes elicited weaker absolute EAG responses, but in relation to their lower volatility, they were assessed as strong EAG stimulants. Our interpretation of the EAG results suggested that monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes should be included in field attractancy tests. A blend of monoterpenes and a blend of sesquiterpenes, similar in proportions to walnut leaf headspace concentrations, were field tested, with both blends being significantly more attractive than the control. The second field experiment was conducted to elucidate which components of a previously suggested male WHF attractant, angelica seed oil (ASOil) (Angelica archangelica), are attractive. Distilled fractions of ASOil, along with crude ASOil were tested. Only one fraction was significantly attractive, a fraction composed predominantly of sesquiterpenes high in both alphacopaene (a known medfly, Ceratitis capitata, attractant) and caryophyllene, a sesquiterpene found in walnut headspace. The final set of field experiments tested individual walnut headspace sesquiterpenes (caryophyllene, <b>beta-farnesene,</b> alpha-farnesene and germacrene D) and the one attractive ASOil fraction. Caryophyllene, a common plant volatile, was more attractive than any other test lure, including germacrene D, a more walnut-specific volatile. This is the first report of a host-plant based volatile attractant for WHFs. The attractant, caryophyllene, captured primarily male WHFs (approximately 3 : 1, male:female). The impact of these studies may lead to a new WHF monitoring tool that might be predictive of the onset of walnut damage by ovipositing females. The lead-time provided by a predictive lure will help walnut growers reduce WHF damage by accurately timing their spray applications, thus treating their orchards less often, and with less adverse environmental impact...|$|E
