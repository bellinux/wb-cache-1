5|$|There {{are several}} subtypes of the <b>Breton</b> breed. Two, the Trait <b>Breton</b> and the Postier <b>Breton,</b> are officially recognised, while others {{such as the}} Corlais or Cheval de Corlay and the Centre-montagne or Central Mountain <b>Breton</b> are not. Older types that have {{disappeared}} include the Grand <b>Breton</b> and the Bidet <b>Breton</b> or Bidet d'Allure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Breton</b> {{was the son}} of William le <b>Breton,</b> a royal justice. The elder <b>Breton,</b> who is {{sometimes}} styled William Brito in records, came from a family who often served as justices and other legal officials. Occasionally the younger <b>Breton</b> appears in the records as John Bretun or John Brito. He served as Sheriff of Herefordshire from 1254 to 1257, and then as constable and bailiff of Abergavenny around 1257. In October 1259 he was sent abroad on matters pertaining to King Henry III of England, and Henry's son, the future Edward I. He then served Edward as keeper of the prince's wardrobe and then after November 1261 as the prince's steward.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{marriage}} to Claude Duchess of Brittany, Francis I of France secured the Union of Brittany and France. On 13 August 1532, the Estates of Brittany confirmed the arrangement by signing the Edict of Union. Upon the death of Francis III, Duke of Brittany in 1536, the Duchy of Brittany passed to Henry II of France. Henry's status as king of France meant that the duchy became merely a French province. Institutions such as the <b>Breton</b> Estates and Parlement of Brittany continued to resist Paris in matters of taxation until their dissolution {{at the end of}} the 18th century. <b>Breton</b> nationalism saw a revival following the 1839 publication of Barzaz Breiz, a collection of traditional <b>Breton</b> folktales, songs and music. Pitre-Chevalier's 1844 Histoire de la Bretagne, followed in the same footsteps by highlighting a number of historical events as manifestations of <b>Breton</b> nationalism and aspirations of independence. Chevalier did not hesitate to distort the causes of revolts such as the Revolt of the papier timbré, in order to promote his agenda. The end of the 19th century was marked by the disintegration of archaic <b>Breton</b> social and economic structures with a parallel drive for compulsory primary education. During the course of the latter, primary teachers were specifically instructed with phasing out minority languages. Early <b>Breton</b> nationalist organizations such as Association Brettone (founded in 1829) focused on issues such as the preservation of the <b>Breton</b> language and administrative autonomy. By 1914, the <b>Breton</b> language had embraced by the region's intellectuals through a literary revival failing however to reach the masses.|$|E

5|$|On 24 October 1940, Adolf Hitler {{installed}} Philippe Pétain as {{the head}} of state of Vichy France in the Montoire Agreement, abandoning the idea of an independent <b>Breton</b> state to ensure French cooperation.

5|$|The Soviet {{entry into}} the war {{prompted}} French communists to join the French Resistance, augmenting its presence in Brittany significantly. The majority of <b>Breton</b> nationalists adopted a neutral stance, refusing to join French collaborationist units such as Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism, while sharing their hatred of what they perceived as a worldwide Judeo-Bolshevist conspiracy. In the meantime, <b>Breton</b> nationalists became targets of a guerilla campaign waged by Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, who continued to view them as traitors. The first such killing took place on 4 September 1943, with the shooting of Yann Bricler, a relative of <b>Breton</b> nationalist Olier Mordrel. Lainé decided to directly aid the Germans in their anti partisan operations, hoping {{for a change in}} policy regarding the question of <b>Breton</b> independence. He believed that the mere presence of a purely <b>Breton</b> force would inspire others to join his cause.|$|E

5|$|Angus Lewis Macdonald {{was born}} August 10, 1890, {{on a small}} family farm at Dunvegan, Inverness County, on Cape <b>Breton</b> Island. He was the ninth child {{in a family of}} 14.

5|$|<b>Breton</b> died on {{or before}} 12 May 1275, when the {{custodian}} of the bishopric was given orders to seize Breton's estate because of debts {{owed to the}} king. These debts dated back over 20 years, to his time as sheriff. A Thomas le <b>Breton,</b> presumably a relative, was a canon at Hereford Cathedral from 1273, and probably owed his office to John.|$|E

5|$|In late 1261 <b>Breton</b> {{is noted}} as owing £120 {{in the royal}} records. A {{notation}} next to the debt implies {{that he was a}} canon of Hereford Cathedral at this point, but the Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066–1300 does not identify him as such. <b>Breton</b> does not appear in the records from this point until after the Battle of Evesham in 1265, when he is noted as holding a grant of royal safeguarding.|$|E
5|$|John de <b>Breton</b> (died c. 12 May 1275) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Hereford. He {{served as a}} royal justice and sheriff before being {{nominated}} to Hereford. He is sometimes credited with the legal treatise Britton; but {{in its current form}} <b>Breton</b> cannot be the author as the work refers to laws written 15 years after the bishop's death.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} chronicles that mention Breton's death {{also note that}} he was the author of a legal {{treatise}} entitled le Bretoun, but this cannot be the surviving work called Britton, {{at least not in the}} current form, as that work discusses laws composed 15 years after Breton's death. It is unclear why he was credited with the work, and whether this attribution is just a confusion of <b>Breton</b> with the real author or if he did in fact author the work, which was later revised. The fact that the Britton is written in French, not Latin, and that it contains little information about the theory of law, being mostly concerned with the practical application of laws, points rather strongly to an author who was a royal justice, which <b>Breton</b> was.|$|E

He was targeted by the Berlin-based Dadaists, in particular by Huelsenbeck and Serner, the former of whom was also involved in a conflict with Raoul Hausmann over leadership status. According to Richter, tensions between <b>Breton</b> and Tzara had surfaced in 1920, when <b>Breton</b> first made known his wish to do away with musical performances altogether and alleged that the Romanian was merely repeating himself. The Dada shows themselves were by then such common occurrences that audiences expected to be insulted by the performers.|$|E

5|$|Hervey le <b>Breton</b> (also {{known as}} Hervé le Breton; died 30 August 1131) was a <b>Breton</b> cleric who became Bishop of Bangor in Wales and later Bishop of Ely in England.
