40|$|Abstract It {{may be true}} that mankind’s hope is the {{identification}} of the living meaning of natural structures. However, scientists including physicists, chemists, and biologists have not found any evidence of the meaning. In the natural world, there exists one kind of structure which {{is beyond the scope of}} human laboratorial experiment. It is the structure of <b>galaxies.</b> <b>Spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> are flat disk-shaped. There are two types of <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies.</b> The <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> with some bar-shaped pattern are called <b>barred</b> <b>spirals,</b> and the ones without the pattern are called ordinary <b>spirals.</b> Longer-wavelength <b>galaxy</b> images (infrared, for example) show that ordinary <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> are basically an axi-symmetric disk that is called exponential disk. For a planar distribution of matter, Jin He and Bo He defined Darwin curves on the plane as such that the ratio of the matter densities at both sides of the curve is constant along the curve. Therefore, the arms of ordinary <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> are Darwin curves. Now an important question facing humans is that: Are the arms of <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> the Darwin curves too? Fortunately, Dr. Jin He made a piece of Galaxy Anatomy Graphic Software (www. galaxyanatomy. com). With the software, not only can people simulate the stellar density distribution of <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> but also can draw the Darwin curves of the simulated galaxy structure. Therefore, if Dr. Jin He’s idea is true then people all over the world will witness the evidence that the arms of <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> are identical to the corresponding Darwin curves. This paper shows partial evidence that the arms of galaxy NGC 3275 follow Darwin curves. Note: Ammar Sakaji and Ignazio Licata are the founder or the editor-in-chief of the Electronic Journal of Theoretical Physics. Over fifty journals of astronomy and physics had rejected Dr. Jin He’s core article on galaxy structure before 2010. It is Sakaji and Licata’s journal that accepted the article...|$|R

This survey {{is the first one}} specialized for <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> in this redshift range. We detected CO emission from six out of nine galaxies, whose CO luminosity (L_CO') ranges (1. 09 - 10. 8) × 10 ^ 9 K km s^- 1 pc^ 2. These are the infrared (IR) dimmest galaxies that have ever been detected in CO at z 0. 1 to date. They follow the L_CO'-L_IR relation among local <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies,</b> Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs), Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) and Sub-millimeter Galaxies (SMGs). Their L_CO' and L_IR are higher than that of local <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> which have been detected in CO so far, and L_IR/L'_CO, which is a measure of star formation efficiency, is comparable to or slightly higher than that of local ones.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the stellar masses of strongly <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Our analysis {{is based on}} a sample of ~ 14000 visually-classified nearby galaxies given in Nair & Abraham 2010 (a). The fraction of <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> is found to be a strong function of stellar mass and star formation history, with a minimum near the characteristic mass at which bimodality is seen in the stellar populations of galaxies. We also find bar fractions are very sensitive to the central concentration of galaxies below the transition mass but not above it. This suggests that whatever process is causing the creation of the red and blue sequences is either influencing, or being influenced by, structural changes which manifest themselves in the absence of bars. As a consequence of strong bar fractions being sensitive to the mass range probed, our analysis helps resolve discrepant results on the reported evolution of bar fractions with redshift.

Two ultraluminous X-ray sources and one supernova have been observed in NGC 7424. SN 2001ig was discovered in 2001 and classified as a Type IIb supernova, one that initially showed a weak hydrogen line in its spectrum, but this emission later became undetectable {{and was replaced by}} lines of oxygen, magnesium and calcium, as well as other features that resembled the spectrum of a Type Ib supernova.

5|$|The Solar System {{is located}} in the Milky Way, a <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> with a {{diameter}} of about 100,000 light-years containing about 100 billion stars. The Sun resides in one of the Milky Way's outer spiral arms, known as the Orion–Cygnus Arm or Local Spur. The Sun lies between 25,000 and 28,000 light-years from the Galactic Centre, and its speed within the Milky Way is about 220km/s, so that it completes one revolution every 225–250 million years. This revolution is known as the Solar System's galactic year. The solar apex, the direction of the Sun's path through interstellar space, is near the constellation Hercules {{in the direction of the}} current location of the bright star Vega.

M85 is interacting with the spiral galaxy NGC 4394 and the elliptical galaxy MCG-3-32-38. M88 (NGC 4501) is a multi-arm spiral galaxy seen at about 30° from edge-on. It has a highly-regular shape with well-developed, symmetrical arms. Among the first galaxies recognized as spiral, it has a supermassive black hole in its center. M91 (NGC 4548), a <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> with a bright, diffuse nucleus, is the faintest object in Messier's catalog at magnitude 10.2. M98 (NGC 4192), a bright, elongated spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on, appears elliptical because of its unusual angle. The magnitude-10 galaxy has no redshift. M99 (NGC 4254) is a spiral galaxy seen face-on. Like M98 it is of magnitude-10 and has an unusually long arm on its west side. M100 (NGC 4321), a magnitude-nine spiral galaxy seen face-on, is one of the cluster's brightest.

5|$|Hoag's Object, located 600 {{million light-years}} from Earth, {{is a member}} of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. The outer ring is largely {{composed}} of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxy</b> whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's coherence and therefore detached. Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies NGC 5953 and NGC 5954. In this case, both are active galaxies, with the former a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst of star formation triggered by the interaction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Friends: Whenever feeling happy, sad, or dangerous, {{remember}} two things. First, {{scientific experiments}} continue {{to show that}} human experience {{is derived from the}} creation of natural structure. For example, love, disease, and mental worries are the origin of the creation of microscopic structure. Second, the products of human’s creation is based on the natural one. That is, the products are the second creation to the natural one. For example, the toys which children are fond of, are the creation based on Earth’s resources and deposits while the meaning the toys transfer is originated from human’s feelings for the motion of natural structure. However, scientists do not know what is the origin of the natural creation. Laurent Nottale is the first person in human history who gave the fundamental explanation to the natural creation of Solar system, based on his theory of Scale Relativity. This paper is the study on the natural creation of galaxies. For a planar distribution of matter, Jin He and Bo He defined Darwin curves on the plane as such that the ratio of the matter densities at both sides of the curve is constant along the curve.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{two-dimensional}} numerical experiments is performed {{in order to}} test the response of an isothermal, self-gravitating gas disk to a uniformly rotating, barlike gravitational potential. The barlike potential is an equilibrium stellar model from the n-body calculations of Miller and Smith (1979). In the bar-dominated, central regions of the disk, a gas bar whose phase depends primarily on the location of principal resonances in the disk is formed. This response can be understood in terms of orbit-crowding effects. In the gas-dominated outer regions of the disk, two-armed trailing spiral waves are formed. The local pitch angle of these waves increases with increasing fractional gas mass. These self-gravitating gas waves are not self-sustaining. They are driven from the ends of equilibrium stellar bars, and their phase does not depend on the location of resonances in the disk. The relevance of these self-gravitating waves to observations and models of <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> is discussed. It is concluded that these waves and their associated ringlike structures may be consistent with the morphological distribution of gas features in <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies...</b>|$|R
50|$|Barred {{galaxies are}} {{apparently}} predominant, with surveys showing {{that up to}} two-thirds of all <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> contain a <b>bar.</b> The current hypothesis is that the bar structure acts {{as a type of}} stellar nursery, fueling star birth at their centers. The bar is thought to act as a mechanism that channels gas inwards from the spiral arms through orbital resonance, in effect funneling the flow to create new stars. This process is also thought to explain why many <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> have active galactic nuclei, such as that seen in the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy.|$|R

The two are 88,000 light-years apart and lie around 18 million light-years away. These two plus another four nearby dwarf irregular galaxies constitute the NGC 672 group, and all six appear to have had a burst of star formation in the last ten million years. The group is thought connected to another group of six galaxies known as the NGC 784 group, named for its principal galaxy, the barred spiral NGC 784. Together with two isolated dwarf galaxies, these fourteen appear to be moving in a common direction and constitute a group possibly located on a dark matter filament. 3C 48 was the first quasar ever to be observed, although its true identity was not uncovered until after that of 3C 273 in 1963.

It is 7.2 by 4.2 arcminutes, meaning that its surface brightness, magnitude 13.6, is significantly lower than its integrated magnitude. NGC 772 is a class SA(s)b galaxy, which means {{that it is an}} unbarred spiral galaxy without a ring that possesses a somewhat prominent bulge and spiral arms that are wound somewhat tightly. The main arm, on the northwest side of the galaxy, is home to many star forming regions; this is due to previous gravitational interactions with other galaxies.

By combining galaxy samples from the Hubble Deep Field North with newly available data from the Hubble Deep Field South, we are able to define a statistical sample of 18 objectively-defined low-inclination <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> systems with I_ 814 W< 23. 2 mag. Analysing the proportion of <b>barred</b> <b>spiral</b> <b>galaxies</b> seen {{as a function of}} redshift, we find a significant decline in the barred fraction beyond redshifts z≃ 0. 5. The physical significance of this effect remains unclear, but several possibilities include dynamically hotter (or increasingly dark-matter dominated) high-redshift discs, or an enhanced efficiency in bar destruction at high redshifts. By investigating the formation of the "orthogonal" axis of Hubble's classification tuning fork, our result complements studies of evolution in the early [...] late sequence, and pushes to later epochs the redshift at which the Hubble classification sequence is observed to be in place.
