40|$|Strangulation of {{the penis}} by {{application}} of constricting devices may present {{a challenge for}} the treating physician. Depending {{on the type of}} constricting material, special equipment is essential for successful removal of the foreign bodies. We report a new form of constricting device, the neck of a Coca Cola bottle made of Pentaethylene-terephthalate (PET). Particular difficulties were encountered upon removal. Technical details of this case are described. Prior literature on the treatment of penile strangulation is discussed. KEY WORDS: penis; strangulation; constriction; autoeroticism. CASE REPORT A 69 -year old man presented to the emergency room at 4 a. m. The man was drunk, wrapped in a blanket, and obviously suffering from pain in the genital area. Removal of the blanket disclosed a grossly swollen dark, red penis completely stuck inside a 1. 5 l Coca Cola PET bottle. The man had inserted his penis into the bottle for autoerotic purposes. The bottle neck was located directly at the penile base and penile swelling prevented even a turning of the bottle. Reluctantly, the patient reported insertion of his penis into the bottle more than 10 hr ago. His repeated at-tempts of removal of the bottle had remained unsuccessful. By use of a bolt cutter available in the emergency room, the bottle was incised below its neck. Attempts to position the cutter at the bottle neck were unsuccessful. As shown in Fig. 1, bottle necks of PET bottles are equipped with a wide collar and manufactured from particularly firm material. Since the <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> cutters open for a maximum width of only 1. 5 cm, cutting of a PET bottle neck is impossible. The idea of using a manually operate...|$|R

40|$|Department of Energy EngineeringThere {{are many}} kinds of {{one-dimensional}} (1 -D) nanomaterials such as nanofiber, nanoribbon, nanotube and nanowire. They have been widely studied over a decades because they are promising materials for applications in various optoelectronic devices such as organic photovoltaic cell, flexible sensor, phototransistor, organic light-emitting diode. Recently, on the other hand, 1 -D nanomaterials with unique structure morphologies have been developed and applied to optoelectronic devices that can exhibit unusual electrical characteristics, and these unconventional 1 -D nanomaterials were employed for fundamental study in organic electronics. In this work, 1 -D organic semiconductor nanomaterials with unconventional structures including branched nanowires have been developed and used for various optoelectronic devices. In addition, the fundamental charge transport mechanisms have been investigated. First, we synthesized branched wires by modifying the morphology of 1 -D nanowires from solution phase. The injection {{of different kinds of}} non-solvents, such as methanol, ortho-dichlorobenzene or a nanowire-dispersed solution, greatly affected the growth mechanism of nanowires during the π- π stacking of molecules and resulted in the formation <b>of</b> <b>branched</b> <b>wires.</b> Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated for the fundamental study on the charge transport <b>of</b> these <b>branched</b> nanowires. Electrical characterizations of over one hundred samples and investigation of activation energy by temperature analysis suggests that there is difference in the electron mobility <b>of</b> <b>branched</b> <b>wires</b> upon switching the source-drain direction. For second experiment, a highly photo-sensitive material (2 Z, 2 'Z) - 3, 3 '-(2, 5 -dimethoxy- 1, 4 -phenylene) bis(2 -(3, 5 -bis(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) acrylonitrile) (DM-R) and other three materials were synthesized with high purity. These materials were easily fabricated into nanowires by stacking π-π self-assembly in solution-phase. By using these nanowires, highly photo-sensitive field-effect transistor was fabricated and their photo-responsivity was measured in high-vacuum condition to compare with their thin film structure. For third experiment, nanoparticle-embedded magnetically-alignable nanowires were synthesized via the injection of iron oxide nanoparticle dispersed ethanol as a non-solvent in a hot BPE-PTCDI solution. The nanowire was aligned by external magnetic force due to the embedded magnetic nanoparticles inside the body of nanowire. For the application to the memory, the field-effect transistor device was fabricated and its memory characteristics were measured. ope...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} self-producing heat and {{external}} radiation on the insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> are studied experimentally in this paper. In the experiments of self-producing heat <b>of</b> <b>wire,</b> 6 types <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> are used under {{the situation of}} overloading. The {{results show that the}} effect of the temperature rise <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> on insulating property <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is remarkable. Under the situation of having electric current wired to produce heat by itself, the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> decreases and the leakage of electricity electric current enhances. Under the situation that electric current is relatively stable, the temperature becomes stable when rising to a certain value, conducting wire heat dissipating and fever heat are in an equilibrium state. In the experiments of external radiation, such as the situation of building fire, RV sheathed wires present a similar regulation to the self-producing heat experiments. The difference is that the effect of external factor (such as air flow, voltaic instability, etc.) on temperature <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> is more obvious than that on the insulation resistance <b>of</b> <b>wire.</b> When external factor makes the wire temperature decrease to a certain value, the insulation resistance value is higher than that out of the effect...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the reproducibility <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes to characterise residential power line configurations {{and to determine}} the extent to which wire codes provide a proxy measure of residential magnetic field strength in a case-control study of childhood leukaemia conducted in nine states within the United States. METHODS: Misclassification <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was assessed with independent measurements by two technicians for 187 residences. The association between categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and measured level of magnetic field was evaluated in 858 residences with both a wire code measurement and a 24 hour measurement of the magnetic field in the bedroom. The strength of the association between category <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia was examined in two regions with different average levels of magnetic field in homes with high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code. RESULTS: The reproducibility of any of three different classifications <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> codes was excellent (kappa > or = 0. 89). Mean and median magnetic fields, and the percentage of homes with high magnetic fields increased with increasing category for each <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes. The size of the odds ratios for risk of leukaemia and high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code did not reflect the mean levels of the magnetic field in those categories in two study regions. CONCLUSION: Misclassification <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code is not a major source of bias in the study. Wire codes provide a proxy measure of exposure to residential magnetic fields. If magnetic fields were a risk factor for leukaemia, however, there would be some attenuation of risk estimates based on <b>wire</b> codes because <b>of</b> misclassification of exposure to magnetic fields at both extremes <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code range. The lack of an association between high categories <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> code and risk of leukaemia cannot be explained by a failure <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> code classification schemes to estimate exposure to magnetic fields in the study area...|$|R
