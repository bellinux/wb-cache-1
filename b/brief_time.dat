Born {{at the time of the}} Great Depression, Adkins' early life was stricken by poverty. His parents were unable to provide him shoes until he was four or five years old. Some reports say he attended school for a very <b>brief</b> <b>time,</b> as few as two days of first grade.|$|E
5|$|Carrick has {{represented}} England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 {{and has since}} gained 34 caps but is yet to score an international goal. Carrick has often been overlooked during his England career, with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes, Gareth Barry and (for a <b>brief</b> <b>time)</b> Scott Parker preferred in his position. This was the case until the 2012–13 season, when Carrick {{established himself as a}} regular. He {{has been a member of}} the England squads for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.|$|E

5|$|During its <b>brief</b> <b>time</b> in operation, the Pony Express {{delivered}} approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California. Although the Pony Express {{proved that}} the central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors and Waddell {{did not get the}} contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.|$|E

5|$|Hancock {{rejoined the}} Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his <b>brief</b> <b>time</b> there was unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected Henry Laurens as its new president, {{which was a}} {{disappointment}} to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and missed his wife and newborn son. On July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the Articles of Confederation; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.|$|E
50|$|Founded in 1837, {{the club}} {{has spent most of}} its time in the 2nd {{division}} of the Lent and May Bumps, with <b>brief</b> <b>times</b> spent in the 1st division.

50|$|On a {{daylight}} mission, squadron visibility {{was the key}} to {{a successful}} mission - the reason for the large tail letters and individual aircraft numbers on fuselages. For some missions, it was imperative that the aircraft commander (AC) found his designated squadron and proceeded over the target at the <b>briefed</b> <b>time,</b> the <b>briefed</b> altitude, and hit his target. If he could not find his particular formation, he would join another group and bomb their target.|$|R

5|$|In 1980 the Notre Dame Island {{site was}} reopened (primarily for the Floralies) making both islands {{simultaneously}} accessible again, albeit {{only for a}} <b>brief</b> <b>time.</b> Minor thematic exhibitions were held at the Atlantic pavilion and Quebec pavilion at this period. After the 1981 season, the Saint Helen's Island site permanently closed, shutting out the majority of attractions. Man and His World was able to continue in a limited fashion with {{the small number of}} pavilions left standing on Notre Dame Island. However, the few remaining original exhibits closed permanently in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} of Santa María de Óvila were well-to-do farmers who cared little for the {{buildings}}. For a <b>brief</b> <b>time,</b> the former monastery {{was used as}} a hostel, but mainly, the buildings were subjected to hard agricultural use as barns sheltering livestock. The chapter house served as a manure pit. Other buildings were used as storage. In the early 20th century small trees were seen to be growing in the dirt packed atop the monastery roofs—the protective roof tiles had long since been taken down and sold.|$|E
5|$|The second Persian campaign, in 490 BC, {{was under}} the command of Datis and Artaphernes. The {{expedition}} headed first to the island Naxos, which it captured and burnt. It then island-hopped between the rest of the Cycladic Islands, annexing each into the Persian empire. Reaching Greece, the expedition landed at Eretria, which it besieged, and after a <b>brief</b> <b>time,</b> captured. Eretria was razed and its citizens enslaved. Finally, the task force headed to Attica, landing at Marathon, en route for Athens. There, it was met by a smaller Athenian army, which nevertheless proceeded to win a remarkable victory at the Battle of Marathon.|$|E

50|$|WWLP has {{traditionally}} been the most watched station in the Pioneer Valley according to Nielsen ratings. However, there have been <b>brief</b> <b>times</b> when WGGB was on top and extended periods {{in which the two}} outlets were basically neck-and-neck with WWLP having a slight edge. Originally, WGGB's newscasts were known as NewsWatch 40. The station cut back financially under Sinclair ownership, and during that period, rumors of cancelling ABC 40 News or converting to Sinclair's controversial, now-defunct centralcasting News Central format sometimes spread.|$|R
50|$|When the Mariella was {{delivered}} in 1985, {{she was the}} first ship on Viking Lines Helsinki-Stockholm service which was not owned by Rederi Ab Sally. She has remained on the same route ever since, except for a few <b>brief</b> <b>times</b> when she has been moved temporarily on to other Viking Line routes. This makes her the record holder for the longest continual service on the Helsinki-Stockholm route. At the time of her delivery, the Mariella was the largest ferry in {{the world in terms of}} gross tonnage, number of passengers and passenger berths.|$|R
