40|$|An {{experiment}} on virus free in vitro banana plantlets production by the meristem cultured from virus infected four month old banana suckers cv. Amritasagar {{were used as}} explants. Four levels of BAP (0, 3, 4 and 5 mg/l), 5 levels of NAA (0. 0, 1. 0, 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 mg/l) were used as treatment for shoot proliferation in experiment-I and Four levels of IBA (0, 1, 2 and 3 mg/l), 4 levels of NAA (0, 2, 3 and 4 mg/l) were used for root formation in experiment-II. ELISA test was conducted for the confirmation of virus eradication rate of regenerated plants and survival rate of regenerated plants in experiment-III. A significant variation was found among the treatments. Studies on the different concentrations of BAP + NAA on shoot proliferation and differentiation, reveals that 4 mg/l BAP + 1. 5 mg/l NAA produced the greater number of shoots (4. 58 /explant), the longest shoot (3. 56 cm) and the highest numbers of leaves 3. 11 /explant). On the contrary, plantlets were cultured on half strength of MS media in different levels of IBA and NAA. The highest number of vigorous roots (6. 98 /explant) and maximum root length (5 cm) were recorded from the treatment combination 2 mg/l IBA+ 2 mg/l NAA and 3 mg/l IBA+ 3 mg/l NAA, respectively. While less vigorous root was found in control treatments. The rate of virus free plant regeneration from banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) infected plants was 57. 14 % and from <b>banana</b> <b>mosaic</b> virus (BMV) infected sources was 64. 28 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{find the}} yield loss due to BBrMV in cv. Nendran (AAB), fixed field plot {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Tiruchirapalli District of Tamil Nadu during 1997 - 1999. BBrMV infected plants and symptom free healthy plants were randomly selected and tagged for recording the observations. The average yield reduction due to BBrMV was 30 per cent. The reduction in bunch weight over healthy plants was 32. 7, 53. 69, 30. 61 and 28. 84 per cent in four different fields and the variations in bunch weights of infected and healthy plants were highly significant. The yield loss varied between orchards. The yield differences between healthy and infected plants were more in fertile soil than in saline sodic, low fertile soil and from the infected plants malformed bunches of less weight, underdeveloped fingers emerged, making them not marketable.

40|$|<b>Banana</b> mild <b>mosaic</b> virus (BanMMV) is a {{previously}} undescribed filamentous virus infecting Musa spp. The complete genome has been sequenced from PCR clones {{and consists of}} 7352 nucleotides, encoding five open reading frames (ORFs) of 205, 25. 5, 12. 4, 8. 0 and 26. 8 kDa, respectively.

40|$|The viruses {{naturally}} infecting banana include Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV), Cucumber <b>mosaic</b> virus (CMV), <b>Banana</b> bract <b>mosaic</b> virus (BBrMV), <b>Banana</b> mild <b>mosaic</b> virus (BanMMV), <b>Banana</b> virus X (BVX) and {{the banana}} streak viruses (BSVs). BBTV is still {{regarded as the}} most damaging of the viruses and continues to expand in geographic distribution. The epidemiology of BBTV is very simple, and in Australia it has been effectively controlled and even eradicated from some regions {{through a combination of}} roguing, clean planting material schemes and domestic quarantine. BSVs impact on production directly by reducing yield, but also indirectly because of the problems they cause to Musa breeding programmes. Estimates of yield loss from BSVs vary widely but the factors contributing to this variation are largely unknown. All progenitors of the domesticated banana have integrated badnavirus DNA. However, only integrants associated with the B genome in hybrid genetic backgrounds are known to initiate infection. An outstanding question is why the rate of activation of BSV integrants in some hybrids, such as 2 ̆ 7 Goldfinger 2 ̆ 7 (syn. 2 ̆ 7 FHIA- 012 ̆ 7, AAAB genome), is low whilst it is high in other cultivars. Two recently discovered viruses, BVX and BanMMV, were discovered in the course of other virus research. There is indirect evidence that BanMMV is transmitted between plants in the field but, as yet, attempts to find a vector have been unsuccessful. Genetic engineering for virus resistance remains a promising technology, although probably more than a decade away from implementation because of regulatory problems and issues of public acceptance...|$|R
40|$|Using biochemical, serological, and cytopathological evidence, we have {{confirmed}} that <b>banana</b> bract <b>mosaic</b> virus (BBrMV) is a distinct {{member of the family}} Potyviridae. Virions of a Philippine isolate of BBrMV were purified from field-infected banana cv. Cardaba. Particles were approximately 725 -nm long, banded at a density equivalent to 1. 29 to 1. 31 g/ml in cesium chloride equilibrium gradients, and had an A(260 / 280) of 1. 17. Yields of about 4 mg/kg were obtained from fresh or frozen leaf midrib or lamina tissue. Three major protein species with sizes of 31, 37, and 39 kDa were resolved from dissociated virions, and all reacted specifically with polyclonal antibodies to BBrMV. Infected leaf cells contained typical pinwheel inclusions. Virus-specific cDNA was amplifiedfrom field samples by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay using potyvirus degenerate primers. In plate-trapped antigan-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), weak serological relationships were demonstrated between BBrMV {{and other members of the}} family Potyviridae, including abaca mosaic (AbaMV), desheen mosaic, maize dwarf mosaic, sorghum mosaic, sugarcane mosaic, and wheat streak mosaic viruses. Despite similarities in the symptoms caused by the two viruses, AbaMV was serologically distinct from BBrMV and reacted only weakly, or not at all, with BBrMV antibodies in double-antibody sandwich (DAS) -ELISA. No cross reactions were observed when RT-PCR products from the two viruses were examined by Southern blot hybridization using BBrMV- and AbaMV-specific digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes.

40|$|A multiplex, immunocapture PCR (M-IC-PCR) was {{developed}} for the simultaneous detection of three viruses from crude sap extracts of banana and plantain (Musa spp.). A reverse transcription step was required for <b>Banana</b> bract <b>mosaic</b> virus and Cucumber mosaic virus, which have ssRNA genomes. The detection of Banana bunchy top virus (ssDNA genome) was not adversely affected by inclusion in this step. All the three viruses could be detected simultaneously from a mixed infection. Identification and detection of individual viruses was achieved through the visualisation of discretely sized PCR amplicons by gel electrophoresis. Alternatively, a colourimetric microplate detection system utilising digoxigenin-labelled virus-specific probes was used. The latter assay was up to five times more sensitive than detection by gel electrophoresis and between 25 and 625 times more sensitive than ELISA for the various viruses.

40|$|A {{total of}} 154 partial {{nucleotide}} sequences within the <b>Banana</b> mild <b>mosaic</b> virus (BanMMV) ORF 1, which encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), {{was obtained from}} 68 distinct infected banana accessions originating from various locations worldwide. The 310 nt sequences displayed {{a high level of}} variability with a mean pairwise nucleotide sequence divergence level of 20 ? 4 %. This situation resulted essentially from a high rate of synonymous mutations. A similar analysis was performed for a limited selection of 10 banana accessions (30 sequences) on the region comprising approximately the last 310 nt of the BanMMV genome. This region corresponds to the 39 end of ORF 5, which encodes the coat protein (234 nt), and to the 39 non-coding region. This analysis confirmed the high level of diversity observed in the RdRp dataset, characterized by a high level of synonymous mutations. Analysis of intra-host diversity indicated the existence of two distinct situations, with some plants containing only closely related sequence variants, whereas others contained widely divergent isolates. Analyses indicated that BanMMV genetic diversity is not structured by the geographical origin of the infected Musa accessions or by their genotype. This situation may be, in part, explained by the exchange of banana germplasm between {{different parts of the world}} and also by plant-to-plant transfer of virus isolates, the evidence for which is, for the first time, provided by this study...|$|R
40|$|The Bioversity International Transit Center (ITC) for banana hosts {{more than}} 1500 accessions largely {{covering}} the genetic {{diversity of the}} genus Musa. Its objective is to conserve this genetic diversity and to supply plant materials to users worldwide. All the Musa accessions must be tested for virus presence and, if infected, virus elimination must be attempted, to enable the supply of virus-free plant material. An international collaborative effort launched {{under the auspices of}} Bioversity International (2007 – 2013) finally led to the implementation of a two-step process to test the accessions. The first step, called pre-indexing, involved only molecular tests and was designed as a pre-screen of new germplasm lines or existing accessions to reduce the need for post-entry virus therapy and repeated virus indexing. The second step, called full indexing, was performed on either older existing accessions or newer accessions which tested negative during pre-indexing, and involved molecular tests, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and symptom observation. In total, 270 germplasm lines (434 samples) were pre-indexed; while full indexing was carried out on 243 accessions (68 of which had been pre-indexed). A significant proportion of the samples tested during pre-indexing was infected with at least one virus (68 %), showing the utility of this early pre-screening step. Banana streak OL virus and <b>Banana</b> mild <b>mosaic</b> virus were the most commonly detected viruses during both pre- and full indexing.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the full[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on <b>Banana</b> bract <b>mosaic</b> virus (BBrMV) with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. <b>Banana</b> bract <b>mosaic</b> virus (BBrMV) is a recently characterised virus of the genus Potyvirus family Potyviridae (Thomas et al., 1997), which infects banana and plantain. It is an aphid transmissible virus and can cause serious losses due to yield reduction and malformation of fruits. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles and terminology of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). The review evaluated the accuracy and relevance of data, the information provided for pest risk assessment purposes, {{the quality and quantity of}} data considered, and the quality of methods applied to conduct the risk assessment. Following analysis of the French document and from additional information sought, the Panel established that BBrMV is a well-characterised virus, for which reliable assays, mainly based on PCR, are currently available for identification. All four aphid species, known to have the ability to transmit BBrMV, are present in the French overseas departments, providing conditions suitable for its further spread after entry. Taking into considerations these elements the Panel concludes that:· The most important potential pathway of entry for BBrMV into the French overseas departments is through the import of infected banana propagating materials (vitroplants, suckers). Minor pathways include the introduction of infected cultivars by private individuals and the import of banana fruits and leaves. · The current French regulations provide the means to ensure that the probability of entry of BBrMV is extremely low. In the absence of those regulations, the probability of entry would be higher, and has been considered by the Panel as low/medium. Although propagation material represents the main entry pathway, BBrMV is noted as currently restricted in distribution to a small number of countries in Asia and the Pacific. · There is a high probability of establishment of BBrMV in the PRA area[4]. As plant propagation material represents the main pathway for introduction, the establishment of the virus, after planting of infected material, is assured. · There is a potential for negative economic and social consequences should BBrMV be introduced, in particular concerning Guadeloupe and Martinique where banana crops form a major part of the agricultural economy. The Panel recognises that there are some areas of uncertainty, concerning the biology of BBrMV, such as symptom expression and host range. However, these uncertainties are considered unlikely to affect the conclusions reached by the Panel. The overall conclusion of the Panel is that BBrMV poses a risk to the banana crops of the four overseas departments and thus qualifies for risk management measures. BBrMV is therefore considered potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms under Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R

40|$|<b>Banana</b> bract <b>mosaic</b> virus (BBrMV), {{a member}} of the genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae, is the causal agent of bract mosaic disease. The {{disorder}} has been considered a serious constraint to banana and plantain production in India and the Philippines, where the virus was first identified (3). To date, the presence of BBrMV has been reported only in a few banana-growing countries in Asia (3). In the Americas, BBrMV has been detected by ELISA tests in Colombia only (1). The efficient spread of BBrMV through aphids and vegetative material increases the quarantine risk and requires strict measures to prevent entrance of the virus to new areas. In Ecuador—the world's number one banana exporter—the banana industry represents the main agricultural income source. Thus, early detection of banana pathogens is a priority. In June of 2012, mosaic symptoms in bracts and bunch distortion of ‘Cavendish’ banana were observed in a commercial field in the province of Guayas, Ecuador. Leaves from 35 symptomatic plants were tested for Cucumber <b>mosaic</b> virus (CMV), <b>Banana</b> streak virus (BSV), and BBrMV using double antibody sandwich ELISA kits from Adgen (Scotland, UK). Twenty-one plants tested positive for BBrMV but not for CMV or BSV. In order to confirm the ELISA results, fresh or lyophilized leaf extracts were used for immunocapture reverse transcription (IC-RT) -PCR. In addition, total RNA was extracted from the ELISA-positive samples and subjected to RT-PCR. The RT reactions were done using both random and oligo dT primers. Several sets of primers, flanking conserved regions of the virus coat protein (CP), have been used for PCR-detection of BBrMV (2, 3, 4). The Ecuadorian BBrMV isolate was successfully detected by three primer sets with reported amplification products of 324, 280, and 260 nucleotides long, respectively (3, 4). Amplification products of the expected size were purified and sequenced. All the nucleotide sequences obtained from 20 PCR-positive symptomatic plants were 100 % identical between each other. However, 99 % identity was observed when PCR products from the Ecuadorian isolate were compared with the corresponding fragment of a BBrMV isolate from the Philippines (NCBI Accession No. DQ 851496. 1). PCR products of the Ecuadorian isolate, amplified by the different CP primers described above, were assembled into a 408 -bp fragment and deposited in the NCBI GenBank (KC 247746). Further testing confirmed the presence of BBrMV in symptomatic plants from four different provinces. To our knowledge, this is the first report of BBrMV in Ecuador and the first BBrMV partial nucleotide sequence reported from the Americas. It is worth mentioning that primer set Bract 1 /Bract 2, which amplifies a 604 -bp product (2), was not effective in detecting the Ecuadorian isolate. It is hypothesized that nucleotide variation at the reverse primer site is the cause of the lack of amplification with this primer set, since the forward primer is part of the sequenced product and no variation was found. Sequencing of the entire CP region is underway to conduct phylogenetic analysis and determine genetic relationships across several other BBrMV isolates.
