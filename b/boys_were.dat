5|$|A {{school day}} at the orphanage would start at 6:00a.m. with many morning chores to be completed, predominately cleaning. A mass would be held at 7:15a.m., and breakfast would follow. Boys at the orphanage would then go to school. All boys over 14 were given a {{religious}} education at the Brother's Cathedral School, whereas the younger boys attended the infants' school at the Convent. All <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> also trained in technical education. Before leaving, the orphanage trained the boys in all classes of agriculture. This was so the <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> well educated and had the knowledge to become sufficient farmers {{when they left the}} orphanage.|$|E
5|$|After {{repairs to}} the college were {{completed}} in mid-1656, the first admissions were made. The first headmaster, Richard Dutton, was appointed in 1655, and in 1665 the institution became an incorporated charity. The number of pupils grew, with admissions rising to 100 by the 1870s. <b>Boys</b> <b>were</b> admitted based on the parish they lived in, and on need, health and background of the family. Illegitimate <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> not admitted, and all boys {{had to be able}} to read to a certain standard that meant they were not hard to teach. In 1878, a new schoolroom designed by architect Alfred Waterhouse (who designed Manchester Town Hall) was built in a Tudor style. The number of boys admitted was reduced to 75 in 1908 to save money, though three years later admissions increased again to 99. In 1916, no <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> admitted due to lack of funding caused by World War I, and in 1918 the number was limited to 70. Successful public appeals resulted in the numbers rising to 97 in 1929. In 1926 a scheme was set up which allowed boys to apply for scholarships to join a grammar school, which meant that while they lived at Chetham's, they were educated elsewhere during the day. Further, they would stay at grammar school until at least the age of 16 and sometimes 18.|$|E

5|$|During the negotiations, the {{relatives}} {{of several of the}} West Side <b>Boys</b> <b>were</b> brought to the gang's camp to ask them to release the British soldiers. The gang responded that they had nothing against the soldiers, but that holding them had brought attention to their demands—which now included immunity from prosecution, safe passage to the UK to take up university courses, and guaranteed acceptance to the re-formed Sierra Leone Army.|$|E

5|$|In 1832 the Gibraltar Public School, a free English-language {{establishment}} {{for poor}} children, {{was set up}} in a government-owned building on Flat Bastion Road. Funded by the contributions of wealthy people in the colony, it was open to children of all faiths. By 1833, there were 181 boys and 99 girls at the school. After <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> excluded in 1897, it continued as a school for girls into the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{stories from}} the 13th century, tengu began to abduct young boys {{as well as the}} priests they had always targeted.

All of the tengu's victims, however, would come back in a state of near death or madness, {{sometimes}} after having been tricked into eating animal dung.|$|E
5|$|Janet Burnett Grossman {{writes that}} girls {{appear to be}} commemorated about as {{frequently}} as boys on surviving Attic gravestones, although previous scholars suggested that <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> commemorated up to twice as often. If they survived, Athenian children were named in a ceremony (the dekate) ten days after birth. Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth (at five, seven, and forty days after birth) were also observed. Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls.|$|E

His brother Norman also played cricket, representing Yorkshire and Warwickshire. The Kilners attended Wombwell Parish Church and the <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> members of the Church Lads' Brigade. His father and his uncle, Irving Washington, the former Yorkshire player, encouraged him to play cricket from an early age. He showed enough ability to join the local colliery team, Mitchell Main.|$|E

On 7 February 1877, as L'Estrange neared {{the end of his}} wire act, sparks from the fireworks going off around him fell into the nearby store of gunpowder and fireworks, igniting them. The store's shed was demolished, a surrounding fence knocked down, part of L'Estrange's performance tent caught fire, and two young <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> injured.|$|E
5|$|Like Caroline herself (who {{was created}} Baroness Vaughan upon {{the birth of}} their first son), the two <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> granted {{courtesy}} titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary. Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, their two sons were still deemed illegitimate. Upon each of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made. Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne. Had Leopold married in a legal civil ceremony, the boy could have indeed inherited the throne, because all classes were equal under the Belgian constitution, and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic. In 1910, the two <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> adopted by Antoine Durrieux, whom Caroline married soon after Leopold's death.|$|E

5|$|Passing over Okinawa with {{a central}} {{pressure}} of 910mbar (hPa; 26.87inHg), Bolaven {{became one of the}} most intense typhoons to ever strike the region. Off the coast of Wakayama Prefecture, swells from the typhoon battered fishing vessels and knocked the captain of one ship overboard. Although a rescue helicopter was quick to reach him, he was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Just off the coast of Jogashima Misaki-cho in Miura, Kanagawa, two <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> swept away by large swells. A mother attempted to swim after them to save them but later drowned. The two <b>boys</b> <b>were</b> later rescued with minor injuries by the Coast Guard. Although the storm did not strike the Japanese mainland, its outer bands brought showers and thunderstorms to parts of Kyushu. Due to the rains, rail service in Saga Prefecture was temporarily suspended, affecting 4,200 passengers. In Isahaya, one person was injured after being struck by a billboard downed by high winds. Throughout Japan, losses to agriculture and fisheries amounted to ¥423.28million (US$5.39million).|$|E

50|$|The male {{phenomenon}} {{refers to}} the fact that a large majority of juvenile delinquents <b>are</b> men, or <b>boys.</b> In the United States, <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> five times more likely than girls to become juvenile delinquents. Moreover, there are many suggested explanations as to why it <b>is</b> that <b>boys</b> commit more crimes than girls. One comes from theorists who believe men and <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> naturally more aggressive than women and girls. Another theory communicates the idea that men and boys commit more crimes because of societal pressures to be masculine and aggressive. A third theory suggests that the manner in which <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> treated by their families calls for more criminal action. The crime rates vary across boys of different races. They are mentioned in the 'juvenile delinquency statistics' section above, {{as well as in the}} 'cradle to prison pipeline' section below, but to review, African-American <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> more likely to become juvenile delinquents than White and Latino <b>boys.</b> Latino <b>boys</b> <b>are</b> more likely to become juvenile delinquents than White <b>boys</b> <b>are.</b> One clear way to explain this difference in crime rates among different races of <b>boys</b> <b>is</b> by looking at their poverty rates.|$|R
5|$|Studies of {{children}} who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received.
