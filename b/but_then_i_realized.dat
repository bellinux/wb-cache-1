There are two men who are capable of holding the job quite adequately. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> how little <b>I</b> know of their real characters.

In other words, a man who in ordinary circumstances had never been conscious of any desire to visit the more distant portions of South America might feel the urge, so to speak, shortly after he became a treasurer. That is my difficulty. Of course, one always takes a sporting chance with any treasurer; but how am I to find out which of these two men would give me the more reasonable opportunity of keeping some of my money?" ...|$|R

[...] One of these was Dorice Donegan [...] "Dee-Dee" [...] Moore, who launched a business with Shakespeare, Abraham Shakespeare LLC, giving herself control of the firm's funds. Moore subsequently withdrew $1 million and bought herself a Hummer, a Chevrolet Corvette and a truck before going on vacation. She later claimed that the money was a gift from Shakespeare.|$|E

5000|$|Toms has {{received}} {{criticism from the}} international development community [...] who have stated that Toms' model is designed to make consumers feel good rather than addressing {{the underlying causes of}} poverty. Criticisms have also included whether or not the shoe donation is as effective as a monetary donation to other charities. Mycoskie responded to these criticisms in November 2013, saying [...] "If you really are serious about poverty alleviation, our critics said, then you need to create jobs.

5000|$|In a 1970 {{interview}} Handke {{said that}} the idea behind his plays was [...] "making people aware {{of the world of}} the theatre--not of the outside world." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} specifically in the case of Offending the Audience, his [...] "point was to use words to encircle the audience so they'd want to free themselves by heckling; they might feel naked and get involved." [...] He further goes on to explain his intentions:The idea was to have the spectators in the orchestra thrown back upon themselves. What mattered to me was making them feel like going to the theatre more, making them see all plays more consciously and with a different consciousness. My theatrical plan is to have the audience always look upon my play as a means of testing other plays. I first intended to write an essay, a pamphlet, against the theatre, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that a paperback isn't an effective way to publish an anti-theatre statement. And so the outcome was, paradoxically, doing something onstage against the stage, using the theatre to protest against the theatre of the moment--I don't mean theatre as such, the Absolute, I mean theatre as a historical phenomenon, as it is to this day.|$|E
5000|$|In August 2015 Boyd Tinsley {{brought the}} members of Crystal Garden {{together}} for the first time to [...] "Do some creative session work". For two years Tinsley had looked all over North America for a specific group of musicians who would form his vision of an organic, modern day rock band. On the forming of the band, Tinsley commented [...] "The band was an idea I had maybe three years ago. I really wanted to create a young rock band - not a pop band - but a real rock band that had the same sensibility that rock from the 1960s and 1970s had to it. You know, something rocking from the heart and expressing something real. The question became: where am I going to find these guys?

I have to be able to vibe off those people and know those people when I see them." [...] In their first week of recording sessions at Boyd's Studio in Virginia they tracked the bulk of their first studio album Let The Rocks Cry Out, which Tinsley Produced. The album was released digitally on all platforms March 14, 2017 and physically on April 22, 2017.|$|E

It helps if they are engaged and complete the semester. A common frustration for many of us is having a full class that first day—and possibly turning away students interested in adding your class—only to have empty seats later in the term. So how do we keep the students who attend class on day one engaged throughout the semester? One key component is to have a successful beginning in {{each and every one of}} your classes. We’ve all heard stories and maybe even have personal experience with bad beginnings. This past spring, I was at a professional development workshop on my campus about learning communities. The facilitator spent time discussing classroom activities for the first day of class, activities designed to increase the sense of community and to engage your students from day one.

I didn’t think I was one. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> the computer monitor was my bushes. ” The above-referenced quote was made by serial child predator Jake Matthew Clawson in regards to his recognition of his online obsession. It was referenced as {{a demonstration of the}} common misconception many of us have regarding the tactics used by child pedophiles to stalk children. The stereotype of the dirty old man hanging out at the school playground in a dingy van waiting and watching for unsuspecting little girls and boys is being replaced by a different type of predator. This is the predator that hides behind false identities and personalities in chat room, instant messages or emails to gain the trust of the same unsuspecting, but now computer-savvy children. The book “Sexual Predators: How to Recognize Them on the Internet and on the Street – How to Keep Your Kids Away,” written by Stephen Dean, is the latest book that provides a wealth of information on these new types of predators and the tactics that they use on the technologically confident youth...|$|E

Hoxton cures that. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that for eighteen hundred years the Church Militant had not been a pageant, but a riot--and a suppressed riot. There, still living patiently in Hoxton, were the people to whom the tremendous promises had been made. In the face of that I had to become a revolutionary if I was to continue to be religious. In Hoxton one cannot be a conservative without being also an atheist-- and a pessimist. Nobody but the devil could want to conserve Hoxton.|$|R
