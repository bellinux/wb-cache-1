40|$|Congenital hepatic {{fibrosis}} (CHF) is an {{autosomal recessive}} inherited malformation defined pathologically by a variable degree of periportal fibrosis and irregularly shaped proliferating bile ducts. It {{is one of}} the fibropolycystic diseases, which also include Caroli disease, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. Clinically it is characterized by hepatic fibrosis, portal hypertension, and renal cystic disease. CHF is known to occur in association with a range of both inherited and non-inherited disorders, with multiorgan involvement, as a result of ductal plate malformation. Because of the similarities in the clinical picture, it is necessary to differentiate CHF from idiopathic portal hypertension and early liver cirrhosis, for which a liver biopsy is essential. Radiological tests are important for recognizing involvement of other organ systems. With regards to our experience at Hacettepe University, a total of 26 patients have been diagnosed and followed-up between 1974 and 2009 with a diagnosis of CHF. Presentation with Caroli syndrome was the most common diagnosis, with all such patients presenting with symptoms of recurrent cholangitis and symptoms related to portal hypertension. Although portal fibrosis is known to contribute to the ensuing portal hypertension, it is our belief that portal vein cavernous transformation also {{plays an important role in}} its pathogenesis. In all patients with CHF portal vein morphology should be evaluated by all means since portal vein involvement results in more severe and complicated portal hypertension.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that genetic factors {{play a role in}} the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Identification of the genes involved in the development of this neurologic disorder in animal models may elucidate factors responsible for the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in hydrocephalic humans. The authors report here a brief summary of findings from 12 lines of genetically engineered mice that presented with autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus. This study illustrates the value of knockout mice in identifying genetic factors involved in the development of congenital hydrocephalus. Findings suggest that dysfunctional motile cilia represent the underlying pathogenetic mechanism in 8 of the 12 lines (Ulk 4, Nme 5, Nme 7, Kif 27, Stk 36, Dpcd, Ak 7, and Ak 8). The likely underlying cause in the remaining 4 lines (RIKEN 4930444 A 02, Celsr 2, Mboat 7, and transgenic FZD 3) was not determined, but it is possible that some of these could also have ciliary defects. For example, the cerebellar malformations observed in RIKEN 4930444 A 02 knockout mice show similarities to a number of developmental disorders, such as Joubert, Meckel-Gruber, and <b>Bardet-Biedl</b> <b>syndromes,</b> which involve mutations in cilia-related genes. Even though the direct relevance of mouse models to hydrocephalus in humans remains uncertain, the high pre-valence of familial patterns of inheritance for congenital hydrocephalus in humans suggests that identification of genes responsible for development of hydrocephalus in mice may lead to the identification of homologous modifier genes and susceptibility alleles in humans. Also, characterization of mouse models can enhance understanding of important cell signaling and developmental pathways involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background PDZ domains mediate protein-protein {{interactions}} {{involved in}} important biological processes through {{the recognition of}} short linear motifs in their target proteins. Two recent independent studies have used protein microarray or phage display technology to detect PDZ domain interactions with peptide ligands on a large scale. Several computational predictors of PDZ domain interactions have been developed, however they are trained using only protein microarray data and focus on limited subsets of PDZ domains. An accurate predictor of genomic PDZ domain interactions would allow the proteomes of organisms to be scanned for potential binders. Such an application would require an accurate and precise predictor to avoid generating too many false positive hits given {{the large amount of}} possible interactors in a given proteome. Once validated these predictions will help to increase the coverage of current PDZ domain interaction networks and further our understanding of the roles that PDZ domains play in a variety of biological processes. Results We developed a PDZ domain interaction predictor using a support vector machine (SVM) trained with both protein microarray and phage display data. In order to use the phage display data for training, which only contains positive interactions, we developed a method to generate artificial negative interactions. Using cross-validation and a series of independent tests, we showed that our SVM successfully predicts interactions in different organisms. We then used the SVM to scan the proteomes of human, worm and fly to predict binders for several PDZ domains. Predictions were validated using known genomic interactions and published protein microarray experiments. Based on our results, new protein interactions potentially associated with Usher and <b>Bardet-Biedl</b> <b>syndromes</b> were predicted. A comparison of performance measures (F 1 measure and FPR) for the SVM and published predictors demonstrated our SVM's improved accuracy and precision at proteome scanning. Conclusions We built an SVM using mouse and human experimental training data to predict PDZ domain interactions. We showed that it correctly predicts known interactions from proteomes of different organisms and is more accurate and precise at proteome scanning compared with published state-of-the-art predictors. </p...|$|R

Polycystic {{kidney disease}} (PKD) is com-mon and its characterization has {{paved the way}} for the iden-tification of a growing number of cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) of which most show cystic kidneys. While the recessive form of PKD (ARPKD) virtually always presents in childhood, early onset can, in some instances, also occur in the dominant form (ADPKD). Both ADPKD genes (PKD 1 and PKD 2) can also be inherited in a recessive way, making the story more complex with evidence for a dosage-sensitive network. Several phenocopies are known, and mutations in HNF 1 ß or genes that typically cause other ciliopathies, such as nephronophthisis, <b>Bardet–Biedl,</b> Joubert <b>syndrome</b> and related disorders, can mimic PKD. An accurate genetic diag-nosis is crucial for genetic counseling, prenatal diagnostics, and the clinical management of patients and their families. The increasing number of genes that have to be considered in patients with cystic kidney disease is challenging to address by conventional techniques and largely benefits from next-generation sequencing-based approaches. The parallel analy-sis of targeted genes considerably increases the detection rate, allows for better interpretation of identified variants, and avoids genetic misdiagnoses...|$|R

Consequently, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are among the most promising approaches to identify mutations in RD. So far, NGS is not routinely used in gene diagnostics. We developed a diagnostic NGS pipeline to identify mutations in 170 genetically and clinically unselected RD patients. NGS was applied to 105 RD-associated genes.

40|$|Ciliopathies {{are caused}} by {{mutations}} in genes encoding proteins required for cilia organization or function. We show through colocalization with PCM- 1, that OFD 1 (the product of the gene mutated in oral-facial-digital syndrome 1) as well as BBS 4 and CEP 290 (proteins encoded by other ciliopathy genes) are primarily components of centriolar satellites, the particles surrounding centrosomes and basal bodies. RNA interference experiments reveal that satellite integrity is mutually dependent upon each of these proteins. Upon satellite dispersal, through mitosis or forced microtubule depolymerization, OFD 1 and CEP 290 remain centrosomal, whereas BBS 4 and PCM- 1 do not. OFD 1 interacts via its fifth coiled-coil motif with the N-terminal coiled-coil domain of PCM- 1, which itself interacts via its C-terminal non-coiled-coil region with BBS 4. OFD 1 localization to satellites requires its N-terminal region, encompassing the LisH motif, whereas expression of OFD 1 C-terminal constructs causes PCM- 1 and CEP 290 mislocalization. Moreover, in embryonic zebrafish, OFD 1 and BBS 4 functionally synergize, determining morphogenesis. Our observation that satellites are assembly points for several mutually dependent ciliopathy proteins provides a further possible explanation {{as to why the}} clinical spectrum of OFD 1, <b>Bardet-Biedl</b> and Joubert <b>syndromes</b> overlap.

In young patients, diagnosis is difficult, because several of the characteristic features may not be present until school age or later years and the intermittent neutropenia is not always detectable. Design: This was a prospective study using whole exome sequencing in syndromic retinal dystrophy. It was undertaken in a hospital and research institute setting. Participants: Participants {{in this study were}} members of a consanguineous Australian family of Lebanese ethnicity with two siblings with retinal dystrophy, microcephaly and developmental delay. Methods: Detailed clinical evaluation was undertaken. Whole exome capture and sequencing of patient genomic DNA samples was followed by sequence alignment, variant detection, comparison and prioritization. Main Outcome Measures: Pathogenic variant identification in the disease-causing gene in affected individuals. Results: We identified a novel homozygous deletion leading to a frameshift mutation in VPS 13 B, c. 11327 del, p. (Asn 3776 Thrfs* 102), the disease gene associated with Cohen syndrome. Conclusions: This report emphasizes the value of a broad-based whole exome sequencing approach in disease gene identification in the syndromic retinal dystrophies, where all disease characteristics may not be present in young patients to allow a clinical diagnosis.

40|$|AbstractCerebellar {{granule cell}} {{precursors}} (GCPs), which {{give rise to}} the most abundant neuronal type in the mammalian brain, arise from a restricted pool of primary progenitors in the rhombic lip (RL). Sonic hedgehog (Shh) secreted by developing Purkinje cells {{is essential for the}} expansion of GCPs and for cerebellar morphogenesis. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} primary cilium concentrates components of Shh signaling and that this structure is required for Shh signaling. GCPs have a primary cilium on their surface [Del Cerro, M. P., Snider, R. S. (1972). Studies on the developing cerebellum. II. The ultrastructure of the external granular layer. J Comp Neurol 144, 131 - 64. ]. Here, we show that 1) this cilium can be conditionally ablated by crossing Kif 3 afl/− mice with hGFAP-Cre mice, 2) removal of Kif 3 a from GCPs disrupts cerebellar development, and 3) these defects are due to a drastic reduction in Shh-dependent expansion of GCPs. A similar phenotype is observed when Smoothened (Smo), an essential transducer of Shh signaling, is removed from the same population of GCPs. Interestingly, Kif 3 a-Smo double conditional mutants show that Kif 3 a is epistatic to Smo. This work shows that Kif 3 a is essential for Shh-dependent expansion of cerebellar progenitors. Dysfunctional cilia are associated with diverse human disorders including <b>Bardet–Biedl</b> and Joubert <b>syndromes.</b> Cerebellar abnormalities observed in these patients could be explained by defects in Shh-induced GCP expansion...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{from many}} sources {{suggests}} that similar phenotypes are begotten by functionally related genes. This is most obvious {{in the case of}} genetically heterogeneous diseases such as Fanconi anemia, <b>Bardet-Biedl</b> or Usher <b>syndrome,</b> where the various genes work together in a single biological module. Such modules can be a multiprotein complex, a pathway, or a single cellular or subcellular organelle. This observation suggests a number of hypotheses about the human phenome that are now beginning to be explored. First, there is now good evidence from bioinformatic analyses that human genetic diseases can be clustered {{on the basis of their}} phenotypic similarities and that such a clustering represents true biological relationships of the genes involved. Second, one may use such phenotypic similarity to predict and then test for the contribution of apparently unrelated genes to the same functional module. This concept is now being systematically tested for several diseases. Most recently, a systematic yeast two-hybrid screen of all known genes for inherited ataxias indicated that they all form part of a single extended protein-protein interaction network. Third, one can use bioinformatics to make predictions about new genes for diseases that form part of the same phenotype cluster. This is done by starting from the known disease genes and then searching for genes that share one or more functional attributes such as gene expression pattern, coevolution, or gene ontology. Ultimately, one may expect that a modular view of disease genes should help the rapid identification of additional disease genes for multifactorial diseases once the first few contributing genes (or environmental factors) have been reliably identified...|$|R

40|$|Atrioventricular canal defect (AVCD) is {{a common}} {{congenital}} heart defect (CHD), representing 7. 4 % of all cardiac malformations, considered secondary to an extracellular matrix anomaly. The AVCD is associated with extracardiac defects in about 75 % of the cases. In this review we analyzed different syndromic AVCDs, in particular those associated with polydactyly disorders, which show remarkable genotype-phenotype correlations. Chromo - some imbalances more frequently associated with AVCD include Down syndrome, deletion 8 p 23 and deletion 3 p 25, while mendelian disorders include Noonan syndrome and related RASopathies, several polydactyly syndromes, CHARGE and 3 C (cranio-cerebello-cardiac) syndrome. The complete form of AVCD is prevalent in patients with chromosomal imbalances. Additional cardiac defects are found in patients affected by chromosomal imbalances different from Down syndrome. Left-sided obstructive lesions are prevalently found in patients with RASopathies. Patients with deletion 8 p 23 often display AVCD with tetralogy of Fallot or with pulmonary valve stenosis. Tetralogy of Fallot is the only additional cardiac defect found in patients with Down syndrome and AVCD. On the other hand, the association of AVCD and tetralogy of Fallot is also quite characteristic of CHARGE and 3 C syndromes. Heterotaxia defects, including common atrium and anomalous pulmonary venous return, occur in patients with AVCD associated with polydactyly syndromes (Ellis-van Creveld, short rib polydactyly, oral-facial-digital, <b>Bardet-Biedl,</b> and Smith-Lemli-Opitz <b>syndromes).</b> The initial clinical evidence of anatomic similarities between AVCD and heterotaxia in polydactyly syndromes was corroborated and explained by experimental studies in transgenic mice.

Proteins from RP-associated genes {{are involved in a}} wide variety of cellular processes, including phototransduction, photoreceptor outer segment structure, splicing, transcriptional regulation, and intraflagellar trans-port, to name a few [4, 5]. Mutations in the SNRNP 200 gene located on chromo-some 2 q 11. 2 were initially identified in 2009 as a cause of the RP 33 form of adRP [6]. SNRNP 200 encodes Brr 2, a 200 kDa helicase involved in the catalytic activation of the RNA spliceosome [6]. Brr 2 unwinds the U 4 /U 6 duplex allowing the U 4 complex to be released and U 6 to bind to U 2, and is involved in spliceosome disassembly. Brr 2 is thought to be tightly regulated by Pfp 8, another adRP-associated protein, and Snu 114 GTPase [7].

However, the recent identification of three diverged chaperonin paralogs associated with the human <b>Bardet-Biedl</b> and McKusick-Kaufman <b>Syndromes</b> (BBS and MKKS, respectively) indicates that the eukaryotic chaperonin-gene family is larger and more differentiated than previously thought. The availability of complete genome sequences makes possible a definitive characterization of the complete set of chaperonin sequences in human and other species. Results We identified fifty-four chaperonin-like sequences in the human genome and similar numbers in the genomes of the model organisms mouse and rat. In mammal genomes we identified, besides the well-known CCT chaperonin genes and the three genes associated with the MKKS and BBS pathological conditions, a newly-defined class of chaperonin genes named CCT 8 L, represented in human by the two sequences CCT 8 L 1 and CCT 8 L 2. Comparative analyses from several vertebrate genomes established the monophyletic origin of chaperonin-like MKKS and BBS genes from the CCT 8 lineage. The CCT 8 L gene originated from a later duplication also in the CCT 8 lineage {{at the onset of}} mammal evolution and duplicated in primate genomes. The functionality of CCT 8 L genes in different species was confirmed by evolutionary analyses and in human by expression data. Detailed sequence analysis and structural predictions of MKKS, BBS and CCT 8 L proteins strongly suggested that they conserve a typical chaperonin-like core structure but that they are unlikely to form a CCT-like oligomeric complex. The characterization of many newly-discovered chaperonin pseudogenes uncovered the intense duplication activity of eukaryotic chaperonin genes. Conclusions In vertebrates, chaperonin genes, driven by intense duplication processes, have diversified into multiple classes and functionalities that extend beyond their well-known protein-folding role as part of the typical oligomeric chaperonin complex, emphasizing previous observations on the involvement of individual CCT monomers in microtubule elongation. The functional characterization of newly identified chaperonin genes will be a challenge for future experimental analyses. </p...|$|R
