5000|$|A <b>brake</b> <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> {{was fitted}} to all 4 and 6 {{cylinder}} Centuras from factory {{to compensate for}} weight transfer during braking [...] When the car [...] "nose-dived" [...] under heavy braking, a mechanical link connected to the proportioning valve reduced the brake pressure on the rear wheels, {{to prevent them from}} locking up and causing {{the back of the car}} to slide around. This was typical of many European cars of the time but uncommon in Australian cars.|$|E
50|$|During the {{production}} {{life of the}} Comanche, six different transmissions were offered, manufactured by Aisin, Chrysler, and Peugeot. Aisin provided the AX-4 (four-speed), AX-5 and AX-15 (five-speed overdrive) manual transmissions, along with the AW-4 four-speed automatic that was used beginning in 1987. This is the same Warner transmission used in early- to mid-1990s Toyota 4Runners with the 3.0 and some 22re 4wd. The AX-15 was phased in to replace the Peugeot BA-10/5 five-speed {{that had been used}} from 1987 until mid-1989 behind the 4.0 L I6 engine. The Comanche came equipped with a weight sensing rear <b>brake</b> <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, the X-body {{developed}} a poor reputation for quality, due to engineering defects and related safety problems. Several running {{changes were made}} to the car's braking system during the first months of manufacture in 1979. Initial automobile magazine articles about the new car in the autumn of 1979 cited a dangerous tendency for the car to lock the rear wheels upon braking; then hundreds of complaints involving this behavior, including dozens of accidents, over a dozen injuries and one death triggering a lawsuit, were reported {{in the first year of}} manufacture, leading the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to pressure General Motors for some remedial action. Despite there being over a million of these automobiles on the road at that point, GM issued a voluntary recall of only the earliest manual transmission models, less than 50,000, declaring no safety involvement, and declining to publicize the recall. Internal documents, which eventually were leaked, revealed that GM's engineering staff were dubious that this modification to the <b>brake</b> <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> would be sufficient, even for the cars which were subject to the recall, and that further changes to the brake linings and brake drums would be required; that would have raised the cost from $70 a vehicle to $150, in addition to greatly increasing the number of cars involved.|$|E

50|$|The {{fire started}} before dawn on February 1, 1997, at Aisin Seiki Co.'s Factory No. 1 in Kariya, Japan. The {{cause of the}} fire was {{reportedly}} unknown. The factory produced <b>brake</b> fluid <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> (P-valves) which help prevent skidding by controlling the pressure on rear brakes, and {{are used in the}} braking system of all Toyota vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|As per the {{technical}} paper published by Buschmann et al."The {{job of the}} EBD as a subsystem of the ABS system is to control the effective adhesion utilization by the rear wheels. The pressure of the rear wheels are approximated to the ideal brake force distribution in a partial braking operation. To do so, the conventional brake design is modified {{in the direction of}} rear axle overbraking, and the components of the ABS are used. EBD reduces the strain on the hydraulic <b>brake</b> force <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> in the vehicle. EBD optimizes the brake design with regard to: adhesion utilization; driving stability; wear; temperature stress; and pedal force." ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{proportional}} control {{system is a}} type of linear feedback control system. Two classic mechanical examples are the toilet bowl float <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> and the fly-ball governor.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{example is}} where spring load applies a {{reducing}} force {{so that the}} output pressure is reduced. <b>Proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> are frequently used in cars to reduce the brake fluid pressure to the rear brakes.|$|R
50|$|In May 2014, Honda {{issued a}} recall of about 32,000 Brio and Amaze cars in India {{due to a}} {{possible}} mis-assembly of the <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b> This recall is limited to models which are not fitted with ABS.|$|R
50|$|A <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} the {{pressure}} to the rear brakes under heavy braking. This limits the rear braking to reduce the chances of locking up the rear brakes, and greatly lessens the chances of a spin.|$|R
5000|$|... 124 Sport Coupés were modern in chassis {{and engine}} design. Braking was via four 9" [...] disc brakes with a front/rear weight-sensitive <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b> It {{also had a}} sealed cooling system, viscous fan clutch and a toothed timing belt for the twin-cam motor, the first mass-produced engine to feature this {{instead of the usual}} chain-drive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} system consists of unequal length control arms with forged aluminium arms and cast aluminium uprights, coil springs and anti-roll bars on both axles.

50|$|Safety wise, the Proton Juara came {{equipped}} with a reinforced body structure with anti-intrusion bars, as well as front ventilated disc brakes and rear drum brakes respectively. The brake line also has a load-sensing <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> which prevents rear wheel lock-up on wet surfaces when the Juara is lightly loaded. However, there are no airbags or an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).|$|R
25|$|Coil spring {{independent}} suspension features {{by way of}} a MacPherson strut type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel lower arms. Steering uses a rack and pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> to suppress lock-up. Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect worn-out brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.|$|R

5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{configuration of}} the Arena consists {{of a combination of}} independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, leaf sprung suspensions at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14" [...] front ventilated discs and 9" [...] rear drum brakes with load sensing <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres.

5000|$|... 1. Pumps: Majority {{of systems}} utilize two {{two-cylinder}} piston pumps, {{one for each}} buffer, combining the output of both in a mixing chamber. Some simpler systems use a single peristaltic pump which draws both buffers from separate reservoirs through a <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> and mixing chamber. In either case the system allows the fraction of each buffer entering the column to be continuously varied. The flow rate can go from a few milliliters per minute in bench-top systems to liters per minute for industrial scale purifications. The wide flow range makes it suitable both for analytical and preparative chromatography.|$|R
50|$|Suspension was {{as on the}} Primula. At {{the front}} it {{consisted}} of A-arms and an upper transverse leaf spring, which doubled both as upper link and an anti-roll bar, {{as well as providing}} the attachment point for double-acting hydraulic dampers; at the rear there was a beam axle on longitudinal semi-elliptic leaf springs, plus double-acting hydraulic dampers.Steering was by means of a rack and pinion mechanism positioned beneath the transverse leaf spring and behind the engine.The braking system comprised four disk brakes, front-rear split hydraulic circuits, a vacuum servo and <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> on the rear axle.|$|R
50|$|On the VTX1800, Honda updated its linked braking feature, {{instead of}} having the usual {{separate}} hand and foot brakes, the hand brake operated two-thirds of the front pistons while the foot operated the other third in front and all the rear via a <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve.</b> The induction system was Honda's programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) system using a Manifold Air Pressure (MAP) sensor in the small throttle areas until the standard throttle position sensor (Alpha N) took over at greater throttle opening values. The VTX1800 also had an emission control system that utilized air injection and catalytic converter controlled by the ECU to reduce hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen to levels surpassing emissions standards.|$|R
5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} engines were {{fitted with}} a new Carter carburetor. A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> in the rear brake circuit, power-boosted brakes and hazard warning lights. Indicator, headlight dipping, headlight flashing and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk. This was the first multi-purpose stalk control to be fitted {{by any of the}} “big three" [...] manufacturers, the other two being Ford Australia and General Motors-Holden's.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{internal}} combustion engines, the sketch of the DoE shows that average car efficiency amounts to less than 20%.

50|$|Because the DIRAVI {{system is}} much more {{sensitive}} than conventional systems, {{something must be done}} to prevent the driver over-controlling at high speeds. This is the job of the heart shaped centring cam inside the unit. A pressure loaded piston with a roller on the end runs against the edge of this cam. This pressure comes from a centrifugal governor <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> driven from the gearbox (on manual gearboxes - on automatic gearboxes the gearbox's internal governor pressure controls the centring pressure). At low speeds, the centring piston pressure is 290 psig, to provide a light degree of self centring when parking etc. Proportionally the self centring pressure rises to a maximum of about 800 psig. at 80 km/h, at which self centring forces become a maximum, stiffening the steering but not excessively so.|$|R
5000|$|The DLX has a vinyl interior, a two spoke {{steering}} wheel, a two-speaker radio/tape set-up {{and steel}} wheels with center ornaments.

5000|$|The automobiles' suspension, brakes, and {{aerodynamic}} {{components are}} also selected to tailor the cars to different racetracks.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of carrier particle size and simulated inspiratory flow increase rate on emptying from dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Several flow rate ramps were created using a computer-generated voltage signal linked to an electronic <b>proportioning</b> <b>valve</b> with a fast response time. Different linear ramps were programmed to reach 30, 60, 90, and 120 L/minute over 1, 2, or 3 seconds. At the lower flow rates, 100 -ms and 500 -ms ramps were also investigated. Three DPIs, Spinhaler, Rotahaler, and Turbuhaler, were used to test the effect of flow rate ramp on powder emptying. To test the effect of carrier particle size, anhydrous lactose was sieved into 3 particle sizes, and 20 mg of each was introduced into # 2 and # 3 hard gelatin capsules for Spinhaler and Rotahaler, respectively. Emptying tests were also carried out using the on/off solenoid valve described in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) (resulting in no ramp generation). Powder emptying increased fro...|$|R
5000|$|A heavily {{redesigned}} [...] "Type 2" [...] variant (internally designated Typ 53B) {{went on sale}} in 1981, {{although it}} remained on the A1 platform. The second generation Scirocco, still assembled on behalf of Volkswagen by Karmann of Osnabrück (in the same factory as the first generation Scirocco), was first shown at the 1981 Geneva Salon in March that year. Designed by Volkswagen's own internal design team, the new car featured increased front and rear headroom, increased luggage space {{and a reduction in}} the coefficient of drag. One unique feature of the Type 2 was the location of the rear spoiler midway up the glass on the rear hatch. A mid-cycle update occurred in 1984, which included minor changes over the 1982 model: removal of the outlined [...] "SCIROCCO" [...] script from the rear hatch (below the spoiler), a redesigned air conditioning compressor, and a different brake master cylinder with in-line <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> and a <b>brake</b> light switch mounted to the pedal instead of on the master cylinder.|$|R

40|$|Braking {{system is}} {{becoming}} one of the important aspects of the vehicle because {{it is one of the}} safety systems. Vehicle that traveling at higher speed must fully equipped with more reliable braking system. Reliable braking system is important ro reduce speed or to stop vehicle.

It dangerous for the vehicle because it becoming unstable. Combined brake system is more reliable to maintain <b>braking</b> <b>proportion</b> between front and rear wheel. As a braking vehicle decelerates or during the braking process, there is weight transfer, removes weight from the rear wheels and results in a minimum stopping distance. In this research investigates we present an analysis of the minimum stopping distance problem taking into acount the effect of weight transfer on (i) one passeger on vehicle (ii) two passegers on vehicle.

50|$|More complaints, accidents, injuries, and {{lawsuits}} ensued, including cars which {{had actually been}} modified according to the recall and cars from the 1981 model year, causing NHTSA to pressure GM for further action, preferably a recall of all 1.1 million vehicles in the 1980 model year for replacement of both the <b>proportioning</b> <b>valves</b> and the linings and drums. GM, however, responded in 1983 with a voluntary recall of only all manual transmission vehicles of that year and the very earliest automatic transmission cars, a total of fewer than 250,000, including those in the first recall. NHTSA responded by suing GM, demanding a recall of the entire 1980 model year, claiming the company had known {{as far back as}} 1978 of the cars' dangerous tendency to lock the rear brakes but had provided misleading and incomplete answers to NHTSA's investigation. In 1987, however, the presiding judge dismissed the suit, ruling that NHTSA had filed it prematurely and without the proper procedure of developing conclusive evidence and holding investigative hearings, relying mainly on anecdotal evidence. NHTSA had logged 4,282 complaints, including 1,417 accidents, 427 injuries and 18 fatalities.|$|R
