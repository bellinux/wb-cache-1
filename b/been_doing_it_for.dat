Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing just goes to pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and only time I ever had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without you and we won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew." [...] Abrams commented, [...] "It was surreal to direct him as Spock, because what the hell am I doing there? This guy has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> forty years. It's like 'I think Spock would...|$|E
500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Crowe {{returned}} to Australia at age 21, intending {{to apply to}} the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [...] "I was working in a theatre show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA", Crowe has recalled. [...] "I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things you go there to learn, and you've <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> most of your life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'" [...] From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a New Zealand production of The Rocky Horror Show. He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott. He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show, which also toured New Zealand. In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work. In the 1988 Australian production of Blood Brothers, Crowe played the role of Mickey. He was also cast again by Daniel Abineri in the role of Johnny, in the stage musical Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spiritual leader}} of the tail section. Director Bong first saw Hurt in The Elephant Man while at middle-school, which made him curious about the actor; for the part of Gilliam he wanted an older actor, though one {{with the ability to}} [...] "exude the {{ambience}} of spirituality." [...] On the character of Gilliam, Hurt said, [...] "He is certainly shadowy, but he is shadowy for a reason. Even though I still am not entirely certain what the reason is," [...] adding, [...] " [...] as far as Gilliam is concerned, he believes in the status quo, but he also sees himself as a true humanitarian. I mean he has literally given his limbs to these people." [...] Hurt stated that the role of Gilliam was physically challenging one at that, because, [...] " [...] the fact that I had one leg strapped behind me, trying to stagger around on those not very easy-to-use crutches. [...] and having {{to make it look like}} as though I'd <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years." [...] He too acknowledged Bong's encouragement of collaboration in allowing the cast and crew to [...] "interpret things as we want, as we see fit" [...] as well as adding pointers to the act. Hurt said of Bong, [...] "I just fell in love with him. He was wonderful. I hadn't seen anything. I hadn't seen Mother or anything, which I immediately did when I got home. I went, 'Wow, that's the chap I was talking to.' Thank God instinct has left me completely. I adored him then, I adored him ever since." [...] as well as previously adding, [...] "He is quite different but technically, he is as clever as Hitchcock. That's saying something. [...] He is one of the best directors I've worked with. I absolutely adore working with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also citing McFly as {{influences}} are British pop {{rock band}} The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 [...] Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated [...] "McFly is a band {{we love to}} be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances." [...] Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining [...] "McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like {{the next generation of}} their take on pop," [...] while bassist Connor Ball continued [...] "They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first in all of our collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years and the little things we picked up have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said [...] "We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation... We find ourselves going to the same minor guitar chords like McFly would." ...|$|E

60|$|From {{the lofty}} ramparts {{one has a}} fine view of the sacred rivers. They join at that point--the pale blue Jumna, {{apparently}} clean and clear, and the muddy Ganges, dull yellow and not clean. On a long curved spit between the rivers, towns of tents were visible, with a multitude of fluttering pennons, and a mighty swarm of pilgrims. It was a troublesome place to get down to, and not a quiet place when you arrived; but it was interesting. There was a world of activity and turmoil and noise, partly religious, partly commercial; for the Mohammedans were there to curse and sell, and the Hindoos to buy and pray. It is a fair {{as well as a}} religious festival. Crowds were bathing, praying, and drinking the purifying waters, and many sick pilgrims had come long journeys in palanquins to be healed of their maladies by a bath; or if that might not be, then to die on the blessed banks and so make sure of heaven. There were fakeers in plenty, with their bodies dusted over with ashes and their long hair caked together with cow-dung; for the cow is holy and so is the rest of it; so holy that the good Hindoo peasant frescoes the walls of his hut with this refuse, and also constructs ornamental figures out of it for the gracing of his dirt floor. There were seated families, fearfully and wonderfully painted, who by attitude and grouping represented the families of certain great gods. There was a holy man who sat naked by the day and by the week on a cluster of iron spikes, and did not seem to mind it; and another holy man, who stood all day holding his withered arms motionless aloft, and was said to have <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> years. All of these performers have a cloth on the ground beside them for the reception of contributions, and even the poorest of the people give a trifle and hope that the sacrifice will be blessed to him. At last came a procession of naked holy people marching by and chanting, and I wrenched myself away.|$|E
