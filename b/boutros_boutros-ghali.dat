5|$|Beginning in {{the last}} decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN {{condemned}} the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore. <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali,</b> Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing {{the size of the}} organization somewhat. His successor, Kofi Annan (1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.|$|E
5|$|Tensions were renewed at the {{beginning}} of 1995 as Croatia sought to put increasing pressure on the RSK. In a five-page letter on 12 January Franjo Tuđman formally told the UN Secretary General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> that Croatia was ending the agreement permitting the stationing of UNPROFOR in Croatia, effective 31 March. The move was purportedly motivated by actions by Serbia and the Serb-dominated Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to provide assistance to the Serb occupation of Croatia and allegedly integrate the occupied areas into Yugoslav territory. The situation was noted and addressed by the UN General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E

5|$|With {{states from}} Africa and Asia joining the United Nations, {{development}} issues became increasingly important, {{resulting in the}} expansion of the United Nations in the development area, including the establishment of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 1965 and negotiations on an International Economic Order (NIEO) as part of the North-South conflict in the 1970s. The 1980s were characterized by financial crisis and the retreat of the United States, which triggered a reform of the budgetary process and the downsizing of the Organization. With the end of the Cold War, the rediscovery of and renaissance of the United Nations were hailed; {{the first half of the}} 1990s saw a major expansion of the Organization and the reform associated with the Agenda for Peace launched by Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali.</b>|$|E

Former Egyptian Foreign Minister Nabil Araby is the present Secretary General of the Arab League. Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> served as Secretary General of the United Nations from 1991 to 1996.|$|E
50|$|Member States were {{encouraged}} to contribute to ECOMOG financially to facilitate the sending of reinforcements by African states. Furthermore, the assistance they provided was praised and the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> efforts to encourage dialogue were welcomed.|$|R
50|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1087: There {{was slow}} {{progress}} in the peace process, including implementing the Lusaka Protocol. The Council approved the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> recommendation {{to reduce the size}} of UNAVEM III during February 1997, due to donor fatigue.|$|R
5000|$|The Council reiterated its {{determination}} {{to ensure the}} security and safety of UNPROFOR and its freedom of movement in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Yusuf attended {{as part of an}} honorary committee which also included George Martin, Richard Branson, <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali,</b> Klaus Voormann, Christopher Lee and others.|$|E
25|$|On 5 February 1994 Sarajevo {{suffered}} its deadliest single attack {{during the}} entire siege with the first Markale massacre, when a 120 millimeter mortar shell landed in {{the centre of the}} crowded marketplace, killing 68 people and wounding another 144. On 6 February, UN Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> formally requested NATO to confirm that future requests for air strikes would be carried out immediately.|$|E
25|$|African leaders began {{a series}} of peace talks between the warring factions {{following}} a request by the United Nations Secretary General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> for them to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Talks were initiated under the aegis of former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere in 1995; following his death, South African President Nelson Mandela took the helm. As the talks progressed, South African President Thabo Mbeki and United States President Bill Clinton also lent their respective weight.|$|E
50|$|The {{talks between}} {{the country and the}} rebel group UNITA in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, had failed and a ceasefire was not established. The Council {{supported}} the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> efforts to bring about an end to the crisis, stressing the importance of the United Nations presence to push forward the peace process.|$|R
50|$|A United Nations Secretary-General {{selection}} {{was held in}} 1996 {{at the end of}} <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> first term. Boutros-Ghali ran unopposed for a second term and received the support of 14 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council. However, the United States vetoed his re-selection and eventually forced him to withdraw his candidacy.|$|R
50|$|Acknowledging the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> {{visit to}} the Western Sahara in November 1994, the Council affirmed that a {{referendum}} of self-determination must be held {{for the people of}} the territory. The Secretary-General felt that the MINURSO mission, which was responsible for the organisation of the referendum, required more staff for the purposes of voter registration. The Settlement Plan as a whole had also been delayed.|$|R
25|$|In the post-Cold War era, the United Nations {{has taken}} on a more nuanced, multidimensional {{approach}} to Peacekeeping. In 1992, {{in the aftermath of the}} Cold War, then Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> put together a report detailing his ambitious concepts for the United Nations and Peacekeeping at large. The report, titled An Agenda for Peace, described a multi-faceted and interconnected set of measures he hoped would lead to effective use of the UN in its role in post-Cold War international politics. This included the use of preventative diplomacy, peace-enforcement, peace-making, peace-keeping and post-conflict reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> ran unopposed for {{a second}} term. Although he won 14 of the 15 votes on the Security Council, he was vetoed by the United States. After four deadlocked {{meetings}} of the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy, becoming the only Secretary-General ever to be denied a second term. Annan was the leading candidate to replace him, beating Amara Essy by one vote in the first round. However, France vetoed Annan four times before finally abstaining. The UN Security Council recommended Annan on 13 December 1996. Confirmed four days later by the vote of the General Assembly, he started his first term as Secretary-General on 1 January 1997.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S. and UK {{had been}} engaged in {{low-level}} attacks on Iraqi air defenses which targeted them while enforcing Iraqi no-fly zones. These zones, and the attacks to enforce them, were described as illegal by the former UN Secretary General, <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali,</b> and the French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine. Other countries, notably Russia and China, also condemned the zones {{as a violation of}} Iraqi sovereignty. In mid-2002, the U.S. began more carefully selecting targets {{in the southern part of}} the country to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq. A change in enforcement tactics was acknowledged at the time, but it was not made public that this was part of a plan known as Operation Southern Focus.|$|E
50|$|A team of 20 {{military}} observers {{was then}} established, {{known as the}} United Nations Military Liaison Team (UNMLT) to monitor {{the situation in the}} country after the withdrawal of UNTAC. The intention of the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> intention to appoint a person to coordinate the United Nations presence in Cambodia was welcomed, as was his intention to report on the lessons learned {{during the course of the}} entire UNTAC operation.|$|R
5000|$|The Council {{reiterated the}} {{importance}} it {{attached to the}} full and timely implementation of the [...] "Acordos de Paz" [...] peace agreement and relevant resolutions of the Security Council, {{and the importance of}} the role of the United Nations in this process. The efforts of the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> Special Representative, Margaret Anstee, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and that of neighbouring states, particularly Zambia, was welcomed.|$|R
2500|$|On 1 July 1994, he was {{appointed}} United Nations Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> Special Representative to Rwanda, succeeding Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh. [...] As U.N. Special Representative, he represented the United Nations during the genocide and subsequent refugee crisis. He also remained the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board from 10 December 2003 till he resigned on 7 October 2006. On 16 August 2014 he was again appointed as the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.|$|R
25|$|<b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> is a Copt {{who served}} as Egypt's foreign {{minister}} under President Anwar Sadat. Today, only two Copts are on Egypt's governmental cabinet: Finance Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali and Environment Minister Magued George. There is also currently one Coptic governor out of 25, that of the upper Egyptian governorate of Qena, and is the first Coptic governor in decades. In addition, Naguib Sawiris, an extremely successful businessman {{and one of the}} world's 100 wealthiest people, is a Copt. In 2002, under the Mubarak government, Coptic Christmas (January 7) was recognized as an official holiday. However, many Copts continue to complain of being minimally represented in law enforcement, state security and public office, and of being discriminated against in the workforce {{on the basis of their}} religion. Most Copts do not support independence or separation movement from other Egyptians.|$|E
500|$|With the {{enlargement}} of the United Nations membership and increasing self-confidence among the new members, going {{hand in hand with}} processes of decolonization, old structures and procedures were increasingly challenged. The imbalance between the number of seats in the Security Council and the total number of member States became evident, and the only significant reform of the Security Council occurred in 1965: this included an increase in the non-permanent membership from six to 10 members. With <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> elected as Secretary-General in 1992, the reform discussions of the UN Security Council were launched again as he started his new term with the first-ever summit of the Security Council and then published [...] "An Agenda for Peace". His motivation was to restructure the composition and arguably anachronistic procedures of the UN organ to recognize the changed world.|$|E
500|$|In June 1993, {{partly in}} {{response}} to pressure from the United States, the Security Council passed Resolution 836 which authorized NATO forces to provide close air support for UNPROFOR forces upon request. The procedure to request air support was quite difficult, as it involved the [...] "dual key" [...] of both UN and NATO approval. UN approval required contact with the United Nations headquarters in New York City, making effective coordination nearly impossible given the difference in time zones. The UN approval process was later somewhat streamlined when UN Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali</b> delegated the authority to authorize air strikes to his special representative in Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi. [...] Even after this simplification, however, [...] "dual key" [...] remained a problem as all requests first had to be processed through the UN Air Operations Center in Kiseljak then pass up the entire [...] UNPROFOR chain of command to Akashi. After Akashi approved the request, {{he would make a}} request to NATO commanders who then had to pass orders back down their chain of command and coordinate with forces on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Unless {{these tasks}} were fulfilled, the Council would {{consider}} imposing measures from Resolution 864 (1993). The Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> intention {{to reduce the}} size of UNAVEM III by the end of December 1996 in accordance with Resolution 976 (1995) was noted, which also recommended that the mandate of UNAVEM III end by February 1997. He was also asked to report to the Council by 20 November and 1 December 1996 on progress in the peace process.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> {{political}} career {{developed during the}} presidency of Anwar El Sadat. He {{was a member of}} the Central Committee of the Arab Socialist Union from 1974 to 1977. He served as Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1977 until early 1991. He then became Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for several months before moving to the UN. As Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, he played a part in the peace agreements between President Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.|$|R
50|$|The {{participating}} countries in IFOR {{were asked to}} report every month. The Council created the post of High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and appointed Carl Bildt to the position to monitor {{the implementation of the}} peace agreement. The mandate of UNPROFOR would end as soon as the transfer of authority to IFOR had taken place, which occurred on 20 December 1995; the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> arrangements for the withdrawal of UNPROFOR were approved and he was also asked to report when that withdrawal was complete.|$|R
500|$|Sihanouk left in November 1992 to {{seek medical}} {{treatment}} in Beijing, where he stayed {{for the next six}} months until his return to Cambodia in May 1993, [...] on the eve of elections. While in Beijing, Sihanouk proposed a Presidential system government for Cambodia to then-UN secretary-general <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali,</b> but soon dropped the idea after facing opposition from the Khmer Rouge. When general elections were held, FUNCINPEC, now headed by Sihanouk's son Norodom Ranariddh, won, while the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) headed by Hun Sen came in second. The CPP was unhappy with the election results, and on 3June 1993 Hun Sen and Chea Sim called on Sihanouk to lead the government. Sihanouk complied, and announced the formation of a Provisional National Government (PRG) headed by him, with Hun Sen and Ranariddh as his deputies. Ranariddh was surprised at Sihanouk's announcement, as he had not been informed of his father's plans, and joined Australia, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States in opposing the plan. The following day, Sihanouk rescinded his announcement through a national radio broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Goldstone was {{approached}} by Cassese and {{expressed an interest in}} the position. President Mandela supported his wish to take up the position at The Hague, as Goldstone later recalled: [...] "He certainly encouraged me. He thought it was important to take what was the first offer of a major international position after South Africa ceased to be a pariah." [...] However, the offer put Mandela in a difficult spot. He wanted Goldstone, {{who was one of the}} few South African jurists to have earned the respect of both blacks and whites, for South Africa's newly established Constitutional Court. Mandela struck a deal with the UN Secretary-General, <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali,</b> that Goldstone would serve only half of his four-year term as prosecutor and would then return to take up his post in South Africa. The president rushed through a constitutional amendment that would allow Goldstone to be named, take an immediate period of leave to serve at the tribunal and then return to his spot on the Constitutional Court. He proved to be an ideal candidate, as he had been suggested by the French, was not too hot-headed for the British, was strong enough to satisfy the Americans and his credentials as a white South African who had opposed apartheid satisfied the Russians and Chinese. The UN Security Council unanimously approved his appointment to the rôle of prosecutor.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{international}} NGOs {{launched the}} International Campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, the principal current movement {{for the establishment}} of a UNPA. Its Secretariat is led by [...] Over 150 civil society groups and nearly 1,500 parliamentarians from all over the world are taking part in the Campaign. As of June 2017, CEUNPA's appeal was endorsed by thousands of signatories from over 150 countries, among them hundreds of parliamentarians, civil society leaders, leading academics and distinguished individuals such as former UN Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali,</b> the President of the Pan-African Parliament, Gertrude Mongella, Academy Award winner Emma Thompson, SF-author Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Edgar Mitchell, former NASA astronaut and sixth human being to walk on the moon. On 25 September 2007, the statement by H.E. Mr. José Sócrates, Prime Minister of Portugal, on behalf of the European Union, at the United Nations 62nd Session of the General Assembly, General Debate, stated, [...] "We remain committed to the reform of its main bodies in order to enhance the Organization's representativity, transparency and effectiveness." [...] On 24 October 2007, the Pan African Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution calling {{for the establishment of}} a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations, noting, [...] "in contrast to regional international bodies such as the African Union, the European Union, the Council of Europe, or Mercosur, the United Nations and its ...|$|E
50|$|Between 1985 and 1993, Ould-Abdallah {{worked as}} adviser on energy, {{including}} renewable energies and African issues, to the United Nations Secretary-General. From 1993 to 1995, he was Secretary General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> Special Representative in Burundi, {{during the first}} part of the Burundi Civil War. Between 1996 and 2002, he served as the Executive Secretary of the Global Coalition for Africa, a Washington D.C. based intergovernmental forum dedicated to African issues. In 2002, Secretary General Kofi Annan appointed him Special Representative for West Africa at the head of the United Nations Office for West Africa.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, Beresford {{wrote in}} The Guardian that Justice Richard Goldstone ran a [...] "much vaunted" [...] {{judicial}} {{commission of inquiry}} that [...] "failed dismally", {{and that was a}} [...] "rubbish bin" [...] used by the South African government. He discussed Goldstone’s [...] "disturbing" [...] practice by which he acted with [...] "overt political 'sensitivity", including his being [...] "at pains to involve the politically distinguished in the conduct of his inquiry"; and of harboring such ambition to succeed <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali’s</b> post as UN Secretary-General, that Goldstone’s legal colleagues gave him the nickname of [...] "Richard-Richard".|$|R
5000|$|Again, the Council reaffirmed its {{commitment}} to the holding of a referendum on self-determination {{for the people of}} Western Sahara, in accordance with the Settlement Plan. It expressed regret that the parties did not want to co-operate with MINURSO to allow it to complete the identification of voters, and therefore the process was suspended. The resolution agreed with the Secretary-General <b>Boutros</b> <b>Boutros-Ghali's</b> recommendation that the military component of MINURSO be reduced by 20% as this would not affect the operational capacity of the peacekeeping force. The Security Council was satisfied that the parties complied with ceasefire and asked them to show their good will by releasing political prisoners and to accelerate the implementation of the peace plan.|$|R
