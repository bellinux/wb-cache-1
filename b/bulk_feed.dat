50|$|However, an {{argument}} exists that Aetiocetus {{was in fact}} a bulk feeder, who fed by gulping and straining prey from the water through their interlocking cusped cheek teeth. This is supported by the presence of a lack of mandibular symphysis, meaning the jaw was loosely articulated, and by the presence of the wide palate. This feeding method has an analog in crab-eater seals. This hypothesis combines the idea of <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding</b> and retention of the dentition. Aetiocetus might have been a functional mysticete. Lending credence to this interpretation is the presence of mandibular kinesis in Aetiocetus, though they lack the rostral kinesis seen in more derived mysticetes. This cranial kinesis, or ability of the skull bones to move relative to one another, permit the mysticete skull to decrease the strain exerted on the skull during <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Steam Mill is {{near the}} {{headwaters}} of the Canard River and was once the head of tide from the river's saltwater estuary. The area was used by early Acadian settlers and later New England Planters at nearby Upper Dyke on the Canard River who used the Steam Mill area in the 18th century as upland pasture. Near the present day crossing of Route 359 over the river, the Acadians built the first of series of dykes across the Canard River, pushing back the salt water tides to create highly productive farmland along the river. In the 19th century, the community was the site of one of the first steam saw mills in Kings County, thus earning its name. The mill is believed to have operated where the Elm Grove cemetery stands today. In 1889, the Cornwallis Valley Railway, a branch line of the Dominion Atlantic Railway arrived which later became the Kingsport Subdivision of the DAR with the railway station at Steam Mill Village appearing as [...] "Mill Village" [...] on railway timetables. Camp Aldershot, a militia training camp was established in 1904 beside Steam Mill. After World War II, the community became the site of several plants selling <b>bulk</b> <b>feed</b> and agricultural supplies located along the railway. In 1961, the Cornwallis Valley Railway was abandoned beyond Steam Mill, making the community the terminus of the [...] "CVR Spur" [...] serving the <b>bulk</b> <b>feed</b> mills.

500|$|Fucaia buelli is the {{earliest}} mysticete, {{dating back to}} 33 million years ago (mya). Measuring only , it is the smallest baleen whale discovered. It is only known from its teeth; they suggest a suction feeding behavior, much like that of beaked whales. Like other early toothed mysticetes, or [...] "archaeomysticetes", F. buelli had heterodont dentition. Archaeomysticetes from the Oligocene are the Mammalodontidae (Mammalodon and Janjucetus) from Australia. They were small with shortened rostra, and a primitive dental formula (...) [...] In baleen whales, enlarged mouths adapted for suction feeding evolved before specializations for <b>bulk</b> filter <b>feeding.</b> In the toothed Oligocene mammalodontid Janjucetus, the symphysis is short and the mouth enlarged, the rostrum is wide, and {{the edges of the}} maxillae are thin, indicating an adaptation for suction feeding. The aetiocetid Chonecetus still had teeth, but the presence of a groove on the interior side of each mandible indicates the symphysis was elastic, which would have enabled rotation of each mandible, an initial adaptation for <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding</b> like in modern mysticetes.|$|R
50|$|Fitzgerald {{argued against}} {{the model of}} tooth-aided filter feeding, based {{on the lack of}} closely pressed teeth and the {{presence}} of simple postcanine crowns. Deméré argues that this assumes a very small prey size (i.e., krill). The distinction here is that Aetiocetus was a bulk feeder, and prey size does not enter into this definition of feeding strategy. There is no reason to assume a priori that all bulk filter-feeders eat small prey, given the large diversity of food items consumed by modern mysticetes. Demere hypothesizes that Aetiocetus’ <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding</b> behavior could have targeted large prey, such as schooling fish or squid. With prey items of this size, Aetiocetus’ teeth would still have served well as a coarse sieve.|$|R
40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed September 16, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 33 - 35) Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in managed collections may be {{at increased risk for}} various chronic health issues including insulin resistance, hemochromatosis, nephrolithiasis, and hypocitraturia. To assess the impact of meal size and feeding frequency on biochemical markers, a prospective intervention study was developed {{to determine the effects of}} various feeding schedules on selected blood and urine variables during four feeding phases. Blood and urine samples were collected weekly during a 6 -week standard feeding schedule (average six meals per day over eight hours), a 6 -week continuous feeding schedule (twelve meals per day over twelve hours), a 3 -week recovery period (same as standard feeding schedule), and a 6 -week <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding</b> schedule (two meals per day over six hours). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare postprandial mean blood and urine data collected over a 21 -week period from six bottlenose dolphins at the U. S. Navy Marine Mammal Program in San Diego, California. Most changes were observed during the <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding</b> intervention including significantly increased levels of serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, triglyceride and urine creatinine as well as significantly decreased levels of urine uric acid and uric acid/creatinine. Serum cholesterol significantly increased during the continuous feeding intervention when compared to the standard feeding schedule. Significance was also observed when comparing estimated glomerular filtration rates among the four feeding phases. Findings were consistent with human studies assessing meal size and frequency as determinants of chronic health. Findings were also consistent with studies assessing the effects of high-protein diets on both animals and humans. Overall, it seems that a diet more similar to that of wild dolphin populations (continuous feeding) may be beneficial for dolphins that are at increased risk of chronic health issues such as hemochromatosis and nephrolithiasis...|$|R

40|$|The multifactorial {{nature of}} colony losses is widely accepted, {{although}} synergistic effects of possible causative factors {{are not completely}} understood. To investigate interactions between two serious and wide-spread pathogens of honey bee colonies, Deformed Wing Virus and Nosema ceranae, an experiment {{was set up in}} which worker bees were infected with known amounts of N. ceranae spores. To reduce the impact of Varroa destructor an apiary was established in an isolated mountain area and mitelevels kept as low as possible. Newly emerged worker bees were kept in 14 hoarding cages (30 bees each). Each cage was provided with 0. 2 ml 50 % w/v sucrose solution containing 20  106 N. ceranae spores per ml. Oral infection was therefore obtained via <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding.</b> The number of dead bees in each cage was recorded for ~ 30 days.

The dietary inclusion of soybean meal resulted in a significantly higher <b>feed</b> <b>bulk</b> density relative to the fishmeal control diet. The inclusions of copra and palm kernel meals, however, resulted in lower <b>feed</b> <b>bulk</b> densities. Sinking rates, water stabilities and nutrient retention efficiencies of feed pellets were directly related to <b>feed</b> <b>bulk</b> densities. The soybean meal diet had the fastest sinking velocities, greatest water stability and highest nutrient retention rates. The dietary inclusion of soybean meal, however, significantly impaired feed intake compared to the other three diets. Mean daily feed intakes of the control, palm kernel meal and copra meal diets corresponded to 28. 88, 27. 01 and 28. 31  g during the experimental period and varied significantly from the mean daily intake of the soybean meal diet which corresponded to 20. 01  g. Faecal matter production (g dry mass kg− 1 ingested feed) was significantly higher in the tilapia groups fed the copra and palm kernel meals.

500|$|Sirenians are {{referred}} to as [...] "sea cows" [...] because their diet consists mainly of seagrass. They ingest the whole plant, including the roots, although they will feed on just the leaves if this is not possible. Manatees, in particular the West Indian manatee, are known to consume over 60 different freshwater and saltwater plants, such as shoalweed, water lettuce, muskgrass, manatee grass, and turtle grass. Using their divided upper lip, an adult manatee will commonly eat up to 10%-15% of their body weight, or , per day, which requires the manatee to graze for several hours per day. However, 10% of the diet of the African manatee is fish and mollusks. Manatees have been known to eat small amounts of fish from nets. As opposed to <b>bulk</b> <b>feeding,</b> dugongs target high-nitrogen grasses to maximize nutrient intake, and, although almost completely herbivorous, dugongs will occasionally eat invertebrates such as jellyfish, sea squirts, and shellfish. Some populations of dugongs, such as the one in Moreton Bay, Australia, are omnivorous, feeding on invertebrates such as polychaetes or marine algae when their supply of seagrasses decrease. In other dugong populations in western and eastern Australia, there is evidence that dugongs actively seek out large invertebrates. Populations of Amazonian manatees become restricted to lakes during the July–August dry season when water levels begin to fall, and are thought to fast during this period. Their large fat reserves and low metabolic rates – only 36% of the usual placental mammal metabolic rate – allow them to survive for up to seven months with little or no food.|$|R
