40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{characterize}} <b>BIBO-stability</b> of input/output quaternionic systems. After defining and investigating properties of quaternionic polynomials and rational functions, the Smith and the Smith-McMillan forms of quaternionic matrices are studied. Finally, the stability of quaternionic behavioral systems is analyzed using these tools...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We explore {{mathematical}} {{knowledge in}} the field of electrical engineering and claim that electrical engineering is a suitable area of application for mathematical knowledge management: We show that mathematical knowledge arising in electrical engineering can be successfully handled by existing MKM systems, namely by the Mizar system. To this end we consider in this paper network theory and in particular stability of networks. As an example for mathematical knowledge in electrical engineering we present a Mizar formalization of Schur’s theorem. Schur’s theorem provides a recursive, easy method to check for <b>BIBO-stability</b> of networks. ...|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that, {{in contrast to}} frameworks for steady-state analysis such as queue theory, control theory provides the means to design controllers that systematically exhibit particular behavior for both steady-state and transient responses. That allows for characterizing the resulting system (controller + target system) {{in terms of the}} so-called SASO properties (Tilbury et al. 2004): Stability, Accuracy, Settling time, and Overshoot. Among several definitions of stability available today (Slotine and Li 1991), one widely used in feedback control is that of <b>BIBO-stability</b> (Hayes 2011). A system is BIBO-stable if for any bounded input signal v(t) the output y(t) is bounded.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new kernel-based approach for linear system identification of stable systems. We model the impulse response as {{the realization of}} a Gaussian process whose statistics, differently from previously adopted priors, include information not only on smoothness but also on <b>BIBO-stability.</b> The associated autocovariance defines {{what we call a}} stable spline kernel. The corresponding minimum variance estimate belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space which is spectrally characterized. Compared to parametric identification techniques, the impulse response of the system is searched for within an infinite-dimensional space, dense in the space of continuous functions. Overparametrization is avoided by tuning few hyperparameters via marginal likelihood maximization. The proposed approach may prove particularly useful in the context of robust identification in order to obtain reduced order models by exploiting a two-step procedure that projects the nonparametric estimate onto the space of nominal models. The continuous-time derivation immediately extends to the discrete-time case. On several continuous- and discrete-time benchmarks taken from the literature the proposed approach compares very favorably with the existing parametric and nonparametric techniques...|$|E
40|$|A novel Neuropredictive Teleoperation (NPT) Scheme is presented. The design {{results from}} two key ideas: the {{exploitation}} of the measured or estimated neural input to the human arm or its electromyograph (EMG) as the system input and the employment of a predictor of the arm movement, based on this neural signal and an arm model, to compensate for time delays in the system. Although a multitude of such models, as well as measuring devices for the neural signals and the EMG, have been proposed, current telemanipulator research has only been considering highly simplified arm models. In the present design, the bilateral constraint that the master and slave are simultaneously compliant to each other's state (equal positions and forces) is abandoned, thus obtaining a ""simple to analyze"" succession of only locally controlled modules, and a robustness to time delays of up to 500 ms. The proposed designs were inspired by well established physiological evidence that the brain, rather than controlling the movement on-line, ""programs"" the arm with an action plan of a complete movement, which is then executed largely in open loop, regulated only by local reflex loops. As {{a model of the}} human arm the well-established Stark model is employed, whose mathematical representation is modified to make it suitable for an engineering application. The proposed scheme is however valid for any arm model. <b>BIBO-stability</b> and passivity results for a variety of local control laws are reported. Simulation results and comparisons with ""traditional"" designs also highlight the advantages of the proposed design...|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{stability}} analysis is always {{one of the}} most important issues in the theory of differential equations and their applications. The analysis on stability of fractional-order differential equations is more complex than that of classical differential equations, since fractional derivatives are nonlocal and have weakly singular kernels. The earliest study on the stability of fractional systems started in [8]; the author has given a well-known stability criterion for a linear fractional differential system with constant coefficient matrix. Since then, the stability of fractional systems has attracted increasing interest. Many researchers have done further studies on the stability of fractional systems. In [9], by the frequency domain method, the <b>BIBO-stability</b> of fractional differential systems with delays was considered. Chen and Moore [10] considered the analytical stability bound for a class of fractional differential systems with time-delay. The authors derived a stability condition by applying the Laplace transformation and the Lambert function. [11] studied the linear system with multi-order Caputo derivative and derived a sufficient condition on Lyapunov global asymptotical stability. In [12] LMI stability conditions for linear fractional differential systems were given. The boundedness properties of system responses are very important from the engineering point of view. From this fact, finite-time stability for fractional differential systems with time-delay was introduced [13, 14]. In [15], the definitions of q-fractional calculus was presented and the stability of non-autonomous systems within the frame of the q-Caputo fractional derivative was studied. Recently, survey papers [16, 17] have provided more details about the stability results and the methods available to analyze the stability of fractional differential systems; the reader may refer to them and the references therein.|$|E
