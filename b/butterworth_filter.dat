5|$|Elliptic {{filters are}} filters {{produced}} by the insertion-loss method which use elliptic rational functions in their transfer function as an approximation to the ideal filter response {{and the result is}} called a Chebyshev approximation. This is the same Chebyshev approximation technique used by Cauer on image filters but follows the Darlington insertion-loss design method and uses slightly different elliptic functions. Cauer had some contact with Darlington and Bell Labs before WWII (for a time he worked in the US) but during the war they worked independently, in some cases making the same discoveries. Cauer had disclosed the Chebyshev approximation to Bell Labs but had not left them with the proof. Sergei Schelkunoff provided this and a generalisation to all equal ripple problems. Elliptic filters are a general class of filter which incorporate several other important classes as special cases: Cauer filter (equal ripple in passband and stopband), Chebyshev filter (ripple only in passband), reverse Chebyshev filter (ripple only in stopband) and <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filter</b> (no ripple in either band).|$|E

[...] A very early application of this type was to make significant improvements to the abysmal audio performance of phonographs. [...] In 1929 Edward Norton designed the mechanical parts of a phonograph to behave as a maximally flat filter, thus anticipating the electronic <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
40|$|The "combined" {{characteristics}} of the Bessel analog filters is investigated, where the combined characteristics implies the feature of the filters that represents how accurately the original signal will be reproduced when it is first divided by the low pass filter (LPF) and high pass filter (HPF), then those signals are summed after passing through these filters. It has been found that, in the gain-frequency {{characteristics of}} the combined filters (LP+HP), the Bessel filters of order N = 4 to 11, and 21 to 30 have rather flat combined gain-characteristics, while those of N = 2, 3, and 12 to 20, {{in the range of}} N ≦ 30 calculated, show dips greater than a few dB, at the cross-over angular frequency ω = 1 (renormalized with an half-power angular frequency ω 0). This is in contrast with the <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filters</b> previousely investigated: <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filters</b> of odd order have the perfect gain characteristics, namely, │G LPF (jω) +G HPF (jω) │ = 1. The group delay characteristics (τ d) of the Bessel combined filters is better than that of the <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filters.</b> The impulse response of the Bessel low pass filters shows only a simple peak near the corresponding delay time τd, and those of the high pass filters consist of a delta function at t = 0 and a slowly varing decay curve (represented by the 1 st kind Bessel function J 1 at N →∞). As the inpulse response of the combined Bessel filters is the sum of them, it is also simpler than that of the <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filters...</b>|$|R

500|$|A single λ/4 coupled {{section is}} good for bandwidths of less than an octave. [...] To achieve greater bandwidths {{multiple}} λ/4 coupling sections are used. [...] The design of such couplers proceeds {{in much the same}} way as the design of distributed element filters. [...] The sections of the coupler are treated as being sections of a filter, and by adjusting the coupling factor of each section the coupled port can be made to have any of the classic filter responses such as maximally flat (<b>Butterworth</b> <b>filter),</b> equal-ripple (Cauer filter), or a specified-ripple (Chebychev filter) response. [...] Ripple is the maximum variation in output of the coupled port in its passband, usually quoted as plus or minus a value in dB from the nominal coupling factor.Matthaei et al., pp.775–777 ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison used Campbell's {{image filter}} theory, {{which was the}} most {{advanced}} filter theory available at the time. In this theory, filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem. More advanced filter theory was {{brought to bear on}} this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs. Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being [...] "maximally flat". Norton's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter. The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filter,</b> that is, one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance, whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends, making it hard to recognise the design for what it is. Another unusual feature of Norton's filter design arises from the series capacitor, which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm. This is the only series capacitor in Norton's representation, and without it, the filter could be analysed as a low-pass prototype. Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit (Norton's figure 4). Norton has used here the [...] "turning round the L" [...] impedance transform to achieve this.|$|E

500|$|<b>Butterworth</b> <b>filters</b> are an {{important}} class of filters due to Stephen Butterworth (1930) which are now recognised as being a special case of Cauer's elliptic <b>filters.</b> <b>Butterworth</b> discovered this <b>filter</b> independently of Cauer's work and implemented it in his version with each section isolated from the next with a valve amplifier which made calculation of component values easy since the filter sections could not {{interact with each other}} and each section represented one term in the Butterworth polynomials. This gives Butterworth the credit for being both the first to deviate from image parameter theory and the first to design active filters. It was later shown that <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filters</b> could be implemented in ladder topology without the need for amplifiers. [...] Possibly the first to do so was William Bennett (1932) in a patent which presents formulae for component values identical to the modern ones. Bennett, at this stage though, is still discussing the design as an artificial transmission line and so is adopting an image parameter approach despite having produced what would now be considered a network synthesis design. He also {{does not appear to be}} aware of the work of Butterworth or the connection between them.|$|R

This work investigates the influence of three different baseline wander removal techniques on ST changes. The chosen <b>filters</b> were phase-free <b>Butterworth</b> <b>filtering,</b> median filtering and baseline correction with cubic spline interpolation. 289 simulated ECGs containing ischemia were used to determine the influence of these filtering processes on the ST segment. Synthetic baseline wander and offsets were added to the simulated signals. All methods proved to be good approaches by removing most of the baseline wander in all signals. Correlation coefficients between the original signals and the filtered signals were greater than 0. 93 for all ECGs. Cubic spline interpolation performed best regarding the preservation of the ST segment amplitude change when compared to the original signal.
