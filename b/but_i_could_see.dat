[...] "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of {{sweetening}} and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film– all the stuff in the house– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." [...] "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> why. Because, obviously, I've {{done a lot of}} movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I., not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.|$|E

"At one death ceremony…I {{had this}} feeling that – it was so dark, {{about an hour before}} dawn – in that sky there, so clearly lit by the stars – I had this feeling of seeing all the spirits at once of all the animals and all the people that had run in that {{particular}} bit of country and …was it dense! everywhere, thousands of them. I didn't {{know what was going on}} <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> and feel all those silhouettes." ...|$|E

[...] "What she did today was incredible, I mean everything she does is incredible, but I'm lost for words... He (Red Excitement) certainly made a race of it. He left no stone unturned. I was comfortable {{in the first quarter of}} the race <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what was happening so I started to make my way a bit closer from the 900-metre mark but I still had to stay within myself... I'm concentrating on just keeping her balanced but when she hit the afterburners at the 150-metre mark today, I just can't explain the feeling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Youzhny {{was born}} on 25 June 1982 to Mikhail, a Soviet army colonel and Lubov, a {{professional}} tennis player. 25 June is also his father's birthday. His father sacrificed {{his career in the}} Soviet army to steer Youzhny and his older brother Andrei into becoming tennis players. It was because of his father that Boris Sobkin became his coach. At 13, he was a ballboy for a Russia – United States Davis Cup final in Moscow. Youzhny's father was recommended that Mikhail and his brother should join the tennis club Spartak Club if they wanted to become professional players. Mikhail and Andrei had to travel on an underground metro train and then on two buses to reach their destination, taking well over an hour to reach the club. His mother had to take a part-time job to pay for their club membership fees. At Spartak Club, Youzhny, along with many others his age, would watch Andrei Chesnokov, a former top-10 player, practice for hours. However, his parents had difficulty finding a good coach for Mikhail and Andrei. According to Mikhail, [...] "It was not so easy. In the beginning me and Andrei would watch how coaches were working with students. Then we would make our own drills with a bag of old balls that we collected." [...] Remembering Youzhny's early years, Sobkin said, [...] "Mischa and Andrei were practising together all the time without [...] coach". Sobkin continued: [...] "In the beginning, Mischa is all the time breaking racquets and crying. Not so many coaches want to work with boy with strong character like this. So, they would practise on one court for 15 minutes and then comes a member so they must leave court immediately and move to another court. Ten minutes maybe 20 minutes later comes another member and like this all day. There was something in Mischa's eyes, a sparkle, maybe, I don't know. Sometimes the eyes tells more than parents. Of course, I did not see Mischa is Top 10 player then. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he had something special." ...|$|E
60|$|Neither of us {{looked at}} each other; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his hand {{deliberately}} making bread pills.|$|E

60|$|She {{moved in}} her chair a little restlessly. Her eyes avoided mine. Her eyebrows had {{contracted}} a little, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> that she was angry.|$|R
60|$|I stood up, {{steadying}} myself upon my uncle's shoulder, <b>but</b> though <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> for a mile, {{or perhaps}} a quarter more, {{there was not a}} sign of the four-in-hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yea, yea," [...] {{she said}} (and I {{knew she was}} nodding her head sagaciously); I {{looked out at the}} room window, <b>but</b> all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a man {{wheeling}} an empty barrow down the brae.|$|R
60|$|Chauncey Dike {{stopped in}} his tracks and haw-hawed with laughter. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that he was not}} very much pleased.|$|E

6000|$|To die--that {{does not}} disturb me; we {{of the service}} never care for death. <b>But</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> her once more! if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear her bugle sing again and say, [...] "It is I, Soldier--come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I came close, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{make out}} that there was someone behind the bars, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> who it was. Of course, I did not come {{straight}} to the spot, but went about promiscuously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not by a whole mile! It was dark, {{but not so}} dark <b>but</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{who they}} were. They were in a top buggy, drivin' that slick nag the old man is so choice about." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Henry {{was in the}} steward's room, {{affecting}} employment, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> he {{was only}} impatient to hear of my errand.|$|E

60|$|It was {{not very}} light in the hall in which we stood, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> that this lady was young, that she was of medium size, and good-looking.|$|E
60|$|The {{magistrate}} complimented {{the woman}} on her muscular powers, and the court-room laughed; <b>but</b> all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> was a boy {{on the threshold of}} life, passionately crawling to muddy death, and there was no laughter in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean you}} would stand by my side, Mary? Thank you, my love, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not accept the}} sacrifice. I can bear my own lot, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> the woman I loved pointed at as {{the wife of a}} murderer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, señor. But, oh, do not {{go after}} him, I pray you!" [...] cried the girl, in high alarm. [...] "I would not have spoken, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> you {{poisoned}} before my very eyes; no, not that!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said he, {{laying down}} his cup, [...] "I feared as much. How was it done?" [...] He spoke calmly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that he was}} deeply moved.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Spiggoty Spanish wasn't much to brag on, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> she understood, {{though she}} only {{shook her head}} and wouldn't speak. But great Moses, she was some looker--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that there}} were some shanties built behind the wagons, doubtless those [...] "rude houses" [...] of which Marie had written. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> anyone moving about them, or any cattle or any smoke, or other sign of life.

6000|$|... 'No doubt, ma'am. I don't make a doubt, so long {{as there}} is no one to put between them. I have 'eard how the sight of an 'opeful son was as balm to the eyes of his father; <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> Mr. Fulmort--' ...|$|R

60|$|Then I told my story, and Mr. Poplington {{said it was}} a mercy I was not killed, and Jone didn't say much, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> {{that his}} teeth was grinding.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He didn't {{say much}} to me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> what he thought. And of course {{everybody}} thinks the same. How you can {{like the people}} yourself is what I can't understand!' ...|$|E
60|$|Leaning {{over the}} side, with {{two pairs of}} gloves on, I caught the double line, and as I pulled and Dan reeled the fish came up nearer. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> him. Then I reached the leader and held on as for dear life.|$|R
