5|$|Gardiner's health {{continued}} {{to be an issue}} throughout the 1934 NHL playoffs. On March 29, 1934 in a playoff game against the Montreal Maroons Gardiner had a shutout as the Black Hawks won 3–0; though he was named first star as the best player of the game, Gardiner was in extreme pain during the entire game with a fever of 102 Fahrenheit and was attended to <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> in the dressing room during intermissions.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Following {{several more}} troubled months, Jackson {{ended up in}} the hospital; he had {{collapsed}} while rehearsing for a concert in New York. Presley arrived to meet her ill husband, and yet another heated debate ensued. The argument ended after Jackson warned her that she was making his heart rate go up and asked her to leave. She obliged, and was admonished <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> and Jackson's mother Katherine along the way. Presley subsequently returned to Los Angeles. Upon being discharged from hospital, Jackson went to Disneyland Paris to recover.|$|E

5|$|General Eusebio Canales (alias Chamarrita or Prince of Arms) {{is forced}} into exile after {{being accused of}} the murder of Colonel José Parrales Sonriente. He appears to be {{organizing}} a guerrilla attack on the President, but dies of a broken heart after reading a false news report detailing his daughter's wedding to Miguel Angel Face, at which the President was apparently present. The character of the General comes into clearer focus while he is on the road to exile. Canales's road to exile also introduces readers to the desperate financial situation of three sisters who are being taken advantage of <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> who visited their ailing mother. This episode demonstrates that corruption and malice exist not just in the capital city but also in rural villages.|$|E
5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
5|$|When Dyer {{returned}} to Europe he initially travelled to France, where he sang and played to theatres in Paris. Only one boxing match is recorded {{during his time}} there, against middleweight Jean Audouy. Before the fight Dyer was advised <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> not to wear his strapping he had used to support his injured left leg, but in the seventh round his leg gave way again and Audouy was declared the winner. Just a week before his encounter with Audouy, Ted Lewis had regained his British middleweight title but Dyer's reoccurring injury now ruled out any encounter between the fighters.|$|E

5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor,</b> Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
5|$|In early 1989, Schottenheimer {{was fired}} as Browns head coach, {{and took the}} head {{coaching}} job with the Kansas City Chiefs. He still had faith in Junkin, unlike the Browns, and traded a fifth-round pick {{to bring him to}} Kansas City. Two weeks after the trade, a report came out that Junkin had taken steroids provided <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> to treat an injured ankle, and had failed a drug test at the scouting combine as a result. Entering the 1989 Kansas City Chiefs season, Junkin competed with Walker Lee Ashley for the second inside linebacker spot alongside Dino Hackett. Ashley won the job, and Junkin played five games before a shoulder injury sidelined him {{for the rest of the}} season. He was released from the Chiefs after season's end, and retired after not being signed by any team through the 1990 season.|$|E
5|$|St Petersburg {{academic}} psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller {{notes that}} the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>doctor</b> could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.|$|E
