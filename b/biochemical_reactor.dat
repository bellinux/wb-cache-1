40|$|An {{integrated}} approach is presented for the on-line {{estimation of the}} state of a <b>biochemical</b> <b>reactor</b> from presently attainable real-time measurements. Elemental and macroscopic balances are used for the determination of the total rate of growth and state-of-the-art estimation techniques are subsequently employed for the elimination of process and measurement noise and the estimation of the state variables and unknown culture parameters.

The method does not require any model for the growth kinetics and is very sucessful in accurately estimating the above variables in the presence of intense noise and under both steady state and transient conditions. Computer simulation as well as experimental results obtained from this study clearly demonstrate the superb performance of such estimation methodology.

Successful operation depends on the types of microorganisms supported by the organic matrix, and factors affecting the community composition are unknown. A molecular survey of a field-based <b>biochemical</b> <b>reactor</b> that had been removing zinc and arsenic for over six years revealed that the microbial community was dominated by methanogens related to Methanocorpusculum sp. and Methanosarcina sp., which co-occurred with Bacteroidetes environmental groups, such as Vadin HA 17, in places where the organic matter was more degraded.
