50|$|In {{the late}} 1870s and early 1880s, European redcedar cutters and Chinese that were {{prospecting}} for gold {{arrived in the}} region. The Chinese often used Aboriginals as labourers and paid them in opium, {{one of the key}} factors that led to the virtual extinction, save for a few remnants, of these rainforest peoples like the Mamu. The explorer Christie Palmerston, recalled that, while pushing out from Mourilyan Harbour in late 1883, he and his Melanasian manservant encounter a 'large mob' of 'cute creatures', Mamu aborigines, coming down the North Johnstone River who were unaware of 'the power of resistance the white man had'. He therefore made them submit to 'the usual ordeal' since reasoning was beyond them, and 'drilled them' with rifle-fire while his kanaka laid into them with a long <b>bush</b> <b>knife,</b> effecting 'terrible havoc'.|$|E

5000|$|Local men usually {{prefer to}} use long handle styles {{so they can be}} worn over the shoulder, freeing their arms for more {{important}} issues, like carrying important <b>bush</b> <b>knives</b> or to grab onto things while hiking mountains.

50|$|Flight 175 was {{scheduled}} to land at Washington's National Airport but Hahneman ordered the captain to land at Dulles International Airport. He did so at 11:15am. No passengers were allowed to leave the plane while Eastern Airlines worked to meet Hahneman's demands. These were $303,000 in cash, six parachutes, two <b>bush</b> <b>knives,</b> two jump suits, two crash helmets, fuel, food and two cartons of his favourite Benson and Hedges cigarettes.|$|R
50|$|Tribal {{conflicts}} are common using crude clubs and steel <b>bush</b> <b>knives,</b> occasionally employing {{the use of}} shields made from corrugated sheeting. The usual method of engagement is for both warring parties to line up opposite each other, spend several hours verbally abusing each other, with small rushes {{towards and away from}} the enemy being made - increasing in boldness. Eventually, a critical point is reached and the battle begins in earnest.|$|R
50|$|In October 2006, 300 angry mud-smeared Engans {{wielding}} <b>bush</b> <b>knives,</b> {{sticks and}} iron bars marched from Kamkumung to Eriku oval {{to protest the}} killing {{of one of their}} tribesmen by the driver and crew of a PMV bus. Western Highlanders, who own most of the PMV buses operating in Lae, withdrew their vehicles from the city roads fearing retaliation. During the past week one thousand Unitech students rioted leaving four families without homes and thousands of kina worth of properties destroyed. Residents called for the expulsion of illegal settlers as a result of constant violence in and around the city precincts.|$|R
5000|$|In the Pacific {{theater of}} World War II, U.S. Army and Marine Corps {{personnel}} frequently employed jungle and utility knives such as machetes, <b>bush</b> <b>knives,</b> hospital corps knives, and bolos as fighting knives. [...] These knives were particularly favored by elite or specialist units {{such as the}} U.S. Army's Bushmaster regiment and Pioneer combat engineer detachment and the Marine Raider and Paramarine battalions of the U.S. Marine Corps. [...] The success of these large knives in individual combat engagements caused authorities to reexamine the suitability of existing [...] "commando"-type fighting knives for troops expected to fight the Japanese.|$|R
2500|$|On 26 September 2009, it was {{reported}} that at about 11pm that evening a group of about 40 people entered the Kennedy Road settlement wielding guns and knives and attacked an Abahlali baseMjondolo youth meeting. [...] The attackers chanted ethnic and ANC slogans, demolished residents' homes and threatened to kill named individuals. At about 5am the next morning two people were killed in the resulting conflict.

5000|$|On 26 September 2009, it was {{reported}} that at about 11 p.m. that evening a group of about 40 people entered the Kennedy Road informal settlement wielding guns and knives and attacked an Abahlali baseMjondolo youth meeting. The attackers chanted ethnic and pro-ANC slogans, demolished residents' homes and threatened to kill named individuals associated with Abahlali baseMjondolo. The attack was witnessed by the makers of the award winning film 'Dear Mandela'. At about 5 a.m. the next morning two people were killed. Many others were injured and displaced in conflict. According to an Abahlali baseMjondolo (ABM) press statement issued on 27 September 2009 [...] "As far as we know two of the attackers were killed when people managed to take their <b>bush</b> <b>knives</b> off them. This was self defence." [...] The next day, reports indicate that, in the presence of police, a number of homes of AbM members were demolished by the same mob and hundreds or thousands fled the settlement.|$|R
25|$|Another {{tactic of}} the Ashanti during later wars against the British {{was to create}} {{powerful}} log stockades at key points to block British advances. Some of these fortifications were over a hundred yard long, with heavy parallel tree trunks sometimes impervious to destruction by artillery fire. Behind these stockades numerous warriors were mobilized to check enemy movement. While formidable in construction, many of these strongpoints failed because Ashanti guns, gunpowder and bullets were poor, and provided little sustained killing power in defense. Time and time again British troops overcame or bypassed the stockades by mounting old-fashioned bayonet charges, after laying down some covering fire. The Ashanti had given up effective use of traditional weapons like spears, and had little effective reply to the cold steel of an infantry charge except the weak volleys of their obsolete or malfunctioning muskets. Supplementary weapons like <b>bush</b> <b>knives</b> made an indifferent showing in these tactical situations against the European soldiers. The presence of African enemies also fighting alongside the British with their customary tribal arms also added to Ashanti woes. Supposed advanced technology in this case, the gun, became ironically, a handicap for the indigenous forces. By contrast, the Zulu retained the effective use of their traditional spears, generally forcing the British to remain in packed defensive formations or entrenched strongpoints, protected by guns and artillery.|$|R
5000|$|John Straker, Silver Blaze's late trainer, {{has been}} killed by {{a blow to the}} skull, assumed to have been {{administered}} by Simpson with his [...] "Penang lawyer", a clublike walking stick. Simpson's cravat is also found in Straker's hand, and the latter's coat is found draped over a furze <b>bush.</b> A <b>knife</b> is found at the crime scene—a peculiarly delicate-looking one, with a small blade. Dr. Watson, from his medical experience, identifies it as a cataract knife used for the most delicate surgery - useful as it is for that purpose, it would be unsuitable as a weapon; in addition, Straker also seems to have stabbed himself in the hip with it.|$|R
50|$|Each man {{typically}} took a rifle or shotgun (double barrel recommended) {{and occasional}} pistol {{along with the}} necessary balls, gunpowder and primers for hunting game and protection against snakes and Indians. Many took their fishing gear along—at least lines and hooks as a usable pole could usually be cut from a willow or other <b>bush.</b> Belt <b>knives</b> or folding knives were carried by nearly all men and boys and considered essential. Farm tools such as a plow, pick, shovel, scythe, rake, hoe; plus carpentry tools—saw, hammer, nails, broad axe, mallet, plane were often carried along. Farmers typically took seeds for corn, wheat and other crops. Some even included fruit trees and vines in their loads. Awls, scissors, pins, needles, thread and leather laces to repair clothes, shoes, harnesses, equipment and occasionally people were constantly in use. Spare leather used for repairs was often needed and used. Goggles to keep dust out of eyes were used by some. Storage boxes for food and supplies were often the same height {{so they could be}} arranged to give a flat surface inside the wagon for sleeping during bad weather. If the cargo weighed too much, and it often did initially, these boxes were typically discarded and nearly everything put into bags.|$|R
50|$|After the lunch, Gagin {{returns to}} the bus depot where he {{retrieves}} the check and follows the fiesta crowd to the Tip Top Cafe. He meets with Hugo, who is having dinner with his associates. Hugo tells Gagin that the bank messenger with {{the money will be}} late. Marjorie invites Gagin to dance with her, and in order to not be seen by Hugo, she walks Gagin outside to a dark alley. There, she tells him that there is no messenger, but someone else. The response to Gagin's query as to who is coming is two toughs who jump him. In the ensuing fight, one of them stabs Gagin in the right shoulder with a knife. Retz finds the two toughs in the alley, one dead and one with a broken arm, and confronts Hugo at the dining table. While the police search the area, Pila finds Gagin in the <b>bushes,</b> pulls the <b>knife</b> out of his back, and together they make their way back to Pancho and the merry go round.|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{information}} that rape primarily occurs between acquaintances {{has not only}} exploded our understanding of this problem, but forced a reexamination of our notions of prevention. In recent years, {{the vast majority of}} rape prevention programs have taken the format of educa-tional workshops, with the underlying assumption that change in rape-supportive ideologies will decrease the actual incidence of sexual ag-gression. This article critically reviews such rape prevention education wi:h particular focus on common techniques such as: "debunking " rape mythology, generating participant interaction, providing sexuality edu-cation and a feminist orientation, and avoiding confrontational a p proaches. Finally, theoretical and practical concerns are discussed re-garding previous experiences of sexual victimization or perpetration, the conceptualization and use of outcome measures, issues of program facilitation, and processes underlying change in rape-supportive ideolo-gies. It is concluded that future research must seriously address these many issues through thoughtful conceptualization and rigorous experi-mentation, so that the promise of rape prevention can be fully realized. Within the American consciousness exists a stereotypic rape. The rape is perpetrated by a psychopathic man hiding in the <b>bushes</b> with a <b>knife,</b> waiting to attack an unsuspecting young woman as she walks by. The woman fights strenuously during the rape, and after the attack she pro-Thanks go to Thom Moore, Louise Fitzgerald, Pat Morey, and the anonymous reviewers for their invaluable assistance in the preparation of this manuscript.
