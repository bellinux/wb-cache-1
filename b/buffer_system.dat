5|$|To {{give the}} paratroops some {{artillery}} support, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Blyth of the 2/4th Field Regiment proposed dropping {{some of its}} eight short 25-pounders by parachute. A call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected. On 30 August, Vasey watched them carry out a practice jump at Rogers Airfield. This {{turned out to be}} the easy part. Brand new guns were received from the 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot at Port Moresby on 23 August. Two were handed over for training while, as a precaution, the remaining six were sent the 2/117th Field Workshops for inspection and checking. All six were condemned, owing to a number of serious defects in assembly and manufacture. On 30 August, the gunners received orders to move out the next day, so the 2/51st Light Aid Detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns, which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun. Only one was ready in time to leave with the gunners so the other followed on a special flight. Eight of the 2/4th Field Regiment’s Mark II 25-pounders were also condemned owing to the presence of filings in the <b>buffer</b> <b>system.</b> Vasey was less than impressed.|$|E
25|$|Boric acid in {{equilibrium}} {{with its}} conjugate base the borate ion {{is widely used}} (in the concentration range 50 - 100ppm boron equivalents) as a primary or adjunct pH <b>buffer</b> <b>system</b> in swimming pools. Boric acid is a weak acid, with pKa (the pH at which buffering is strongest because the free acid and borate ion are in equal concentrations) of 9.24 in pure water at 25°C. But apparent pKa is substantially lower in swimming pool or ocean waters because of interactions with various other molecules in solution. It will be around 9.0 in a salt-water pool. No matter which form of soluble boron is added, within the acceptable range of pH and boron concentration for swimming pools, boric acid is the predominant form in aqueous solution, {{as shown in the}} accompanying figure. The boric acid - borate system can be useful as a primary <b>buffer</b> <b>system</b> (substituting for the bicarbonate system with pKa1 = 6.0 and pKa2 = 9.4 under typical salt-water pool conditions) in pools with salt-water chlorine generators that tend to show upward drift in pH from a working range of pH 7.5 - 8.2. Buffer capacity is greater against rising pH (towards the pKa around 9.0), as illustrated in the accompanying graph. The use of boric acid in this concentration range does not allow any reduction in free HOCl concentration needed for pool sanitation, but it may add marginally to the photo-protective effects of cyanuric acid and confer other benefits through anti-corrosive activity or perceived water softness, depending on overall pool solute composition.|$|E
500|$|The product {{improvement}} program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic <b>buffer</b> <b>system</b> to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual gas port settings were reduced to only one; variants with the {{product improvement}} kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E

In this work, the influence of medium supplementation, with different <b>buffer</b> <b>systems</b> at two different concentrations and pH conditions, on the morphology of T. reesei Rut C- 30 and cellulase production, was investigated. A medium without buffer was used as control. The results suggest that fungal morphology is significantly dependent on the addition of different <b>buffer</b> <b>systems</b> to the nutrient broth.

500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} using an in-house multi-platform proprietary engine called ASKA (tri-Ace Superlative Knowledge-based Architecture), {{developed by a}} team led by Gotanda. The engine was in development since 2005 and was used for three different games in tandem: Resonance of Fate, Infinite Undiscovery and [...] While the staff were satisfied with its performance, it had to be customized for this game's specific needs. The engine employs multiple advanced graphics and lighting techniques, including high-dynamic-range rendering, and multiple layered shader tools to manage graphical layers and shadow effects. Motion blur effects were implemented using techniques {{similar to those of the}} second-generation CryEngine. Creating realistic blurring during camera movement was complicated by graphical inconsistencies generated by ASKA's structure. A separate graphics <b>buffer</b> <b>system</b> was designed to address the issue. Environments and characters employ a relatively low number of polygons in order to free up resources to render the main cast, whose character models use at least four times as many polygons as models in the PlayStation 2 era. The main characters' faces use 40 bones for facial movement and their hair use 250. This enables more detailed facial expressions compared to the [...] "doll"-like facial movements of earlier video game characters. Character hair uses additional shaders and layered textures to give it a lifelike appearance and behavior. The physics simulation was similar to that used for , but improved and expanded to suit the new hardware's capacity. There were minor differences between the graphical effects and performances of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 titles. Shadow and blurring effects were more sophisticated on 360. The estimated frame rate of 30fps was identical across both versions. The team managed to fit all the game's content onto a single disc for both versions while keeping load times short. This was due to the staff not wanting players to know when they had reached the halfway point, prolonging the sense of adventure.|$|E

2500|$|Most SDS-PAGE protein separations are {{performed}} using a [...] "discontinuous" [...] (or DISC) <b>buffer</b> <b>system</b> that significantly enhances {{the sharpness of}} the bands within the gel.

The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, {{which leads to a}} sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins.|$|E
2500|$|LDH {{works to}} prevent muscular failure and fatigue in {{multiple}} ways. [...] The lactate-forming reaction generates cytosolic NAD+, which feeds into the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction {{to help maintain}} cytosolic redox potential and promote substrate flux through {{the second phase of}} glycolysis to promote ATP generation. [...] This, in effect, provides more energy to contracting muscles under heavy workloads. [...] The production and removal of lactate from the cell also ejects a proton consumed in the LDH reaction- the removal of excess protons produced in the wake of this fermentation reaction serves to act as a <b>buffer</b> <b>system</b> for muscle acidosis. [...] Once proton accumulation exceeds the rate of uptake in lactate production and removal through the LDH symport, muscular acidosis occurs.|$|E

30|$|The {{buffer action}} of {{homogeneous}} metal <b>buffer</b> <b>systems</b> {{is based on}} complexation reactions. The ligands, capable to bind the metals, thus, reducing their concentrations, {{appear to be a}} part of the resistance mechanism. The presence of excess ligand may fix the concentration of free metal ions at some value. If an additional amount of metal is added to the buffered solution, its concentration will be changed only slightly. This action is analogous to the acid-base buffer, and hence solutions containing an excess of chelating agent can be regarded as “metal buffers”.

5000|$|In various animals, {{including}} humans, acid-base homeostasis {{is maintained}} {{by means of}} three interconnected systems. The first are the various chemical buffers which minimize pH changes that would otherwise occur in their absence. They do not correct pH deviations, but only serve to limit {{the extent of the}} change that would otherwise occur. These buffers include the bicarbonate <b>buffer</b> <b>system,</b> the phosphate <b>buffer</b> <b>system,</b> and the protein <b>buffer</b> <b>system.</b> Physiological corrective measures make use of, primarily, the bicarbonate <b>buffer</b> <b>system.</b> This is because abnormalities in the carbonic acid (H2CO3, or dissolved carbon dioxide) concentration in the blood plasma can rapidly be corrected by variations in the rate and depth of breathing (i.e. by hyperventilation or hypoventilation). Abnormally low or high plasma bicarbonate (...) ion concentrations can be corrected by the excretion of H+ or [...] ions in the urine, in instances where the plasma pH is abnormal. Plasma pH abnormalities are known as acidemia or alkalemia depending on which way the pH has deviated from normal.|$|E

40|$|Conservative <b>buffered</b> <b>systems</b> {{involving}} ligand binding. Binding and debinding reactions {{stabilize the}} free concentration of numerous solutes. Examples include binding proteins for various hormones such as transthyretin [1], sex hormone binding globulin [2], corticosteroid binding proteins [3, 4], growth hormone binding protein [5], the soluble leptin receptor [6, 7], IGF-binding proteins [8], or proteins that bind exogenous, possibly toxic substances such as quinidine or vanadate [9, 10]. Importantly, binding and debinding is also {{crucial for the}} transport and storage of oxygen and carbon dioxide [11, 12]. The extent of buffering is sometimes considerable, and manipulating the concentration of the respective buffers or “binding proteins ” will have clear physiological or pathophysiological consequences. All such processes are immediately amenable to analysis in terms of conservative <b>buffered</b> <b>systems</b> and the buffering parameters t, b, T, and B, even though binding may obey different quantitative relations as the simple Langmuir-like behavior explored in this section. Conservative <b>buffered</b> <b>systems</b> that do not involve ligand binding Our buffering concept and units are suited to quantitate H + buffering in pure water and in solutions of weak acids. However, they can be applied readily to phenomena that are brought about by mechanisms different from those prevailing in classical acid-base buffering. Two examples shall demonstrate that even simple chemical systems can display “perfect buffering ” or even “amplification”. Furthermore, we try to sketch out how the concept of conservative <b>buffered</b> <b>systems</b> may serve to quantitate “redox buffering”, a phenomenon for which no satisfactory buffering strength unit seems available to date. “Perfect buffering ”- a solute beyond its solubility (Figure 1 A) Consider a solution of KCl in water.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of buffering and “muffling ” {{are closely related}} to the paradigms of signal processing and of systems and control theory. In the previous sections, we established a framework that could handle <b>buffered</b> <b>systems</b> even when they were dimensionally heterogeneous (e. g. autoregulation of flow in the face of pressure variations) or time dependent (e. g. the “muffling ” of calcium). Control systems can be viewed as systems that are both, i. e., dimensionally heterogeneous and time dependent. By combining the two approaches established above, our buffering concept can be extended to systems and control theory. This extension will prove fruitful inasmuch it allows one to derive 1) two novel quantitative measures of “systems level buffering ” in time-independent, stationary systems, and 2) two novel measures of control efficiency in time-dependent, non-stationary systems. More generally, this extension allows one to accommodate buffering and muffling within the language of control theory; as homeostatic mechanisms, this is where they belong.
