50|$|In 1769, the Comte de Jaucourt, {{the heir}} of the Comtesse de Vassé, sold the château to Augustin-Louis-Marie Rouillé, the chevalier and seigneur of Vaugien. That same year, Rouillé sold the {{usufruct}} {{of the property}} to Madame de Saint-Martin, whose husband obtained the right to exploit the ice ponds in the surrounding park. Subsequently, in 1781, Rouillé, ruined financially, also sold the <b>bare</b> <b>ownership</b> of the property to the Villemoriens. In 1784, they obtained full ownership by purchasing the rights of usufruct from the heir of the widowed Madame de Saint-Martin.|$|E
50|$|A celebrated playwright, he {{surrounded}} {{himself with}} a circle of performers and artists who flattered him and enthusiastically attended the lavish receptions he hosted in his residence in Marly. Victorien Sardou also {{became involved in the}} daily life of the commune of Marly, but he met his match when he attempted to organize a genuine “counter-revolution.” Despite this setback, he kept his beloved Château des Sphinx. When he died in 1908, the usufruct of the property was granted to his wife, while the <b>bare</b> <b>ownership</b> went to his four children. They recovered the right of usufruct when their mother died and sold the property to Bertrand-Louis-Eugène Mir.|$|E

Bobb and Dr. William M. Eldon — became {{partners}} and/or managers in one of Bare's largely family-controlled companies. Throughout his working life, Bare retained partners in most of his business ventures, although he appears to have maintained control over these operations either through intermediaries or family members. The paper mill was incorporated in 1907 and the <b>Bare</b> family retained <b>ownership</b> until 1946 when the business was sold to a paper company from Wisconsin.12 ...|$|R

Prior his departure, he had sought {{professional}} advice on the tax implications relating to his assets which eventually led to him setting up an elaborate scheme to avoid adverse exchange control implications. The scheme involved him, inter alia, vesting the beneficial interests in both the assets and the income in a British Virgin Islands company {{through a series of}} agreements. In consequence to all his transactional activity, according to Mr Krok, he ceded all his South African income and assets to a company except for the <b>bare</b> <b>ownership</b> thereof, and he had no income or capital gains on which he could be taxed by the ATO under the agreements. On 29 December 2008, Mr Krok again emigrated from Australia to the United Kingdom. He set up a similar tax avoidance scheme in respect of which he purported to transfer to the second appellant, Jucool Enterprises Inc. (Jucool), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, his assets situated in South Africa. In 2009, the ATO launched an audit of Mr Krok’s taxation affairs as part of a government initiative investigating participation by Australians in internationally promoted tax arrangements to identify taxpayers involved in significant offshore transactions or large transfers of funds to or from Australia. Resultant, the ATO held Mr Krok liable for $25 361 875.79 plus interest.” The ATO’s investigation also revealed Krok’s illegal use of funds while his assets were frozen, noting that Krok used South African credit cards from blocked assets for purchases ranging from the purchasing and renovation of multiple holiday homes, private payments to his mother and the purchasing of 2010 FIFA World Cup tickets.|$|E
