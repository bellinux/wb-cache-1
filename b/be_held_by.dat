5|$|An {{agreement}} {{called the}} Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks, {{which had the}} majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) a referendum on independence was proposed to <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>by</b> 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as they felt that France would never allow them independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1691, Arsenije {{struck a}} deal with Leopold I, who was Holy Roman Emperor and King of Hungary, whereby the Habsburgs granted the Serbs ecclesiastic {{autonomy}} and some degree of self-administration, much to the displeasure of the Roman Catholic Church and Hungarian authorities. Leopold recognized Arsenije as the leader of Habsburg Serbs in both religious and secular affairs, and indicated that this power would <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>by</b> all future Archbishops. In 1712, Sremski Karlovci became the Patriarchate for Serbs living in the Habsburg Empire.|$|E
5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to drive away intruding males and other species.

5|$|A Passover Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the Passover holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>by</b> any group of Jews, such as members of a synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt.

While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>by</b> central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable for gold and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged for gold. The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E

5|$|In 1702, King William III died, and Anne became Queen. Anne {{immediately}} offered John Churchill a dukedom, which Sarah initially refused.

Anne countered by offering the Marlboroughs a pension of £5000 a year, for life, from Parliament, as well as an extra £2000 a year from the Privy Purse, and they accepted the Dukedom. Sarah was promptly created Mistress of the Robes (the highest office in the royal court that could <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>by</b> a woman), Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and Ranger of Windsor Great Park. The Duke accepted the Order of the Garter, as well as the office of Captain-General of the army.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Kabila {{was shot}} dead inside his palace. The Congolese {{government}} claimed Kabila {{had been killed by}} a rogue bodyguard, who was himself killed at the scene. According to a report published in French newspaper Le Monde, Kabila was killed by the kadogo, an army of child soldiers he was known to have assembled during the First Congo War. The kadogo had suffered badly during the battles in Kasai and Katanga, were poorly paid, and had become alienated by Kabila. Kabila's son Joseph was appointed president and immediately began asserting his authority by dismissing his father's cabinet and senior army commanders, assembling a new government, and engaging with the international community. The new government provided impetus for renewed peace negotiations, and in July 2002 a peace agreement was reached between Rwanda, Congo, and the other major participants, in which all foreign troops would withdraw and RCD-Goma would enter a power-sharing transitional government with Joseph Kabila as interim president until elections could <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> <b>By</b> the end of 2002, all uniformed Rwandan troops had left Congolese territory.|$|E

5|$|In her legend, Haumea's many {{children}} came from {{different parts of}} her body. The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of rock, with only a superficial layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle is thought to have been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could <b>be</b> <b>held</b> <b>by</b> Haumea's gravitational influence (its Hill sphere).

5|$|The Cuu Long {{conference held}} between 6 and 10 October {{was the first}} provincial-level conference to <b>be</b> <b>held.</b> <b>By</b> 22 October, 21 provinces had held provincial-level party conferences. The central party {{leadership}} faced less criticism on the draft Political Report and socio-economic policies from the provincial-level conferences than by district-level conferences. The provincial-level conferences criticized central policies less and were evasive about critical issues. However, the provincial-level conferences were not completely dormant and scored some minor victories, such as reducing the average age needed to join an executive committee and they adopted a more flexible and efficient mode of planning and organization. As during the district-level conferences, there were certain convocations which attracted attention; the An Giang Party Committee criticized past economic performance, while the Ha Son Binh Congress criticized the irrational management of provincial economic affairs. While these committees criticized past policies or well-known deficiencies, none of them criticized {{the policies of the}} central party leadership.|$|E
