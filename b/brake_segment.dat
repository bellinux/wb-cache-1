5000|$|On May 16, 1999, a 365 lb (165 kg) guest {{was unable}} to close his lap bar {{properly}} and was ejected and fell approximately 9 ft from the Superman - Ride of Steel roller coaster as the ride went over a camel hump hill, suffering serious injuries. He sued the park and the ride manufacturer for negligence, and was awarded US$3.95 million. Seatbelts and an extra <b>brake</b> <b>segment</b> before the final hill {{were added to the}} coaster after the incident.|$|E
50|$|On July 29, 2005, 25 {{guests were}} injured when the purple train rear-ended the red train. Of the 48 guests aboard the two trains, 15 {{were taken to}} the {{hospital}} for treatment of minor injuries. The accident occurred on the section of track about 30 ft short of the loading station. A full ride stop was activated with the red train stopped. The <b>brake</b> <b>segment</b> that was supposed to have stopped the purple train failed, and the purple train continued until it collided with the stopped red train. An investigation showed that a faulty brake valve, installed a few days earlier by Disney (not by the ride manufacturer Intamin), was the cause.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is design and production of the prototype brake pad for high bicycle with FDM 3 D printer. The first part {{is devoted to the}} basic principle of Rapid Prototyping and FDM technology, materials used for 3 D printing and a history of high bicycles. The second part is dedicated to design a 3 D model in Autodesk Inventor Professional 2016, the manufacturing process of <b>brake</b> <b>segments</b> and eventually technological-economic evaluation...|$|R
5000|$|According to the Gerstlauer website, the {{manufacture}} has two different models of its spinning roller coaster collection and one where a park can customize to fit its desires. The Joker {{is the only}} spinning roller coaster in the company that is the 400 model are the 420 model. The 400 model, is shorter at 48 ft, more compact, and has a lower capacity. The layout consists of several [...] "segments" [...] separated by <b>brakes.</b> The first <b>segment</b> comprises a swooping drop and climb into the second segment, which {{is a series of}} S-shaped turns. The third segment is a heavily banked figure-8; the fourth is a series of hills that form a semicircle; the fifth is a pair of small hills; and the sixth is a helix into the seventh segment; a long loop, which leads to a massive hill, and finally into the brake run. For most of the ride, the cart is spinning around rapidly.|$|R
40|$|Number of good {{vehicles}} of wheel two and wheel four now is estimated reachs number tens of million units. More than anything else, replacement of brake pad <b>brake</b> in <b>segment</b> of this vehicle one year can more than twice. So among industry brake pad raw material material problem still depend on material or expensive import material. One of solution {{to get the}} price of product which more competitive is by the way of doing material engineering with aim to depress price, by the way of substitution and selection “ raw material” what has coefficient to fiddle height and has competitive price. In this research done expansion of sintered technique with various detention time of material applied by coconut fiber powder, phonelic resin, and brass powder. Originally coconut fiber waste is refined with blender then is sieved with mesh 30. Coconut fiber powder mixed with brass powder, and ponelich resin with composition applied by coconut fiber powder 28 grams, brass 084 grams and resin 56 grams by using blender. Brake pad is made with printed at compaction machine and heated at temperature 150 oC during 90, 120 and 150 minutes. Hereinafter brake pad is hardness test it and characteristic test so that knowable brake pad performance. Result of hardness of Brinell specimen 21, 88 and coefficient fiddles 2 for brake pad factory brake while hardiness 18, 82, 18, 19, and 20, 46 and coefficient fiddles 0, 5, 0, 4 and 2. for prototype with sinter temperature 150 oC during 90, 120 and 150 minutes.

5000|$|According to the Gerstlauer website, the {{manufacture}} has two different models of its spinning roller coaster collection and one where a park can customize to fit its desires. The five Pandemoniums make up {{both of the}} two, the 400 and the 420. Each model has different statistics, so the Pandemoniums range in height from 52 ft to 54 ft with the same speed of 31 mph. Discovery Kingdom was the only park to feature the 400 as the others were the 420 model. The 400 model, is shorter at 48 ft, more compact, and had a lower capacity. The layout consists of several [...] "segments" [...] separated by <b>brakes.</b> The first <b>segment</b> comprises a swooping drop and climb into the second segment, which {{is a series of}} S-shaped turns.
