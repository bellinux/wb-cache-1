We show that blog exposure is fundamentally different from the traditional media coverage, and securities with low blog exposure earn higher returns than stocks with high blog exposure. We further illustrate that such an effect is more prominent for stocks with low institutional ownership. Contrary to traditional media coverage, the return premium associated with blog exposure cannot be explained by either the illiquidity hypothesis or the investor recognition hypothesis based on the rational-agent framework. Instead, our results suggest that blog effect {{can be attributed to the}} limited attention theory and cannot be arbitraged due to investors’ self-attribution and short-sale constraints.

In this paper we study how to automatically integrate opinions expressed in a well-written expert review with lots of opinions scattering in various sources such as <b>blogspaces</b> and forums. We formally define this new integration problem and propose to use semi-supervised topic models to solve the problem in a principled way. Experiments on integrating opinions about two quite different topics (a product and a political figure) show that the proposed method is effective for both topics and can generate useful aligned integrated opinion summaries. The proposed method is quite general.

40|$|We propose two {{new tools}} {{to address the}} {{evolution}} of hyperlinked corpora. First, we define time graphs to extend the traditional notion of an evolving directed graph, capturing link creation as a point phenomenon in time. Second, we develop definitions and algorithms for time-dense community tracking, to crystallize the notion of community evolution. We develop these tools {{in the context of}} <b>Blogspace,</b> the space of weblogs (or blogs). Our study involves approximately 750 K links among 25 K blogs. We create a time graph on these blogs by an automatic analysis of their internal time stamps. We then study the evolution of connected component structure and microscopic community structure in this time graph. We show that <b>Blogspace</b> underwent a transition behavior around the end of 2001, and has been rapidly expanding over the past year, not just in metrics of scale, but also in metrics of community structure and connectedness. This expansion shows no sign of abating, although measures of connectedness must plateau within two years. By randomizing link destinations in <b>Blogspace,</b> but retaining sources and timestamps, we introduce a concept of randomized <b>Blogspace.</b> Herein, we observe similar evolution of a giant component, but no corresponding increase in community structure. Having demonstrated the formation of micro-communities over time, we then turn to the ongoing activity within active communities. We extend recent work of Kleinberg [11] to discover dense periods of “bursty ” intra-community link creation...|$|E

Typically emerging from existing interest communities, p 2 p publications frequently cater for topics which are absent from the mainstream media. Their basis in the community can lead to the publishing and discussion of news and information in a highly topical, well-informed fashion, which has also made such models highly attractive to online activist groups. Common to such sites is that the role of site owners and editors appears largely to be limited to maintenance interventions, rather than content-editorial screening and filtering. The selection and editing of content, on the other hand, is usually in the hands of site users themselves, often (as in the case of sites like Slashdot. org with its 500, 000 registered users) through elaborate selfmoderation systems. Compared to traditional news and commentary publications, therefore, new power structures can emerge which affect these publications in specific ways. If in these sites we see the emergence of common models for designing communication for diverse communities, it is necessary to investigate whether these site models provide suitable vehicles for information exchange and communication for more than simply the usual techno-geek groups that are already overrepresented in Internet communication structures. This paper describes peer-to-peer publications as a continuum of publishing approaches ranging from isolated, single-writer blogs to widely recognised, large-community open publishing Websites; it notes commonalities and differences amongst these related models along the way. It makes reference to typical examples of p 2 p publishing sites and points out potential benefits and problems inherent in these publishing forms.

Our characterization of over 35 million read, write, and administrative requests spanning a 28 -day period is done from three different blogosphere perspectives. The server view characterizes the aggregate access patterns of all users to all blogs; the user view characterizes how individual users interact with blogosphere objects (blogs); the object view characterizes how individual blogs are accessed. Our findings support two important conclusions. First, we show that the nature of interactions between users and objects is fundamentally different in <b>blogspace</b> than that observed in traditional web content. Access to objects in <b>blogspace</b> could be conceived as part of an interaction between an author and its readership. As we show in our work, such interactions range from one-to-many “broadcast-type” and many-to-one “registration-type ” communication between an author and its readers, to multi-way, iterative “parlortype” dialogues among members of an interest group. This more-interactive nature of the blogosphere leads to interesting traffic and communication patterns, which are different from those observed in traditional web content.

Exploring the <b>Blogspace</b> From {{the point of view of}} information access, the <b>blogspace</b> offers many natural opportunities beyond traditional search facilities, such as trend detection, topic tracking, link tracking, feed generation, etc. But there is more. Many blog authoring environments allow bloggers to tag their entries with highly individual (and personal) features. Users of LiveJournal, currently the largest weblog community, have the option of reporting their mood at the time of the post; users can either select a mood from a predefined list of 132 common moods such as “amused ” or “angry, ” or enter free-text. A large percentage of LiveJournal users chooses to utilize this option, tagging their postings with a mood. This results in a stream of hundreds of weblog posts tagged with mood information per minute, from hundreds of thousands of different users across the globe. Our focus in this demo is on providing access to the <b>blogspace</b> using moods as the “central” dimension. The type of information needs that we are interested in are best illustrated by questions such as: How do moods develop? How are they related? How do global events impact moods? And: Can global mood swings be traced back to global events? We describe MoodViews, a collection of tools for analyzing, tracking and visualizing moods and mood changes in blogs posted by LiveJournal users.

We identify and characterize novel features of the blogosphere workload, and we show the similarities and differences between typical web server workloads and blogosphere server workloads.

Design/methodology/approach - In this paper a variety of blog searching techniques are described and illustrated with a case study of the Danish cartoons affair. Findings - A time series analysis of related blog postings suggests that the Danish cartoons issue attracted little attention in the English-speaking world for four months after the initial publication of the cartoons, exploding only after the simultaneous start of diplomatic sanctions and a commercial boycott. Research limitations/implications – Blogs only reveal the opinions of bloggers, and blog analysis is language-specific. Sections of the world and the population of individual countries that do not have access to the internet will not be adequately represented in <b>blogspace.</b> Moreover, bloggers are self-selected and probably not representative of internet users. Originality/value - The existence of blog search engines now allows researchers to search <b>blogspace</b> for posts relating to any given debate, seeking either the opinions of blogging pundits or casual mentions in personal journals.

Such communities can be illustrated in terms of bipartite graphs based on weblog update information, and they can effectively function to create meeting spaces for bloggers who write about similar or closely related topics but do not know each other. To extract these communities from <b>blogspace,</b> I developed a partitioning algorithm known as the Weakest Pair (WP) algorithm, which separates the weakest pairs of bloggers and webpages, respectively, using co-citation information. As a result of numerical evaluation, the WP algorithm is more effective than the Shortest Path Betweenness (SPB) algorithm in terms of information loss and completeness of bipartite graphs. I will provide three examples of LBC extracted using the WP algorithm and report its secondary effects, i. e. personae detection, the detection of a set of weblogs owned by a single blogger...|$|E

40|$|How do blogs cite and {{influence}} each other? How do such links evolve? Does {{the popularity of}} old blog posts drop exponentially with time? These {{are some of the}} questions that we address in this work. Blogs (weblogs) have become an important medium of information because of their timely publication, ease of use, and wide availability. In fact, they often make headlines, by discussing and discovering evidence about political events and facts. Often blogs link to one another, creating a publicly available record of how information {{and influence}} spreads through an underlying social network. Aggregating links from several blog posts creates a directed graph which we analyze to discover the patterns of information propagation in <b>blogspace,</b> and thereby understand the underlying social network. Here we report some surprising findings of the blog linking and information propagation structure, after we analyzed one of the largest available datasets, with 45, 000 blogs and ≈ 2. 2 million blog-postings. Our analysis also sheds light on how rumors, viruses, and ideas propagate over social and computer networks. ...|$|E

Our {{objective is to}} allow users to interactively understand the <b>blogspace</b> by providing a system framework for retrieving relevant weblogs and obtaining highlighted information.

We introduce weighted link-based weblog ranking, which ranks the popularity of weblogs according to their entry semantic content and time delay of citation. Furthermore, our weblog ranking algorithms provide the flexibility to rank weblogs not only based on their different roles in the society, but also based on end-users ’ different ranking interests. The second component is hot story summarization. A hot story is the discussion that attracts various weblogs ’ attention. Influential bloggers are useful in identifying hot conversations because these bloggers {{are likely to be}} the leader in such conversations. We propose a method based on first discovering weblogs that take important roles in the society, and then extracting hot story from these important weblogs. 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Blogspace</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic areas of today’s Internet, and it is {{increasingly}} recognised that blogs are much more than “meaningless chatter”. Many syntax-based approaches exist to analyse the text and the net-work structure between blogs. While this is very helpful for purposes such as the detection of discussion bursts concerning uniquely-named topics (e. g., a book, prod-uct, or person), it is insufficient for understanding blogs discussing new phenomena in different wordings, or for finding and explaining relationships between new dis-course topics or the context of a new topic in a larger domain of discourse. In this paper, we propose two methods for semantics-enhanced blogs analysis that al-low the analyst to integrate domain-specific as well as general background knowledge. The methods rely on the Term Extractor for identifying keyphrases (Navigli & Velardi, 2004), SSI (Structural Semantic Intercon-nections) for disambiguating terms (Navigli & Velardi, 2005), and the taxonomy of domain labels by (Magnini & Cavaglià, 2000). Applications include topic detection and grouping, the proposal of blog tags and the forming of blog directories, and blog recommender systems. To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we present a detailed experimental analysis of a sample of four sets of blogs with different thematic foci (food, health, law, and weblogs about blogging) ...|$|E
40|$|Although topic {{detection}} and tracking techniques have made great progress, {{most of the}} researchers seldom {{pay more attention to}} the following two aspects. First, the construction of a topic model does not take the characteristics of different topics into consideration. Second, the factors that determine the formation and development of hot topics are not further analyzed. In order to correctly extract news blog hot topics, the paper views the above problems in a new perspective based on the W 2 T (Wisdom Web of Things) methodology, in which the characteristics of blog users, context of topic propagation and information granularity are investigated in a unified way. The motivations and features of blog users are first analyzed to understand the characteristics of news blog topics. Then the context of topic propagation is decomposed into the blog community, topic network and opinion network, respectively. Some important factors such as the user behavior pattern, opinion leader and network opinion are identified to track the development trends of news blog topics. Moreover, a blog hot {{topic detection}} algorithm is proposed, in which news blog hot topics are identified by measuring the duration, topic novelty, attention degree of users and topic growth.

40|$|Social Work {{education}} has {{for some time}} laboured under the tag of being somewhat behind the times {{in relation to the}} use of elearning, and at the University of Western Australia (UWA) this idea rings true. One {{reason for this is that}} pedagogies within Social Work tend to hold true to the people-oriented nature of the discipline, and it has been difficult to see how technology can replicate this aspect of the field. Nevertheless, the problem exists that Social Work students are very often lacking in some of the digital literacies that are increasingly becoming important in the workplace, and as in other discipline areas, it is incumbent upon educators in this area to provide their students with opportunities to develop such competencies. The challenge, then, was two-fold: find a way to introduce technologies that are of relevance to the discipline, and overcome the resistence Social Work students show toward such technologies in general. Blogging was trialled in an upper level Social Work unit at UWA which focussed on the development of communities and community practice and, despite uniformly negative feedback from the students on the perceived “difficulty ” of the technology, the blog entries and comments themselves showed clear evidence of the students having developed as a community of learners.
