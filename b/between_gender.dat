5|$|Catherine Rottenberg {{argues that}} Larsen’s novella {{is a prime}} example of race and gender norms portrayed in the US. The main characters, Irene and Clare, and their {{struggle}} with their own identification problems in the novel, helps readers understand the difference <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> and race norms. These two central characters are able to pass as white women even though Irene does not fully pass over, and Rottenberg argues the difference between Clare and Irene by re-evaluating the idea of desire/identification. The mis-identification Clare deals with stems from her re-connection with Irene after twelve years of not speaking. Seeing Irene sparked a desire in Clare for her to get back in touch with her African-American culture. Irene's identification trouble is associated with her need to feel safe and in control in her life, the main reason Irene chooses to pass over only on occasion. Irene doesn't want to put herself into a dangerous situation.|$|E
5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance of gender in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation of gender a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

The second series began airing on 24 October 2011, while the third began on 1 November 2012.|$|E
25|$|Contextual {{factors that}} are thought to {{contribute}} to anxiety include gender socialization and learning experiences. In particular, learning mastery (the degree to which people perceive their lives to be under their own control) and instrumentality, which includes such traits as self-confidence, independence, and competitiveness fully mediate the relation <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> and anxiety. That is, though gender differences in anxiety exist, {{with higher levels of}} anxiety in women compared to men, gender socialization and learning mastery explain these gender differences. Research has demonstrated the ways in which facial prominence in photographic images differs between men and women. More specifically, in official online photographs of politicians around the world, women's faces are less prominent than men's. Interestingly enough, the difference in these images actually tended to be greater in cultures with greater institutional gender equality.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{identity}} is one's personal experience of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it completely. All societies {{have a set}} of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. In most societies, there is a basic division <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression. In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; In some cases, a person's gender {{identity is}} inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity), and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called Gender Identity Disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.|$|E

500|$|David Gates of Newsweek contrasted Eugenides' debut novel The Virgin Suicides with Middlesex, {{writing that}} the first novel was [...] "ingenious", [...] "entertaining", and [...] "oddly moving", but that Middlesex is [...] "ingenious", [...] "entertaining", and [...] "ultimately not-so-moving". Despite this criticism, Gates {{considered}} Middlesex to be the novel where Eugenides [...] "finally plays his metafictional ace".

Max Watman of The New Criterion concurred, noting that Middlesex is [...] "funny, big, embracing, and wonderful", unlike Eugenides' first novel. Mark Lawson of The Guardian praised Middlesex for having the same unique qualities as The Virgin Suicides, commenting that Middlesex had [...] "an ability to describe the horrible in a comic voice, an unusual form of narration and an eye for bizarre detail."

500|$|Bell et al. {{rejected}} many accepted {{ideas about}} the development of homosexuality. They concluded that psychodynamic theories exaggerate the role of parents in the development of their sons' sexual orientation, and that the psychoanalytic model that attributed male homosexuality to dominant mothers and weak fathers is inadequate, there being barely any connection between boys' relationships with their mothers and the development of homosexuality. Bell et al. found the idea that [...] "cold, detached" [...] fathers and poor father-son relationships predispose boys toward homosexuality more plausible, but emphasized that these factors have only an indirect connection to sexual preference. Bell et al. suggested that relationships with parents might play a greater {{role in the development of}} female homosexuality, although they found having a cold or distant father less significant as a cause of female than of male homosexuality. They also rejected various sociological theories, such as the idea that homosexuality results from labeling by others. Overall, they concluded that sexual preference is likely to be already determined by the time boys and girls reach adolescence, and that there is a powerful link <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> nonconformity and the development of homosexuality in both sexes, but especially in men. Though stressing that their model [...] "applies only to extant theories and does not create new ones", Bell et al. wrote that they had identified [...] "a pattern of feelings and reactions within the child that cannot be traced back to a single social or psychological root".|$|E
500|$|According to {{intersex}} {{activist and}} academic Morgan Holmes, Eugenides posits that a person's sexual attraction determines {{his or her}} gender. Cal's wish to become male because he desires females demonstrates a link <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> identity and sexuality. While Callie is not permitted to love the Obscure Object openly, Cal can freely love Julie. Holmes believed that the depiction of Callie [...] "denies the legitimate place of lesbian desire and rewrites it as male heterosexuality." [...] Book reviewer Georgia Warnke has a similar view. She wrote that by making these choices in the novel, Eugenides agrees {{with the belief that}} being attracted to females is [...] "masculine" [...] and thus it is [...] "more natural" [...] for a male to be attracted to a female than a female be attracted to a female. Daniel Mendelsohn of The New York Review of Books argued that Callie {{does not have to be}} a male in order to be drawn towards females; she could be gay. As an adult, Cal brags, [...] "Breasts have the same effect on me as on anyone with my testosterone level." [...] Mendelsohn noted that this assertion will astonish [...] "Eugenides's (presumably testosterone-rich) gay male readership". Scholar Rachel Carroll agreed, writing that teenage Callie's erotic interest in girls is [...] "retroactively explained and legitimized, by the discovery of his 'true biological nature'." [...] Cal's gender identity postdates rather than predates his sexual interests. Carroll posited that Cal's inability to form heterosexual relationships as an adult is founded not upon his being intersex, but on his rejection of the sexual ambiguities that form his sexual interests as a youth.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's epigrammatic {{allusion to}} Rousseau's Julie (1761) signifies her {{debt to the}} novel of sensibility, {{one of the most}} popular genres during the last half of the 18th century. Along with other female writers, such as Mary Hays, Helen Maria Williams, Charlotte Turner Smith, Mary Robinson, Maria Edgeworth, and Hannah More, Wollstonecraft felt {{compelled}} to respond to the Rousseauvean ideological aesthetic that had come to dominate British fiction. Romantic heroines, Wollstonecraft scholar Gary Kelly writes, [...] "represent woman constructed for man: the heroic feminine victim of the courtly rake and gallant, the virtuous feminine companion of the ideal professionalized gentleman, and the intellectually and erotically subservient companion of the ideal bourgeois man". Wollstonecraft would also attack Rousseau in her best-known work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, because of his sexism in the second part of Emile. She announces in the [...] "Advertisement" [...] (a section similar to a preface) of Mary that she is offering her heroine, who is a [...] "genius", as a contrast to characters such as Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Rousseau's [...] In addition the text is peppered with allusions to popular sentimental novels such as The History of Eliza Warwick (1778) and The Platonic Marriage (1787), which critique their presentation of the heroine of feminine sensibility. Mary is more akin to the charitable and industrious heroines of Bluestocking Sarah Scott's Millenium Hall (1762) than to the passive, weepy heroines found in most sentimental novels. Debate concerning the relationship <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> and sensibility continued into the early 19th century; Jane Austen, for example, made it the explicit focus of her novel Sense and Sensibility (1811).|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} Analytical Reviews third issue, Mary Wollstonecraft became the key editor for dramas, romances, and novels. Scholars {{have speculated that}} her reviews are signed by the letters [...] "M", [...] "W", or [...] "T", {{corresponding}} roughly to her initials, {{in large part because}} they have identified her writing style in these pieces. Her reviews, which number over 200, are generally characterized by their concern for women's issues. Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers concludes that Wollstonecraft [...] "is not only a pioneer feminist, but also a pioneer feminist critic, whose analysis of the mesh <b>between</b> <b>gender</b> and genre inaugurates the feminist critical project". Wollstonecraft wrote excoriating reviews, criticizing the passive novelistic heroines of the time and praising, for example, the [...] "wise and resilient" [...] Mrs Stafford of Charlotte Smith's autobiographical novel Emmeline (1788). In highlighting this character, she [...] "singles out... the knowledgeable mother figure who has felt and thought deeply", one who resembles the women she described in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) as having [...] "power... over themselves". She derides the [...] "derivative, prescriptive, imitative, and affected" [...] and celebrates the [...] "natural, innovative, [...] imaginative". Evincing a particular regard for the works of Thomas Holcroft, such as Anna St. Ives (1792), Wollstonecraft celebrated their championing of innate nobility and virtue over aristocratic titles. Romanticist Anne Chandler argues that Wollstonecraft's reviews demonstrate [...] "an earlier Augustan politics of knowledge, variously outlined by Dryden, Pope, and, to a lesser extent, Swift" [...] which [...] "may be seen in her insistence on a continuum between aesthetic integrity and civic virtue; her belief in a metaphysical dialogue between human wit and divine Nature; and her perception of belletristic criticism as the proper tribunal for a new onslaught of scholarly and scientific research". While writing her last novel, [...] (1798), Wollstonecraft took advantage of her position with Johnson and reviewed almost nothing but novels, exposing herself to the wide variety of novelistic forms.|$|E

30|$|After the {{expansion}} of higher education admissions (hereafter ‘The Expansion’) beginning in 1999, the distribution of higher education opportunities has gradually become equalized <b>between</b> <b>genders.</b> Utilizing data from the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2008), this study investigates ‘how {{the expansion}} of college admission induced gender equality in higher education opportunities.’ By focusing on how newly emerging educational opportunities are allocated <b>between</b> <b>genders,</b> this study also seeks to identify the factors that contribute most to gender equalization. The results suggest that, overall, The Expansion modified the opportunity structure <b>between</b> <b>genders.</b> Two major changes that occurred are as follows: first, women whose parents are at the middle education level (the ‘sublow cultural level’ group) received more opportunities to receive higher education, thus contributing to gender equality; second, due to The Expansion, women from rural areas are less disadvantaged in obtaining higher educational opportunity, and the difference in distribution <b>between</b> <b>genders</b> is thus reduced.
