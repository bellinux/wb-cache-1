50|$|<b>Bloodworms</b> {{are poor}} {{swimmers}} but good burrowers, {{living on the}} sandy or silty bottoms of the intertidal or subtidal regions. Though usually marine, they can tolerate low salt levels in the water, and also poor oxygen levels. <b>Bloodworms</b> and all water worms have adapted {{to life in the}} sand and silt for the protection it offers.|$|R
50|$|Julii corys are {{scavengers}} and omnivores {{that will}} eat food that sinks {{to the bottom}} of the tank.

5000|$|In the {{original}} script, {{the crew of}} the Enterprise-D came upon a derelict spaceship whose crew had all been killed off by Regulan <b>bloodworms.</b> Since these creatures are highly dangerous and can kill within hours, any ship or space station found to be infested with <b>bloodworms</b> must be sterilized and/or destroyed, per Starfleet orders. The concept of Regulan <b>bloodworms,</b> mentioned in dialogue in {{the original}} Star Trek series (but never actually explained until this episode), was intended to be a metaphor for the public's fear of AIDS. [...] Gerrold has since said that he also intended the episode to specifically address the public's fear of donating blood, and that he wanted to include a title card encouraging viewers to donate blood via the Red Cross.|$|R

50|$|In captivity, {{axolotls}} eat {{a variety}} of readily available foods, including trout and salmon pellets, frozen or live <b>bloodworms,</b> earthworms, and waxworms. Axolotls can also eat feeder fish, but care should be taken as fish may contain parasites.|$|R
50|$|Most midges, {{apart from}} the gall midges (Cecidomyiidae), are aquatic during the larval stage. Some Cecidomyiidae (e.g., the sorghum midge) are {{significant}} plant pests. The larvae of some Chironomidae contain haemoglobin and are {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>bloodworms.</b>|$|R
50|$|S. mahnerti {{requires}} {{plenty of}} hiding spaces separated by visual barriers to distinguish its territory. Although {{it can be}} taught to accept flake food in captivity, it prefers a largely carnivorous diet of mosquito larvae, <b>bloodworms,</b> and small insects.|$|R
50|$|A varied diet is very {{important}} to the dwarf gourami, which is an omnivore that prefers both algae-based foods and meaty foods. An algae-based flake food, along with freeze-dried <b>bloodworms,</b> tubifex, and brine shrimp, will provide these fish with proper nutrition.|$|R
50|$|B. bagarius is {{the only}} member of the genus even {{marginally}} suitable for home aquaria. It requires cool, fast-flowing water, and eats <b>bloodworms,</b> shrimp and live or dead fish. Reports exist of very anti-social behaviour by these fish in captivity.|$|R
