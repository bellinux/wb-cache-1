Assuming a normal Jurassic lithosphere and a pure shear opening mechanism, stretching factors of 1. 25 and 1. 7 have been calculated for the Black Flysch and Ceahlau basins, respectively. These values were in turn used to determine the theoretical values of the syn-tift sediment thickness, and compared with those obtained by backsttipping techniques. The occurrence of <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> in the Black Flysch basin associated to such a low stretching factor, suggests that melt generation was possible due to 'wet ' composition of the mantle peridotite.

Upper Triassic and Jurassic thermal states of the European lithosphere are related to the coeval opening mechanism of the Tethys. There was a transition from a simple shear between Austro-Alpine (= Apuseni Mountains) and the South Carpathians, to a pure shear mechanism (accompanied by strike-slip movements) between Austro-Alpine and the northern part of the Eastern Carpathians. Related to this change in the position of the master detachment fault, an astenospheric uprise developed within the European plate.

Subaqueous alteration is confirmed by the gap in Ce: the Ce loss is typical of sea sediments. The two samples belonged to very similar magmas, and their flows have been erupted at the same period. Euganean basic rocks show different degree of magmatic differentiation (from basalt to trachy-andesite basalt), and consequently different concentrations in major and minor elements. Studying the REE concentration normalized to chondrite values it emerges that all the samples could be genetically related by partial melting process. In particular it’s possible to divide the samples in two groups: EU 50 and EU 52 belong to alkaline series, EU 53 belongs to sub alkaline series. Sub alkaline rock has been developed from an high-degree partial melting process, meanwhile alkaline rocks developed from a low-degree partial melting process. Alkaline rocks, moreover, shows high concentrations in LREE due to residual garnet during the melting event. Stratigraphic relations show that alkaline rocks are younger than sub alkaline sample.

In Scotland Dinantian magmatism was dominantly mildly alkaline-transitional in composition. Tournaisian activity was followed by widespread Visean eruptions largely concentrated within the Scottish Midland Valley where the lava successions, dominantly of basaltic-hawaiitic composition, attained thicknesses of up to 1000 m. Changing stress fields in the late Visean coincided with a change in the nature of the igneous activity; subsequently, wholly <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> persisted into the Silesian.

The problem is resolved by proposing either mixing of silicic magma derived by strong fractionation of basaltic magma with anatectic magma from a pelitic/semi-pelitic crustal source, or fractionation of basaltic magma heavily contaminated by assimilated crustal material. Both origins would yield the high REE contents and fiat REE patterns of a 'primitive ' granite magma.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Brasiliano/Pan-African {{orogenic cycle}} is represented, in {{southern}} Brazil, by arc and collisional settings, with very expressive granitic magmatism. The post collisional stage, 650 - 580 Ma, is recorded by extensive magmatism along major transcurrent shear zones that compose the Southern Brazilian Shear Belt. The early post-collisional magmatism is high-K, calc alkaline, found along gently dipping shear zones; biotite-bearing granites and granodiorites {{are the most}} common rock types, often containing mafic micrpgranular enclaves. This is immediately followed by peraluminous two-mica leucogranites, emplaced either along flat lying or steeply dipping shear zones. The next magmatic manifestation has a shoshonitic affinity and is found either within the shear belt or far from deformation sites, piercing through cratonic areas. Shoshonitic rocks range from acid to basic, either as extrusive or plutonic terms. The latest magmatic event is a silica- saturated alkaline magmatism, occurring within or outside the shear belt. It is controlled by steeply dipping transcurrent structures, or discordantly intrusive in the previous types. Metaluminous biotite granites are widespread, with a coeval <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> of mildly alkaline affinity. The shear belt acted as a conduit for magmas and also promoted decompression of shallower mantle levels, reactivating the sources of previous, calc-alkaline, pre-collisional magmatism.

It comprises the Morro do Boi migmatites and the diatexitic Ponta do Cabeço Granite. Zircon U-Pb dating of migmatites and associated granitic neosomes shows that crustal evolution started in the Paleo- Mesoarchean (3. 3 - 3. 0 Ga), continued with events through the Neoarchean and Paleoproterozoic and ended in the Neoproterozoic (0. 64 - 0. 61 Ga). Integration of zircon Hf isotopic data and U-Pb ages indicate that juvenile crustal accretion was restricted to the Archean and that afterwards intracrustal reworking predominated. The exception to this is the ca. 1. 56 Ga xenoliths (basic dike remnants?), whose magmatic zircons have juvenile Hf isotopic signatures. This <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> marks extension of the earlier Precambrian complex.

The results show a heterogeneous mineral composition illustrative of the chemical evolution of calc-alkaline basic magmas during crystallization. The formation of incompatible element-rich interstitial minerals, such as amphibole, phlogopite and accessory phases (e. g., zircon, apatite), {{and the presence of}} zoning patterns in major minerals towards a more evolved composition, point to a progressive differentiation of the parental melt. The chemical variation depicted by trace elements usually incompatible with clinopyroxene (e. g., rare earth elements (REE), Th, Zr, Nb, Ti) implies co-precipitation with phases displaying a compatible behaviour with respect to these elements (e. g., apatite, zircon, amphibole). However, the very high LILE (large ion lithophile elements) and LREE (light REE) shown by clinopyroxene can not be explained exclusively by a closed-system in-situ crystallization process. Several features of the mineral chemistry (e. g. positive correlation of (La/Sm) N with La and Na in clinopyroxene and plagioclase, respectively) support the involvement of an external component (wall-rock assimilation or hybridization with an evolved melt). The petrography and mineral chemistry of the gabbros, in conjunction with bulk rock data from previous studies, favour a calc-alkaline affinity for the parental melts.

Older terrigenous zircons (3100 - 3200 Ma) were found only {{in the northern part of}} the belt, which is probably a consequence of the input of Mesoarchean material from the Karelian craton and/or the Kola province. The oldest metamorphic zircons of Belomorian paragneisses were formed 2820 +/- 15 Ma ago. Zircons with an age of 2710 15 Ma provide a record of collisional metamorphism of the high-pressure granulite, eclogite, and amphibolite facies, which was completed by several magmatic and migmatitic events 2615 +/- 15 Ma ago. The <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> of 2450 - 2400 Ma did not produce accessory zircons in the supracrustal complexes of the Belomorian belt. In contrast, the later Svecofennian metamorphism of the amphibolite facies resulted in the reequilibration of the U-Pb isotopic system of sphene and growth of a new zircon generation, especially in the zones of migmatization and pegmatite formation between 1900 and 1800 Ma. Early Proterozoic tectonothermal processes only partially obliterated the record of the Archean history of the Belomorian belt, which does not prevent the reconstruction of Archean tectonic settings. New more accurate isotopic data supported the previously proposed geodynamic model of the evolution of the Belomorian belt. According to this model, its formation occurred under the influence of oceanic crust subduction 2900 - 2800 Ma ago and subsequent collision with the Karelian craton 2730 - 2710 Ma ago...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTitanite {{occurs as}} a {{widespread}} accessory phase in mineralised zones and alteration associated with iron oxide-copper gold (IOCG) and iron oxide-apatite (IOA) deposits of Norrbotten County, Sweden, {{and is a}} major host of the REE in these deposits. In situ analyses of SmNd isotope ratios in titanites previously analysed for UPb geochronology and trace element composition confirms previous interpretations of grain scale isotopic heterogeneity. Initial Nd-isotope ratios expressed relative to CHUR range from ~− 3 to − 8 in IOA deposits, from ~− 1 to − 9 in IOCG deposits, and from + 2 to − 4 in the most Cu-rich, deformed IOCG deposits of the Nautanen Deformation zone. Within individual IOA deposits εNd varies relative to CHUR: from − 3. 1 to − 4. 0 at Valkommen (Malmberget), from − 1. 4 to − 5. 7 in grain cores, and − 7. 2 to − 8. 2 in grain rims rim at Gruvberget; and from − 3. 0 to − 6. 0 in grain cores and from − 5. 8 to − 7. 1 in grain rims at Luossavaara. In IOCG deposits at Rakkurijärvi εNd varies from − 6. 1. to − 7. 1, and in deformed IOCG deposits at Nautanen from − 1. 3 to − 2. 3. These values {{are consistent with the}} derivation of the REE, and potentially economically enriched metals, from the local volcanic sequence, either via granitic melts, or directly by leaching by metasomatic fluids. The most Cu-rich deposits reflect the involvement of more basic protoliths. The age distribution of these deposits suggest IOA deposit formation during the collisional phase of the Svecofennian orogeny (~ 1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga), and IOCG mineralisation during this phase and during post-orogenic collapse (~ 1. 8 – 1. 7 Ga), whilst model ages indicate the ultimate enrichment of the continental crust in these metals during pre-collisional extensional and subduction-related <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism.</b> These processes underscore the importance of continental cycles both in producing the preserved geological record of orogenic ore deposition, and in the generation of fertile continental crust, from which metals can be mobilised by subsequent events...|$|E

The deep crust forms {{the lower part of}} the section and includes from the bottom to the top: a) layered metagabbros including meta-peridotites; b) felsic and mafic granulites with interleaved metapelites; c) migmatitic metapelites with interleaved metabasites, rare marbles and felsic orthogneisses. The aim of this study is to characterize the geochemistry and the evolution of the Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> represented by metagabbros and metabasites. The reconstruction of the geodynamic setting in which the basic magmas were emplacement could allow a better understanding of the tectonic evolution of the peri-Gondwana terraines having memory of the West African craton. The effects of the Hercynian metamorphism have modified the mineralogical assemblage and, in some case, have induced partial melting modifying the original compositions. Petrographic and geochemical (major and trace elements) analyses have been performed on 20 samples collected at the base of the deep crust in the gabbroic portion. Two groups of basic rocks have been defined on the basis of the petrographic features. The first group characterized by coarse grained and isotropic texture, consists of gabbros and Qtz-gabbro containing Pl+Opx+Cpx+Amph±Qtz±Grt, rare crystals of biotite can be also present. Frequently, amphibolites with green or brown hornblende form thick layers. On the other hand leucocratic portions showing trondhjemitic composition are interspersed within the main gabbroic body. The second group is characterized by a medium grained and anisotropic texture formed by Pl+Opx+Bt+ k-feld±Cpx±Qtz±Grt. Peculiar characteristics of this rock-type are the abundance of biotite and the presence of pockets of granitic melts having eutectic composition. In both groups, few porphyroblastic garnet crystals occur including amphibole, pyroxene, plagioclase, ± biotite and ± quartz. Frequently, garnet crystals are rimmed by Opx+Pl+Amph or Amph+Pl symplectitic corona in biotite free-rock types or by Bt+Pl±Qtz symplectitic corona in biotite bearing-rock types. The two groups of rocks have variable chemical compositions owing to the variability of their components. The former are subalkaline rocks (Na 2 O + K 2 O = 1. 17 - 4. 84...|$|E
40|$|Permo-Mesozoic {{extension}} {{represents one}} of the most noticeable geological processes in the western Mediterranean. Triassic sedimentary sequences observed along the Dinaride-Hellenide orogenic belts and in Betic Cordillera are locally related with a <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> in an extensional tectonic setting. Carbonates sequences which include basic rocks can be observed in the Alpujarride Complex (central-eastern Betic Cordillera, Spain) and in the Lungro-Verbicaro Unit (northern Calabria). Betic Cordillera represents an important orogenic belt sited in the southern and southeastern side of the Iberian Peninsula and it is commonly divided into three main geological units: the Betic External Zone, Campo de Gibraltar Complex and the Betic Internal Zone, which include various tectonostratigraphic units arising from previous paleogeographical domains developed during the Mesozoic, {{as a consequence of the}} break-up of the Pangaea supercontinent. According to Iannace et al. (2007), the Meso-Cenozoic carbonates sequences outcropping in northern Calabria can be grouped into three tectonic units: the Lungro-Verbicaro Unit, the Cetraro Unit and the Pollino-Ciagola Unit. The Lungro-Verbicaro Unit is represented by a thick sedimentary succession affected by HP-LT metamorphism and consisting of phyllites and metarenites with carbonate intercalations in its lowermost part of Middle Triassic. Basic rocks can be found as a small intrusive complex within the Anisian phyllites and the Ladinian-Carnian carbonates of the Lungro-Verbicaro Unit. As Mesozoic geodynamic processes, since the opening of the Tethys, are recorded in the above rocks, the attention was focused on these two areas. The aim of this research was to study these basic magmatic rocks in order to obtain a better interpretation of the extensional tectonic process and to recognize a possible hydrothermal metamorphic overprint. In fact, the latter process is suggested by significant mineralizations observed in the outcrops of the Alpujarride Complex, due to the activity of a hydrothermal metamorphism in the Betic area. Basic rocks were characterized from a petrological and geochemical standpoint with the purpose of determining the characteristics of their source. A multidisciplinary approach was followed in both areas. Firstly, a field geology work (with the addition of photo-geological analyses for the Betic area) was performed to constrain relationships between basic rocks and wall rocks. Secondly, laboratory analyses were carried out in order to determine petrographic, petrological and geochemical characteristics of study samples. Petrographic analyses were performed using both the optical and scanning electron microscopy techniques, whereas petrological data were obtained by the electron microprobe. Lastly, geochemical composition of study rocks was characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), and the obtained data were processed using suitable diagrams.

40|$|The Mesozoic <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> {{found in}} the External Zones of the Betic Cordilleras (ZECB) is {{represented}} either as &# 194;&# 171;ophites&# 194;&# 187; forming small dimension tectonic blocks intercalated in the Keuper gypsum-rich, clay sediments, or also as lava ilow bodies, most of them with pillow structures, within the Jurassic sedimentary rocks. Geochemical characteristics of these rocks indicate sorne differences between these two magmatic series. Two different chemical affinities {{have been carried out}} within the &# 194;&# 171;ophites&# 194;&# 187; : a) with modal orthopyroxene and tholeiitic affinity; and b) with modal olivine and transitionalalkaline affinity. Chemical characteristics of this last group {{are similar to those of}} the volcanic rocks from the Jurassic sediments. The field relationships found in sorne &# 194;&# 171;ophite&# 194;&# 187; outcrops al!ow us to deduce that the tholeiitic rocks are mostly present as extrusive rocks. However, their older whole-rock K-Ar ages range between 182 &# 194;&# 177; 9 and 187 &# 194;&# 177; 4 M. a., and do not correctly represent Upper Triassic ages. Transitional-alkaline &# 194;&# 171;ophites&# 194;&# 187; occur as subvolcanic rocks and their older obtained radiometric age is 137 &# 194;&# 177; 4 M. a. Al! these radiometric ages obtained may be intepreted as a result of the hybridization between the age of the Triassic magmatism and the very low- to low-grade metamorphism present in these rocks. This metamorphism is responsable for the new formed secondary paragenesis, made of prehnite + pumpel! yite + sericitie + mafic phyl!osicates. Radiometric age obtained in sorne intra-Jurassic volcanic rocks range between 155 &# 194;&# 177; 3 to 166 &# 194;&# 177; 4 M. a. These new radiometric data and field relationships are used to define the Mesozoic magmatic evolution in the ZECB. Tholeiitic magmatism was generated during an initial Triassic distensive stage. After this magmatic event, and as a consequence of an increment of the distensive regime, with important continental crust thickening, transitionalalkaline magmatism occurS. This second magmatic event is present both as Jurassic pillow-lavas and also as sorne subvolcanic basic rocks intrusive in the Triassic sediments. El magmatismo b&# 225;sico mesozoico de las Zonas Externas de las Cordilleras B&# 233;ticas (ZECB) est&# 225; representado por bloques tect&# 243;nicos de peque&# 241;as dimensiones (&# 194;&# 171;ofitas&# 194;&# 187;) intercalados entre los sedimentos arcilloso-yes&# 237;feros del Tr&# 237;as Keuper y por niveles de pillow-Iavas intercalados entre los sedimentos jur&# 225;sicos. El quimismo de estas rocas indica diferencias significativas entre ellos. Dentro de las &# 194;&# 171;ofitas&# 194;&# 187; se ha puesto de manifiesto la existencia de dos grupos con afinidades geoqu&# 237;micas diferentes: a) con ortopiroxeno modal y afinidad tole&# 237;tica, y b) con olivino modal y afinidad transicional-alcalina. El quimismo de este &# 250;ltimo grupo presenta rasgos composicionales similares a los de las rocas volc&# 225;nicas presentes entre los sedimentos jur&# 225;sicos. Las relaciones de campo observadas en algunos afloramientos de &# 194;&# 171;ofitas&# 194;&# 187; permiten establecer que las de afinidad tole&# 237;tica aparecen, mayoritariamente, como rocas extrusivas. Las dataciones K-Ar m&# 225;s antiguas obtenidas para estas rocas han dado edades de 182 &# 194;&# 177; 9 a 187 &# 194;&# 177; 4 M. a., que no coinciden exactamente con las edades del Tr&# 237;as Superior.

Todas estas edades radiom&# 233;tricas obtenidas se deben interpretar como un resultado de la hibridaci&# 243;n de las edades del magmatismo Tri&# 225;sico y del metamorfismo de grado bajo a muy bajo que presenta estas rocas.

40|$|Mesozoic <b>basic</b> <b>magmatism</b> in the External Zones of the Betic Cordilleras (S. Spain) is {{represented}} by small tectonic bodies (ophites) in Triassic formations, and submarine flows with abundant pillow-lavas interbedded with Jurassic sediments. Both basic igneous manifestations suffered very low- to low-grade metamorphism, more intense {{in the case of}} the ophites. Two types of ophites are distinguished on the basis of their primary mineralogy. In the first type, orthopyroxene is present in the less differentiated products. Clinopyroxene and Ca-plagioclase are the main primary phases and quartz appears in the more evolved rocks. In the second type, olivine is present in the less differentiated products. Ti-rich augite and Ca-plagioclase are also important primary minerals, but quartz is absent. Whole-rock chemistry (major and trace elements, including REE) also allows us to discriminate between these two groups. The first group has higher SiO 2, and lower TiO 2, P 2 O 5 and lower Na 2 O/K 2 O ratios than the second. Normative quartz is almost invariably present in this first group, whereas normative nepheline (lower than 5 %) is characteristic of the second group. Both groups are Sr, K, Ba, Rb, Th, Nb and Ce enriched with respect to normal MORB, but the first group has higher K, Rb, Ba, Th and lower Nb, Ce contents than the alkaline group. Nb/Y and Ti/V ratios are also different and show a tholeiitic affinity for the first group and transitional to alkaline for the second. Chondrite-normalised REE patterns in both groups are similar and characterized by LREE enrichment with respect to HREE. LREE/HREE ratios are, however, slightly higher in the transitional to alkaline group. Various discriminant tectonic diagrams indicate a continental intraplate setting for both ophite groups. This magmatism is related to the first extensional period of the Betic Cordilleras, during the Triassic-Jurassic. Geochemical differences between the two groups could evidence different degrees of crustal contamination, and/or different mantle sources. Trace element ratios [(La/Ce) n &# 226;&# 137;&# 187; 1, La/Nb &# 226;&# 137;&# 186; 1. 5] for both magmatism are indicative of an enriched mantle source. Differences in Th/Yb, Zr/Nb, Zr/Y and Ba/Zr ratios underline the greater influence of a lithospheric component {{in the case of the}} Triassic magmatism. El magmatismo b&# 225;sico mesozoico en las Zonas Externas de las Cordilleras B&# 233;ticas (S. Espa&# 241;a) esta representado por peque&# 241;os bloques tect&# 243;nicos (ofitas) en las formaciones tri&# 225;sicas, y coladas submarinas, con abundantes pillow-lavas intercaladas en los sedimentos jur&# 225;sicos. Ambos tipos de manifestaciones &# 237;gneas sufrieron transformaciones metam&# 243;rficas en condiciones de grado bajo a muy bajo, mas intensas en el caso de las ofitas. Sobre la base de la mineralog&# 237;a primaria se han distinguido dos tipos de ofitas. En el primer tipo, aparece ortopiroxeno en los t&# 233;rminos menos diferenciados, siendo los clino- piroxenos y plagioclasas c&# 225;lcicas las principales fases minerales, con presencia de cuarzo en las rocas mas evolucionadas. En el segundo tipo, el olivino esta presente en los t&# 233;rminos menos diferenciados, siendo tambi&# 233;n los clinopiroxenos (tipo augita rica en Ti) y las plagioclasas c&# 225;lcicas las fases minerales mas importantes, aunque no existe cuarzo en las rocas mas diferenciadas. Los datos de geoqu&# 237;mica de roca total (elementos mayores y trazas, incluyendo tierras raras) tambi&# 233;n permiten discriminar entre estos dos grupos. El primero presenta mayores valores de SiO 2 y menores contenidos de TiO 2, P 2 O 5, as&# 237; como menores relaciones Na 2 O/K 2 O que el segundo. El primer grupo presenta casi sistem&# 225;ticamente cuarzo normativo, mientras que el segundo se caracteriza por la presencia de nefelina normativa &# 194;&# 171; 5 %). Ambos grupos est&# 225;n enriquecidos en Sr, K, Ba, Rb, Th, Nb y Ce con respecto a los N-MORB, pero el primer grupo tiene mayores contenidos en K, Rb, Ba y Th y menores valores en Nb y Ce que el segundo. Las relaciones Nb/Y y T/V tambi&# 233;n son diferentes entre los dos grupos, indicando una afinidad tole&# 237;tica para el primer grupo y transicional- alcalina para el segundo. Los diagramas de tierras raras normalizados a condritos son similares en los dos grupos, y est&# 225;n caracterizados por un enriquecimiento en tierras raras ligeras con respecto alas pesadas, aunque con relaciones ligeramente mas altas en el grupo transicional-alcalino. El uso de varios diagramas de discriminaci&# 243;n tect&# 243;nica indican un contexto de g&# 233;nesis de intraplaca continental para ambos grupos. Este magmatismo esta relacionado con los primeros episodios distensivos de las Cordilleras B&# 233;ticas durante el Tri&# 225;sico-Jur&# 225;sico. Las diferencias geoqu&# 237;micas entre los dos grupos podr&# 237;an indicar distintos grados de contaminaci&# 243;n cortical y/o diferente fuente mant&# 233;lica. Las relaciones entre elementos traza [(La/Ce) n &# 226;&# 137;&# 187; 1, La/Nb &# 226;&# 137;&# 186; 1. 5] en ambos magmatismos son indicativas de una fuente mant&# 233;lica enriquecida. Las diferencias observadas en las relaciones Th/Yb, Zr/Nb, Zr/Y y Ba/Zr ponen de manifiesto la mayor influencia de un componente litosf&# 233;rico en el caso del magmatismo tri&# 225;sico...|$|E
