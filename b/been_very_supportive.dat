When she wakes up, she goes to the Hearst library, where Tim Foyle’s (James Jordan) girlfriend, Bonnie, asks her to {{investigate}} who slipped her RU-486, which caused a miscarriage. When Veronica presses Bonnie further, she reveals that Tim or Dick (Ryan Hansen) could be the father, although Tim has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>supportive.</b> Veronica asks Logan point-blank whether Logan had sex with Madison over the winter, and he says yes, leading to a major fight, with Veronica saying she’ll never forgive him. Veronica speaks to Bonnie’s roommate, Phyllis (Toni Trucks), who reiterates that Tim is being very supportive.

For the wedding scene, Zoic staff extended columns, added stained glass windows, and completed {{the wedding party}} with additions of digital guests. The effect of the Evil Queen disappearing from Charming's flying sword cost ABC a reported $12,000. Kitsis has commented that because the network has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>supportive,</b> they are not worried about losing the [...] "fantastical feel" [...] of the series' flashback sequences.

500|$|Although {{critical}} {{reception of}} Barbara Gordon's evolution into Oracle {{have been mixed}} among critics and other observers, according to John Ostrander: [...] "We have, over the years, on those occasions when I have worked with the character, gotten some letters {{from those who have}} disabilities of one stripe or another and all have <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>supportive.</b> I feel very proud for my part in creating Oracle." [...] Supporters of Oracle argue that the Barbara Gordon character provides a greater service to DC Comics and its readers as a disabled character, regardless of the events that caused her paralysis. In her persona as Oracle, Barbara Gordon {{is not limited to the}} Batman Family, serving a unique and universal role in the DC universe. DC Senior Vice President Dan DiDio comments, [...] "Some stories... are so strong that undoing them would be a crime. The DCU would be a lesser place without Barry's sacrifice, or the crippling of Barbara at the hands of the Joker." ...|$|E

500|$|Club Life: Volume Two Miami is {{the second}} {{installment}} of the Club Life series, succeeding its predecessor [...] (2011). The album serves {{as a tribute to}} the nightlife in Miami, Florida, a city internationally renowned for being an epicenter for electronic dance music. Upon arriving in the United States in 2002, Tiësto was instantly enamored by the city's vibrant electronic music scene, as the genre had yet to garner mainstream popularity {{throughout the rest of the}} country. [...] "Literally the first place I came to in America was Miami," [...] he recalled, [...] "and since then I've always been in love with the city. They've always <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> of my music. Like, even in the beginning of 2002, when the whole of America was not really into dance music, Miami had already embraced my music here and played it in all the stores." [...] Tiësto, who performs in the area annually, sought inspiration from varying discothèques in the city. He explained, [...] "I wanted to create songs that give fans the opportunity to experience the sound of Miami clubs, whether they’ve been there or not." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "e find no warrant in the Arbitration Act for {{implying}} {{in every}} contract within its ken a presumption against arbitration of statutory claims," [...] Blackmun wrote {{in response to}} Soler's claims under the Car Dealers' Day In Court Act. The Court's own recent decisions on arbitration had <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>supportive,</b> and he {{saw no reason to}} hold, in their light, that they did not apply only to contractual disputes. While conversely not every statutory claim was suitable for arbitration, [...] "the Act itself provides no basis for disfavoring agreements to arbitrate statutory claims by skewing the otherwise hospitable inquiry into arbitrability ... Soler's concern for statutorily protected classes provides no reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause is read." ...|$|E

2500|$|Denmark is {{a long-time}} {{supporter}} of international peacekeeping, {{but since the}} NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 and the War in Afghanistan in 2001, Denmark has also found a new role as a warring nation, participating actively in several wars and invasions. This relatively new situation has stirred some internal critique, but the Danish population has generally <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>supportive,</b> in particular of the War in Afghanistan. The Danish Defence has around 1,400 staff in international missions, not including standing contributions to NATO SNMCMG1. Danish forces were heavily engaged in the former Yugoslavia in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), with IFOR, and now SFOR. Between 2003 and 2007, there were approximately 450 Danish soldiers in Iraq. Denmark also strongly supported American operations in Afghanistan and has contributed both monetarily and materially to the ISAF. These initiatives are often described by the authorities {{as part of a}} new [...] "active foreign policy" [...] of Denmark.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1990s, Blackwell {{remained}} active in performances with opera companies throughout the United States and Europe. Most notably, in 1994 Blackwell replaced Kathleen Battle as Marie in La fille du régiment at the Metropolitan Opera {{for the entire}} run when Battle was fired from the production for unprofessional conduct. This has inevitably caused critics to compare the two singers, and indeed both women have played {{many of the same}} roles and share a similar vocal quality. In a 2003 interview Blackwell said, [...] "Kathleen has <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> and very good to me over my career. Mattiwilda Dobbs, Reri Grist and Kathy were basically the predecessors for me and I really am grateful to those women, especially with my particular fach. I mean, singing Aïda or Leonora is one thing, but the lyric repertory roles are not star vehicles. It just doesn't happen and I think these women have really helped in that respect." ...|$|E
