2500|$|After {{receiving}} initial skepticism {{from the}} public health and agricultural communities, Bouis partnered with Dr. Ross Welch from the United States Department of Agriculture’s Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory (PSNL) at Cornell University and Dr. Robin Graham of the University of Adelaide, and IFPRI’s <b>Biofortification</b> Challenge Project was formed in 1993. The Project was renamed HarvestPlus in 2003, and Bouis was selected as Director. [...] In that role, he led the effort to breed and deliver micronutrient-dense staple crops to reduce micronutrient malnutrition. <b>Biofortification</b> now reaches over 25 million people in developing countries.|$|E
2500|$|Howarth E. [...] "Howdy" [...] Bouis (born October 10, 1950), is an American {{economist}} {{whose work}} {{has focused on}} agriculture, nutrition outcomes, and reducing micronutrient malnutrition, also known as hidden hunger. He {{is the founder and}} former director of HarvestPlus, a global non-profit agricultural research program. Bouis was awarded the World Food Prize in 2016 for his pioneering work on <b>biofortification.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2016, Bouis was {{announced}} as {{a recipient of}} the World Food Prize for pioneering the concept of <b>biofortification</b> and taking it from hypothesis to scaling up globally. [...] The World Food Prize Committee noted that Bouis “persevered relentlessly {{in the face of}} skepticism and opposition from public health experts and crop breeders as he pursued his vision that agriculture could provide more nutritious staple crops, which could reduce the micronutrient deficiencies that can cause malnutrition, blindness, disease and even early death among vulnerable populations in Africa and Asia, and Latin America, particularly {{children under the age of}} five”. [...] He shared the prize with fellow laureates Dr. Maria Andrade, Dr. Jan Low, and Dr. Robert Mwanga of the International Potato Center in recognition of their pioneering work on biofortified sweet potatoes in Africa.|$|E
2500|$|When Bouis joined IFPRI, {{most experts}} in the field {{considered}} calorie intake to be the principal benchmark for nutritional status. The issue of micronutrient malnutrition, or hidden hunger, was not yet widely understood. Research that Bouis and Lawrence Haddad carried out in the Philippines from 1984 to 1990 indicated that mineral and vitamin intake, not calorie intake, was the primary constraint to improving nutrition outcomes and reducing micronutrient deficiencies. Recognizing that low-income smallholder farmers, {{a large proportion of the}} population in most developing countries, could not afford nutritionally-dense, diverse diets, Bouis sought a way for staple crops, such as beans, rice, and wheat, to [...] provide more micronutrients. He hypothesized that crops bred to include higher levels of iron, zinc or vitamin A could substantially improve nutrition at a relatively low cost and could conveniently reach remote rural households. This concept eventually came to be known as <b>biofortification.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Biofortification</b> is {{the idea}} of {{breeding}} crops to increase their nutritional value. This can be done either through conventional selective breeding, or through genetic engineering. <b>Biofortification</b> differs from ordinary fortification because it focuses on making plant foods more nutritious as the plants are growing, rather than having nutrients added to the foods when they are being processed. This is an improvement on ordinary fortification when it comes to providing nutrients for the rural poor, who rarely have access to commercially fortified foods. As such, <b>biofortification</b> is seen as an upcoming strategy for dealing with deficiencies of micronutrients in the developing world. In the case of iron, WHO estimated that <b>biofortification</b> could help curing the 2 billion people suffering from iron deficiency-induced anemia.|$|E
50|$|Some {{have criticized}} <b>biofortification</b> {{programs}} {{because they may}} encourage “further simplification of human diets and food systems”, because “is a strategy that aims to concentrate more nutrients in few staple foods which may contribute to further simplifying diets already overly dependant on a few carbohydrate staples.” This may seem irresponsible, as {{lack of access to}} a diverse and balanced diet is the major cause of malnutrition. As a result, these critics urge caution, and the use of <b>biofortification</b> {{as part of a larger}} strategy involving diversification of foods in the developing world. Advocates of <b>biofortification</b> accept this as a long term strategy, but warn that substantially increasing diet diversity will take “many decades and untold billions of dollars”, and that <b>biofortification</b> could be an effective strategy to help reduce micronutrient malnutrition.|$|E

50|$|Other {{possible}} solutions are the industrial enrichment of food or <b>biofortification</b> of feedplants (e.g. vitamin A rich sweet potatoes).In {{the case of}} acute nutrient deficiency and in specific life phases, food supplements can be used.

50|$|This {{approach}} may have advantages over other health interventions such as providing foods fortified after processing, or providing supplements. Although these approaches have proven successful {{when dealing with}} the urban poor, they tend to require access to effective markets and healthcare systems which often just do not exist in rural areas. <b>Biofortification</b> is also fairly cost effective after an initial large research investment - where seeds can be distributed, the “implementation costs growing biofortified foods are nil or negligible”, as opposed to supplementation which is comparatively expensive and requires continued financing over time, which may be jeopardized by fluctuating political interest.|$|E

40|$|Zinc (Zn) {{and iron}} (Fe) {{deficiencies}} are well-documented public health issue {{and an important}} soil constraint to crop production. Generally, there is a close geographical overlap between soil deficiency and human deficiency of Zn and Fe, indicating a high requirement for increasing concentrations of micronutrients in food crops. Breeding new plant genotypes for high grain concentrations of Fe and Zn (genetic <b>biofortification)</b> is the most cost-effective strategy to address the problem; but, this strategy is a long-term process. A rapid and complementary approach is therefore required for <b>biofortification</b> of food crops with Zn and Fe in the short term. In this regard, a fertilizer strategy (agronomic <b>biofortification)</b> represents an effective way for <b>biofortification</b> of food crops. In this paper, several examples are presented showing that application of Zn fertilizers greatly contribute to <b>biofortification</b> of cereal grains with Zn. By contrast, application of various inorganic and chelated Fe fertilizers remains ineffective for increasing grain Fe concentration. However, improving nitrogen (N) nutritional status of plants promoted accumulation of Fe (and also Zn) in grain.

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is a {{major problem}} in both developing and developed countries, and much of this can be attributed to insufficient dietary intake. Over the past decades several measures, such as supplementation and food fortification, have helped to alleviate this problem. However, their associated costs limit their accessibility and effectiveness, particularly amongst the financially constrained. A more affordable and sustainable option that can be implemented alongside existing measures is <b>biofortification.</b> To date, much work has been invested into staples like cereals and root crops—this has culminated in the successful generation of high iron-accumulating lines in rice and pearl millet. More recently, pulses have gained attention as targets for <b>biofortification.</b> Being secondary staples rich in protein, they are a nutritional complement to the traditional starchy staples. Despite the relative youth of this interest, considerable advances have already been made concerning the <b>biofortification</b> of pulses. Several studies have been conducted in bean, chickpea, lentil, and pea to assess existing germplasm for high iron-accumulating traits. However, {{little is known about the}} molecular workings behind these traits, particularly in a leguminous context, and <b>biofortification</b> via genetic modification (GM) remains to be attempted. This review examines the current state of the iron <b>biofortification</b> in pulses, particularly chickpea. The challenges concerning <b>biofortification</b> in pulses are also discussed.

40|$|Background Agricultural {{science can}} address a population's vitamin, amino acid and mineral {{malnutrition}} through <b>biofortification</b> - agronomy, plant breeding and biotechnology to develop crops with high nutrient contents. Biofortified crop varieties should be grown {{in areas with}} populations at risk of nutrient deficiency and {{in areas where the}} same crop is already grown and consumed. Information on the population at risk of nutrient deficiency is rarely available for sub-national administrative units, such as provinces, districts, and municipalities. Nor is this type of information commonly analyzed with data on agricultural production. This project developed a method to identify populations at risk of nutrient deficiency in zones with high crop production, places where <b>biofortification</b> interventions could be targeted. Results Nutrient deficiency risk data were combined with crop production and socioeconomic data to assess the suitability of establishing an intervention. Our analysis developed maps of candidate sites for <b>biofortification</b> interventions for nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Results for Colombia, Nicaragua, and Bolivia are presented in this paper. Interventions in northern Colombia appear promising for all crops, while sites for bean <b>biofortification</b> are widely scattered throughout the country. The most promising sites in Nicaragua are found in the center-north region. Candidate sites for <b>biofortification</b> in Bolivia are found in {{the central part of the}} country, in the Andes Mountains. The availability and resolution of data limits the analysis. Some areas show opportunities for <b>biofortification</b> of several crops, taking advantage of their spatial coincidence. Results from this analysis should be confirmed by experts or through field visits. Conclusion This study demonstrates a method for identifying candidate sites for <b>biofortification</b> interventions. The method evaluates populations at risk of nutrient deficiencies for sub-national administrative regions, and provides a reasonable alternative to more costly, information-intensive approaches.

40|$|Common {{beans are}} a staple {{food and the}} major source of iron for populations in Eastern Africa and Latin America. Bean iron {{concentration}} is high and can be further increased by <b>biofortification.</b> A major constraint to bean iron <b>biofortification</b> is low iron absorption, attributed to inhibitory compounds such as phytic acid (PA) and polyphenol(s) (PP). We have evaluated the usefulness of the common bean as a vehicle for iron <b>biofortification.</b> High iron concentrations and wide genetic variability have enabled plant breeders to develop high iron bean varieties (up to 10 mg/ 100 g). PA concentrations in beans are high and tend to increase with iron <b>biofortification.</b> Short-term human isotope studies indicate that iron absorption from beans is low, PA is the major inhibitor, and bean PP play a minor role. Multiple composite meal studies indicate that decreasing the PA level in the biofortified varieties substantially increases iron absorption. Fractional iron absorption from composite meals was 4 %– 7 % in iron deficient women; thus the consumption of 100 g biofortified beans/day would provide about 30 %– 50 % of their daily iron requirement.
