50|$|Masliyah {{has been}} {{involved}} with the oil sands industry in Alberta for over three decades. His research has focused mainly on bitumen extraction. He has applied fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, interfacial and surface science and colloids to oil sand lump ablation, <b>bitumen-sand</b> separation and emulsion formation. He also worked to create stronger relationships between the oil sand operators and university researchers. Mathematical simulators developed in his laboratory are commonly used in the design of new and operation of current bitumen extraction plants.|$|E

Evidence {{from the study of}} mixed <b>bitumen-sand</b> intrusions includes progressive spalling of individual grains from cemented sandstones and individual sand grains with adhering cements. Both physical forces related to rapid fluid movement and chemical dissolution may contribute to the disaggregation process. Rapid fluid flow due to hydrofracturing of an overpressured sequence is responsible for several examples of sand-bearing bitumen veins. A overpressuring s a widespread phenomenon, disaggregation of lithified sandstones may be more prevalent than hitherto appre-ciated. Sand may be entrapped in bitumen within vein systems cutting ki/ometres of stra igraphy. Fluid inclusion data from an example at Bentheim, Germany, shows that cementation f sandstone occurred at high temperatures before sand disaggregation and mobilization. Sandstone dykes and sills are a widespread phenome-non in the geological record. The general ssumption is that they develop before the source sand bed became consolidated (Lonergan et al. 2000), imply-ing a shallow depth of formation. This is probably tru...|$|E
