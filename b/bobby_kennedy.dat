5|$|Warhol's {{production}} of Campbell's Soup can works underwent three distinct phases. The first {{took place in}} 1962, during which he created realistic images, and produced numerous pencil drawings of the subject. In 1965, Warhol revisited the theme while arbitrarily replacing the original red and white colors with {{a wider variety of}} hues. In the late 1970s, he again returned to the soup cans while inverting and reversing the images. Some in the art world consider Warhol's work completed after his 1968 shooting—which occurred the day before the <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy</b> assassination— to be less significant than that done before it.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968 Democratic primary campaign, McCarthy {{staged a}} strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President Hubert Humphrey ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were {{both from the}} {{neighboring}} state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota Democratic primary, {{which resulted in a}} strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy</b> left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.|$|E

In 2001, Robinson returned to NASCAR to drive the No. 99 Michael Waltrip Racing car for three races in the Busch Series with the objective of obtaining a season-long drive in 2002. The seat materialized when she met Tim Butler and Ken Butler of Aaron's at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the fall of 2000.

In her three races, she achieved one top-20 finish but did not finish the first two events having been involved in crashes. She continued a strong run in ARCA Series with two top-ten finishes in the season's first two races.|$|E

25|$|In October 1967, {{a private}} meeting was {{arranged}} between Parrish and <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy</b> by mutual friend and well-known Kennedy photographer, Stanley Tretick. She begged Bobby {{to run for president}} telling him that huge, influential organizations opposed to the war in Vietnam were ready to support him if he ran. Kennedy refused again and again, saying he could not oppose Lyndon Johnson, a sitting president. On November 30, Eugene McCarthy, a brilliant yet little-known senator, declared he would run against the war and challenge Johnson. Parrish was elected chair of his speaker's bureau and utilized STOP! to develop support for McCarthy. On March 12, 1968, McCarthy almost defeated Johnson in the New Hampshire primary winning 42% of the vote. On March 16 (four days later) <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy</b> announced that he would run for president. Two weeks later, on March 31, Johnson declared that he would not run again for president.

25|$|President Kennedy had {{submitted}} a civil-rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which {{was met with}} strong opposition. Johnson renewed the effort and asked <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy</b> to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on Capitol Hill.

Historian Robert Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past; southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote. In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, in order to force the bill's supporters to pull it.|$|E

500|$|Two {{days later}} Kennedy and his wife, Ethel, {{attended}} an 08:00 Palm Sunday service at New Bethel Baptist Church in the riot zone. Stokely Carmichael, widely blamed for inciting local disorder, {{was among the}} others in the congregation. Kennedy, a devout Catholic, took communion {{with the rest of the}} parishioners, much to the chagrin of the Bishop of Washington. After the service he asked the minister, Walter E. Fauntroy, how bad the destruction was in the surrounding area. Fauntroy then walked Kennedy towards the worst devastation on 14th street. Ethel, aide Peter Edelman, Marian Wright Edelman (wife of Peter Edelman), and a small group of reporters, local officials, and parishioners closely followed. People joined the crowd as it walked, becoming so large that a group of National Guardsmen mistook it for a mob of looters. Fearing a confrontation, they put on their gas masks and fixed their bayonets. A trailing police car quickly accelerated and parked itself in between the crowd and the guardsmen to prevent any incident from occurring. Fauntroy remembered, [...] "When [...] saw it was <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy,</b> they took off their masks and let us through. They looked awfully relieved." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} organizers {{found themselves}} out of money after the amount of required bail was raised. Because King was the major fundraiser, his associates urged him to travel the country to raise bail money for those arrested. He had, however, previously promised to lead the marchers to jail in solidarity, but hesitated as the planned date arrived. Some SCLC members grew frustrated with his indecisiveness. [...] "I have never seen Martin so troubled", one of King's friends later said. After King prayed and reflected alone in his hotel room, he and the campaign leaders decided to defy the injunction and prepared for mass arrests of campaign supporters. To build morale and to recruit volunteers to go to jail, Ralph Abernathy spoke at a mass meeting of Birmingham's black citizens at the 6th Avenue Baptist Church: [...] "The {{eyes of the world}} are on Birmingham tonight. <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy</b> is looking here at Birmingham, the United States Congress is looking at Birmingham. The Department of Justice is looking at Birmingham. Are you ready, are you ready to make the challenge? I am ready to go to jail, are you?"

At Hoover's direction, Boyd leaves the FBI and begins working with Hoover's personal nemeses - Kennedy {{and his younger brother}} Robert—on the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management's investigation of organized crime and union corruption. Boyd strikes a rapport with John <b>Kennedy</b> but dislikes <b>Bobby.</b> The <b>Kennedys,</b> with their wealth and privilege, embody everything that Boyd hopes to gain.

5000|$|Martin's {{campaign}} {{enabled the}} GOP {{to conduct an}} educational mission for the two-party system. [...] "If we show strength in Alabama and other southern states, we will help to name the Republican candidate for the presidency in 1964," [...] Martin predicted, claiming that the nominee would look favorably on the South. The Mobile Register endorsed the two-party format to stimulate the spread of ideas and to improve government: [...] "It takes only an unprejudiced attitude to recognize the potentialities ... from two-party political vigor." [...] The Huntsville Times noted with amusement that voting for a Republican in Alabama could [...] "constitute a crime or start convolutions in ancestral graves. ... can hardly pick up {{a cup of coffee}} ... without hearing grumbling around the table about <b>Bobby</b> <b>Kennedy's</b> interference in the South ... or the need to kick the Reds out of Cuba. ... But vote Republican? That is another thing." [...] Though it editorialized for a two-party system in theory, The Huntsville Times endorsed Lister Hill. The newspaper conceded that Martin had defended states rights but noted that three key New York liberal Republicans, Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and Senators Kenneth B. Keating and Jacob Javits, were hostile to limited government and local autonomy. The publication urged the Republicans to hold primary elections in 1964 and field a full slate, rather than singling out one contest, as they had done in 1962. Republican prospects were dampened by the Alabama legislature's implementation of the [...] "vote-for-eight" [...] requirement for the then at-large U.S. House races. Because the GOP offered only three House candidates, the Republicans either had to back five Democrats or to write-in other names on the ballot. GOP chairman John Grenier of Birmingham, who would emerge with Martin as a key figure and even an intraparty rival in their party's resurgence, denounced the [...] "vote-for-eight" [...] clause, which was upheld by the Alabama Supreme Court as a prohibition against [...] "complete freedom of choice." [...] Republicans hence had to dilute the strength of their nominees by being compelled to support five other candidates. After 1962, [...] "vote-for-eight" [...] was struck down by the United States Supreme Court, which required single-member House districts. Martin employed Country music bands to stir up enthusiasm and plastered the state with billboards which omitted his party affiliation. His failure to identify himself as a Republican in his advertising seemed to contradict the mission of his candidacy. The discrepancy prompted Hill to denounce [...] "glorified pawn brokers ... ashamed to admit that they're running as Republicans." [...] Because Alabama then had no significant GOP base, Martin sought to appeal to Independents and the more conservative Democrats The Hill-Martin race drew considerable national attention. The liberal columnist Drew Pearson wrote from Decatur, Alabama, that [...] "for the first time since Reconstruction, the two-party system, which political scientists talk about for the South, but never expect to materialize, may come to Alabama." [...] The New York Times viewed the Alabama race as the most vigorous off-year effort in modern southern history but predicted a Hill victory on the basis that Martin had failed to gauge [...] "bread-and-butter" [...] issues and was viewed as an [...] "ultraconservative." ...|$|R
