40|$|This paper {{presents}} a partial evaluation {{on the use}} of singular perturbation methods for developing computer algorithms for on-line optimal control of aircraft. The evaluation is based on a study of the minimum time intercept problem using F- 4 aerodynamic and propulsion data as a <b>base</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>extensions</b> over previous work on this subject are that aircraft turning dynamics (in addition to position and energy dynamics) are included in the analysis, the algorithm is developed for a moving end point and is adaptive to unpredictable target maneuvers, and short range maneuvers that do not have a cruise leg are included. Particular attention is given to identifying those quantities that can be precomputed and stored (as a function of aircraft total energy), thus greatly reducing the onboard computational load. Numerical results are given that illustrate the nature of the optimal intercept flight paths, and an estimate is given for the execution time and storage requirements of the control algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{determinants}} of <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> success using data on 75 <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> of 34 cigarette brands over a 20 -year period to investigate the relative effects of brand, extension, and firm characteristics on the incremental market share of brand <b>line</b> <b>extensions.</b> The econometric model also captures the extent of cannibalization of parent brand sales that may have occurred due to the <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> 2 ̆ 7 s introduction. The authors also explore {{the role of a}} brand 2 ̆ 7 s symbolic value as a factor in <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> success. Results indicate that parent brand strength and its symbolic value, early entry timing, a firm 2 ̆ 7 s size, and distinctive marketing competencies, as well as the advertising support allocated to <b>line</b> <b>extensions,</b> contribute positively to the success of <b>line</b> <b>extensions.</b> Their findings suggest that, in this industry, cannibalization effects of <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> activity may have been limited and <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> into earlier subcategories actually may have helped the parent brand. Even with cannibalization, the incremental sales generated by the extension seem to be reason enough to make a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> strategy viable...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSMany {{prominent}} brands wane {{at the end}} {{of their}} brand life cycle. This research report analysed this phenomenon and whether an upscale <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> could assist to revitalise a stale brand. Research in beverages found that a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> allows an established brand to venture into new territories with less risk than repositioning itself altogether. The <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> is akin to a tugboat that steers a ship in a desired direction. The research revealed some reciprocation where a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> adds brand differentiation. Findings included four possible functions for a <b>line</b> <b>extension.</b> In addition, some parameters in crafting a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> were firstly, the core brand remained the driver; secondly, brand-fit in the market opportunity, the functional and emotional benefits and lastly, entry entrant launch timing is optimal. Finally a conceptual framework is presented to develop <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> incorporating the portfolio strategy, core brand and <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> executio...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of products that}} are launched today are extensions of a brand. These extensions are often launched as <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> where the new product is developed within an existing product category. The use of <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> has affected customer’s evaluations and purchase decisions, and the factors impacting these are important to consider. The purpose of this thesis was therefore to further explore the customer perception of <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> and how it affects the brand image. Focus groups were used in our empirical research, among our findings we discovered that successful <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> provides variety and fulfil a customer need, <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> easily tend to fail if they are too dissimilar {{from the rest of}} the brand’s products. The brand image can be strengthened through marketing and promotion of the <b>line</b> <b>extension.</b> The thesis is supposed to contribute and function as a guide for further research in the area.

40|$|When {{should a}} firm {{introduce}} a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> or improved product {{in order to}} maximize total profits from the original product and the <b>line</b> <b>extension?</b> We identify three critical issues which affect the answer to this question: the interrelationship of sales of the two products because of substitution and diffusion, the relative margins of the two products, and the relationship of the length of the firm's planning horizon to the original product's diffusion time. We develop a model in which the first product contributes a higher unit margin; however, sales develop slowly. The <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> contributes a lower unit margin and partially cannibalizes sales of the original product, but also broadens the market, causing sales to develop more rapidly. The timing of the introduction of the <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> affects the subsequent sales pattern for both products and the total profit to be made within the planning period. The optimal entry time depends upon the product pair's substitutability. We show that it is best either to introduce the <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> at a time early in the life cycle of the original product or not to introduce it at all. Consideration of dynamic phenomena can make a difference. For example, our results indicate that in some cases the <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> should be introduced early, whereas a simpler static analysis (which neglects diffusion and the implications of a finite planning horizon) would indicate that the <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> should never be introduced. product line, product development, product introduction, timing, optimal...|$|R

40|$|Assembled product {{manufacturers}} often introduce <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> {{that share}} components with existing products, or among themselves, resulting in cost interactions among products because of shared costs, and revenue interactions because of cannibalization. We present a cross-functional approach to evaluating multiple <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> that simultaneously considers revenue implications of component sharing at the product level and cost implications at the component level. We develop a source-of-volume model and a measurement procedure to decompose the life-cycle sales volume from a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> into sales from cannibalization, competitive draw, and demand expansion. We develop an activity-based costing procedure for estimating the life-cycle costs of <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> that share components. We develop an optimization model that uses these revenue and cost estimates {{to identify a}} subset of <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> that maximizes incremental profits. We implement our approach at a quartz wristwatch manufacturer. Results suggest that our approach would have improved profits for the firm by over 5 %, while actually launching fewer <b>line</b> <b>extensions.</b> We also find that the drivers of cannibalization are counterintuitive. In simulation studies, our approach outperforms three managerial heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach is most valuable when cannibalization dominates competitive draw {{as a source of}} volume, and discuss its relative merits under low and high parts-sharing.

40|$|<b>Line</b> <b>extensions</b> (i. e., the {{introduction}} of a new product that is a variation of a firm's existing product) are an important competitive instrument in consumer non-durable products. Using the `new empirical industrial organization' methodology, we examine the impact of a <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> on price competition between two national yogurt manufacturers. We find that the extending firm gains price-setting power. Additionally, the positioning of the <b>line</b> <b>extension</b> grows the combined sales, and raises the average weekly contributions for both the extending firm and the rival firm. We also discuss additional insights into the nature of competition before and after the extension...|$|R
50|$|Product <b>line</b> <b>extensions</b> are {{a process}} where {{companies}} with an established brand alter the factors {{of a product}} or products to satisfy a refined segment in the market. There {{are two types of}} product <b>line</b> <b>extensions,</b> horizontal and vertical.
