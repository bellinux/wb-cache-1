500|$|... "The Time of Angels" [...] is {{the fourth}} episode in the fifth series of British science fiction {{television}} series Doctor Who, first broadcast on 24 April 2010 on BBC One. It is the first episode of a two-part story written by showrunner Steven Moffat and directed by Adam Smith; the second episode was [...] "Flesh and Stone". Moffat utilised the two-part episode to bring <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> his previous creations: the Weeping Angels from his series three episode [...] "Blink", and River Song (Alex Kingston) from the series four episodes [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead". The episode is partly set in the 51st century.|$|E
500|$|On November 20, {{second baseman}} Chase Utley had hip surgery and was {{scheduled}} to be out for four to six months. However, on December 15, Utley said in a press conference that he could be ready for Opening Night. Just under four months later, Utley made his first pre-season game appearance in an intersquad game March 14, and his first appearance in actual game competition the next day against the St. Louis Cardinals. Third baseman Pedro Feliz also had surgery on his back to repair a herniated disc on the same day as Utley. Feliz officially returned to spring training action on March 13. During spring training, starting pitcher Cole Hamels left training camp on March 16 and flew to Philadelphia to have his left elbow examined by Dr. Michael Ciccotti. Hamels felt tightness in between innings and after he was done pitching for the day. [...] "This will obviously set me <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, and I don’t think that should be a big deal", said Hamels. However, the injury threw his Opening Day start against the Braves into doubt, even though Ciccotti found no structural damage in his arm; Brett Myers was announced as Hamels' replacement to start Opening Night.|$|E

[...] "This will obviously set me <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, and I don't think {{that should be a}} big deal", said Hamels. Ciccotti found no structural damage in his arm, yet Hamels still did not pitch on Opening Day as expected; Myers did for the third consecutive season. For {{the first time in his}} career, he went winless in his first four starts, and left back-to-back starts early due to injury in late April, sustaining a left-shoulder contusion and an ankle sprain respectively. From June on, however, he returned to his previous form, recording two complete-game shutouts (tied for the NL-lead), striking out at least 10 batters in two separate games, and amassing a 21-inning scoreless streak from August 21 to September 6, while allowing just two home runs in his final eight starts. In July, the Phillies augmented their starting rotation by acquiring two former Cy Young Award winners in Cliff Lee and Pedro Martínez from a trade and a free agent signing respectively. Due to his early season injury struggles, Hamels posted a 10–11 record and a 4.32 ERA in the regular season, his first major league season in which he posted a sub-.500 record, and the worst ERA of his career to that point.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1512, Cerón ordered another {{incursion}} {{into the}} lands of [...] "Alonso". Three months later, Hernando de la Torre targeted Orocobix. On June 10, 1512, Álvaro de Saavedra entered into {{the lands of}} Guayama. Two days later, the Spanish breached the domain of Agüeybana II, with Gil leading the horseback attack and carried <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> natives that were sold as slaves. Later that week, Gil and Luis de Añasco led two horseback slave hunts in Agüeybana II's domain. Juan López did the same. The captured natives were then auctioned at Villa San Germán, whose residents had grown increasingly interested in the royal terrains. Juan Godínez and Antón Cansino led similar incursions during this time. Cerón concluded the month by entering the lands of Orocobix. In July, Gil attacked the domain of Agüeybana II. On August 10, 1512, he led another incursion into the terrains of Orocobix. This {{was followed by a}} hiatus that extended for half a year.|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{his words}} were drowned by the furious shouts of the crowd, [...] "Death to the Flemings!" [...] and a rush was made at the door, headed by the clerk, who struck savagely at Edgar.

With a yell of rage the crowd now strove furiously to enter, but the {{position}} of the two lads standing <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> feet from the entrance rendered it impossible for {{more than two or three}} to attack them at once, and the clubs and rough weapons were no match for the swords.

6000|$|There was {{a little}} talk, and then {{two of the men}} went out and brought <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> strong ropes. A few minutes after their return Mark Thorndyke came in. He paused as he entered the room, in {{surprise}} at the silence that reigned, for he was accustomed to be greeted with friendly exclamations. However, as he walked in the door closed, and then suddenly, with shouts of [...] "Down with the spy!" [...] the men sprang from their seats and made a sudden rush at him. For a minute the struggle was tremendous; man after man went down under Mark's blows, others clung onto him from behind, a rope was passed round his legs and pulled, and he fell down with a crash, bringing down five or six of his assailants; a minute later he was gagged and bound.|$|E
6000|$|But Ben-Ahmed {{would not}} stand aside. Although an old man, {{he was still}} active and powerful.

Ill would it have fared with the Dey at that moment if Peter the Great had not possessed a mechanical turn of mind, and a big, powerful body, as well as a keen, quick eye for possibilities.

60|$|Astonished for the moment, Ralph fell <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> paces and {{surveyed}} him {{from head to}} foot. A spare, dark, withered man, of about his own age, with a stooping body, and a very sinister face rendered more ill-favoured by hollow and hungry cheeks, deeply sunburnt, and thick black eyebrows, blacker {{in contrast with the}} perfect whiteness of his hair; roughly clothed in shabby garments, of a strange and uncouth make; and having about him an indefinable manner of depression and degradation--this, for a moment, was all he saw. But he looked again, and the face and person seemed gradually to grow less strange; to change as he looked, to subside and soften into lineaments that were familiar, until at last they resolved themselves, as if by some strange optical illusion, into those of one whom he had known for many years, and forgotten and lost sight of for nearly as many more.|$|E

60|$|My {{friend and}} I were soon {{on the road}} {{which led to the}} farm of his brother Jonathan. It stood about two miles distant. On our way we had to pass one corner of the private domain of Black Jack, or David Marais, I forget which--I think it was the former. He was there ready for us, and evidently in a rage at the mere {{possibility}} of our intrusion, for the wings were going like flails and the tail was up. Hobson pulled up to look at him for a minute. I got down and went to the wall, knowing that it afforded perfect security. Black Jack came up slowly, as if he meant no mischief. I leant over the wall, which was breast-high, and poked fun at him. In an instant, like a flash of light, he came at me. I saw his great claw over my head, and almost before I could jump <b>back,</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> heavy stones were driven violently {{off the top of the}} wall. To bolt and jump into the cart was almost an involuntary and instantaneous impulse on my part, though there was no need for haste, because the furious biped could not leap the wall.|$|E
60|$|It is a {{delightful}} sight {{to watch the}} two little lilliputian proprietors approaching and milking these their wee green motionless cattle. First of all, the ants quickly scent their way with protruded antennæ (for they {{are as good as}} blind, poor things!) up the prickly stem of the rose-bush, guided, no doubt, by the faint perfume exhaled from the nectar above them. Smelling their road cautiously {{to the ends of the}} branches, they soon reach their own particular aphides, whose bodies they proceed gently to stroke with their outstretched feelers, and then stand by quietly for a moment in happy anticipation of the coming dinner. Presently, the obedient aphis, conscious of its lawful master's friendly presence, begins slowly to emit from two long horn-like tubes near the centre of its <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> limpid drops of a sticky pale yellow fluid. Honey-dew our English rustics still call it, because, when the aphides are not milked often enough by ants, they discharge it awkwardly of their own accord, and then it falls as a sweet clammy dew upon the grass beneath them. The ant, approaching the two tubes with cautious tenderness, removes the sweet drops without injuring in any way his little protégé, and then passes on to the next in order of his tiny cattle, leaving the aphis apparently as much relieved by the process as a cow with a full hanging udder is relieved by the timely attention of the human milkmaid.|$|E
6000|$|... “The {{thought of}} what was coming gave us fresh strength. We went at them with a will, and drove them <b>back</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> yards. Then Pearson shouted ‘Run!’ and back we went aft {{as hard as we}} could tear, Pearson and I almost {{dragging}} Conklin with us. As we passed between the guns, with the Malays close at our heels, both men fired; the guns were crammed almost to the mouth with bullets, and the execution was awful. In a moment we dashed at them again, while the men forward, who had armed themselves with the capstan-bars, ran down the ladder and fell upon them. In another minute it was all over. The Malays who remained alive sprang over the bulwark, and we discharged the remaining five cannons into the canoes, smashing up numbers of them, and the rest paddled for the shore for their lives. We had time now to look around. It was an awful sight. Over fifty Malays lay dead, together with eleven of our men, besides the captain. If it had not been for Pearson not a soul would have lived to tell the tale. After it was over, we found that, as the crowds on deck had increased, most of our old hands, who were the men that had taken the pistols, had gradually gathered near the forecastle. Some of the others had joined them, and when the outbreak came, they had for a time been able to make a stout resistance, until one of their number, who was on the forecastle when the fight began, shouted to them that we were training the cannon forward, and they then made a rush up and joined him.|$|E
