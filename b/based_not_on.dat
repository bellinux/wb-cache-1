5|$|Main reforms {{concerning}} the Roman Catholic Church were initiated {{and carried out}} under Maria Theresa, while the reforms under her son concerned their non-Catholic subjects. The ecclesiastical policies of Maria Theresa, like those of her devout predecessors, were <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> anti-religious principles, but on ensuring primacy of State control in Church-State relations.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Universal's conduct {{amounted}} to {{an abuse of}} judicial process, {{and in that sense}} caused a longer harm to the public as a whole. Depending on the commercial results, Universal alternatively argued to the courts, first, that King Kong {{was a part of the}} public domain, and then second, that King Kong was not part of the public domain, and that Universal possessed exclusive trademark rights in it. Universal's assertions in court were <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> any good faith belief in their truth, but on the mistaken belief that it could use the courts to turn a profit.|$|E

2500|$|Succession {{planning}} {{requires a}} sharp {{focus on the}} organization's future and vision, in order to align leadership development with the future that the organization aspires to create. Thus successive leadership development is <b>based</b> <b>not</b> only <b>on</b> knowledge and history but also on a dream. For such a plan to be successful, a screening of future leadership should be <b>based</b> <b>not</b> only <b>on</b> [...] "what we know and have" [...] but also on [...] "what we aspire to become".|$|R
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports that Jesus was a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E

25|$|Declining {{habitat is}} a major threat. For example, Asian arowanas are now {{uncommon}} in the Malay Peninsula, where they were once widely distributed, due to environmental destruction. Inclusion in the IUCN Red List was originally <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> biological reasons but on practical ones: though widely distributed throughout southeast Asia, they have been harvested heavily by aquarium collectors. However, habitat loss is likely a greater threat than aquarium collecting.|$|E
25|$|The opera {{was first}} portrayed in film in 1915 by famed {{director}} Cecil B. DeMille, and subsequently by directors Edwin Carewe in 1923, and John Francis Dillon, whose 1930 film was lost.

25|$|Militarily, {{the unit}} {{organization}} of the Abbasids was designed {{with the goal of}} ethnic and racial equality among supporters. When Abu Muslim recruited mixed Arab and Iranian officers along the Silk Road, he registered them <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> their tribal or ethno-national affiliations but on their current places of residence. This greatly diminished tribal and ethnic solidarity and replaced both concepts with a sense of shared interests among individuals.|$|E

If these numbers did change, there should be noticeable effects in the sky; stars in different directions would have different colours, for instance.|$|E

25|$|After World War II, {{there was}} also the Truman Directive of 1945, which did not allow more people to migrate, but did use the {{immigration}} quotas to let in more displaced people after the war. There was also the War Brides Act of 1945, which allowed spouses of US soldiers to get an expedited path towards citizenship. In contrast, the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, turned away migrants <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> their country of origin but rather whether they are moral or diseased.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the colonies in the East Indies, from {{the second half of}} the 19th century onwards, the Netherlands envisaged expansion of Dutch in its colonies in the West Indies. Until 1863, when slavery was abolished in the West Indies, slaves were forbidden to speak Dutch, with the effect that local creoles such as Papiamento and Sranan Tongo which were <b>based</b> <b>not</b> <b>on</b> Dutch but rather other European languages, became common in the Dutch West Indies. However, as most of the people in the Colony of Surinam (now Suriname) worked on Dutch plantations, this reinforced the use of Dutch as a means for direct communication.|$|E

Also, he advocated that places of education, such as museums and zoos, should be open to all on Sundays. The working week became five days long around 1960, and it was even later before shops were able to open on Sundays.|$|E
