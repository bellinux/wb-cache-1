5|$|In this work, Eakins took {{advantage}} of {{an exception to the}} generally prudish Victorian attitude to nudity: swimming naked was widely accepted, and for males was seen as normal, even in public spaces. Eakins was the first American artist to portray one of the few occasions in 19th-century life when nudity was on display. The Swimming Hole develops themes raised in his earlier work, in particular his treatment of <b>buttocks</b> <b>and</b> his ambiguous treatment of the human form; in some cases it is uncertain as to whether the forms portrayed are male or female. Such themes had earlier been examined in his The Gross Clinic (1875) and William Rush (1877), and would continue to be explored in his paintings of boxers (Taking the Count, Salutat, and Between Rounds) and wrestlers (Wrestlers).|$|E
5|$|Shawn Michaels {{returned}} on the June 12 {{episode of}} Raw and soon reunited with Triple H to re-form D-Generation X, turning Triple H into a fan favorite {{once again for}} the first time since 2002. DX defeated The Spirit Squad at Vengeance in a 5-on-2 handicap match. They continued their feud with Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon and The Spirit Squad for several weeks. They then defeated The Spirit Squad again on the July 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event in a 5-on-2 elimination match. They then again defeated the McMahons at SummerSlam, withstanding the attack of several wrestlers who assaulted them before the match as directed by Mr. McMahon. At Unforgiven, D-Generation X then defeated the McMahons and ECW World Champion Big Show in a 3-on-2 handicap Hell in a Cell match. During the match, DX embarrassed Vince by shoving his face in between Big Show's <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> DX won when Triple H broke a sledgehammer over the shoulders of Mr. McMahon after Michaels performed a Sweet Chin Music on him.|$|E

30|$|A 2 -year-old girl {{presented}} with rash on <b>buttock</b> <b>and</b> extremities for 4  days. Firstly the rash began as multiple vesicles on <b>buttock</b> <b>and</b> extremities and then changed into erythematous papules and crust on top. She {{has been in}} contact with two friends who had the same rash at school. She was diagnosed as chickenpox infection from a doctor. Physical examination demonstrated dry erythematous papules on arms, legs <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> with some desquamation on buttock. Few red macules were present on soles. No buccal and trunk lesions were detected (Figure  3 b). The cutaneous lesions in this case were presented as Gianotti–Crosti syndrome (GCS)-like because GCS is characterized by monomorphous lichenoid papules and/or papulovesicles, symmetrically distributed on the face, arms and legs with relative sparing of the trunk. However, the lesions in this case disappeared in a week.|$|R
25|$|On January 17, 2005, the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OKDHS) first {{confirmed}} abuse against Kelsey's mother after Kelsey {{was taken}} to a local emergency room with a broken collarbone, multiple bruises and abrasions to Kelsey's lower back, <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> thighs.|$|E
25|$|The bikini {{has spawned}} many stylistic variations. A regular bikini is a two-piece {{swimsuit}} that together covers a female's crotch, <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> breasts. Some bikini designs cover larger {{portions of the}} wearer's body while other designs provide minimal coverage. Topless variants are still sometimes considered bikinis, although they are technically not a two-piece swimsuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{superficial}} burrows of scabies usually {{occur in}} the area of the finger webs, feet, ventral wrists, elbows, back, <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> external genitals. Except in infants and the immunosuppressed, infection generally does not {{occur in the}} skin of the face or scalp. The burrows are created by excavation of the adult mite in the epidermis.|$|E

50|$|Muscle imbalance, trauma (e.g., {{falling on}} the <b>buttock)</b> <b>and</b> {{hormonal}} changes can all lead to SIJ dysfunction. Sacroiliac joint pain may be felt anteriorly, however, {{care must be taken}} to differentiate this from hip joint pain.|$|R
40|$|Hemipelvectomy {{utilizing}} an anterior myocutaneous flap {{is indicated}} for aggressive {{tumors of the}} <b>buttock</b> <b>and</b> proximal portion of the posterior thigh. A large operative defect created posteriorly by amputation of the lower extremity, hemipelvis, <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> is covered by a myocutaneous flap of quadriceps femoris muscle and overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue. The superficial femoral artery is preserved to sustain the myocutaneous flap...|$|R
25|$|Progestogens {{reportedly}} alter fat distribution (e.g., {{by increasing}} {{fat in the}} <b>buttocks</b> <b>and</b> thighs), increase sex drive (specifically progesterone, via its active metabolite allopregnanolone; this does not occur through activation of the progesterone receptor), cause increased appetite and weight gain (only in combination with estrogen), produce a sense of calm (i.e., anxiolysis), and promote sleep (i.e., sedative and hypnotic effects).|$|E
25|$|The {{trouble with}} this account is that Gigantopithecus {{was not a}} hominin and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet the {{physical}} evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with <b>buttocks</b> <b>and</b> a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.|$|E
25|$|In {{surgical}} praxis, {{the abdomen}} {{is the primary}} donor-site for harvesting the tissues to create the free flap, because that region of the woman’s body usually contain’s sufficient (redundant) adipocyte fat and skin -tissues that are biologically compatible and aesthetically adequate {{for the construction of}} a substitute breast. The secondary donor-sites for harvesting adipocyte and skin tissues to create a free flap are the regions of: (i) the gluteus maximus muscles, (ii) the medial thigh, (iii) the <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> (iv) the waist of the woman’s body.|$|E
25|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} is often left undiagnosed and mistaken with other pains due to similar symptoms with back pain, quadriceps pain, lower leg pain, <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> pain. These symptoms include tenderness, tingling and numbness initiating in lower back <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> area <b>and</b> then radiating {{down to the}} thigh and to the leg.|$|R
50|$|Padded control briefs or hip <b>and</b> <b>buttock</b> padding {{may be used}} to {{increase}} the apparent size of hips <b>and</b> <b>buttocks.</b> Buttock augmentation surgery may be used {{to increase}} the size of hips <b>and</b> <b>buttocks</b> to make them look more rounded.|$|R
50|$|Usage {{varies from}} animal to animal. Birds and cattle {{are said to}} have a rump and tailhead. Dogs {{are said to have}} a rump and dock. Horses are said to have a croup (sometimes rump), thigh or haunch, <b>buttock,</b> <b>and</b> dock.|$|R
25|$|Later in 1944, Compton {{was shot}} through the {{buttocks}} while participating in Operation Market Garden, the Allies' ill-fated attempt to seize a number of bridges in the Netherlands and cross the Rhine River into Germany. The bullet traveled sideways, through {{one side of the}} <b>buttocks</b> <b>and</b> out the other side. After a partial recovery, he returned to E Company in time for the siege in the frozen Ardennes that became known as the Battle of the Bulge. In January 1945, Compton left E Company for another assignment.|$|E
25|$|Hand, foot, {{and mouth}} disease (HFMD) {{is a common}} {{infection}} caused {{by a group of}} viruses. It typically begins with a fever and feeling generally unwell. This is followed a day or two later by flat discolored spots or bumps that may blister, on the hands, feet, and mouth, and occasionally <b>buttocks</b> <b>and</b> groin. Signs and symptoms normally appear 3–6 days after exposure to the virus. The rash generally goes away on its own in about a week. Fingernail and toenail loss may occur a few weeks later, but will regrow with time.|$|E
25|$|At 6:30a.m. on April 16, {{the body}} of a 13-year-old schoolgirl named Dawn Louise Basom was found {{discarded}} beside a desolate road in Ypsilanti. Clothed only in a white blouse and bra, which had been pushed around her neck, she had been repeatedly stabbed in the chest and genitals, had received multiple slash wounds across the breasts, <b>buttocks</b> <b>and</b> stomach, then strangled to death with a two-foot length electrical flex still knotted around her neck. A handkerchief found stuffed in her mouth had likely been placed there to muffle her cries throughout her torture, and her murderer had placed her body in a location where rapid discovery was assured.|$|E
50|$|There are sex-dependent {{differences}} in regional fat distribution. In women, estrogen {{is believed to}} cause fat to be stored in the <b>buttocks,</b> thighs, <b>and</b> hips. When women reach menopause and the estrogen produced by ovaries declines, fat migrates from their <b>buttocks,</b> hips, <b>and</b> thighs to their belly.|$|R
30|$|An 11 -month-old boy {{presented}} with rash on body without fever. Physical examination demonstrated widespread vesicular eruption on arms, legs, hands, feet, <b>buttock</b> <b>and</b> ears. He also had large vesicles on arms, legs <b>and</b> <b>buttock.</b> Mouth ulcers were also detected. His mother worried about varicella infection. Tzanck smear {{was done and}} showed multiple neutrophils and mononuclear cells without multinucleated giant cell (Figure  2 c). He had delayed desquamation on his soles after rash disappeared.|$|R

25|$|The {{development}} of secondary sex characteristics in women {{is driven by}} estrogens, to be specific, estradiol. These changes are initiated {{at the time of}} puberty, most are enhanced during the reproductive years, and become less pronounced with declining estradiol support after menopause. Thus, estradiol produces breast development, and is responsible for changes in the body shape, affecting bones, joints, and fat deposition. In females, estradiol induces breast development, widening of the hips, a feminine fat distribution (with fat deposited particularly in the breasts, hips, thighs, and <b>buttocks),</b> <b>and</b> maturation of the vagina and vulva, whereas it mediates the pubertal growth spurt (indirectly via increased growth hormone secretion) and epiphyseal closure (thereby limiting final height) in both sexes.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 1992, Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old {{woman from}} Albuquerque, New Mexico, ordered a 49-cent {{cup of coffee}} from the drive-through window of a local McDonald's {{restaurant}} located at 5001 Gibson Boulevard Southeast. Liebeck was in the passenger's seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled {{the far side of}} the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap. Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> groin.|$|E
25|$|Common {{constitutional}} {{signs and}} symptoms of the HFMD include fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling tired, generalized discomfort, loss of appetite, and irritability in infants and toddlers. Skin lesions frequently develop {{in the form of a}} rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes on the lips. The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7–10 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur.|$|E

25|$|Donald (Stephen Merchant) and Emily (Halle Berry) {{are on a}} date {{together}} at a Mexican restaurant. Tired of typical first dates, Emily challenges Donald to a game of truth or dare. She dares him to grab a man's <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> he follows with daring her to blow out the birthday candles on a blind boy's cake. The game rapidly escalates to extremes, in which both of them get plastic surgery and tattoos, and humiliate themselves. When Donald and Emily arrive back at Emily's apartment, they praise their date. Donald tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming she's not attracted to Asian men (which he was surgically altered to resemble). It is revealed that she was joking and invites him {{to have sex with}} her as she shows him her enlarged breasts.|$|E
25|$|GH {{treatment}} {{is not recommended}} {{for children who are}} not growing despite having normal levels of growth hormone, and in the UK it is not licensed for this use. Children requiring treatment usually receive daily injections of growth hormone. Most pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth and adjust dose every 3–6 months and many of these visits involve blood tests and x-rays. Treatment is usually extended as long as the child is growing, and lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient. Nearly painless insulin syringes, pen injectors, or a needle-free delivery system reduce the discomfort. Injection sites include the biceps, thigh, <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> stomach. Injection sites should be rotated daily to avoid lipoatrophy. Treatment is expensive, costing as much as US $10,000 to $40,000 a year in the USA.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{relatives}} of the PWD are widely {{thought to be the}} Standard Poodle. Like Poodles and several other water dog breeds, PWDs are intelligent, can have curly coats, have webbed toes for swimming, and do not shed. However, Portuguese Water Dogs are more robustly built, with stout legs, and can have a wavy coat instead of tightly curled. If comparing the structure to that of a Poodle, there are {{significant differences between the two}} breeds. The Portuguese Water Dog is built of strong substantial bone; well developed, neither refined nor coarse, and a solidly built, muscular body. The Portuguese Water Dog is off-square, slightly longer than tall when measured from prosternum to rearmost point of the <b>buttocks,</b> <b>and</b> from withers to ground. Portuguese Water Dog eyes are black or various tones of brown, and their coats can be black, brown, black and white or brown and white.|$|E
