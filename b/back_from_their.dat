5|$|Hervey le Breton (also {{known as}} Hervé le Breton; died 30 August 1131) was a Breton cleric who became Bishop of Bangor in Wales and later Bishop of Ely in England. Appointed to Bangor by King William II of England, when the Normans were {{advancing}} into Wales, Hervey {{was unable to}} remain in his diocese when the Welsh began to drive the Normans <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> recent conquests. Hervey's behaviour towards the Welsh seems to have contributed to his expulsion from his see. Although the new king, Henry I wished to translate Hervey to the see of Lisieux in Normandy, it was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|North Korean forces {{began making}} {{gains in the}} hills along the river {{adjacent}} to their bridgehead, against positions of the 34th Infantry. Coordinated attacks pushed A Company to the north <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> hills with heavy casualties on August 7. K Company to the south was also attacked but held its line, reinforced by L Company on August 10. Fighting continued for several days, resulting in heavy casualties as both sides captured and recaptured the hills along the Naktong, neither side able to gain a decisive advantage against the other.|$|E
5000|$|The Trades Union Congress (TUC) was {{established}} in 1868 and formed a committee to act on its decisions and direct activities between conferences.

Shortly after, the Allied armies launched the Battle of Amiens, {{which led to the}} start of the Hundred Days Offensive, the culminating offensive of the war. In the 38th Division sector, the Fourth Army pushed the Germans <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> gains and onto the eastern bank of the Ancre. The 38th Division was assigned to cross the river and clear the German-held Thiepval ridge north of Albert.|$|E
5|$|After {{striking}} Tulagi, Yorktown rejoined with Lexington, {{and the two}} carriers {{engaged the}} rest of the Japanese forces involved in the Mo operation from 6–8 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea. In the battle, Lexington was sunk and Yorktown was damaged. The Japanese suffered Shōhō sunk, a fleet carrier heavily damaged, and heavy losses to their carrier aircraft and aircrews. Fearing more damaging attacks from Allied land-based aircraft or warships and unable because of their aircraft losses to provide adequate air cover for their naval surface forces, the Japanese turned <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> planned assault on Port Moresby with the intention of trying again later. The next Japanese seaborne attempt to take Port Moresby, however, never happened, mainly because of their navy's defeat in June at the Battle of Midway. Instead, the Japanese decided to try to take Port Moresby in an ultimately unsuccessful overland attack along the Kokoda Track. The failure to take Port Moresby in May 1942 would have significant and far-reaching strategic implications, many of which involved the small Japanese naval base at Tulagi.|$|E

Gradually, military supervision was relaxed and the original group began to take over, with beneficial results.|$|E

25|$|In February 1944, Meretskov was {{transferred}} to the Karelian Front. Here, he participated in the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive that started in June 1944. His front liberated the city of Petrozavodsk and East Karelia. In October, Meretskov was ordered to clear the city of Petsamo, in northern Finland, of Germans and to drive the German army back into Norway. Meretskov was able to use his knowledge of Arctic warfare to launch a co-ordinated offensive called the Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive that drove the Germans <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> positions. After this offensive Meretskov was promoted to the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union, on October 26, 1944.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{took the}} bait, {{when he and}} an aide, Maj. Theodore Winthrop, devised {{a plan for a}} dawn attack on June 10, 1861, after a night march to drive the Confederates <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> bases. Butler chose not to lead the force in person, for which he was later criticized. The plan proved too complex for his poorly-trained {{subordinates}} to carry out, especially at night, and his staff had also omitted to communicate the passwords. They were trying to advance without knowledge of the layout or strength of the Confederate positions, when a friendly fire incident gave away their own. The commander in the field, Massachusetts militia Gen. Ebenezer Peirce, received the most criticism for the failed operation.|$|E

Jacques Kallis and Ashwell Prince broke an 80-year-old record for the highest fourth-wicket partnership for South Africa against Australia. Ricky Ponting then scored a century to bring Australia within 97 runs of South Africa, and rain cut 70 overs off the fourth day before South Africa declared 286 runs ahead midway through the morning session on the fifth. Ponting then hit another century, becoming the first batsman to hit centuries in both innings of his 100th Test, and guided Australia to an eight-wicket win.|$|E
25|$|By 13:30 the Wellington Mounted Rifles {{had gained}} a footing {{on the ridge}} by rapidly {{capturing}} small tactical positions at the gallop. They achieved their objective by successive rushes driving the Ottoman defenders <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> main position. Major Wilder's 9th Squadron supported by the 2nd Squadron had rushed the first Ottoman position with the bayonet; one machine-gun and one Lewis gun were captured. These guns were used against the second position which was captured by another bayonet charge; two more machine-guns being captured. The third Ottoman position situated well along the long side of the ridge was then attacked. But Red Knoll, located close to the junction with the short leg and practically {{in front of the}} dividing line between the two regiments, poured fire directly on them all.|$|E
25|$|Another Boer {{invasion}} in 1867 was more {{dangerous for the}} Basotho. The Europeans had upgraded their rifles, obtained more powerful artillery, and augmented their numbers with white volunteers from across South Africa. Once again they converged on Thaba Boisu, liquidating local strongholds on the way. A first assault against the fortress ended in failure. A second drove the Basotho <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> advanced defence lines, but also became bogged down. A third also stalled when a Boer leader was shot dead. The conflict dragged on for 6 months as the Boers ravaged Basotho territory, seizing cattle, people and burning crops to bring their opponents to heel. In early 1868 however Moshoeshoe persuaded the British to intervene and placed his kingdom under crown protection. This ended the Boer siege although a subsequent treaty transferred yet more Basotho land to their enemies.|$|E

25|$|The club {{started their}} 2013–14 season with three {{straight}} league losses and an immediate exit from European football. They got {{knocked out of}} the cup in the quarter finals. The team managed to come <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> early 17th league position and climbed to fourth place by the halfway point. They stayed in this position {{for most of the}} second half of the season and went on a winning streak to finish the 2013–14 Eredivisie in second place. This position gave the club an entry berth in the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. Five Feyenoord players from this season were selected for the Dutch squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup – Feyenoord contributed the most players to the Dutch team. Nine out of all World Cup players were trained by Feyenoord; they were the club that contributed most worldwide to develop players for this event.|$|E

On 21 May 140 Bde (temporarily under the command of Col Faux of the 1/7th) was subjected to a heavy bombardment, and the Germans attacked in the evening. The weight of the attack fell on 1/7th and 1/8th Londons, who were forced <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>their</b> front and support lines halfway down the slope. 1/7th made a local counter-attack, but it was too weak to succeed. After a night and day of confusion, the 1/6th and 1/7th Bns pushed forward 250 yards to reoccupy an old French trench which they consolidated and thereby prevented any further enemy advance. They were relieved in the evening of 22 May, having suffered heavy casualties.|$|E
