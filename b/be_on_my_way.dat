6000|$|... "I'll <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{just the}} same." [...] Young Dick turned {{as if to}} depart, paused casually, and said over his shoulder, [...] "Better come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jim, [...] "I gotta <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> Here's the Tribune--there ain't nothin' more fer ye. So long! Giddap!" [...] {{and he was}} gone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Extraordinary!" [...] I cried. [...] "Do you know, Hilda, as luck {{will have}} it, I also shall <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Bombay {{by the very}} same steamer!" ...|$|E
50|$|Ah goin guh buy it. I <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to buy it.|$|R
60|$|I {{mentioned}} that I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Branscombe, and inquired the distance.|$|R
60|$|In {{a moment}} I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the post-office, three blocks distant.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Chandos, [...] "I must <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back; {{for that}} {{expedition}} to Bescancon must be looked to. But {{what is to}} be done with the boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope it {{will not}} take long to grant," [...] he rejoins; [...] "for I have only to-night to be with you. To-morrow morning, before you are up, I must <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back to Chalons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such are the thanks of the ungodly people," [...] said Jeph, gravely rising. [...] "I must <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back. We are digging {{trenches}} {{about this}} great city, assuredly believing that {{it shall be}} delivered into our hands." ...|$|E
60|$|By daybreak {{the next}} morning, I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back to <b>my</b> own country.|$|R
60|$|So I went to pack my bag. And {{within an}} hour I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to France.|$|R
60|$|THE {{next day}} I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the north. My {{narrative}} brightens again--but {{let us not}} forget Sir Gervase Damian.|$|R
6000|$|... "How be you, Will? Kind of poorly, I callate. So Cynthy's b'en took," [...] he said sadly. [...] "Always {{thought a}} sight of Cynthy. Little Cynthy favors her some. Yes, thought I'd drop {{in and see}} how you <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' said I, 'whatever we do {{must be done}} at once, for {{my orders}} are to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Abrantes by {{tomorrow}} night. But we must have some information first, and here is someone who {{should be able to}} give it to us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eight days, I think. I {{have been}} up the road to Portalegre, and by that to Lavre; and if I had not, unfortunately, accidentally heard of this road over the mountains, I should now <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Madrid; but luck has been against me." ...|$|E
60|$|The bargain was struck, I {{was taken}} to Stipbitts, and an hour {{afterward}} I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to <b>my</b> home at Arden.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to {{a dinner}} party," [...] she whispered, with humorously uplifted eyebrows. [...] "I must drive back home, and--and--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{came across}} the {{professor}} unexpectedly," [...] Tavernake answered, coldly. [...] "What do you want with me, please? I <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home." ...|$|R
60|$|I left Rome yesterday, and am {{on my way}} home; but, alas! {{might as}} well <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home from Cochin China, for any chance I have of speedily arriving. Meantime your letters will reach me here with speed, {{and will be a}} great comfort to me, if they don't fatigue you.|$|E
60|$|When {{you receive}} this I shall <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to London. I {{was married to}} Oliver Haddo this morning. I love him as I never loved Arthur. I have acted in this manner because I thought I {{had gone too far}} with Arthur to make an {{explanation}} possible. Please tell him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear madam, don't be alarmed! I will {{accompany}} you; and I {{will answer}} for the result. We will pay our visit at tea-time. Let her {{offer you a}} cup--and let me (under pretence of handing it) get possession of the poisoned drink. Before she can cry Stop!--I shall <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the chemist.|$|E
6000|$|Half an {{hour after}} {{receiving}} this information, I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Portland Place--without having {{had the courage to}} own it to Mr. Bruff! ...|$|R
60|$|My tale was not {{too hard}} of belief, and before noon I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Winchelsea, a stout nag enough between my legs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} your word!" [...] Mannering said. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Portland Crescent, but I fancy that I have taken a wrong turn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't ask you {{to answer}} this, for I shall <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> home, I hope, long before your letter could reach me in this out-of-the-way place. Whatever you do, don't lose a moment in going to Major Milroy. Go, on second thoughts, whether {{the loss of the}} yacht is known in England or not.|$|E
60|$|I {{ceased to}} think of Uncle 'Rasmus who had been alone in the cabin all day, and gave no heed {{whatsoever}} to those scoundrels in the loft; forgot all else save {{the fact that the}} moment was fast approaching when I would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to the American lines with the most welcome news ever carried by a lad of Virginia.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam, Robert was {{cut down}} by the Lord Clifford beside the Earl of Rutland. 'Tis a lost field! I barely 'scaped with a dozen men. I came but to bear the tidings, and see whether you needed an arm to hold out the castle for young Bernard. Or I would <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to my own folk on the Border, for the Queen's men will anon be everywhere, since the Duke is slain!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hem! ... hem! ..." [...] stammered Master Skyffington, [...] "I ... that is ... hem ... I left Canterbury {{this morning}} and <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Dover ... hem ... this lies <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way,</b> ma'am ... and ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} there since an hour before noon, and only left when I had to go for {{something}} to eat. Now I <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the work}} of Providence," [...] murmured the sufferer. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> hither when the storm overtook the Mary Lee. I--I--a drink--I am fainting!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{everything}} {{will still be}} for the best, never fear, my good Beresteyn," [...] exclaimed Stoutenburg, whose hard, cruel face was glowing with excitement. [...] "Chance indeed has been on our side throughout this business. An you will trust me to finish it now; you'll have no cause for anxiety or regrets. Come! let us find Jan at once! I have a few orders to give him, and then mean to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to Ryswyk to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You saw nobody outside there? I hardly {{thought you}} would," [...] he said. [...] "Our animal {{instincts}} are sometimes more useful than our powers of reasoning, Hilton. It {{is probable that}} if you had not checked me, I should now <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> out of this land of surprises. What we heard was a diminutive arrow, no doubt with the venom there's no cure for upon its point. It could not have been shot at us by either of the Africans yonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind," [...] {{retorted}} Sammy. [...] "I simply {{mean that}} nobody can do everything, and that very often two heads are better than one. It struck me that you had something on your mind, and I thought I {{might be able to}} help you get rid of it. But of course, if you don't want my help, supposing I could and would give it to you, that is an end of the matter, and I guess I'll <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> The Old Briar-patch is rather a dull place anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said grimly, [...] "that {{you will}} not think it of much importance. I <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{to play in a}} golf tournament there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, {{making a}} virtue of necessity. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to {{surrender}} for trial, and redeem my bail. Now {{you can understand}} my hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> {{to catch}} the ten o'clock train from Charing Cross," [...] Richard went on. [...] "If I don't catch it, my leave will be broken." ...|$|R
