5000|$|There {{was not one}} {{bottleneck}} to faster casting production {{but rather}} several. Improvements were made in molding speed, molding sand preparation, sand mixing, core manufacturing processes, and the slow metal melting rate in cupola furnaces. In 1912, the sand slinger was invented by the American company Beardsley & Piper. In 1912, the first sand mixer with individually mounted revolving plows was marketed by the Simpson Company. In 1915, the first experiments started with bentonite clay instead of simple fire clay as the <b>bonding</b> <b>additive</b> to the molding sand. This increased tremendously the green and dry strength of the molds. In 1918, the first fully automated foundry for fabricating hand grenades for the U.S. Army went into production. In the 1930s the first high-frequency coreless electric furnace was installed in the U.S. In 1943, ductile iron was invented by adding magnesium to the widely used grey iron. In 1940, thermal sand reclamation was applied for molding and core sands. In 1952, the [...] "D-process" [...] was developed for making shell molds with fine, pre-coated sand. In 1953, the hotbox core sand {{process in which the}} cores are thermally cured was invented. In 1954, a new core binder—water glass (sodium silicate), hardened with CO2 from ambient air, came into use.|$|E

An especially interesting subclass of these descriptors consists of 148 discrete Adriatic indices.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{apparatus and}} test procedure {{was developed to}} compare the performance of two solid lubricant coatings for air lubricated compliant foil gas bearings in the temperature range of 25 to 315 C. Polyimide <b>bonded</b> <b>additive</b> (SBGC) were tested extensively for durability and frictional characteristics. A partial arc bearing constructed of Inconel X- 750 was coated on the bore {{with one of these}} coatings. The foil was subjected to repeated start/stop cycles. Performance comparisons reveal that although both coatings survive thousands of start/stop cycles, only the PBGF coated bearing achieves the specified 9000 start/stops. There is enough wear on the SBGC coated bearing to warrant termination of the test prior to 9000 start/stop cycles due to coating failure. The frictional characteristics of the PBGF are better at the elevated temperatures than at lower temperatures; a marked increase in sliding friction occurs as the temperature decreases. The SBGC maintains relatively constant frictional characteristics independent of operating temperature...|$|R

30|$|These “Poem” {{prints are}} part of a {{distinctive}} artistic group of works created in the late 1960 s to early 1970 s, a period when Maki’s key work, Festive Wine, was receiving international recognition [1]. The series bears the striking contrast of colors, dramatic embossing, and innovative textural effects that are hallmarks of Maki’s prints, bringing his ancient subject matter into a modern print vernacular. These visual properties were created using a printmaking technique that involved building up cement around the carved designs on a traditionally prepared woodblock [2]. The technique used for creating the “Poem” series was slightly modified from his other kanji prints. Laminated sheets of damp paper were laid over the uninked, cement-enhanced woodblock and passed through the press a number of times to deeply emboss the figural elements and to impart the cement’s texture. Velvety black poster color was then applied to the entire surface of the paper {{with the exception of the}} margins. Laying a stencil over the matte black areas, Haku Maki applied colored inks over embossed areas. In the scant contemporary literature on Maki’s printmaking [1, 2], he is reported to have relied on Portland cement modified with a chemical <b>bond</b> <b>additive</b> to create his hard textural surfaces and a coating of shellac to prevent water penetration into the block. His colors were comprised of poster paints, oil paints thinned with turpentine, and full-bodied offset printing inks diluted with a thinner spread ink to prevent the paper from sticking to the block or to create a glossier appearance. Other than this meagre description, little definitive information is known about his choices of pigments or media.|$|R

Effect of the type, composition, average molecular weight and amount of the silicone additive in the blends, on the surface properties were determined. Influence of the thermal history of the samples on the surface properties was also investigated. All of the blends showed formation of silicone rich surfaces.

The ability to seamlessly join materials with significant differences in properties would advance the development of efficient designs and concepts within many fields. In this work, bonds between aluminium and carbon-fibre reinforced plastic have been studied. The aluminium side of the bonds were fabricated using classical methods (milling) and additive manufacturing. Two types of bonds were fabricated using additive manufacturing, one flat, relying on the rough surface for adhesion in the bond, {{and the other with}} surface features designed to hook into the carbon-fibre plies.

40|$|The work of {{this thesis}} {{was carried out in}} order to try to {{understand}} more fully the structure and solvating properties of water. Several forms of spectroscopy were used to gain information on the effect of non-electrolyte and electrolytes on the structure of water. The spectra of water and aqueous solutions are generally regarded as being uninformative as the bands are broad and insensitive to additives. However, the work in this thesis overcomes the problem by isotopic dilution of H 2 O by D 2 O and by greatly lowering the temperature of the solutions to form 'glassy solids'. The bands become better resolved and information can be obtained from the appearance of sub-bands. A water molecule is capable of forming four hydrogen-bonds, tetrahedrally disposed, but this ideal situation does not exist in liquid water and hydrogen-bonds will be constantly breaking to give OH free and Lone Pair groups. The presence of the OH free groups was monitored in the near infrared as a function of temperature and added electrolytes and nonelectrolytes. In the infrared, at low temperatures, bands can be identified due to OH groups <b>bonded</b> to <b>additives.</b> Using these results, this thesis attempts to explain the manner in which water solvates and also to calculate the percentage of OH free groups which are present in pure water at room temperature.

In this paper we show that a typical dewatering agent (DWA), dioctyl sodiumsuccinate, decomposes to a series VOCs under conditions that are representative of an industrial calcination stack. At lower temperatures of 300 - 700 °C, the predominant VOC released is 3 -methyleneheptane (3 -MH), due to cleavage of the alkyl-O <b>bond</b> in the <b>additive</b> precursor.

In support of this objective, several sub-objectives were accomplished. First, an expert system addressing the major problems associated with gypsum wallboard manufacturing was developed. Second, manufacturing problems that utilized quantifiable process data in their problem solving procedures were identified for incorporation into the system. Third, the statistical process control techniques of control charting to filter process information were applied to selected problems in the manufacturing process. Finally, the system was implemented and verified. Several stagesand accompanying methods marked the development of this system. Identifying crucial parameters for expert system development, acquiring knowledge for those identified parameters, coding the knowledge base, adapting statistical process control (SPC) techniques to filter process data, and lastly, implementing the system in the study facility were the elements of the full expert system.

40|$|Using {{ab initio}} MO theory, {{a series of}} isodesmic {{reactions}} was studied in which nitrogen-, oxygen-, and fluorine-containing species acted as proton donors and accepters. Comparison of protonation and deprotonation energies suggests that approximately three-quarters of the enhanced acidity of acetic acid comes from electrostatic stabilization, while the remaining quarter results from pi resonance. Similar logic shows that only one-third of the enhanced acidity of the nitrogen analogue acetamidine is electrostatic in nature, and that the remaining two-thirds derives from resonance. The primary importance of electrostatics for oxygen and of pi resonance for nitrogen is further supported by the behavior of carbonic acid and guanidine. The contributions of hydroxy, amino, and fluorine substituents to the acidity and basicity {{of a series of}} alcohols and amines are well described by a simple electrostatic model with a single adjustable parameter. The model requires the electrostatic contributions of polar <b>bonds</b> to be <b>additive,</b> to be of equal magnitude but opposite sign for anions and cations, and to be strictly proportional to the electronegativity differences between the atoms comprising the bonds. Application of this model to a series of reactions lacking pi bonds results in a correlation coefficient of 0. 99, and indicates that on average C-F bonds contribute 15 kcal/mol, C-O bonds 9 kcal/mol, and C-N bonds 4 kcal/mol to differential acidity and basicity. Further application of the model allows an estimation of pi resonance contributions to the acidity and basicity of acetic acid and a series of related compounds.

40|$|Sintering {{of silicon}} carbide (SiC) {{requires}} high temperature and pressure {{due to the}} covalent nature of its <b>bonding.</b> Therefore, sintering <b>additives</b> are used to lower the sintering temperature and to control the microstructure. In this work, role of aluminium nitride (AlN) and carbon in pressure assisted densification is studied as the literature was not clear on whether AlN always induces liquid phase sintering (LPS). It is shown that mixing suffices to produce green bodies in which AlN is present as individual particles. When heated above 1700 ⁰C the AlN redistributes to grain boundaries and triple junctions through vapour transport and grain boundary diffusion, which causes the onset of densification. Addition of AlN and carbon together leads to microstructure more consistent with solid state sintering (SSS) than with LPS which was induced {{with the addition of}} yttria and AlN. Nano-indentation was used to measure hardness as a function of strain rate and temperature. It was found that hardness increases 0. 8 GPa per decade strain rate and decreases with increasing temperature. Since in the absence of cracking hardness is a function of stiffness and yield stress, nano-indentation was used to calculate the Peierls stress (12 ± 1 GPa), activation energy (1. 1 ± 0. 3 eV) and the activation volume (1. 44 x 10 ⁻²⁹ m³) of dislocation glide in SiC. Grain size was found to have a minimal effect on plasticity of the material when indents are small. Consistent with widely reported trends, the hardness was found to decrease when higher loads are used. It is argued that this decrease in hardness is due to an increase in crack length relative to the indent size. An empirical model, based on dimensional analysis, describes the observed decrease in hardness rather well.

High loadings of well-dispersed nanofillers are generally important for many applications including mechanical reinforcing of polymers. In particular the composites shown in this work might find use as etch masks in nanolithography, or for enabling various phase selective reactions for new materials development. ^ This work explores the use of hydrogen bonding interactions between various additives (such as homopolymers and non-polymeric additives) and small, disordered BCPs to cause the formation of well-ordered morphologies with small domains. A detailed study {{of the organization of}} homopolymer chains and the evolution of structure during the process of ordering is performed. The results demonstrate that by tuning the selective interaction of the additive with the incorporating phase of the BCP, composites with significantly high loadings of additives can be formed while maintaining order in the BCP morphology. The possibility of high and selective loading of additives in one of the phases of the ordered BCP composite opens new avenues due to high degree of functionalization and the proximity of the additives within the incorporating phase. This aspect is utilized in one case for the formation of a network structure between adjoining additive cores to derive mesoporous inorganic materials with their structures templated by the BCP. ^ The concept of additive-driven assembly is extended to formulate BCPadditive blends with an ability to undergo photo-induced ordering. Underlying this strategy is the ability to transition a weakly interacting additive to its strongly interacting form. This strategy provides an on-demand, non-intrusive route for formation of well-ordered nanostructures in arbitrarily defined regions of an otherwise disordered material. ^ The second area explored in this dissertation deals with the incorporation of additives into photoresists for next generation extreme ultra violet (EUV) photolithography applications. The concept of hydrogen <b>bonding</b> between the <b>additives</b> and the polymeric photoresist was utilized to cause formation of a physical network that is expected to slow down the diffusion of photoacid leading to better photolithographic performance (25 - 30 nm resolution obtained). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is {{investigation}} of the morphology of a crystal surface by means of statistical mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations. We employ solid-on-solid models, modified to include the effects of corner and edge energies of faceted surfaces. We also account for surface configurational entropy associated with various surface configurations (colonies of facets). This {{is an extension of}} the work of Herring who ignored corner and edge energies and effectively treated periodic hill-and-valley structures, which have no configurational entropy. The excess energies from the corners and edges of a surface also affect the equilibrium shape of very small crystals. These and other related effects are studied on solid-on-solid models for nearest-neighbor forces with central symmetry and <b>additive</b> <b>bond</b> energies. We obtain theoretical formulae for configurational entropy and theoretical distributions of the heights and lengths of facets on one-dimensional crystal surfaces (two-dimensional crystals). These results are tested by comparison with simulation data and good agreement results. A modified solid-on-solid model with nearest neighbor energy proportional to the nearest neighbor height difference raised to a power p is used to account for effects of corner and edge energies for two-dimensional surfaces (three-dimensional crystals). On an initially flat (100) surface, a slight change of p-value has a significant effect on surface morphology. Especially for p = 0 : 9, which corresponds to positive corner energies, a “macroscopic smoothing” transition from a faceted surface at low temperatures to a non-faceted surface at high temperatures is observed. This transition is only evident for surfaces that are initially tilted with respect to a close-packed surface. We also develop a symmetric solid-on-solid model that preserves crystal symmetry. For this symmetric model, the “macroscopic smoothing” transition for p = 0 : 9 is still observed on (111) and (112) surfaces, but now the surface structure is consistent with crystal symmetry. We find a hysteresis effect in these transitions, which is less pronounced for large systems. We calculate the correlation time of the surface by several different measures to study the relaxation of the system. A discrete Fourier analysis of the surface is implemented and we verify that there exists a long-wave fluctuation in the surface. We also study the distribution of facet areas and facet heights, which turns out to be exponential. A histogram method is employed to extend results at a given temperature to nearby temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Lubricants {{and cooling}} agents such as oil, {{ethylene}} glycol, and water {{are often used}} as traditional heat transfer fluids (HTFs) in engines, radiators, heat pumps, and other equipment which require cooling and/or energy maintenance. The United States of America (USA) spends over $ 80 billion on energy maintenance and increasing the thermal efficiency of HTFs by 25 % could annually save over $ 20 billion. This study was aimed at improving the thermal conductivity (TC) of synthetic and vegetable oil heat transfer fluids (HTFs) by using Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs) additives {{that resulted in a}} semi-solid lubricant that was a nanotube-HTF (n-HTF). The n-HTFs were processed with nitrogen containing additives that coupled with toluene and acetone solvent processing promoted the gelation of the carbon nanotube fibers in the oil. Such processing improved the nanotube dispersion due to hydrogen bonding (H bonding) and micelle formation of the amine groups around the carbon nanotube rod-like fibers and the additive-oil matrix. This allowed for high weight percent (Wt %) loadings of carbon nanotubes in the oil. Characterization via thermal graviometric analysis (TGA) and Fourier Infrared Transform (FTIR) showed that high temperature radical mechanisms breakdown both the oil and nanotubes, and optical microscopy showed that sonication-homogenizing-mixing affects the coagulation-flocculation-aggregation-agglomeration of the nanotubes. Additionally we used two new TC instruments, the Mathis-Hot Disk and KD 2 systems, to provide accurate and reproducible data with a 10 % and 4 % error margin for the Mathis and KD 2, respectively. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies suggest that the TC enhancements result from SWNT phonon mechanisms, these being phonon-phonon, phonon-defect, and phonon-interface, all of which are present at room temperature with the absence of ballistic and superconductivity phenomena. Additional vibrations in the oil that occur due to Brownian motion and electron-phonon and H <b>bonding</b> from the <b>additives</b> would have also contributed to the TC mechanism and were evidenced via Raman spectroscopy and FTIR. The optical microscopy, Raman, FTIR, and TC values indicated that the n-HTFs had a three-dimensional (3 D) SWNT networked structure due to the inclusion of the oleylamine additive and the toluene-acetone processing. This would have resulted in the formation of oleylamine-nanotube micelles that were suspended in the oil-additive mixture. Raman spectroscopy evidenced a percolation effect that was coupled with fluid vibrations and Brownian motion, which led to the absence of the one- or two-dimensional (1 D, 2 D) ballistic or superconductivity phenomena that is often associated with aligned and single SWNTs and other 1 D or 2 D media, and this was reflected in the TC values. Nevertheless, the TC of the resulting n-HTFs was improved by over 80 - 96 % when compared to other HTFs and the dispersion of the nanotubes in the oil-additive mixture was greatly enhanced. Applications of the n-HTFs include: mechanical-frictional damping, semiconductor packaging, thin-films, hydraulic oil lubricant use, thermoelectric power, thermo-sensing, fuel cells, additive-antioxidant-viscosity modifiers, and filtration...|$|R
