To avoid difficulties with the new government in what he termed its [...] "spirit of intolerant prejudice", Kingsley sent his wives, children, and a few slaves to Haiti, by that time free black republic. [...] His two daughters had already each married white planters and remained in Florida. He sold the plantation to his nephew, Kingsley Beatty Gibbs in 1839, and transferred some of the slaves to his plantation in San Jose, now a neighborhood in Jacksonville. Kingsley started a plantation in Haiti that was worked by former Fort George Island slaves, who had become indentured servants; slavery was not allowed in Haiti. [...] They were to earn their freedom in nine years. In 1842 Kingsley gave an interview to the abolitionist Lydia Child. When she asked him if he was aware that his occupation as a slave trader might be perceived as being akin to piracy, he responded [...] "Yes; and I am glad of it. They will look upon a slaveholder just so, <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>by.</b> Slave trading was a very respectable business when I was young. The first merchants in England and America were engaged in it. Some people hide things which they think other people don’t like. I never conceal anything." ...|$|E

2500|$|Processual {{archaeology}} (formerly the New Archaeology) {{is a form}} {{of archaeological}} theory that had its genesis in 1958 with the work of Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips, Method and Theory in American Archeology, in which the pair stated that [...] "American archaeology is anthropology or it is nothing" [...] (Willey and Phillips, 1958:2), a rephrasing of Frederic William Maitland's comment: [...] "My own belief is that <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>by</b> anthropology will have the choice between being history and being nothing." [...] This idea implied that the goals of archaeology were, in fact, the goals of anthropology, which were to answer questions about humans and human society. That was a critique of the former period in archaeology, the Culture-Historical phase in which archaeologists thought that any information that artifacts contained about past people and past ways of life was lost once the items became included in the archaeological record. All they felt could be done was to catalogue, describe, and create timelines based on the artifacts.|$|E

It was the transferred to the Bug river region and was part of Army Group Linsingen, under the overall command of August von Mackensen, but saw little action until the end of the Russian Great Retreat, at which point the front lines became static. In the summer of 1916, Puhallo and the 1st Army were forced to withdraw during the Brusilov Offensive, and according to the general staff, [...] "the former 1st army was in the course of events dissolved on grounds of expediency and <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>by</b> divided amongst neighboring armies, the headquarters thereby becoming superfluous and was disbanded." [...] In August, however, the 1st Army was formed once again, this time under General of the Infantry Arthur Arz von Straussenburg. Romania also entered the war on that month, and the reformed 1st Army under Straussenburg managed to hold off a Romanian assault in Transylvania on 28 August, despite its numerical inferiority. It continued to fight alongside the German 9th Army, as well as Bulgarian and Ottoman troops, over the next several months as the Central Powers entered Romania proper and occupied a large portion of it. During that time it was subordinated to Army Group Archduke Karl. When the archduke became Emperor Karl I of Austria-Hungary in November, he assigned Straussenburg to replace Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf as chief of the general staff.|$|E

2500|$|A Roman Acrobat (1881) was {{exhibited}} at the Grosvenor Gallery. [...] It was critiqued in The Gentleman's Magazine, where it was compared with William Britten's The Flight of Helen, with which it was exhibited:Allegory {{has no place in}} Mr. Weguelin's canvas; no Venus need smile approval of the feat that is there recorded. [...] A Roman Acrobat—a strapping girl making her perilous way along the tight-rope, and watched by wondering eyes as the arms balance each other and the bare feet press and squeeze round the narrow cord—is a subject that most of the few painters fitted to deal with it at all would have been tempted to make too carefully antiquarian. [...] A painful realisation of the furniture of antiquity—a small truth to a small matter—would have left little room for the greater truths of character and the higher interests of beauty and action. [...] From this permanent error—which yet would have ensured that passing popularity which waits on the adroit display of mere learning and craftsmanship—Mr. Weguelin is freed. [...] One's first thought is not of the artist, of his fund of antiquarian knowledge and his laborious battle with technical difficulty. [...] One takes, instead, a frank and simple pleasure in the picture. [...] It is of excellent draughtsmanship and expressive action—at once imaginative and real. [...] Mr. Weguelin is hardly shown by it to be a skilled colourist, but he is a vivid painter of open-air light, in which it may be that colours strike one as less subtle. [...] Mr. Weguelin's work depends less, however, upon any single highly developed gift of technical skill than upon a union of many gifts which are considerable already, and will improve <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>by.</b>|$|E

My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>by</b> and live with you.
