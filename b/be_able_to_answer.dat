Mulder shows Scully more photos of the victims and, having found more implants in them, believes the implant in Scully may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> all of their questions. The Syndicate meets over the capture of the Rebel. The Well-Manicured Man informs them {{of the existence of}} the Russian vaccine, believing that this makes resistance to the Colonists possible. If the vaccine is ineffective he proposes avoiding handing over the Rebel and instead forming an alliance with the Rebels, but the other Syndicate members believe this would be a suicidal course of action.|$|E
25|$|DHCP is used {{to provide}} the {{appropriate}} client network parameters and specifically the location (IP address) of the TFTP server hosting, ready for download, the initial bootstrap program (NBP) and complementary files. To initiate a PXE bootstrap session the DHCP component of the client's PXE firmware broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet containing PXE-specific options to port 67/UDP (DHCP server port); it asks for the required network configuration and network booting parameters. The PXE-specific options identify the initiated DHCP transaction as a PXE transaction. Standard DHCP servers (non PXE enabled) will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> with a regular DHCPOFFER carrying networking information (i.e. IP address) but not the PXE specific parameters. A PXE client {{will not be able}} to boot if it only receives an answer from a non PXE enabled DHCP server.|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, a {{test was}} {{administered}} to students at grade levels 3, 4, and 5 to assess their competency in reading comprehension and mathematics curriculum from grade levels 1, 2, and 3. This test was called the Concorcio de Evaluación e Investigación Educativa (CEIE). In reading comprehension, the students were given 21 questions. Students <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> on average, 7.37 questions on the test. The exam also found that girls performed better on the reading comprehension test than boys. In mathematics, students were given 35 questions. On average, the third grade students <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> 5.9 questions, the fourth grade students <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> 9.02 questions, and the fifth grade students <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> 11.94 questions. The researchers studying the exams claim that {{the results show that}} students were not learning the basics of reading comprehension and mathematics that they should be learning grades 1-3. The study also found that students at private schools performed better than students at public schools. Over 80% of children attend public schools.|$|R

2500|$|Barker started hosting Truth or Consequences on December 31, 1956 and {{continued}} {{with the program}} until 1974. The idea was to mix the original quiz element of game shows with wacky stunts. On the show, people had to answer a trivia question correctly (usually an off-the-wall question {{that no one would}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> correctly) before [...] "Beulah the Buzzer" [...] was sounded. If the contestant did not complete the [...] "Truth" [...] portion, there was a [...] "Consequences", usually a zany and embarrassing stunt. If the contestant answered the question, invariably, the question had a second part. In addition, during Barker's run as host, [...] "Barker's Box" [...] was played. Barker's Box was a box with four drawers in it. If a contestant was able to pick all three drawers with money inside before picking the empty drawer, they won a bonus prize.|$|E

2500|$|The German Millionaires risk format {{features}} an extra lifeline called [...] "Ask One of the Audience", {{in which the}} host will reread the question and ask the audience who think they would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> that question to stand up. The contestant may choose one of these (judging by looks only) and discuss the question at length with said audience member. He {{may or may not}} choose an answer after that. If he chooses the suggested answer and it proves to be correct, the audience member will also receive a prize of €500. This lifeline is also implemented in the Costa Rican version, after the first milestone is reached. Starting in its thirteenth season, the U.S. syndicated version uses a variant of this lifeline, called [...] "Plus One", which allows the contestant to bring a companion with them for help, rather than having them select their companion from the audience.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{reference}} to the real-world revival and massive success of King Kong in the 1950s in the 1959 movie A Summer Place. In the movie, two teenagers, Molly and Johnny, tell their parents {{that they are going to}} a classic movie showing of King Kong, when they are actually going to an abandoned lookout. Molly calls King Kong [...] "one of those wonderful old horror numbers." [...] Johnny frets that if he doesn't watch the movie, he might not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> his parent's questions, but Molly tells him, [...] "It's kind of sad dreams If anybody asks, just tell 'em about the end. That's the part everybody remembers.". In 1974's Herbie Rides Again Alonzo Hawk has been having nightmares about Herbie. During his nightmare sequence there is a King Kong-themed dream. Alonzo dreams he's Kong with Herbie-like planes flying around him and squirting oil until he falls off the Empire State Building. In a Superman story, an ape grew to giant size and gained kryptonite vision due to meteors of kryptonite and uranium, and was called Titano the Super-Ape. This ape had a liking to Lois Lane, and in one story climbed up the Daily Planet building.|$|E
2500|$|Sven Anders Hedin, {{a medical}} doctor at the royal court, and married {{to one of the}} Queen's chambermaids, Charlotta Hellman, contributed two {{statements}} which have been quoted in connection with the scandal. In the summer of 1780, during the King's absence abroad, he passed through the private apartments of the Queen, which were expected to be empty at that hour. There, he claimed to have seen the Queen and Baron Munck embracing each other through the not-quite closed door to her bedroom. [...] To warn them that they were not alone, he hummed a tune and pretended to speak to himself, saying that he would be in trouble if the Queen discovered him there, and then left the room. He claimed to have found three expensive court costumes in his room a few days after this event. In October 1781, Hedin met the King in the corridor {{on his way to the}} Queen's bed chamber. Gustav III asked Hedin what time it was, and Hedin claims to have added to his reply: [...] "In nine months, I will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> exactly!" [...] in which Hedin insinuated that the King had expected him to remember the time should the fatherhood of the next child be questioned.|$|E

2500|$|More {{and more}} Thérèse {{realised}} {{that she felt}} no attraction to the exalted heights of [...] "great souls". She looked directly for the word of Jesus, which shed light on her prayers and on her daily life. Thérèse's retreat in October 1892 pointed out to her a [...] "downward" [...] path.

[...] (Matthew 8:20). She wrote to Céline (letter 19 October 1892), [...] "Jesus raised us above all the fragile things of this world whose image passes away. Like Zacchaeus, we climbed a tree to see Jesus and now let us listen to what he is saying to us. Make haste to descend, I must lodge today at your house. Well, Jesus tells us to descend?" [...] "A question here of the interior," [...] she qualified in her letter, lest Céline think she meant renouncing food or shelter. [...] "Thérèse knew her virtues, even her love, to be flawed, flawed by self, a mirror too clouded to reflect the divine." [...] She continued to seek to discover the means, [...] "to more efficiently strip herself of self." [...] "No doubt, [...] are already empty of creatures, but, alas, I feel mine is not entirely empty of myself, and {{it is for this reason}} that Jesus tells me to descend." ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} how much the effectiveness of a Question Answering (QA) system was affected by the performance of Machine Translation (MT) based question translation. Nearly 200 questions were selected from TREC QA tracks and ran through a question <b>answering</b> system. It <b>was</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> 42. 6 % of the questions correctly in a monolingual run. These questions were then translated manually from English into Arabic and back into English using an MT system, and then re-applied to the QA system.
