40|$|Scientific and {{practical}} {{interest is the}} application of alloying alloy-modifiers for secondary treatment of high-strength cast iron to stabilize the process of spheroidization graphite and achieving higher physical-mechanical properties of castings. The peculiarity of the high-strength cast irons manufacturing technology is their tendency to supercooling during solidification in the mold. This leads {{to the formation of}} shrinkage defects and structurally free cementite, especially in thin-walled sections of the finished castings. To minimize these effects in foundry practice during production of ductile iron the secondary inoculation is widely used. In this regard, the question of the choice of the additives with effective impact not only on the graphitization process but also on the formation of the metallic base of ductile iron is relevant. The aim of the present work is to study the peculiarities of structure formation in cast iron with nodular graphite when alloying alloy-modifier based on tin with additions of nanoparticles of titanium carbide, yttrium oxide and graphite nano-pipes is used for secondary treatment. Melting of iron in laboratory conditions was performed in crucible induction furnace IST- 006 with an acid lining held. Spheroidizing treatment of melt was realized with magnesium containing alloying alloy FeSiMg 7 by means of ladle method. Secondary treatment of high strength cast iron was carried out by addition of alloying alloy-modifier in an amount of 0. 1 % to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle.</b> Cast samples for chemical composition analysis, study of microstructure, technological and mechanical properties of the resultant alloy were made.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{concerns}} {{the formation of}} pinholes in castings by reaction between cast iron with compacted graphite and green sand mould. Methodology: Experiments were done on bar castings moulded in green bentonite mixtures without carbonaceous matters. Moulding sand moisture and aluminium content in the melt were purposely changed. Metal was melted in a 100 kg furnace by remelting the uniform charge of return material. Metal was inoculated all at once in a ladle and modified in a reaction chamber in a mould or as sandwich method in a <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle.</b> Findings: The formation of pinholes was not caused by high moisture of the mould but this defect was sensible to aluminium content in metal. In castings with high aluminium content > 0. 2 % the pinholes occurred in high numbers, and namely under low and also high moistures (> 4 %). In previous melts with aluminium contents < 0. 02 % defects occurred in small range. Practical implications: Thus the conclusions known from literature {{about the influence of}} Al on pinholes occurrence in cast irons were confirmed. Oxygen activity in metal during its flowing and cooling in the mould was also measured but this quantity was not changed too in dependence on pinholes content.

40|$|The {{production}} of quality castings requires the casting surface {{to be clean}} and free from defects. In some grey cast iron components which are cast in sand moulds, the metal sometimes penetrates into the mould, producing difficulties in cleaning the components. The defect causes very high costs due to component rejection and increased fettling in the casting industry. Most of the grey iron foundries {{around the world have}} problems with metal penetration on applicable components. In this work the problem of metal penetration has been studied using a commercial casting component. Eight castings were mounted on the pattern plate and five different inoculants were investigated. The experiments show that the inoculation of grey cast iron will influence the metal penetration in areas with late solidification times and where the melt is in contact with the sand mould. In all experiments 0. 14 % inoculant was added in the <b>pouring</b> <b>ladle.</b> The experiments show that the best results to reduce metal penetration have been obtained when using the inoculant which contained silicon, aluminium and zirconium. Using this inoculant, the average penetration area was only about 20 % of what was found using the worst inoculant. However, this inoculant also gave rise to a large tendency to formation sinks. The experiments also show two main classes of eutectic cell size. One class nucleated {{at the beginning of the}} eutectic solidification and one at the end of the solidification. Two other inoculants, both containing Al and Si have about the same base composition. From the measurements of penetration areas, one can draw the conclusion that the inoculant with the smallest grain size gives nuclei with the shortest lifetime. The coarser grains give a longer dissolution time and this promotes the survival of the nuclei. At the end of solidification, a larger amount of graphite will precipitate at higher temperatures if new nuclei can be activated. If the hot spot is located close to the metal surface, the metal will expand into the mould; resulting in metal expansion penetration. The worst cases of metal penetration have been obtained using an inoculant containing titanium. A large number of small eutectic cells and high volume of the small cells were observed, which leads to severe penetration...|$|R

Refining steel under a heating layer contributes to the improvement of steel purity – which is measured by analysing the share of surface nonmetallic inclusions. Refining steel under refining slag with a basic character and physical properties adapted to the temperature close to the liquidus temperature of steel contributes to a decrease in the amount of non-metallic inclusions, a decrease in their size.

Vickers hardness test and its value which is equal to 122. 13 HRC indicate elevated hardness value upto 50 % when compare to the hardness value of parent alloy. Tensile specimens were prepared using wire EDM as per ASTM E 8 standards. There is no considerable improvement in tensile strength due to addition of above reinforcements. Failure analysis was carried and the factors caused failure was analyzed. In order to study and understand the wear resistance property of Composite which it is mainly known for, wear test was carried out and test results proves the increase in wear resistance property of Composite in terms of frictional force and coefficient of friction. Introduction. Requirement of engineering materials paves the way for invention of advanced materials like super alloys, ceramics, and composites. In these advanced materials Composites have distinguished properties such as increased wear resistance, high specific strength, strength-to-weight ratio, strength to cost ratio etc. This unique property finds application in aerospace, defense, marine, etc. This motivates researchers to fabricate composite with constitution of various reinforcements with aluminum matrix. The addition any one of the reinforcements like SiC, B 4 C, Al 2 O 3, ZrSiO 4, TiN, and TiB 2 have been carried out and in process as well. Efforts have been initiated to fabricate metal matrix using in situ salt reactions [1]. The stir casting process parameters were thoroughly examined by Pai. It has been concluded that, stir casting process is relatively simple and less expensive as compared to other processing methods [2, 3]. Production of composites using stir casting process needs equal distribution of abrasive particles with the metal matrix. S.

The Vickers hardness test shows elevated hardness value due to the addition of reinforcement ZrSiO 4 and its value is 101. 1 HRC. The tensile specimens were prepared using wire-EDM process as per ASTM-E 8 standard. The tensile value reveals that there was an improvement in tensile strength of composite and its value is 0. 094 Gpa. Also, fractography study was done using scanning electron microscope to understand the causes of failure of specimen. Wear test was carried out on the composite using a linear reciprocating tribometer. The wear test result confirms high wear resistance due to the addition of ZrSiO 4 reinforcement in aluminium matrix. Introduction. Composites material has high stiffness and high strength, low density, improved wear resistance, etc. When designed precisely, the newly combined materials produce enhanced strength than would each individual material. The addition of ceramic particles like SiC, Al 2 O 3, B 4 C, Al 2 O 3 to an aluminum based matrix does not much alter the density of material but instead it usually leads to a considerable rise in strength and modulus of composite. Alaneme, studied the mechanical behaviour of alumina reinforced with 6063 metal matrix composite developed by two step – stir casting process. AA 6063 – Al 2 O 3 particulate composites having 6, 9, 15, and 18 volume percent of reinforcement were produced [...] [1] Sreenivasan fabricated TiB 2 /Al metal matrix composites by stir casting route with 5, 10 and 15 % of TiB 2 and studied the wear behaviour of composite. It was observed that the wear rate was higher for the unreinforced aluminium alloy when compared to the reinforced composites. Wear rate was decreased with increasing TiB 2 content in the MMC composites[2]. The composite fabricated using stircasting technique exhibit uniform distribution. Result of uniform distribution of reinforcement in the metal matrix confirm elevated mechanical behavior[3]. Also addition of reinforcements like Al 2 O 3, SiC, TiB 2 in the metal matrix improves hardness and thermal property [4]. It has been observed that, elongation decreses when the percentage reinforcement increases, but tensile and hardness value will be high[5, 6]. The homogeneity of reinforcement and uniform distribution of reinforcement particles in metal matrix depend upon stir casing parameters [7].
