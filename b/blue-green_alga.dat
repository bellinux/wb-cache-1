50|$|Years later, in 1994, {{local people}} of Hawaii, Maui and Oahu island in Hawaii were {{poisoned}} by food. The local residents of these islands often eat {{various types of}} algae including the red alga Gracilaria coronopifolia. After taking samples of this red alga {{it turned out that}} they contained two toxins which were identical with aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin. Moreover, they observed parasitism of a <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> on the surface of G. coronopifolia. In {{view of the fact that}} some <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> like L. majuscula produce aplysiatoxin and debromoaplysiatoxin, it’s probable that they are the true origin of this food poisoning case.|$|E

40|$|For the {{isolation}} of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> from soil and fresh water, temperature is a selective factor of major importance. In a nutritionally non-selective mineral medium, which at 25 " supported growth of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> and of many eucaryotic algae, the development of eucaryotic algae was almost completely suppressed by incubation at 35 ". Both the number and variety of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> recoverable at 35 " were greater than those recoverable from parallel cultures incubated at 25 ". When a combined-nitrogen source was omitted from the enrichment medium, only <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> developed at both 25 " and 35 "; the microflora consisted exclusively of heterocyst-forming filamentous types, other groups of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> being eliminated...|$|R

50|$|Debromoaplysiatoxin is a {{toxic agent}} {{produced}} by the <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> Lyngbya majuscula. This alga lives in marine waters and causes seaweed dermatitis. Furthermore, it is a tumor promoter which has an anti-proliferative activity against various cancer cell lines in mice.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 {{there was}} a new {{outbreak}} of seaweed dermatitis on Oahu island Hawaii. Samples of L. majuscula revealed that this <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> contained a mixture of aplysiatoxin, debromoaplysiatoxin and lyngbyatoxin A. These three substances appeared to be the causative toxins of seaweed dermatitis.|$|E
50|$|Natural phenols can be {{involved}} in allelopathic interactions, for example in soil or in water.

The aquatic vascular plant Myriophyllum spicatum produces ellagic, gallic and pyrogallic acids and (+)-catechin, allelopathic phenolic compounds inhibiting the growth of <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> Microcystis aeruginosa.|$|E
40|$|Virgin alkali (sodic) soils {{have a high}} pH {{and high}} {{exchangeable}} Na and are often barren. <b>Blue-green</b> <b>algae,</b> however, tolerate excess Na and grow extensively on the soil surface in wet seasons. Experiments using a highly degraded alkali soil (silt loam, pH 10. 3, electrical conductivity 3. 5 dS m- 1, 90 % exchangeable Na) were conducted in soil columns, with or without gypsum, in order to study the influence of waterlogging on the growth of indigenous and inoculated <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> and hence, soil reclamation. The growth of indigenous <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> was initially slow in alkali soil, due to the high pH and exchangeable Na, and depressed in gypsum-amended soil, due to excess Ca. Inoculation hastened the establishment of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> in both the unamended alkali soil and the gypsum-amended soil, overcoming the adverse influence of excess Na in the former and excess Ca in the latter. Gypsum was effective in amelioration (pH 9. 05, electrical conductivity 1. 2 dS m- 1, 41 % exchangeable Na after 11 weeks) but <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> were ineffective even after 17 weeks. In combination with gypsum, <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> had no additional effect, and the C and N increases due {{to the growth of}} indigenous or inoculated <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> were insignificant. Alkali soil reclamation by biological methods requires mobilization of Ca from native soil calcite and the exchange of Ca for Na in the exchange complex. The ineffectiveness of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> was ascribed to their inability to mobilize Ca. It is argued that current theories favouring <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> as a biological amendment to bring about alkali soil reclamation are untenable and are not comparable with an effective chemical amendment such as gypsum. © 1991 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Pyridine nucleotide-dependent glucose {{dehydrogenase}} activity (GPND) {{is described}} {{for the first}} time in cell-free extracts of certain <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae.</b> When glucose is added to these crude cell extracts, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate is reduced at twice the rate as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; but evidence suggests that this activity is due to a single enzyme. The distribution and level of GPND in selected <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> correlates with the heterotrophic potential of each species. In all <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> where GPND was detected, O 2 uptake coupled to the GPND reaction was also observed. Both GPND and O 2 uptake apparently occur in the soluble fraction of the cell. An essential role for GPND in the heterotrophic metabolism of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> is postulated...|$|R
50|$|Gallic acid {{is found}} {{in a number of}} land plants, such as the {{parasitic}} plant Cynomorium coccineum, the aquatic plant Myriophyllum spicatum, and the <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> Microcystis aeruginosa. Gallic acid is also found in various oak species, Caesalpinia mimosoides, and in the stem bark of Boswellia dalzielii, among others. Many foodstuffs contain various amounts of gallic acid, especially fruits (including strawberries, grapes, bananas), as well as teas, cloves, and vinegars.|$|E

50|$|Because {{they feed}} on plankton, they are {{sometimes}} successfully used for controlling water quality, especially in the control of noxious <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> (cyanobacteria). Certain species of <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae,</b> notably the often toxic Microcystis, can pass through the gut of silver carp unharmed, picking up nutrients in the process. Thus, in some cases, <b>blue-green</b> <b>algae</b> blooms have been exacerbated by silver carp. Microcystis {{has also been shown}} to produce more toxins in the presence of silver carp. These carp, which have natural defenses to their toxins, sometimes can contain enough algal toxins in their systems to become hazardous to eat.|$|R

5000|$|In 1977 Huber {{was awarded}} the Otto Warburg Medal. In 1988 he {{was awarded the}} Nobel Prize and in 1992 the Sir Hans Krebs Medal. Huber was elected a member of Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts, in 1993 [...] and Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1999. His {{certificate}} of election reads: [...] Huber has built up, led and still leads the most productive protein crystallography laboratory in Europe. His own contributions to crystallography, made over a period of some 25 years, are prodigious. For his PhD thesis he solved the chemical formula of the important insect hormone edtyson which had eluded the chemists. He then demonstrated that the tertiary fold of the polypeptide chain in the haemoglobin of the fly larva chironomus closely resembled that in Kendrew's sperm whale myoglobin, indicating {{for the first time that}} this fold had been preserved throughout evolution.Huber's next achievement was the solution of the structure of trypsin inhibitor and the demonstration that in its complex with trypsin it mimicked the tetrahedral transition state of the enzyme's substrate. Since then he has determined the structures of many other proteinases, their inactive precursors and their inhibitors, and has established himself as the world authority in this field. Outstanding structures are those of procarboxypeptidase, which led to the discovery of the remarkable activation mechanism of this enzyme, and of the complex of thrombin with hirudin, which showed the molecular mechanism of inhibition of blood clotting by this leech toxin.In parallel with this work, Huber solved the structures of several immunoglobulin fragments. He was the first to determine the structure of the complement-activating F-fragment, which was also the first variable and the first constant domains in Fab-fragments.Huber's structure of citrate synthase revealed a striking example of a conformational change undergone by an enzyme on combination with its substrate by a process of induced fit.Huber shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1988 with Michel and Deisenhofer for their determination of the remarkable and supremely important structures of the photochemical reaction centre of Rhodopseudomonas viridis and of phycocyanin, the light harvesting protein of the <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga</b> Mastiglocadus laminosus. This protein binds linear tetrapyrroles in a tertiary fold reminiscent of the globins, which brought Huber back full circle to his first structure, erythrocruerin,Huber has also determined the structures of several copper-containing electron-transfer proteins, including that of ascorbate oxidase, and of other metallo-enzymes. These studies have thrown new light on electron-transfer systems and on zinc coordination in proteins. He has also solved the structure of an important class of calcium binding proteins - the annexins. Finally his very accurate structures have provided important insights into the different degrees of mobility within protein molecules.Huber has published some 400 papers.|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} computer-based {{mathematical model}} of photophobic {{responses in the}} <b>blue-green</b> <b>alga,</b> Phormidium uncinatum, {{has been used to}} simulate the behavior of the alga under various light and dark conditions.
