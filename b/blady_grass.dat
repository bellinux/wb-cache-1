Various species of acacias, including Brisbane Golden Wattle (Acacia fimbriata) and Broadleaf Wattle (Acacia implexa) are predominant in the understorey shrubs along with grass trees Xanthorrhoea species.

50|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the old road extends approximately 20 metres from the northern bank of Byfield Creek along what {{is now part of}} Richters Road reserve. There is no sand deposit, with the embankment composed of a clay-based soil. There is thick ground-cover vegetation to either side of the path leading up the embankment and onto Richters Road, which is predominately <b>blady</b> <b>grass.</b> This ground-cover hides the entrance to the old road from Richters Road. Native trees, ferns and palms grow along either side of the pathway on the embankment down to the creek.|$|E
5000|$|Thatching {{was less}} common, but cumbungi (rushes), and <b>blady</b> <b>grass</b> [...] were used if available. Later, when crops were grown, straw was used. For a more {{permanent}} dwelling shingles would be cut. The cabbage tree palm was found most suitable, {{and later the}} she-oak. In later years, galvanised iron became a popular roofing material, due to its cheapness and durability. Sometimes this was laid over the original shingles. Mrs Gunn noted that 'Great sheets of bark... were packed a foot deep above the rafters to break the heat reflected from the iron roof, while beneath it the calico ceiling was tacked up.' ...|$|E
50|$|The Islander {{community}} first {{rented land}} from Bill Cuff, the Sandhills storekeeper, for a nominal 2/6 per year, {{and on this}} they built thatched huts of <b>blady</b> <b>grass</b> in the traditional manner, with Tea Tree Bark and traditionally made rope from the wild hibiscus bark. The Islanders soon became self-sufficient by growing crops and market gardens to provide food and an income for their familles. Their families grew up there and soon began buying their own blocks of land south of Mr Cuff's who first invited the South Sea Islanders to the Sandhills. He originally worked at the Yeppoon Sugar Plantation Sugar Mill at Farnborough. When the mill ceased to operate in 1904 he invited some of the Islanders {{who worked on the}} plantation to work for him on his newly purchased acreage. Another land owner, Alexander Charles Huth sold them some of his land. They worked for him in his gardens and with their earnings paid for their land.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the effect of {{residues}} of tuber extract <b>blady</b> <b>grass</b> and coco grass on soybean seed germination, plant height, dry weight of weeds, flowering period, the number of productive branches, number of seeds and seed weight of plants. The study was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Faculty of Agriculture Syiah Kuala University. This study uses a factorial completely randomized design with three replications. The first factor {{is the type of}} weed extracts with 2 levels ie Coco Grass Extract (ET) and <b>Blady</b> <b>Grass</b> extract (EA), to the second factor is the concentration (K) which consists of 5 levels, namely, (K 0 = 0 %), (K 1 = 1. 5 %), (K 2 = 3. 0 %), (K 3 = 4. 5 %), (K 4 = 6. 0 %). Parameters measured were seed germination, plant height, dry weight of weeds, flowering period, the number of productive branches, number of seeds and seed weight of plants. The results showed that the application of coco grass and <b>blady</b> <b>grass</b> at various concentrations inhibited germination percentage of soybean, but does not inhibit soybean flowering period, the number of productive branches, number of seeds and seed weight it stimulates the growth of soybean plants. While plant height and dry weight of weeds does not affect the application of tuber extract <b>blady</b> <b>grass</b> and coco grass. Use of extract coco grass and <b>blady</b> <b>grass</b> at a concentration 1. 5 % - 6. 0 % can increase the number of productive branches, whereas the concentration of 4. 5 % can increase the number of seeds and seed weight of plants can be increased at a concentration of 3. 0 % and 4. 5 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of hypertension in Indonesia was 25, 8 %. As much as 70 % types of hypertensive patients were mild hypertension. There were some medicinal plants contain single formulation {{could be used}} for lowering blood pressure but not in a herbal formulation. This study determined the efficacy of antihypertension herbal formulation that consists of Indonesian bay leaves, Centella herbs, <b>blady</b> <b>grass</b> roots dan nutmeg seeds. This study was an experimental laboratory research with pre and post-test controlled design, used thirty Sprague-Dawley rats that were classified randomly into five groups (negative control group which didn't have treatment, positive control group which consumed captopril 0, 25 mg, and three groups which consumed antihypertension herbal formulation with doses of 0, 08 g; 0, 16 g; and 0, 32 g. The rats were induced by prednisone and NaCl 2, 5 % for 21 days.   The data were analysed using ANOVA test with CI 95 %. After two weeks observation, the results showed that the blood pressure in the negative control group increased,  but in the positive control and treatment groups decreased significantly (p= 0, 001). In conclusion, the herbal formulation could decrease rat's blood pressure.    </p...|$|E
