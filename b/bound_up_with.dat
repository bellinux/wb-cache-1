5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Church, which formed {{the key to}} the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were {{hierarchical}} societies, each {{based on}} ties of allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers. At {{the top of}} the social structure was the king, who stood above many of the normal processes of Anglo-Saxon life and whose household had special privileges and protection. Beneath the king were thegns, nobles, the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen. The relationship between kings and their nobles was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour. Freemen, called churls, formed the next level of society, often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns. Geburs, peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn, formed a lower class still. The very lowest class were slaves, who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights.|$|E

60|$|The last {{appointed}} footstep sounded now {{upon the}} stairs. They all knew it. It was Mr Pecksniff's; and Mr Pecksniff {{was in a}} hurry too, for he came <b>bounding</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> such uncommon expedition that he stumbled twice or thrice.|$|R
5000|$|Tracts on St. Luke's Gospel, 1812. This {{is merely}} Nos. 6, 7, 10, and 11 <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> {{together}} <b>with</b> a general preface.|$|R
40|$|There were {{branches}} {{of business in}} the Ottoman Empire. According to thenature of work artisans would {{be connected to the}} branches. Each branch organizedin itself. Occupations were based on the master-apprentice relationship. Some performances <b>bounded</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the branches such as Meddah, Orta Oyunu, Karagöz. As well as some arts which guided by Islamic aesthetics, performances remained within the religious rules. Until the nineteenth century the European-style drama theater could not be developed. This study was created to analyze this structure...|$|R
25|$|When Hugh Eglintoun of that Ilk, her father, died {{soon after}} 1378 the Montgomerie family {{inherited}} the lands and hereafter Hessilhead's history is <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> that family.|$|E
25|$|On 16 April 1821 {{she married}} William Howitt {{and began a}} career of joint authorship with him. Her life was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> that of her husband; she was {{separated}} only from him {{during the period of}} his Australian journey (1851–54).|$|E
25|$|The {{category}} of mood {{is used to}} express modality, which includes such properties as uncertainty, evidentiality, and obligation. Commonly encountered moods include the indicative, subjunctive, and conditional. Mood can be <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> tense, aspect, or both, in particular verb forms. Hence certain languages are sometimes analysed as having a single tense–aspect–mood (TAM) system, without separate manifestation of the three categories.|$|E
60|$|Lighting a match, Ben {{examined}} the man's wound and <b>bound</b> it <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the major's handkerchief, his own having {{been left behind}} with the Spanish woman. The stranger said that his name was Barton Brownell.|$|R
30|$|The {{fractional}} calculus was <b>bounded</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> fractional integrals {{obtained by}} iterating an integral {{to get the}} nth order integral and then replacing n by any number, and then by using the classical method the corresponding derivatives were defined (see, for example, [1, 9 – 14]). However, {{for the sake of}} better description of real world phenomena, some scientists discovered new fractional operators with nonlocal and nonsingular kernels using the limiting process {{with the help of the}} Dirac delta function. For such operators, we refer to [15 – 17]. Other types of new fractional derivatives can be found in [18 – 21].|$|R
6000|$|And the birch rustled its leaves, and said: 'I {{have served}} you longer than I can say, {{and you never}} tied a bit of twine even round my branches; and the dear {{children}} <b>bound</b> them <b>up</b> <b>with</b> their brightest ribbons.' ...|$|R
25|$|As {{has already}} been mentioned, {{indications}} of tense are often <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> indications of other verbal categories, such as aspect and mood. The conjugation patterns of verbs often also reflect agreement with categories pertaining to the subject, such as person, number and gender. It is consequently not always possible to identify elements that mark any specific category, such as tense, separately from the others.|$|E
25|$|In coevolution, {{where the}} {{existence}} of one species is tightly <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the life of another species, new or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding features in the other species. These relationships are intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a trajectory for millions of years, as {{has occurred in the}} relationship between flowering plants and pollinating insects.|$|E
25|$|The {{claim of}} James VI to the English throne was also <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the Tudor dynasty, coming (despite {{provisions}} in the will of Henry VIII) through his great-grandmothers Margaret Tudor and Mary Tudor. He had two new official signet rings made, combining the arms of England and Scotland. A Latin slogan used on his coins, Henricus rosas regna Jacobus, pointed up a comparison with Henry VII: it implied that Henry's role in uniting the Roses (see Tudor rose) had been followed by James's in uniting the kingdoms.|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} book with shaking hands. A betting-book was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> in it, <b>with</b> the {{customary}} calendar. He turned to {{the date of the}} day after the robbery.|$|R
60|$|When {{the colored}} man {{returned}} with the articles mentioned both boys washed the wounded man's head and <b>bound</b> it <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a towel. Then Tom administered a few spoonfuls of liquor. This seemed to give Peterson some strength, {{but he did not}} fully recover for some hours.|$|R
40|$|ACLNInternational audienceThe {{protection}} of biodiversity which {{had long been}} <b>bounded</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> emblematic "natural" spaces is now increasingly focusing on ordinary biodiversity and rural agricultural land and forests {{as well as on}} urban and peri-urban spaces. Such ordinary biodiversity has its own specific features which make it both a relative and uncertain topic of research. Traditional nature protection instruments do not work on this dimension of the planet's living tissue and new tools need to be deployed in conjunction with regional and local stakeholders that will provide long-term sustainable solutions for biodiversity and for local and regional development more generally. Research conducted on the Plateau de Millevaches explores the possibilities for shared caring for this biodiversity...|$|R
25|$|Day 1 {{begins with}} the {{creation}} of light (and, by implication, time). God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them. In the ancient Near East the act of naming was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the act of creating: thus in Egyptian literature the creator god pronounced the names of everything, and the Enûma Elish begins at the point where nothing has yet been named. God's creation by speech also suggests that he is being compared to a king, who has merely to speak for things to happen.|$|E
25|$|The mind series {{reflect the}} teachings of early Dzogchen, which {{rejected}} all forms of practice, and asserted that striving for liberation would simply create more delusion. One has simply to recognize the nature of one's own mind, which is naturally empty (stong pa), luminous (od gsal ba), and pure. According to Germano, its characteristic language, which is marked by naturalism and negation, is already pronounced in some Indian tantras. Nevertheless, these texts are still inextricably <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> tantric Mahayoga, with its visualisations of deities and mandals, and complex initiations.|$|E
25|$|At first, the {{released}} oxygen was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> limestone, iron, {{and other}} minerals. The oxidized iron appears as red layers in geological strata called banded iron formations that formed in abundance during the Siderian period (between 2500Ma and 2300Ma). When {{most of the}} exposed readily reacting minerals were oxidized, oxygen finally began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Though each cell only produced a minute amount of oxygen, the combined metabolism of many cells over a vast time transformed Earth's atmosphere to its current state. This was Earth's third atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|At first Schwanthaler {{adhered to}} the {{specifications}} of Klenze’s plan. But he soon began to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> his own variations of the Bavaria statue. He made the fundamental decision not to follow Classical models but rather to clothe her in a “Germanic” style: her floor length shirt dress was draped in a simpler way, and <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> together <b>with</b> a bearskin it gave the figure a typical “German” character according to Schwanthaler.|$|R
50|$|A Letter to the Author of the Confessional anon., 1768; {{this was}} {{followed}} {{in the same year}} by second and third letters, and all three, in which Archbishop Secker assisted, were <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> together <b>with</b> a general title. Francis Blackburne, the anonymous author of 'The Confessional,' subsequently replied to them, and so did 'A Country Clergyman' (said to be the Rev. T. Gwatkin).|$|R
25|$|The Duncan {{class was}} {{a class of}} pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy. From 1889, Britain's “rank as a {{first-class}} power was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> its Mediterranean position” and these lightly armoured fast ships were intended to help meet combined Russian and French threats. Their period of maximum operational significance was short. By 1904, Britain had formed the Entente Cordiale with France whilst Russia was decisively defeated at the Battle of Tsushima the following year. The Battle of Tsushima influenced the design of , launched 1906, which eclipsed the Duncans and all previous ships.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the conclusion of peace Louis renewed his aggressions on the German frontier through the Réunions policy. Engaged in a serious struggle with the Ottoman Empire, the emperor was again slow to move, and although he joined the Association League against France in 1682 {{he was glad to}} make a truce at Regensburg two years later. In 1686 the League of Augsburg was formed by the emperor and the imperial princes, to preserve the terms of the treaties of Westphalia and of Nijmegen. The whole European position was now <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> events in England, and the tension lasted until 1688, when William III of Orange won the English crown through the Glorious Revolution and Louis invaded Germany. In May 1689, the Grand Alliance was formed, including the emperor, the kings of England, Spain and Denmark, the elector of Brandenburg and others, and a fierce struggle against France was waged throughout almost the whole of western Europe. In general the several campaigns were favourable to the allies, and in September 1697, England, Spain and the United Provinces made peace with France at the Treaty of Rijswijk.|$|E
25|$|Next in {{importance}} is the speech Against Agoratus (388 BC), {{one of our}} chief authorities for the internal history of Athens during the months which immediately followed; the defeat at Aegospotami. The Olympiacus (388 BC) is a brilliant fragment, expressing {{the spirit of the}} festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks to unite against their common foes. The Plea for the Constitution (403 BC) is interesting for {{the manner in which it}} argues that the well-being of Athens—now stripped of empire—is <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the maintenance of democratic principles. The speech For Mantitheus (392 BC) is a graceful and animated portrait, of a young Athenian hippeus, making a spirited defence of his honor against the charge of disloyalty. The defence For the Invalid is a humorous character-sketch. The speech Against Pancleon illustrates the intimate relations between Athens and Plataea, while it gives us some picturesque glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of the person who had, been charged with destroying a mona, or sacred olive, places us amidst the country life of Attica. And the speech Against Theomnestus deserves attention for its curious evidence of the way in which the ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 BC.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} is science discipline, which directly influence all industrial sectors. It is {{integral part of}} industrial evolution and is forced to constant advancing in knowledge level. Efficiency increase {{can be achieved by}} developing and applying new technologies and materials that ensure the required outputs. Side effect of efficiency increase is also production growth, that follows market needs, which are <b>bounded</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> final price of products. Such products are dental implants, which have to meet mechanical requirements and very important property - compatibility with organic materials. This group of biomaterials includes commercially pure titanium TiGr 2, TiGr 5, nano-structured commercially pure titanium n-Ti and coldformed titanium alloys TiNbTa. This article contains experiment results of milling these materials using different cutting parameters...|$|R
6000|$|As well as {{it could}} be done, Frank and Dick <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> Tom's head <b>with</b> a handkerchief, and {{presently}} the fun-loving lad declared himself about as well as ever, [...] "Only a bit light-headed," [...] as he added.|$|R
60|$|Like {{a yellow}} rubber ball she <b>bounded</b> <b>up,</b> and fled <b>with</b> the yelping hounds at her heels. The chase was short. At {{the end of}} a hundred yards Moze caught <b>up</b> <b>with</b> her and nipped her. She whirled with savage suddenness, and lunged at Moze, but he cunningly eluded the vicious paws. Then she sought safety in another pine.|$|R
500|$|... "If {{morality}} is <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> contributing to others, {{the crucial question}} is: What is to be contributed? One contribution might be making them more moral, and that is fine. But finally, true morality cannot aim simply at the spread of morality. It must aim at the wellbeing of those it tries to help in some broader sense. For process thought that must be the perfection of their experience inclusively." ...|$|E
500|$|There survive {{parts of}} a gospel book, by {{coincidence}} now <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the famous Utrecht Psalter, which are identifiable as by the same scribe as the Cuthbert Gospel, and where [...] "the capitular uncial of the two manuscripts is indistinguishable in style or quality, so they may well be very {{close to each other}} in date". [...] Since the Utrecht pages also use Rustic capital script, which the Cuthbert Gospel does not, it allows another basis for comparison with further manuscripts in the sequence.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the play's themes of duplicity and ambivalence are {{inextricably}} <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> Wilde's homosexuality, and that the play exhibits a [...] "flickering presence-absence of… homosexual desire". On re-reading the play after his release from prison, Wilde said: [...] "It was extraordinary reading the play over. How I used to toy with that Tiger Life." [...] As one scholar has put it, the absolute necessity for homosexuals of the period to [...] "need a public mask is a factor contributing to the satire on social disguise." ...|$|E
60|$|With some {{warm water}} made from melted snow, the lads washed {{the wounds of}} the man, and then <b>bound</b> them <b>up</b> <b>with</b> strips torn from their shirts. They used other water for making coffee, and poured some of this down the man's throat. They also rubbed his hands and wrists, doing what they {{could think of to}} revive him.|$|R
40|$|The {{main idea}} of this work is define a problem of human ecology, the aim of which to understand outward forms and inward {{mechanisms}} of adaptation of social and biological sphere at the different stage of human development. The modern human lost the contacts the nature in a considerable extent. The extent of ecologically personality’s development <b>bounds</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> high morals and recreation activities. It forms different needs such as world outlook’s integrity, syncretic of consciousness, freedom of thought and creation, aspiration for realization, for harmony and others in this conditions ecological crisis. Vital activity must be bases upon responsibility’s principle for the future conditions of our planet. The particular importance assumes the process of forming by ecological world outlook at this time, so as the main role at the process of human’s adaptation is consciousness. </p...|$|R
