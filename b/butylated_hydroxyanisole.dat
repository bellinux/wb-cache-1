5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E

50|$|Some {{additive}} products contain BHT {{as their}} primary ingredient, while others contain the chemical merely {{as a component of}} their formulation, sometimes alongside <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA).|$|E
50|$|OFG may {{represent}} a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, but the causative antigen(s) is not identified or varies form one individual to the next. Suspected sources of antigens include metals, e.g. cobalt, or additives and preservatives in foods, including benzoates, benzoic acid, cinnamaldehyde, metabisulfates, <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole,</b> dodecyl gallate, tartrazine, or menthol, Examples of foods which may contain these substances include margarine, cinnamon, eggs, chocolate or peppermint oil.|$|E
50|$|Preservative food {{additives}} can be antimicrobial—which inhibit {{the growth of}} bacteria or fungi, including mold—or antioxidant, such as oxygen absorbers, which inhibit the oxidation of food constituents. Common antimicrobial preservatives include calcium propionate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, sulfites (sulfur dioxide, sodium bisulfite, potassium hydrogen sulfite, etc.), and EDTA. Antioxidants include <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Other preservatives include formaldehyde (usually in solution), glutaraldehyde (insecticide), ethanol, and methylchloroisothiazolinone.|$|E
5000|$|Corticosteroids applied topically {{are used}} for the relief of the {{inflammatory}} and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses, particularly dermatitis, eczema, and psoriasis. [...] Cyclocort's active ingredient is Amcinonide, with inactive ingredients including petrolatum, benzyl alcohol, sorbitol, <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole,</b> propyl gallate, citric acid, glycerin, and/ or propylene glycol. The specific inactive ingredients used depend on the dosage form (ointment, area, or lotion) and help the product retain its chemical and physical integrity while increasing the shelf-life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) is an {{antioxidant}} {{consisting of}} a mixture of two isomeric organic compounds, 2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole. It is prepared from 4-methoxyphenol and isobutylene. It is a waxy solid used as a food additive with the E number E320. The primary use for BHA is as an antioxidant and preservative in food, food packaging, animal feed, cosmetics, rubber, and petroleum products. BHA also is commonly used in medicines, such as isotretinoin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, among others.|$|E
50|$|Isobutylene {{is used as}} an {{intermediate}} {{in the production of}} a variety of products. It is reacted with methanol and ethanol in the manufacture of the gasoline oxygenates methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), respectively. Alkylation with butane produces isooctane, another fuel additive. Isobutylene is also used in the production of methacrolein. Polymerization of isobutylene produces butyl rubber (polyisobutylene). Antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) are produced by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of phenols using isobutylene.|$|E
50|$|In foods, TBHQ {{is used as}} a {{preservative}} for unsaturated {{vegetable oils}} and many edible animal fats. It does not cause discoloration even in the presence of iron, and does not change flavor or odor of the material to which it is added. It can be combined with other preservatives such as <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA). As a food additive, its E number is E319. It is added {{to a wide range of}} foods, with the highest limit (1 gram/kg) permitted for frozen fish and fish products. Its primary advantage is extending storage life.|$|E
50|$|Antioxidants {{are often}} used as {{preservatives}} in fat-containing foods to delay the onset or slow the development of rancidity due to oxidation. Natural antioxidants include ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and tocopherols (vitamin E). Synthetic antioxidants include <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), TBHQ, propyl gallate and ethoxyquin. The natural antioxidants tend to be short-lived, so synthetic antioxidants are used when a longer shelf-life is preferred. The effectiveness of water-soluble antioxidants is limited in preventing direct oxidation within fats, but is valuable in intercepting free radicals that travel through the aqueous parts of foods. A combination of water-soluble and fat-soluble antioxidants is ideal, usually in the ratio of fat to water.|$|E
5000|$|Warmed-over flavor can be {{prevented}} {{by the addition of}} preservatives to processed meat. Many of the preservatives are antioxidants, ranging from tocopherols (related to vitamin E) to plum juice to industrial additives such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) and propyl gallate. [...] Other preservatives such as sodium pyrophosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate may work by binding iron and preventing it from catalyzing the chemical reactions which lead to warmed-over flavor; as these compounds are generally more soluble in water than the fat-soluble antioxidant preservatives, they may be more readily used to prevent oxidative decomposition in meat. Nitrites, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.|$|E

5000|$|BHT is {{primarily}} {{used as an}} antioxidant food additive. In the United States, it is classified as {{generally recognized as safe}} (GRAS) based on a National Cancer Institute study from 1979 in rats and mice. It is approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration: For example, 21 CFR § 137.350(a)(4) allows BHT up to 0.0033% by weight in [...] "enriched rice", while 9 CFR § 381.147(f)(1) allows up to 0.01% in poultry [...] "by fat content". It is permitted in the European Union under E321. [...] It is forbidden as food additive in Japan (since 1958), Romania, Sweden, and Australia. Since the 1970s, BHT has been steadily replaced with <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA).Some food companies have voluntarily eliminated BHT from their products.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{reliable}} electrochemical sensor based on cobalt oxide nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE/CoOxNPs) for determination of <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> is presented here. The nanoparticles were fabricated by electrodepositing method. The modified electrode shows excellent catalytic activity toward <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> oxidation in pH 12. 0 phosphate buffer solution (PBS). The detection limit (S/N = 3), sensitivity and catalytic rate constant (kcat) of the modified electrode toward <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> were 2. 9 µM, 5. 1 nA μM- 1 and 1. 1 × 104 M- 1 s- 1, respectively, at linear concentration rang up to 1350 μM. The {{capability of the}} modified electrode for direct <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> quantification in real samples is also discussed. This modified electrode shows many advantages such as good catalytic activity, good reproducibility, simple preparation procedure and long-term stability of signal response during <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> oxidation.

40|$|This {{work was}} focused on study of a {{behaviour}} of the food additivum <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> on modified carbon electrodes by the voltammetric techniques - cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry. Glassy carbon and carbon paste electrode were used. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in combination with three different binders (acetonitrile, nafione or chitosane) were employed for the electrode modification. Carbon paste electrode was unable to modificate with film containing carbon nanotubes and acetonitrile, its active surface was treated only with nafione and chitosane film. All three mentioned modifications were applied in case of glassy carbon electrode. <b>Butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> provided a significantly higher signal using electrodes modified with carbon nanotubes with all three binders in contrast to electrodes without any surface modification. The glassy carbon electrode with carbon nanotube / acetonitrile film on its surface {{appeared to be the}} most effective for analytical purposes.

40|$|Propofol (2, 6 -diisopropylphenol), some {{substituted}} phenols (2, 6 -dimethylphenol and 2, 6 -ditertbutylphenol) {{and their}} 4 -nitrosoderivatives have been compared for their scavenging ability towards 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl {{and for their}} inhibitory action on lipid peroxidation. These products were also compared to the classical antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene and <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole.</b> When measuring the reactivity of the various phenolic derivatives with 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl the following order of effectiveness was observed: <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> > propofol > 2, 6 -dimethylphenol > 2, 6 -di-tertbutylphenol > butylated hydroxytoluene. In cumene hydroperoxide-dependent microsomal lipid peroxidation, propofol acts as the most effective antioxidant, while <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole,</b> 2, 6 -di-tertbutylphenol and butylated hydroxytoluene exhibit a rather similar effect, although lower than propofol.

The antioxidant properties of the various molecules depend on their hydrophobic characteristics and on the steric and electronic effects of their substituents. However, the introduction of the nitroso group in the 4 -position almost completely removes the antioxidant properties of the examined compounds.

40|$|Four antioxidants, propyl gallate, <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole,</b> butylated hydroxytoluene, and d-α-tocopherol acid succinate {{were found}} to {{stabilize}} amphotericin B and to prolong its antifungal activity against Candida albicans. Although each of the antioxidants was effective in this respect, propyl gallate and <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> were better than butylated hydroxytoluene and d-α-tocopherol acid succinate. None of the antioxidants alone adversely affected normal cell growth. It is suggested that amphotericin B instability is due, at least in part, to lability of the carbon-carbon double bonds of the polyene moiety toward autoxidation.

40|$|A novel cytosolic Alpha class {{glutathione}} S-transferase (GST) that is {{not normally}} expressed in mouse liver {{was found to be}} markedly induced (at least 20 -fold) by the anti-carcinogenic compound <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole.</b> This enzyme (designated GST Ya 1 Ya 1) did not bind to either the S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose or the glutathione-Sepharose affinity matrices, and purification was achieved by using bromosulphophthalein-glutathione-Sepharose. The purified isoenzyme, which comprises subunits of Mr 25, 600, was characterized, and its catalytic, electrophoretic, immunochemical and structural properties are documented. GST Ya 1 Ya 1 was shown to be distinct from the Alpha class GST that is expressed in normal mouse liver and is composed of 25, 800 -Mr subunits; the Alpha class isoenzyme that is constitutively expressed in the liver is now designated GST Ya 3 Ya 3. Hepatic concentrations of GST Ya 3 Ya 3 were not significantly affected when mice were treated with <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole.</b> Both Pi class GST (subunit Mr 24, 800) and Mu class GST (subunit Mr 26, 400) from female mouse liver were induced by dietary <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole.</b> By contrast, hepatic concentrations of microsomal GST (subunit Mr 17, 300) were unaffected...|$|E

40|$|Red {{blood cell}} lysis and {{histidine}} degradation, photosensitized by tiaprofenic acid (TIA), were investigated. Photohaemolysis was markedly enhanced in oxygenated solutions, {{but was also}} intense {{in the presence of}} nitrogen. Photohaemolysis was inhibited by <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> and reduced glutathione, but was unaffected by sodium azide, superoxide dismutase and mannitol. The TIA-induced photo-oxidation of histidine was greatly enhanced in the presence of oxygen and almost completely inhibited in solutions bubbled with nitrogen. Sodium azide, <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> and reduced glutathione inhibited the photodegradation of histidine. Phototoxicity to histidine was unaffected by mannitol and superoxide dismutase. The overall results suggest that molecular mechanisms involving free radicals and singlet oxygen are responsible for TIA-photosensitized reactions. These two in vitro models (photohaemolysis and histidine degradation) represent different mechanisms of phototoxicity, but complement one another in the investigation of potential phototoxic substances...|$|E
40|$|<b>Butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) and 1, 2 -bis(2 -pyridyl) {{ethylene}} (2 PY-e) are phase II drug metabolizing enzyme inducers {{which cause}} hepatomegaly without hepatocyte hypertrophy and induce glutathione S-transferase Yp (GST Yp, pi-class GST), {{which is known}} as a tumor marker. To evaluate the relationship between GST Yp induction and hepatocyte proliferation, male F 344 /DuCrj rats were treated with BHA, 2 PY-e, or phenobarbital (PB) for three or seven days. All three chemicals caused increases in liver weight after three and seven days. Immunohistochemical examinations revealed that BHA and 2 PY-e induced GST Yp in the hepatocytes of the periportal and centrilobular areas at three and seven days, respectively, whereas PB did not. Significant increases in the BrdU labeling indices were found in the livers of rats in each of the three-day treatment groups, but the labeling index of rat livers treated with BHA was decreased to the control level at seven days, although the high labeling indices of 2 PY-e and PB persisted at seven days. Double immunostaining confirmed that BrdU-positive nuclei corresponded to GST Yp-positive hepatocytes in both BHA and 2 PY-e treated rats. These results suggest that the GST Yp induction caused by BHA or 2 PY-e has some kind of relationship with hepatocyte proliferation.

Different composite meat-curing mixtures were formulated using cochineal and paprika as natural colorants, sodium hypophosphite (SHP) as antimicrobial agent, <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) as antioxidant and sodium nitrite. The treatment, which contained 0. 015 % cochineal, most closely resembled the 120 ppm NaNO 2 {{in its ability to}} create cured-meat color. BHA was found to be a strong antioxidant at the 30 ppm level in cooked sausages during refrigerated storage for 5 weeks. All treatments containing 40 ppm sodium nitrite were successful in replicating sensory attributes of frankfurter samples. Our findings support the use of SHP as possible antibotulinal agent in nitrite-free meat-curing systems. Practical Applications Several nitrite-free and low-nitrite frankfurters consisting of natural colorants, an antioxidant and sodium hypophosphite as antimicrobial agent were formulated in this study. The data from this investigation support the use of cochineal as a colorant, sodium hypophosphite as an antibotulinal and antimicrobial agent, and <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA) as an antioxidant in developing of composite nitrite-free and low-nitrite frankfurter...|$|E

40|$|Tubacin {{is a small}} {{molecule}} inhibitor of {{histone deacetylase}} 6 and blocks aggresome activity. We found that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -positive Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells were generally killed by lower doses of tubacin than EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) or EBV-negative BL cells. Tubacin induced apoptosis of LCLs, which was inhibited by pretreatment with a pancaspase inhibitor but not by <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole,</b> which inhibits reactive oxygen species. In contrast, tubacin killed EBV-positive BL cells in a caspase- 3 -independent pathway that involved reactive oxygen species and was blocked by <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole.</b> Previously, we showed that bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, induces apoptosis of EBV LCLs and that LCLs are killed by lower doses of bortezomib than EBV-positive BL cells. Here {{we found that the}} combination of bortezomib and tubacin acted in synergy to kill EBV-positive BL cells and LCLs. Tubacin or the combination of bortezomib and tubacin did not induce EBV lytic replication.

40|$|Isolated soybean (Glycine max L. var Hood) {{embryonic}} axes have {{a spontaneous}} chemiluminescence (about 150 {{counts per minute}} per embryo) that increases showing two phases, upon water imbibition. The first photoemission burst was measured between 0 and 7 hours of imbibition with a maximum of about 350 counts per minute per embryo after 2 hours. The second photoemission phase, between 7 and 30 hours, increased from about 220 to 520 counts per minute per embryo. Both chemiluminescence phases were inhibited by infused <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> while only the second phase was inhibited by infused salicylhydroxamic acid. On {{the basis of the}} sensitivity of the lipoxygenase reaction to both inhibitors (about 90 %), the first burst is tentatively assigned to oxy-radicals mobilized upon water uptake by the embryonic axes, and the second phase is tentatively identified as due to lipoxygenase activity. The in vivo lipoxygenase activity of the embryonic axes was estimated by both the fraction of total oxygen uptake that was inhibited by <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> and by the fraction of photoemission that was inhibited by <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> and by salicylhydroxamic acid. Both approaches indicated marked increases (5 -fold and 12 -fold, respectively) of lipoxygenase activity between 2 and 30 hours of imbibition. The measured chemiluminescence per O 2 uptake ratio (the experimental quantum yield) for the lipoxygenase reaction (3. 3 × 10 − 14 counts per O 2 molecule) was used to estimate the O 2 uptake due to lipoxygenase activity from the photoemission of the embryonic axes after 30 hours of imbibition. The value (0. 54 microliters per minute per axis) was close to the butylated hydroxyanisole-sensitive O 2 uptake (1. 2 microliters O 2 per minute per axis) of the same embryonic axes.

Continuous administration of <b>butylated</b> <b>hydroxyanisole</b> (BHA), a ROS inhibitor, before or after NNK treatment significantly blocked tumor development, although less effectively when BHA is administered after NNK treatment. Strikingly, BHA abolished the occurrence of F 4 / 80 + macrophages with similar efficiency no matter whether it was administered before or after NNK treatment.
