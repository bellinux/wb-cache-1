25|$|Trend {{lines are}} {{sometimes}} used in <b>business</b> <b>analytics</b> to show changes in data over time. This {{has the advantage}} of being simple. Trend lines are often used to argue that a particular action or event (such as training, or an advertising campaign) caused observed changes at a point in time. This is a simple technique, and does not require a control group, experimental design, or a sophisticated analysis technique. However, it suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data.|$|E

Jennings later wrote an article for Slate, in which he stated: IBM has bragged to the media that Watson's question-answering skills are good for more than annoying Alex Trebek. The company sees {{a future in which}} fields like medical diagnosis, <b>business</b> <b>analytics,</b> and tech support are automated by question-answering software like Watson. Just as factory jobs were eliminated in the 20th century by new assembly-line robots, Brad and I were the first knowledge-industry workers put out of work by the new generation of 'thinking' machines. 'Quiz show contestant' may be the first job made redundant by Watson, but I'm sure it won't be the last.|$|E
