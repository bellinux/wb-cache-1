I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment.

500|$|Their {{relationship}} became strained {{during the}} making of 1980's Gaucho, largely due to their insistence for perfection. In addition, Becker {{was in the midst}} of a drug problem and both, they later recalled, seemed depressed. Though Fagen imagined they might [...] "stick it out for a while," [...] he admitted to Robert Palmer of The New York Times, in an article published on June 17, 1981, that the group had indeed separated. [...] "Basically, we decided after writing and playing together for 14 years, we could use a change mondaire as the French say," [...] he told Palmer. After their split, Fagen worked on a song for the soundtrack of the film Heavy Metal, which got him back in the studio. He began working towards a solo album shortly thereafter. [...] "Working on it has <b>been</b> <b>interesting.</b> The fact that it's not a Steely Dan album has freed me from a certain image, a preconceived idea of how it'll sound," [...] he said at the time. Fagen had hoped to record music on his own [...] "a year or so" [...] prior to the duo's breakup. The album was originally slated to be titled Talk Radio.|$|E
500|$|On 2007's Quién Dijo Ayer, Arjona {{reworked}} past {{songs to}} fit a new style. For example, he gave [...] "Si El Norte Fuera El Sur" [...] a ska beat, and performed {{with the aid of}} Panteón Rococó. He transformed [...] "Historia de Taxi" [...] into a salsa song, with the help of American singer Marc Anthony and pianist Sergio George, who commented that [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>interesting</b> to work with two figures from different music worlds on the interest of making good music." [...] He further stated that [...] "every time a reunion of this kind happens, it's a reason to celebrate." [...] Birchmeier commented, [...] "While only a couple of the new versions depart stylistically from the originals, the contemporary productions breathe new life into these songs." [...] "Realmente No Estoy Tan Solo" [...] was re-recorded with singer Sandro. This {{turned out to be the}} last song recorded by the latter, who died 4 January 2010. This album included three new songs. The lead single, [...] "Quién" [...] was written by Arjona and produced by himself and Torres. [...] "Quiero" [...] and [...] "Espantapájaros" [...] are the other two new songs on the album.|$|E

500|$|The {{album is}} a {{collection}} of Arjona's past hits re-recorded in a [...] "tropical version", featuring genres such as salsa, bachata, merengue, vallenato, son and reggae. Several of Tropicos songs were originally included in another compilation Arjona released several years before, in 2001, entitled Arjona Tropical. The salsa version of [...] "Historia De Taxi", which Arjona performed with American singer Marc Anthony and pianist Sergio George, was included on the album. The song was originally recorded for Arjona's compilation album Quién Dijo Ayer, released in August 2007. George said, [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>interesting</b> to work with two figures from different music worlds on the interest of making good music", and [...] "every time a reunion of this kind happens, it [...] a reason to celebrate." [...] "Buenas Noches Don David", originally recorded for Sin Daños a Terceros, was performed by Puerto Rican salsa singer Gilberto Santa Rosa. Arjona produced both the original version as well as the new salsa version, and provided additional background vocals for the new version. [...] "Primera Vez", originally featured in Animal Nocturno, was performed by Victor Manuelle. [...] "Mujeres" [...] was re-recorded to feature a new merengue style, fitting the usual musical production of Elvis Crespo, who performed the song.|$|E
500|$|Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it was {{favorable}} of {{the early}} pairing of Tucker and Ashley, giving them an [...] "honorable mention" [...] {{on a list of}} [...] "curiously quirky couplings". Candace Young of the website She Knows Soaps wrote that, [...] "Ashley and Tucker have <b>been</b> <b>interesting</b> as a power couple, if you will, in business and the corporate world." [...] In January 2011, Garrett awarded Nichols a [...] "Leading Men Gold Standard" [...] and praised his portrayal that week, writing: [...] "Stephen Nichols as Tucker was all over the place this week. Initially Tucker decided to back the recording label of Devon Winters and Noah Newman. Nichols played a man who wanted to help two young men break into the music industry. However, the shocking news that Cane and Sofia have been lying to Tucker and allowing a conman to swindle Tucker’s company was destined to be revealed. Although the climax came {{at the end of the}} week, the intensity in which Stephen Nichols played the revelation was exciting to say the least. Fans know that next week Tucker McCall’s going to cause heads to roll." [...] Jae Jones of Yahoo! praised the storyline revealing Tucker as Devon's father as it gave the soap opera's matriarch, Katherine, a biracial grandson. She wrote: [...] "What seems to make the story line even more interesting is the fact that she has a biracial grandson. Who would have ever thought the show could catch up with the current times? There are not too many daytime soaps left for housewives and house husbands to enjoy, but those who watch this show are always in for a special treat each afternoon." [...] They later named the storyline the [...] "best reveal" [...] of 2011.|$|E
500|$|In early 1997, Warner Bros. {{approached}} cult filmmaker {{and comic}} book writer Kevin Smith, who had then just finished writing Superman Lives, to script a Green Lantern film. Smith {{turned down the}} offer, believing there were more suitable candidates to make a Green Lantern film. At one point Quentin Tarantino was offered the chance to write and direct. Warner also considered the property as an action comedy; by 2004, Robert Smigel had completed a script which was set to star Jack Black in the lead role. However, the studio dropped the comedy idea following poor fan reaction from the Internet. David S. Goyer was offered the chance to write and direct either a Green Lantern or Flash film after Warner Bros. was impressed with his screenplay for Batman Begins, but he opted to direct the latter. Actor-writer Corey Reynolds, a comic book fan of the John Stewart character, pitched Warner {{an idea for a}} trilogy, with him starring as John Stewart and performing screenwriting duties. Reynolds intended to introduce Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern Corps and Justice League in possible sequels. He finished the script for Green Lantern: Birth of a Hero in June 2007, receiving positive feedback from Warner Bros. with a potential 2010 release date. However, the studio abandoned Reynolds' concept, and in October 2007, Greg Berlanti signed to direct the film and co-write it with comic-book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim. A draft of the trio's 2008 script, leaked on the Internet, revealed a story that included the hero's origin and included the characters Carol Ferris, Kilowog, Sinestro, and Guy Gardner in a cameo appearance, and appeared [...] "to set up Hector Hammond as Hal Jordan's ... first major nemesis...." [...] Shortly afterward, Guggenheim said that the script would contain characterizations inspired by the Denny O'Neil-Neal Adams run on the comic in the 1970s, and Dave Gibbons' work in the early 1980s. He added that he and his co-writers also looked to the 2000s Geoff Johns stories, saying, [...] "It’s <b>been</b> <b>interesting</b> because we finished a draft just before [...] '' [...] started up. [...] "So I’ve been reading 'Secret Origin' with a real interest in seeing 'OK, how did Geoff solve this problem?' There are certain elements just for anyone trying to retell Hal’s origin for a modern day audience has to address and grapple with. For example, why the hell was Abin [...] flying in a space ship when he's a Green Lantern? You don't ask that question back in the Silver Age, but when you're writing in the Modern Age, you have to answer these things." ...|$|E

2500|$|During his Petale and Prima durere years, Theodorian {{borrowed}} {{inspiration from}} his Craiova colleague, Traian Demetrescu, producing novellas about aggrieved figures—pious prostitutes, marginalized officers, altruistic girls. According to his Sburătorul patron Eugen Lovinescu, {{the bulk of}} his short prose resembles Brătescu-Voinești and I. A. Bassarabescu: urban-themed but longing for the [...] "patriarchal" [...] environment of the countryside, this [...] "quite uniform" [...] literature is [...] "rather better in its miniature portrayals [...] aged maniacs and most of all survivors from a bygone era". Călinescu suggests that Theodorian's sketches were [...] "amateurish", and the humorous ones [...] "very weak". He reserved some praise for the more [...] "dramatic" [...] ones, such as Calea sufletului, in which the protagonist, an Orthodox priest, confronts the notary and a band of robbers to protect his charity box. Reviewing the latter, Izabela Sadoveanu described Theodorian's [...] "absence of taste and common sense, [...] makes him slide into sentimental exaggeration, into fake, affected, romanticism". Calea sufletului, she argues, is an [...] "anecdote that, had it been recounted concisely, vigorously, would have <b>been</b> <b>interesting</b> enough with its sheer chain of events." [...] Contrarily, Nicolae Iorga of Sămănătorul found the works illuminating, with Theodorian as [...] "master of the smooth and solid form", including [...] "one of the best stories ever written in Romanian." ...|$|E
