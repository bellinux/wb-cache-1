5|$|The {{circumstances}} in which the Crosby Garret helmet was buried are still unclear, but the discoveries made by the post-discovery Tullie House/PAS excavations have provided much more detail about its context. It was clearly deposited within an artificial feature that had been specially constructed; Stuart Noon of the Museum of Lancashire suggests that the feature may have been intended as a memorial of some sort. It was not buried in an isolated spot but within a long-occupied Romano-British farming settlement that had clearly adopted aspects of Roman culture. Given the settlement's proximity to Roman military locations, it is very possible that some of its inhabitants served with the Roman army, which often recruited mounted auxiliaries from among native peoples. The helmet may well already have been a valuable antique {{at the time of}} its burial; if the coins found nearby reflect when it was buried, it could have been over a century old by the time it was deposited. It was deliberately broken before being buried in what may have been intended as a ritual sacrifice. The identity of its owner will never be known, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been that a local inhabitant who had formerly served with the Roman cavalry was responsible for the helmet's deposition.|$|E

25|$|The Romans {{recognized}} their {{weakness in}} naval power and tactics, {{especially after the}} incident of the Lipari Islands. With this in mind they constructed the corvus, a plank to link ships together at sea. The inventor of the corvus is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a Syracusan, such as Archimedes. This device would {{be attached to the}} prow of Roman ships on a rotating axle, so that it could be swung around; and its spiked end could then be dropped onto an enemy ship. In this way the Romans could still make use of their superior soldiers by loading them across the corvus and onto enemy ships.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, {{many in the}} {{leadership}} of Weimar Germany, who felt humiliated by the conditions that the Treaty of Versailles had imposed after their defeat in the First World War (especially General Hans von Seeckt, chief of the Reichswehr), were interested {{in cooperation with the}} Soviet Union, both in order to avert any threat from the Second Polish Republic, backed by the French Third Republic, and to prevent any possible Soviet-British alliance. The specific German aims were the full rearmament of the Reichswehr, which was explicitly prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles, and an alliance against Poland. It is unknown exactly when the first contacts between von Seeckt and the Soviets took place, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been as early as 1919–1921, or possibly even before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have connected {{the decline of}} Angkor with {{the conversion of the}} Khmer Empire to Theravada Buddhism following the reign of Jayavarman VII, arguing that this religious transition eroded the Hindu conception of kingship that undergirded the Angkorian civilization. According to Angkor scholar George Coedès, Theravada Buddhism's denial of the ultimate reality of the individual served to sap the vitality of the royal personality cult which had provided the inspiration for the grand monuments of Angkor. The vast expanse of temples required an equally large body of workers to maintain them; at Ta Prohm, a stone carving states that 12,640 people serviced that single temple complex. Not only could the spread of Buddhism have eroded this workforce, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> also affected the estimated 300,000 agricultural workers required to feed them all.|$|E

25|$|The {{casualties}} {{on both sides}} were high. There are about 15,000 Germans buried in the cemetery at Halbe, making it the largest war cemetery in Germany from World War II. About 10,000 are unidentified soldiers killed {{during the first half}} of 1945. The Red army claimed to have killed 60,000 German soldiers and taken 120,000 as prisoners. The number of prisoners is confirmed by German official sources, while other sources consider it to be exaggerated. Thousands of Red Army soldiers died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth–Zossen road (Bundesstraße 96). These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total will never be known. Nobody knows how many civilians died, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been as high as 10,000.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, {{making it}} {{chemically}} distinct from other approved anticonvulsants. It enhances {{the action of}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS; which consists of the brain and spinal cord). Lamotrigine may also inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels thereby suppressing the release of glutamate and aspartate, two of the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS. It is generally accepted {{to be a member of}} the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties. Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver.|$|E
25|$|The first Roman {{frontier}} in {{the north}} and west of the island was marked by watchtowers and military camps, or castra, along the Fosse Way. This has led many historians to suggest that it served as the permanent border {{in the early years of}} Roman occupation. However, it is more likely that the boundary between Roman and Celtic Britain fluctuated markedly during this period. In Eburacum in 71 AD, a wood and earth military camp was built by the Legio IX Hispana to secure the northern region. Following the defeat of the Welsh tribes, Agricola’s army advanced against particularly warlike Pictish tribes in the inhabited areas {{in the north}}. In 79, his soldiers reached the Tanaus (or Taus; its location is unknown today, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the Firth of Tay) and established several camps. In 80 AD, Agricola secured his conquests further, and built a row of defensive camps across a narrow neck in the north of Britain where the inlets of the sea cut deeply into the island between what Tacitus had called Clota (the Firth of Clyde) and Bodotria (the Firth of Forth). In 82, he moved with his troops and a unit of the fleet along the east coast of Scotland, into the regions north of the Firth of Forth. To support this incursion he built bases such as Pinnata Castra, a legion camp near Inchtuthil. Subsequently he tried to secure the north permanently with further fortifications on the so-called Gask Ridge. However, the expenditure on military equipment and logistics and the losses in this endless fighting greatly outweighed the benefits gained. After his recall, Caledonia, with its harsh climate and sparse resources, was once again left to itself and the Romans restricted themselves to securing the most fertile and economically attractive regions of the island. Moreover, the troops tied up in Britannia were increasingly needed on the continent to defend the Rhine and Lower Danube from Germanic and Dacian attacks.|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{criticized the}} {{character}} development of Lori Grimes. Goldman was angry upon viewing the crash sequence, avouching that it stunted any development {{intended for the}} scene. He stated, [...] "The Walking Dead really needs to work on strengthening its female characters, and it doesn't help when Lori has a major accident for such a stupid reason, getting distracted {{as she looked at}} a map while she drove. Yeah, yeah, there was a zombie in the road, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been an animal [...] just as easily, and it really undercut the intended drama of her situation when it just seems so stupid that it happened at all." [...] Halden thought that the foundation set up for furthering storyline progression was contrived, while Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal said that the premise of the dilemma made no sense. Jeffery was much more optimistic about the scene, ultimately evaluating it as a [...] "jaw-dropping moment".|$|E
500|$|By {{this time}} George's health was deteriorating. He had a mental illness, characterised by acute mania, which was {{possibly}} {{a symptom of}} the genetic disease porphyria, although this has been questioned. A study of samples of the King's hair published in 2005 revealed high levels of arsenic, a possible trigger for the disease. The source of the arsenic is not known, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a component of medicines or cosmetics. The King may have had a brief episode of disease in 1765, but a longer episode began in the summer of 1788. At the end of the parliamentary session, he went to Cheltenham Spa to recuperate. It was the furthest he had ever been from London—just short of 100miles (150km)—but his condition worsened. In November he became seriously deranged, sometimes speaking for many hours without pause, causing him to foam at the mouth and making his voice hoarse. His doctors were largely at a loss to explain his illness, and spurious stories about his condition spread, such as the claim that he shook hands with a tree in the mistaken belief that it was the King of Prussia. Treatment for mental illness was primitive by modern standards, and the King's doctors, who included Francis Willis, treated the King by forcibly restraining him until he was calm, or applying caustic poultices to draw out [...] "evil humours".|$|E

500|$|At dawn on 28 April, {{the youth}} {{divisions}} Clausewitz, Scharnhorst, and Theodor Körner, attacked from the south-west toward {{the direction of}} Berlin. They were part of Wenck's XX Corps and were made up of men from the officer training schools, making them {{some of the best}} units the Germans had in reserve. They covered a distance of about , before being halted at the tip of Lake Schwielow, south-west of Potsdam and still [...] from Berlin. During the night, General Wenck reported to the German Supreme Army Command in Fuerstenberg that his XII Army had been forced back along the entire front. According to Wenck, no attack on Berlin was possible. At that point, support from the IX Army could no longer be expected. In the meantime, about 25,000 German soldiers of the IX Army, along with several thousand civilians, succeeded in reaching the lines of the XII Army after breaking out of the Halbe pocket. The casualties on both sides were very high. Nearly 30,000 Germans were buried after the battle in the cemetery at Halbe. About 20,000 soldiers of the Red Army also died trying to stop the breakout; most are buried at a cemetery next to the Baruth-Zossen road. These are the known dead, but the remains of more who died in the battle are found every year, so the total of those who died will never be known.

500|$|Reviewing [...] "The Long Game" [...] for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "B-". He found it [...] "inessential" [...] and commented {{that it was not}} very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's {{performance}} was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story [...] "presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been so much more." [...] In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as [...] "entertaining, if unspectacular." [...] He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a [...] "superb job" [...] at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [...] was more positive, opining that a satire {{did not have to be}} subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today. He also praised the way [...] "The Long Game" [...] showed the Ninth Doctor as an [...] "inspirational figure." [...] The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.|$|E
500|$|In comparison, some reviewers {{were more}} {{critical}} of American Gangster. Jonathan Crocker of Time Out London was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, [...] "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of The French Connection, The Godfather, Serpico and Prince of the City – all looming heavily in intertextual nods." [...] In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, [...] "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence." [...] In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars. Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that American Gangster is [...] "never dull, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue." [...] Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have [...] "a ghastly ingenuity". Empires Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was [...] "undeniably enjoyable" [...] and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that [...] "very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from {{the whole history of}} crime flicks" [...] and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination. Slant Magazine journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was [...] "dumb as a rock", and that it was [...] "far too convinced of its import to be any fun." [...] Giving American Gangster a two out of five stars, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, [...] "He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly." [...] He resumed: [...] "He never has the menace of his dirty cop in Training Day, and we don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in Malcolm X. That shoulder-shimmying swagger is rarely seen, and the brand-classic robes of American Gangster sit on him heavily." ...|$|E
