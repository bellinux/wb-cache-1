40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} a general theoretical framework to analyze noise limited networks. More precisely, we consider two ho-mogenous Poisson point processes of base stations and users. General model of radio signal propagation and effect of fading are also consid-ered. The main difference of our model {{with respect to}} other existing models is that a user connects to his <b>best</b> <b>servers</b> but not necessarily the closest one. We provide general formula for the outage probability. We study functionals related to the SNR {{as well as the}} sum of these functionals over all users per cell. For the latter, the expectation and bounds on the variance are obtained. 1...|$|R

40|$|The goal of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) is {{to serve}} content to {{end-users}} with high performance. In order to do that, a CDN measures the latency on the paths from its servers to users and then selects a <b>best</b> available <b>server</b> for each user. For large CDNs, monitoring paths from thousands of servers to millions of users is a challenging task due to its size. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a framework to scale the task of path monitoring. Simply stated, the goal of our framework is clustering IP addresses (clients) such that in each cluster the choice of <b>best</b> available <b>server</b> is same (or similar). Then, finding a <b>best</b> available <b>server</b> for one client in a given cluster will be sufficient to assign that server {{to the rest of}} the clients in the cluster. To achieve this goal, first we introduce two distance metrics to compute how similar the server choices of any given two clients. Second, we use a clustering method that is based on interdomain routing information. We evaluate the goodness of our clusters by using the metrics we introduce. We show that there is a strong correlation between the similarity in how two destination clients are routed to in the Internet and the similarity in their server selections. Finally, we show how to choose representative clients from each cluster so that it is sufficient to learn the latencies from the CDN servers to the representative and find a <b>best</b> available <b>server</b> accordingly for the rest of the clients in the same cluster...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAlthough residue-residue contact maps {{dictate the}} {{topology}} of proteins, sequence-based ab initio contact predictions {{have been found}} little use in actual structure prediction due to the low accuracy. We developed a composite set of nine SVM-based contact predictors {{that are used in}} I-TASSER simulation in combination with sparse template contact restraints. When testing the strategy on 273 nonhomologous targets, remarkable improvements of I-TASSER models were observed for both easy and hard targets, with p value by Student's t test 30 %, which essentially converts “nonfoldable” targets into “foldable” ones. In CASP 9, I-TASSER employed ab initio contact predictions, and generated models for 26 FM targets with a GDT-score 16 % and 44 % higher than the second and third <b>best</b> <b>servers</b> from other groups, respectively. These findings demonstrate a new avenue to improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction especially for free-modeling targets...|$|R
40|$|Kinesis {{is a novel}} data {{placement}} {{model for}} distributed storage systems. It exemplifies three design principles: structure (division of servers into a few failure-isolated segments), freedom of choice (freedom to allocate the <b>best</b> <b>servers</b> to store and retrieve data based on current resource availability), and scattered distribution (independent, pseudo-random spread of replicas in the system). These design principles enable storage systems to achieve balanced utilization of storage and network resources {{in the presence of}} incremental system expansions, failures of single and shared components, and skewed distributions of data size and popularity. In turn, this ability leads to significantly reduced resource provisioning costs, good user-perceived response times, and fast, parallelized recovery from independent and correlated failures. This article validates Kinesis through theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments on a prototype implementation. Evaluations driven by real-world traces show that Kinesis can significantly outperform the widely used Chain replica-placement strategy in terms of resource requirements...|$|R

Servers o ering top service comprised {{only a small fraction of}} the total number of servers hosting the file. We offer a server selection technique that identifies the <b>best</b> performing <b>server</b> from a large collection of servers; Without further testing, the server selected achieves performance that is very close to selecting the <b>best</b> possible <b>server</b> for at least a month of downloads.

40|$|Today, a large {{fraction}} of Internet traffic {{is due to}} Content Delivery Networks (CDN). To cope with the increasing de-mand for content CDNs deploy massively distributed infras-tructures.

40|$|Media {{streaming}} over best-effort packet networks {{such as the}} Internet {{is quite}} challenging because of the dynamic and unpredictable available bandwidth, loss rate, and delay. Recently, streaming over multiple paths to provide path diversity has emerged as an approach to help overcome these problems. This paper {{provides an overview of}} the benefits and use of path diversity for media streaming. The different approaches for media coding and streaming over multiple paths are examined, together with architectures for achieving path diversity between single or multiple senders and a single receiver. Important examples include using the distributed servers in a content delivery network to provide path diversity to a requesting client, using multiple 802. 11 wireless access points to provide path diversity to a mobile client, and using relays to provide low-latency media communication. The design, analysis, and operation of media streaming systems that use path diversity are considered, with emphasis on the accurate performance models needed to select the best paths or <b>best</b> <b>servers...</b>|$|R

His serve {{is known for}} its precision, incredible consistency, and tremendous speed, as it was often clocked above 130 mph and can reach up to high 140s (mph). His serve is often compared with contemporary Andy Roddick, being two of the <b>best</b> <b>servers</b> of the generation, although Roddick's serve relies on more power than precision and is generally less consistent than Ljubičić's. He usually stays at the baseline, relying on his fast, consistent and wide-driving groundstrokes, and uses slice and dropshots to great effect to surprise his opponents. He is very adept at the net, approaching when he sees fit, which also made him a good doubles player. His main weaknesses are his occasional inability to close out 5-set matches, and to a lesser extent, his movement around the court.|$|R

It exemplifies three design principles: structure (division of servers into a few failure-isolated segments), freedom of choice (freedom to allocate the <b>best</b> <b>servers</b> to store and retrieve data based on current re-source availability), and scattered distribution (in-dependent, pseudo-random spread of replicas in the system).

This paper validates Kinesis through theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments on a prototype implementation. Evaluations driven by real-world traces show that Kinesis can significantly out-perform the widely-used Chain strategy for placing replicas; Kinesis saves resource requirements by up to 25 %, improves end-to-end delay by up to 40 %, and recovers from failures orders of magnitude times faster than Chain in our evaluations. ...|$|R
