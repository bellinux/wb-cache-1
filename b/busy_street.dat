5|$|The memorial's {{location}} on a <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> corner has {{caused it to}} deteriorate, resulting {{in at least two}} recent clean-up and restoration projects. The first involved a clean-up of the granite base, while the second involved more extensive restoration, and was completed in April, 2007 at a cost of $90,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was installed}} at a triangular traffic island at a <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> intersection (Southwest 10th Avenue and West Burnside Street) in downtown Portland in November 2002.

Dual Pendulum (2000), Beeman's kinetic prototype of Pod, was installed at Oregon State University for Da Vinci Days in 2007.|$|E

Knox takes him to hospital, where he is diagnosed as a drug addict. Zero is sedated, but becomes agitated when two men enter the hospital lobby; Knox helps him escape, believing his life is in danger. The two men, Wright and Patterson, quarantine the area, as Zero is carrying a highly contagious disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombing was}} planned and {{performed}} by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured. Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow {{after the war}} had ended. In late-November, Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel. The building housed United States Army officers, including lieutenant colonels and majors, and attracted off-duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink, rooftop seating areas and movie screenings. It was a six-story building and had 193bedrooms. The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month, mixing with the crowds in the <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> outside. Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans, they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon's black market, enabling them to get closer. Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur, while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major. They mingled with the real officers {{so that they could}} copy their mannerisms, speaking style and even their way of smoking. The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} branch (U3 Süd) diverts {{from the}} U2 tunnel south of Rothenburger Straße {{and runs to}} the west as well. Two stations of this branch (Sündersbühl and Gustav-Adolf-Straße) have been completed.

The terminus of this branch, to be opened around 2017 or later, will be Gebersdorf Nord near the station Fürth Süd, a former station of the abandoned Bibertbahn railway at a <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> intersection south of Fürth's city limits. Further expansion beyond is under consideration on the right of way of the abandoned Bibertbahn railway into Zirndorf and possibly beyond.|$|E

25|$|SOHR {{reported}} {{the deaths of}} more than 113 civilians. In addition, around 50 civilians {{were killed in the}} al-Arba'een neighbourhood of Hama; but difficulties in contacting the area proved too difficult for SOHR to register the exact number of deaths. 29 were killed in Damascus and a further 12 killed in the Damascus Countryside. 21 civilians were killed and 65 wounded in the mortar shelling of Yarmouk Camp. Residents blamed the government. Witnesses in the camp told Reuters by telephone that the mortars hit a <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> as people were preparing a Ramadan meal to end their fast. 26 were killed in Dera'a; of which 13 were killed in the bombardment of Busra al-Harir.|$|E
25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a <b>busy</b> <b>street.</b> Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after the attack on Mody, another Indian was beaten into a coma; this time on a <b>busy</b> <b>street</b> corner in Jersey City Heights. The victim, Kaushal Saran, was found {{unconscious}} at Central and Ferry Avenues, near a city park and firehouse, according to police reports. Saran, a licensed physician in India who was awaiting licensing in the United States, was discharged later from University Hospital in Newark. The unprovoked attack left Saran in a partial coma for over a week with severe damage to his skull and brain. In September 1992, Thomas Kozak, Martin Ricciardi, and Mark Evangelista were brought to trial on federal civil rights charges in connection with the attack on Saran. However, the three were acquitted of the charges in two separate trials in 1993. Saran testified at both trials that he could not remember the incident.|$|E

25|$|McCloskey won the 1942 Caldecott Medal for Make Way for Ducklings. The story set in Boston, Massachusetts {{features}} a mallard pair that nests {{on an island}} in the Charles River. After some time raising eight ducklings on the island, the mother leads them to the Public Garden downtown. Famously, a friendly policeman stops traffic for them to cross a <b>busy</b> <b>street.</b> The story soon became a Boston institution. Sculptor Nancy Schön created a bronze version of Mrs. Mallard and the ducklings in 1987, installed along a walkway between pond and street. There thousands of children climb them every year and many more people photograph them; the park is also the annual site of a Make Way for Ducklings Mother's Day parade, featuring hundreds of children dressed in the costumes of their favorite characters. Since 2003 Make Way for Ducklings is the official children's book of Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Alison is {{increasingly}} worried about Ben's lack {{of responsibility and}} commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a fantasy baseball draft, which he explains he participates in {{to be free from}} Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons {{him in the middle of}} a <b>busy</b> <b>street.</b> He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup. Ben and Pete decide to go on a road trip to Las Vegas.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the crimes}} {{believed}} to have been associated with gang activity was a deadly shooting in May 2003, on a <b>busy</b> <b>street,</b> which may have been in retaliation for a driver having backed his bus into a rival; as revenge, two buses were set on fire in 2004. There was a fatal stabbing in October 2003, as well as another, unrelated stabbing in 2004. In January 2004, the boyfriend of a bus worker was lethally shot {{in what appeared to be}} a bus feud, and in March 2004, a Chinatown bus operator was killed in another fatal shooting. In a June 2004 incident tied to criminal gangs, two people—a Chinatown bus driver and a bystander—were murdered in a bar in Flushing, Queens, and another was shot in the leg. The accused shooter was arrested in Toronto in 2011 and extradited to the United States. After the 2004 shootings, the New York City Police Department started enforcing Chinatown bus rules more strictly.|$|E
