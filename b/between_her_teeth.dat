5|$|The growing {{popularity}} of worship of a more benign form of Kaali, as Daksinakali, is often attributed to Krishnananda Agamavagisha. He was a noted Bengali leader of the 17th century, author of a Tantra encyclopedia called Tantrasara. According to hearsay - Kaali appeared {{to him in a}} dream and told him to popularize her in a particular form that would appear to him the following day. The next morning he observed a young woman making cow dung patties. While placing a patty on a wall, she stood in the alidha pose, with her right foot forward. When she saw Krishnananda watching her, she was embarrassed and put her tongue <b>between</b> <b>her</b> <b>teeth.</b> Krishnananada took his previous worship of Kali out of the cremation grounds and into a more domestic setting. Krishnananda Vagamavagisha was also the guru of the Kaali devotee and poet Ramprasad Sen.|$|E

60|$|The {{letter was}} on the table with the first lines written. The woman {{was on the}} sofa with <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} twisted <b>between</b> <b>her</b> set <b>teeth,</b> and <b>her</b> tortured face terrible to look at. Mrs. Karnegie raised her a little, examined her closely--then suddenly changed color, and sent her daughter out of the room with directions to dispatch a messenger instantly for medical help.|$|R
6000|$|And {{directly}} {{the black}} dog, stretched at his wife's feet, muzzle on paws and blinking yellow eyes, growled discontentedly at the noise. Mrs. Travers laughed a faint, bright laugh, {{that seemed to}} escape, to glide, to dart <b>between</b> <b>her</b> white <b>teeth.</b> D'Alcacer, concealing his amazement, was {{looking down at her}} gravely: and after a slight gasp, she said with little bursts of merriment between every few words: ...|$|R
25|$|While at Café Society, Vaughan {{became friends}} with trumpeter George Treadwell. Treadwell became Vaughan's manager and she {{ultimately}} delegated to him most of the musical director responsibilities for her recording sessions, leaving her free to focus almost entirely on singing. Over the next few years, Treadwell made changes in Vaughan's stage appearance. Aside from a new wardrobe and hair style, Vaughan had <b>her</b> <b>teeth</b> capped, eliminating a gap <b>between</b> <b>her</b> two front <b>teeth.</b>|$|R

60|$|She rose to {{her feet}} with grave deliberation. For an instant, with the {{recollection}} of the delicate internal organization of the Saltellos on my mind, I was in agony lest she should totter and fall, even then, yielding up her gentle spirit on the spot. But when I looked again she had a hairpin <b>between</b> <b>her</b> white <b>teeth,</b> and was carefully adjusting her toreador hat. And beside us was Enriquez--cheerful, alert, voluble, and undaunted.|$|R

There she turned again and grilled Dry Valley Johnson once more in the dark flame of her audacious eyes, laughed a trifle school-girlishly, and twisted herself with pantherish quickness between the pickets to the O'Brien side of the wild gourd vine.|$|R

6000|$|She hesitated at {{the next}} sentence, wrote the first few words of it, {{scratched}} them out again, and petulantly tore the letter into fragments, and threw the pen {{to the other end}} of the room.

500|$|In the video's conclusion, Gaga's {{silhouette}} struts in {{an alley}} in a tribute to Jackson's [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] video.

She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again, and inside it, a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn. A city and a rainbow appear in the background, and Gaga is seen in her zombie makeup, chewing bubble gum and blowing it, as the pink triangle zooms away.|$|R
2500|$|A more {{effective}} {{variant of the}} over-the-mouth gag is called the cleave gag. Instead of being tied over the person's mouth, the scarf or cloth is pulled <b>between</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>teeth.</b> While such a gag of thin material is not very effective, a thick scarf {{can be used to}} hold his or her mouth open. [...] Cleave gags are difficult to remove as they are between the teeth, not over the mouth. When it is applied properly, the gagged person's speech is muffled, but not completely silenced.|$|R

500|$|As an {{artificial}} construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. Cortana always {{speaks with a}} smooth female voice, and she can communicate through comm systems and project a holographic image of herself from appropriate projectors, such as Holotanks, and appears holographically as a woman. Cortana is said to resemble her creator, Dr. Catherine Halsey, with a similar attitude [...] "only unchecked by military and social protocol". In Halo: The Fall of Reach, Cortana is described as slender, with close-cropped hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on [...] her mood. Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking. In Halo 4 Cortana has become more human in appearance with more subtle additions being added to her character model such as a gap being visible <b>between</b> <b>her</b> front <b>teeth.</b> Cortana was played by actress Mackenzie Mason using advanced facial rendering technology to capture movements in her face while speaking to add a more human look.|$|R
