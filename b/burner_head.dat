50|$|The {{fuel tank}} {{must first be}} {{pressurized}} by using the small hand-pump {{on the side of}} the stove. After pumping, the control valve is opened just slightly, allowing a mix of fuel (drawn from the bottom of the tank) and pressurized air (drawn from the top of the tank) to reach the <b>burner</b> <b>head.</b> There, the mixture is ignited using a match or lighter. Once the flame burns steadily for 2 to 3 minutes and the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> is sufficiently heated up, the control valve is opened as far as possible. This cuts off the air from the tank, changing the mix to pure fuel. The heat of the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> is then sufficient to vaporize the pure fuel prior to combustion. The size of the flame depends on the amount of pressure in the tank, which must be re-pressurized periodically using the hand pump.|$|E
50|$|On top of {{the spray}} chamber is a <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> that {{produces}} a flame that is laterally long (usually 5-10 cm) {{and only a few}} mm deep. The radiation beam passes through this flame at its longest axis, and the flame gas flow-rates may be adjusted to produce the highest concentration of free atoms. The burner height may also be adjusted, so that the radiation beam passes through the zone of highest atom cloud density in the flame, resulting in the highest sensitivity.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of the nozzle geometry on the mean flow field of an annular swirling jet. The nozzle geometry consists of a sudden expansion with step size s followed by a divergent with opening angle α and axial length L. The inner dimensions of the nozzle are changed via s, L and α and in total 87 different nozzle geometries are investigated. For each geometry the mean flow pattern {{as a function of the}} swirl is determined experimentally using pressure measurements. In these measured pressure diagrams, different regions are identified and each region corresponds to a different flow pattern. Up to four different flow patterns can exist depending on the combination of s, L, α and swirl number: Closed Jet Flow, Open Jet Flow Low Swirl, Open Jet Flow High Swirl and Coanda Jet Flow, and hysteresis exist in the flow patterns upon increasing and decreasing the swirl for certain nozzle geometries. A stability diagram is presented in the (s/L, α) - plane. This region contains the combinations of s/L and α, which give the highest number of different stable flow patterns. The information in this article can serve as a database for the design of nozzles in cold flow applications as well as in swirl-stabilized <b>burner</b> <b>heads.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} focused on the investigation of the influence of inert gases on characteristic parameters of the combustion process. Inert gases are usually standard components of alternative gaseous fuels such as the producer gas, coal gas or biogas. For a long period some of the fuels were considered as waste gases and their potential was not sufficiently utilised. Compared with noble fuels such as natural gas, alternative fuels have different physical-chemical properties. For example, their lower heating value (LHV) can be lower even than 10 MJ/mN 3. The composition of the alternative gaseous fuels can be various during their production process. Lower LHV {{is a result of the}} occurrence of inert gases that does not take a part in the combustion reactions. Inert gases have the ability to accumulate the heat. Under certain conditions it is possible to combust alternative fuels on conventional burners, but due to their different properties, problems can occur during the combustion. E. g. to achieve the same heat output as with the noble fuel, it is necessary to burn bigger volume of the alternative fuel. However, the limiting factor could be the <b>burner's</b> <b>head</b> geometry. Theoretical introduction of the thesis summarizes research results in the field of low calorific gaseous fuels combustion and the addition of inert gases into the noble fuels. The thesis also describes the mechanisms of the NOx formation and summarizes techniques which can be used to reduce NOx formation. Furthermore, fuels from alternative sources are categorized and described, including their composition and characteristics. Their physical-chemical properties were obtained by means of the combustion simulation carried out in the simulation software. Two devices had to be designed and manufactured to fulfil goals of the dissertation thesis. The first is a gas mixing station capable of mixing 4 different components. The second device is a burner utilized for the combustion of low calorific fuels. The key section of this thesis is a chapter describing the experimental plan, the performance and the evaluation of the experiments. The goal of the experiments was to dilute the natural gas by two inert gases, namely carbon dioxide and nitrogen. The lowest LHV value achieved during the experiment was 10, 7 MJ/mN 3. The influence of the inert gases on the NOx emissions, the flame stability and characteristics, the flue gas temperature, the in-flame temperatures, the heat flux and the thermal efficiency was investigated and evaluated. Each parameter was measured and evaluated for three different burners: the burner with the staged gas, the burner with the staged air and the burner for low calorific fuels. Generally, after the addition of the inert gas into the noble fuel, the in-flame temperatures decreased. As a consequence, the NOx emissions decreased as well. The effects of carbon dioxide on the investigated combustion parameters were more substantial than the effects of nitrogen. Each measured parameter is strongly dependent on the burner geometry. The experiments revealed that in most cases the addition of the inert gas into the fuel influenced the flame length (flame shortened) and also more heat was transfered into the chamber's walls closer to the burner tile...|$|R
5000|$|To {{light the}} stove, the user pours {{a small amount}} of alcohol into a {{circular}} [...] "spirit cup" [...] just below the burner and lights it to pre-heat the burner assembly. When it is hot, the user pressurizes the tank by means of a small hand pump integrated into the housing, which forces kerosene from the tank up through the rising tube (A) and the ascending pipe (B) to the pre-heated <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> (C), where the fuel is heated and vapourized. The kerosene vapour is then forced under pressure through the descending tube (D) to the vapour nozzle (E); here it sprays through a jet {{in the middle of the}} burner, where it mixes with air and burns in a sootless blue flame. The heat from that flame vapourizes more fuel to sustain the process when the spirit cup burns out. The user can pump the tank more to increase the pressure and make the flame larger; turning a small [...] "air screw" [...] (usually located in the filler cap) will release pressure from the tank and make the flame smaller.|$|E
30|$|Cu-SiO 2 {{coatings}} were {{deposited on}} 1  mm borosilicate glass (Dow Corning) using flame assisted {{chemical vapour deposition}} (FACVD). The FACVD system was of in-house design and construction and consisted of a brass <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> above a translational stage and a precursor delivery system of ultrasonic nebuliser, bubbler and mass flow controllers (Cook et al., 2011). Tetraethylorthosilicate was carried to the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> using a nitrogen flow rate of 0.5 lmin- 1 from a heated and stirred bubbler (75 °C[*]±[*] 3 °C, stirred at 120  rpm). An aqueous solution of copper sulphate (0.25  M) {{was used as the}} copper precursor and simultaneously delivered to the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> by ultrasonically nebulising the aqueous solution prior to carriage by nitrogen at 0.6 lmin- 1. The number of passes under the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> was 6 equating to a residence time in the flame of approximately 12  sec and gave a film approx 25  nm thick.|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{technologies}} {{allow for the}} reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from the combustion sources of fossil fuels. One such technology {{is based on the}} use of hydrogen or hydrogen-enriched fuels and allows for a significant reduction of CO 2 emissions. All regulated pollutant emissions, except for harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx), can also be reduced using hydrogen. Hydrogen’s unique properties are challenging for burner designers. High hydrogen-air flame temperatures and flame speeds result in increased NOx emissions and significant changes in flame shape compared with conventional fuels. A novel burner concept employing partially premixed combustion and flame stabilization on a conical bluff body is here proposed to address some of these challenges. In this study a laboratory-scale burner which can operate with methane, hydrogenenriched methane and pure hydrogen has been studied. The burner performance and pollutant emissions were found to depend on factors such as fuel composition, thermal load, excess air and the burner design parameters. Particular burner operation settings affected near-burner aerodynamics and consequently NOx emissions. In more detail, {{it was found that the}} flow past the bluff body <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> exhibited vortex shedding contributing to enhanced fuel-air mixing and formed a recirculation zone behind the <b>burner</b> <b>head.</b> Flame presence increased turbulent kinetic energy production near the shear layer of the recirculation zone. The burner operated within the highly turbulent flow regime and significant turbulent kinetic energy was contained at the small scales of the flow. The burner operation was controlled by two parameters: position of the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> and the fuel split between primary and secondary fuel ports. When the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> was shifted upstream, NOx emissions were reduced for all fuels tested and the position of the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> was an important parameter for the reduction of NOx emissions. This was attributed to shortened residence time in the high-temperature zone, enhanced fuel-air mixing and an increase in the amount of furnace flue gas entrained into the combustion zone. The <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> shifted upstream also resulted in lower flame stability and increased carbon monoxide emissions. Influence of the secondary fuel stream on the flow field and NOx emissions was relatively complex and affected by the remaining burner operation settings. Generally, NOx emissions increased when more fuel was provided to the burner through the secondary fuel ports. Some exceptions were observed and the secondary fuel fraction helped in reduction of NOx emissions from hydrogen combustion at low burner thermal loads. Depending on the mixing and the velocities in the burner, the secondary fuel may have penetrated the recirculation zone and the hot combustion products in this zone, what could have led to flame extinction. NOx emissions were largely dependent on the fuel composition. More hydrogen in the methane-hydrogen mixture resulted in higher NOx emissions. This is attributed to higher peak flame temperatures enhancing NOx formation via the thermal mechanism. Another factor was the furnace temperature. At higher furnace temperatures the radiative heat losses from the flame were reduced and consequently NOx emissions increased. Excess air could be used to suppress increase of NOx emissions, but it was only effective for methane and methane-hydrogen mixtures containing low fractions of hydrogen. It is believed that this effect was associated with the flame shape, which changed significantly between methane and hydrogen at given burner operation settings. Shorter and wider flames were characteristic for hydrogen combustion. The burner was capable of firing methane, hydrogen and mixtures of both of these fuels, but its operational settings had to be carefully chosen for each of these fuels in order to ensure safe burner operation and low NOx emissions. Empirical models developed on the basis of statistically cognizant experimental design allowed for NOx emissions prediction in a wide range of operating conditions. At the most promising burner operation settings and furnace temperatures of 1050 - 1150 °C, NOx emissions equivalent to 26 and 66 ppmvd at 3...|$|E

40|$|The {{residential}} {{oil burner}} market is currently {{dominated by the}} pressure-atomized, retention <b>head</b> <b>burner.</b> At low firing rates pressure atomizing nozzles suffer rapid fouling of the small internal passages, leading to bad spray patterns and poor combustion performance. To overcome the low input limitations of conventional burners, a low pressure air-atomized burner has been developed watch can operate at fining rates as low as 0. 25 gallons of oil per hour (10 kW). In addition, the burner can be operated in a high/low fining rate mode. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at a fixed input rate of 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination. At the test home, instrumentation was installed to measure fuel and energy flows and record trends in system temperatures. Laboratory efficiency testing with water heaters and boilers has been completed using standard single purpose and combined appliance test procedures. The tests quantify benefits due to low firing rates and other burner features. A two stage oil burner gains a strong advantage in rated efficiency while maintaining capacity for high domestic hot water and space heating loads...|$|R
40|$|Particulates {{and complex}} organic {{mixtures}} were sampled from the exhaust of a flame retention <b>head</b> residential oil <b>burner</b> combusting No. 2 fuel oil at three firing conditions: continuous at Bacharach Smoke No. 1, and cyclic (5 min on, 10 min off) at Smoke Nos. 1 and 5. The complex mixtures were recovered by successive Soxhlet extraction of filtered particulates and XAD- 2 sorbent resin with methylene chloride (DCM) and then methanol (MeOH). Bacterial mutagenicity [see Paper II (8) ] {{was found in}} the DCM extractables. Samples of DCM extracts from the two cyclic firing conditions and of the raw fuel were separated by gravity column chromatography on alumina. The resulting fractions were further characterized by a range of instrumental methods. Average yields of both unextracted particulates and of DCM extractables, normalized to a basis of per unit weight of fuel fired, were lower for continuous firing than for cyclic firing. For cyclic firing, decreasing the smoke number lowered the particulates emissions but only slightly reduced the average yield of DCM extractables. These and similar observations, here reported for two other oil burners, show that adjusting the burner to a lower smoke number has little effect on, or may actually increase, emissions of organic extractables of potential public health interest. Modifications of the burner firing cycle aimed at approaching continuous operation offer promise for reducing the amount of complex organic emissions. Unburned fuel accounted for roughly half of the DCM extractables from cyclic firing of the flame retention <b>head</b> <b>burner</b> at high and low smoke number. Large (i. e., greater than 3 ring) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were not observed in the DCM extractables from cyclic firing. However, nitroaromatics, typified by alkylated nitronaphthalenes, alkyl-nitrobiphenyls, and alkyl-nitrophenanthrenes were found in a minor subfraction containing {{a significant portion of the}} total mutagenic activity of the cyclic low smoke samples (8). Oxygen-containing PAH, typified by phenalene- 1 -one and its alkyl derivatives, are important mutagens from cyclic firing at high smoke conditions. Thus, oil burner effluents differ markedly from those of several other combustors, including the automotive diesel engine, where multiring PAH, typified by fluoranthene and alkylated phenanthrenes, account for a significant portion of the effluent mutagenicity. Implications for combustion and emissions source identification are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The use of hydrogen-rich fuels may be {{challenging}} for burner designers due to unique properties of hydrogen compared to conventional fuels such as natural gas. Burner retrofit {{may be required}} to use hydrogen-enriched fuels in combustion systems that are designed for natural gas combustion. This study aimed to experimentally investigate NOx emissions from a novel low NOx burner fueled by methane-hydrogen mixtures. The burner was tested in a cylindrical combustion chamber at atmospheric pressure. Burner thermal load of 25 kW (LHV) and air-fuel equivalence ratio of 1. 15 were maintained throughout the experimental campaign. The influence of burner design parameters on NOx emissions was tested for various fuel compositions using a statistically cognizant experimental design. The study revealed that shifting the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> upstream can deliver NOx emission reduction. In contrast, supplying fuel to the burner through secondary fuel ports increases NOx emissions, particularly when the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> is shifted upstream.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of various factors on nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions of a low NOx burner is investigated using a central composite design (CCD) approach to an experimental matrix {{in order to show}} the applicability of design of experiments methodology to the combustion field. Four factors have been analyzed in terms of their impact on NOx formation: hydrogen fraction in the fuel (0 %– 15 % mass fraction in hydrogen-enriched methane), amount of excess air (5 %– 30 %), <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> position (20 – 25 mm from the burner throat) and secondary fuel fraction provided to the burner (0 %– 6 %). The measurements were performed at a constant thermal load equal to 25 kW (calculated based on lower heating value). Response surface methodology and CCD were used to develop a second-degree polynomial regression model of the burner NOx emissions. The significance of the tested factors over their respective ranges has been evaluated using the analysis of variance and by the consideration of the coefficients of the model equation. Results show that hydrogen addition to methane leads to increased NOx emissions in comparison to emissions from pure methane combustion. Hydrogen content in a fuel is the strongest factor affecting NOx emissions among all the factors tested. Lower NOx formation because of increased excess air was observed when the burner was fuelled by pure methane, but this effect diminished for hydrogen-rich fuel mixtures. NOx emissions were slightly reduced when the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> was shifted closer to the burner outer tube, whereas a secondary fuel stream provided to the burner was found to have no impact on NOx emissions over the investigated range of factors.

6000|$|The {{stories of}} which we are {{speaking}} were first told in Iceland, perhaps from 950 to 1100 B.C. When Norway and Sweden were still heathen, a thousand years ago, they were possessed by families of noble birth, owning no master, and often at war with each other, when the men were not sailing the seas, to rob and kill in Scotland, England, France, Italy, and away east as far as Constantinople, or farther. Though they were wild sea robbers and warriors, they were sturdy farmers, great shipbuilders; every man of them, however wealthy, could be his own carpenter, smith, shipwright, and ploughman. They forged their own good short swords, hammered their own armour, ploughed their own fields. In short, they lived like Odysseus, the hero of Homer, and were equally skilled in the arts of war and peace. They were mighty lawyers, too, and had a most curious and minute system of laws on all subjects--land, marriage, murder, trade, and so forth. These laws were not written, though the people had a kind of letters called runes. But they did not use them much for documents, but merely for carving a name on a sword- blade, or a tombstone, or on great gold rings such as they wore on their arms. Thus the laws existed in the memory and judgment of the oldest and wisest and most righteous men of the country. The most important was the law of murder. If one man slew another, he was not tried by a jury, but any relation of the dead killed him [...] "at sight," [...] wherever he found him. Even in an Earl's hall, Kari struck the head off one of his friend Njal's <b>Burners,</b> and the <b>head</b> bounded on the board, among the trenchers of meat and the cups of mead or ale. But it was possible, if the relations of a slain man consented, for the slayer to pay his price--every man was valued at so much--and then revenge was not taken. But, as a rule, one revenge called for another. Say Hrut slew Hrap, then Atli slew Hrut, and Gisli slew Atli, and Kari slew Gisli, and so on till perhaps two whole families were extinct and there was peace. The gods were not offended by manslaughter openly done, but were angry with treachery, cowardice, meanness, theft, perjury, and every kind of shabbiness.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{measured}} the emissions {{from a wide}} range of heating equipment burning different fuels including several liquid fuel options, utility supplied natural gas and wood pellet resources. The major effort was placed on generating a database for the mass emission rate of fine particulates (PM 2. 5) for the various fuel types studied. The fine particulates or PM 2. 5 (less than 2. 5 microns in size) were measured using a dilution tunnel technique following the method described in US EPA CTM- 039. The PM 2. 5 emission results are expressed in several units for the benefit of scientists, engineers and administrators. The measurements of gaseous emissions of O{sub 2 }, CO{sub 2 }, CO, NO{sub x} and SO{sub 2 } were made using a combustion analyzer based on electrochemical cells These measurements are presented for each of the residential heating systems tested. This analyzer also provides a steady state efficiency based on stack gas and temperature measurements and these values are included in the report. The gaseous results are within the ranges expected from prior emission studies with the enhancement of expanding these measurements to fuels not available to earlier researchers. Based on measured excess air levels and ultimate analysis of the fuel's chemical composition the gaseous emission results are as expected and fall within the range provided for emission factors contained in the US-EPA AP 42, Emission Factors Volume I, Fifth Edition. Since there were no unexpected findings in these gaseous measurements, the bulk of the report is centered on the emissions of fine particulates, or PM 2. 5. The fine particulate (PM 2. 5) results for the liquid fuel fired heating systems indicate a very strong linear relationship between the fine particulate emissions and the sulfur content of the liquid fuels being studied. This is illustrated by the plot contained in the first figure on the next page which clearly illustrates the linear relationship between the measured mass of fine particulate per unit of energy, expressed as milligrams per Mega-Joule (mg/MJ) versus the different sulfur contents of four different heating fuels. These were tested in a conventional cast iron boiler equipped with a flame retention <b>head</b> <b>burner.</b> The fuels included a typical ASTM No. 2 fuel oil with sulfur below 0. 5 percent (1520 average ppm S), an ASTM No. 2 fuel oil with very high sulfur content (5780 ppm S), low sulfur heating oil (322 ppm S) and an ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (11 ppm S). Three additional oil-fired heating system types were also tested with normal heating fuel, low sulfur and ultralow sulfur fuel. They included an oil-fired warm air furnace of conventional design, a high efficiency condensing warm air furnace, a condensing hydronic boiler and the conventional hydronic boiler as discussed above. The linearity in the results was observed with all of the different oil-fired equipment types (as shown in the second figure on the next page). A linear regression of the data resulted in an Rsquared value of 0. 99 indicating that a very good linear relationship exits. This means that as sulfur decreases the PM 2. 5 emissions are reduced in a linear manner within the sulfur content range tested. At the ultra low sulfur level (15 ppm S) the amount of PM 2. 5 had been reduced dramatically to an average of 0. 043 mg/MJ. Three different gas-fired heating systems were tested. These included a conventional in-shot induced draft warm air furnace, an atmospheric fired hydronic boiler and a high efficiency hydronic boiler. The particulate (PM 2. 5) measured ranged from 0. 011 to 0. 036 mg/MJ. depending on the raw material source used in their manufacture. All three stoves tested were fueled with premium (low ash) wood pellets obtained in a single batch to provide for uniformity in the test fuel. Unlike the oil and gas fired systems, the wood pellet stoves had measurable amounts of particulates sized above the 2. 5 -micron size that defines fine particulates (less than 2. 5 microns). The fine particulate emissions rates ranged from 22 to 30 mg/ MJ with an average value of 25 mg/MJ for the three stoves tested...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hydrogen}} addition on a lean non-premixed natural gas swirl-stabilized ﬂame were investigated. Fuel mixtures containing a volumetric fraction of hydrogen ranging from 0 % up to 100 % were burnt at ambient pressure with swirled air within a quartz chamber in a co-ﬂow conﬁguration. Tests {{were carried out}} keeping {{the sum of the}} volumetric fuels ﬂow rate constant; thus, the fuel mixture mass ﬂow rate, input thermal power and equivalence ratio decreased as hydrogen fraction was increased. The use of hydrogen-enriched natural gas mixtures allowed the burner to operate at overall leaner stable conditions as compared to the case of burning natural gas only; however, an increase in soot, NO x and CO has also been observed. The ﬂame structure was analyzed by still-color photographs and laser sheet visualization; laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and thermocouples were used to analyze the ﬂow ﬁeld and temperature distributions. Measurements of CO and NO x were obtained by probing the exhaust gases and using gas analyzers, while soot was directly identiﬁed by the yellow luminosity in the ﬂame photographs and estimated through spectral analysis of spontaneous ﬂame emission. The present results revealed that hydrogen addition produced: (1) a shorter and narrowed blue ﬂame located closer to the <b>burner</b> <b>head,</b> (2) a central highly luminous yellow plume extending above the visible blue zone, (3) a deeper fuel jet penetration inside the recirculating bubble, and (4) a monotonic increase of both CO and NO x emissions for H 2 fractions ranging from 0 % up to 80 %. The latter behavior may be due to quenching of CO oxidation, related to the reduction {{in the size of the}} reaction zone, while the temperature increase observed near the ﬂame front and close to the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> promote the thermal NO x production. The experimental results revealed that hydrogen addition extended the stability limits of a conventional natural gas non-premixed burner and evidenced a signiﬁcant change in both the ﬂame structure and the ﬂow ﬁeld. Improved fuel mixture injection strategies should be explored to improve mixing and minimize pollutant production, without affecting ﬂame stability...|$|E

The synthesized powders were characterized using standard techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, BET etc., in order to determine the crystallite size, phase content, morphology, particle size and degree of agglomeration. The influences of gas flow rates on the powder characteristics are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{millisecond}} wide sub-breakdown pulsed voltage-current induced flow perturbation has been measured in premixed laminar atmospheric pressure propane/air flame. The flame equivalence ratios were varied from 0. 8 to 1. 2 {{with the flow}} speeds near 1. 1 [*]meter/second. Spatio-temporal flame structure changes were observed through collection of CH (A-X) and OH (A-X) chemiluminescence and simultaneous spontaneous Raman scattering from N 2. This optical collection scheme allows us to obtain {{a strong correlation between}} the measured gas temperature and the chemiluminescence intensity, verifying that chemiluminescence images provide accurate measurements of flame reaction zone structure modifications. The experimental results suggest that the flame perturbation is caused by ionic wind originating only from the radial positive space-charge distribution in/near the cathode fall. A net momentum transfer acts along the annular space discharge distribution in the reaction zone at or near the cathode fall which modifies the flow field near the cathodic <b>burner</b> <b>head.</b> This radially inward directed body force appears to enhance mixing similar to a swirl induced modification of the flame structure. The flame fluidic response exhibit a strong dependence on the voltage pulse width ≤ 10 millisecond...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to characterize the operation of a fan powered infrared burner (PIR burner) at various gas compositions and ambient conditions and develop design guidelines for appliances containing PIR burners for satisfactory performance. The fan powered infrared burner is a technology introduced more recently in the residential and commercial markets. It is a surface combustor that elevates {{the temperature of the}} <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> to a radiant condition. A variety of metallic and ceramic materials are used for the burner heads. It has been demonstrated that infrared burners produce low CO and NO{sub x} emissions in a controlled geometric space. This project consists of both experimental research and numerical analysis. To conduct the experiments, an experimental setup has been developed and installed in the Combustion Laboratory at Clerk Atlanta University (CAU). This setup consists of a commercial deep fat fryer that has been modified to allow in-situ radiation measurements {{on the surface of the}} infrared burner via a view port installed on the side wall of the oil vat. Proper instrumentation including fuel/air flow rate measurement, exhaust gas emission measurement, and radiation measurement has been developed. The project is progressing well. The scheduled tasks for this period of time were conducted smoothly. Specifically: 1. Baseline experimental study at CAU has been completed. The data are now under detailed analysis and will be reported in next quarterly report. 2. Theoretical formulation and analysis of the PIR burner performance model are continuing. Preliminary results have been obtained...|$|E
40|$|The thermo-acoustic {{instability}} {{arising out}} of coupling between the pressure fluctuation and the unsteady heat release, when grows sufficiently, is known to cause serious structural damage thereby reducing {{the life span of}} systems having combustor for example, jet engines, gas turbines and industrial burners. The present work involves experimental study of thermo-acoustic instabilities occurring in a Rijke tube and their suppression by means of diverting a very small fraction of the incoming air flow in the form of radial injection from the wall of the tube through micro jets. A horizontal quartz tube with pre-mixed burner is used as the test model of Rijke tube. The coefficient Rayleigh Index (RI) is estimated from simultaneous measurement of chemiluminescence using a PMT and pressure in the plane of <b>burner</b> <b>head.</b> Experiments were carried out at the equivalence ratio of phi = 1 for a range of the burner position inside the tube, velocity of micro jets, and total mass flow rate through the tube. The control technique of micro jets was found to completely suppress the thermo-acoustics in a range of jet velocity depending on the burner position and the total air mass flow rate. For complete suppression of the thermos-acoustics, the phase difference between the pressure and chemiluminescence waves was found to significantly increase and the RI was found to reduce to nearly zero. In such case, the flame luminescence was observed to significantly reduce. The proposed technique of air injection into the flame through radial micro jets is simple yet very effective in controlling the thermos-acoustic instability. (C) 2016 Energy Institute.

40|$|The {{development}} of advanced oil burner concepts {{has long been}} a part of Brookhaven National Laboratory`s (BNL) oil heat research program. Generally, goals of this work include: increased system efficiency, reduced emissions of soot and NO{sub x}, and the practical extension of the firing rate range of current burners to lower input rates. The report describes the results of a project at BNL aimed at the {{development of}} air atomized burners. Two concepts are discussed. The first is an air atomizer which uses air supplied at pressures ranging from 10 to 20 psi and requiring the integration of an air compressor in the system. The second, more novel, approach involves the use of a low-pressure air atomizing nozzle which requires only 8 - 14 inches of water air pressure for fuel atomization. This second approach requires the use of a fan in the burner instead of a compressor although the fan pressure is higher than with conventional, pressure atomized retention head burners. In testing the first concept, high pressure air atomization, a conventional retention head burner was modified to accept the new nozzle. In addition, the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> was modified to reduce the flow area to maintain roughly 1 inch of water pressure drop across the head at a firing rate of 0. 25 gallons of oil per hour. The burner ignited easily and could be operated at low excess air levels without smoke. The major disadvantage of this burner approach is the need for the air compressor as part of the system. In evaluating options, a vane-type compressor was selected although the use of a compressor of this type will lead to increased burner maintenance requirements...|$|E
40|$|This work focuses {{upon the}} effects of DC {{electric}} fields on the stability of downward propagating atmospheric pressure premixed propane–air flames under experimental conditions that provide close coupling of the electric field to the flame. With the appropriate electrode geometry, modest applied voltages are shown to drive a stable conical flame first into a wrinkled-laminar flamelet geometry, and then further toward either a highly unstable distributed flamelet regime or a collective oscillation of the flame front. Applied potentials up through + 5 kV over a 40 -mm gap encompassing the flame front {{have been used to}} force the above transition sequence in flames with equivalence ratios between 0. 8 and 1. 3 and flow velocities up to 1. 7 m/s. Experiments are reported that characterize the field-induced changes in the geometry of the reaction zone and the structure of the resulting unstable flame. The former is quantified by combustion intensity enhancement estimates derived from high-speed two-dimensional direct and spectroscopic imaging of chemiluminescence signals. The flame fluid mechanical response to the applied field, brought about by forcing positive flame ions counter to the flow, drives the effective flame Lewis number to values suitable for the onset of the thermodiffusive instability, even near stoichiometric conditions. Possible field-driven flame ion recombination chemistry that would produce light reactants near the <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> and precipitate the onset of the thermodiffusive instability is proposed. Electrical measurements are also reported that establish that minimal electrical power input is required to produce the observed flame instabilities. Current continuity-based calculations allow estimates of the level of deficient light reactant necessary to cause the flame to become unstable. This applied-electric-field-induced modification of the thermodiffusive effect could serve as a potentially attractive means of controlling flame fluid-mechanical characteristics and validating combustion instability models over a wide range of equivalence ratios...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} {{for the design}} of a {{residential}} oil burner is presented involving a low pressure, air atomizing nozzle. Advantages of this approach, relative to conventional, pressure atomized burners include: ability to operate at very low excess air levels without smoke, ability to operate at low (and possibly variable) rates, reduced boiler fouling, and low NO{sub x}. The nozzle used is a low pressure, airblast atomizer which can achieve fuel spray drop sizes similar to conventional nozzles and very good combustion performance with air pressure as low as 5 inches of water (1. 24 kPa). A <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> has been developed for this nozzle and combustion test results are presented {{in a wide variety of}} equipment including cast iron and steel boilers, warm air furnaces, and water heaters over the firing rate range 0. 25 gph to 1. 0 gph (10 to 41 kW). Beyond the nozzle and combustion head the burner system must be developed and two approaches have been taken. The first involves a small, brushless DC motor/fan combination which uses high fan speed to achieve air pressures from 7 to 9 inches of water (1. 74 to 2. 24 kPa). Fuel is delivered to the atomizer at less than 1 psig (6. 9 kPa) using a solenoid pump and flow metering orifice. At 0. 35 gph (14 kW) the electric power draw of this burner is less than 100 watts. In a second configuration a conventional motor is used with a single stage fan which develops 5 to 6 inches of water pressure (1. 24 to 1. 50 kPa) at similar firing rates. This burner uses a conventional type fuel pump and metering orifice to deliver fuel. The fuel pump is driven by the fan motor, very much like a conventional burner. This second configuration is seen as more attractive to the heating industry and is now being commercialized. Field tests with this burner have been conducted at 0. 35 gph (14 kW) with a side-wall vented boiler/water storage tank combination...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} technical advances made to {{the concept}} of a low pressure, air atomized oil burner for home heating applications. Currently all oil burners on the market are of the pressure atomized, retention head type. These burners have a lower firing rate limit of about 0. 5 gallons per hour of oil, due to reliability problems related to small flow passage sizes. High pressure air atomized burners {{have been shown to be}} one route to avoid this problem but air compressor cost and reliability have practically eliminated this approach. With the low pressure air atomized burner the air required for atomization can be provided by a fan at 5 - 8 inches of water pressure. A burner using this concept, termed the Fan-Atomized Burner or ''FAB'' has been developed and is currently being commercialized. In the head of the FAB, the combustion air is divided into three parts, much like a conventional retention head burner. This report describes development work on a new concept in which 100 % of the air from the fan goes through the atomizer. The primary advantage of this approach is a great simplification of the head design. A nozzle specifically sized for this concept was built and is described in the report. Basic flow pressure tests, cold air velocity profiles, and atomization performance have been measured. A burner head/flame tube has been developed which promotes a toroidal recirculation zone near the nozzle for flame stability. The <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> has been tested in several furnace and boiler applications over the firing rate range 0. 2 to 0. 28 gallons per hour. In all cases the burner can operate with very low excess air levels (under 10 %) without producing smoke. Flue gas NO{sub x} concentration varied from 42 to 62 ppm at 3 % O{sub 2 }. The concept is seen as having significant potential and planned development efforts are discussed...|$|E
40|$|On the {{way towards}} a low {{emission}} combustion a possible solution {{seems to be}} the use of leaner fuel mixtures. But the main problem occurring at full power conditions are the thermo-acoustic combustion oscillations which can not be tolerated. In order to examine the reasons for that problem we applied two different measurement techniques – DGV and OH* imaging – to an industrial sized combustion chamber operating at atmospheric pressure conditions. For the DGV measurements in hot environments the biggest challenge is to overcome the strong background luminosity. Therefore we applied a self-developed pulse laser system with suitable DGV characteristics such as high power (1 mJ), narrow bandwidth (< 1 MHz) and frequency stability (single-mode operation) together with a gated camera system. To record phase resolved measurements we extracted a trigger signal from the output of a piezo pressure transducer placed in front of the burner outlet. Another important aspect of applying the DGV technique is the addition of seeding particles to the flow. Therefore we used AlO-powder in a solid particle seeding generator which contains a sintered glass filter and a stirring device. Three light sheets were guided through small slits from the sidewalls into the measurement area. A cooled endoscope was mounted inside the combustor looking directly onto the <b>burner</b> <b>head.</b> With this arrangement we obtained all three velocity components for stationary conditions and for different phase angles during an oscillation cycle. The results show that under stationary conditions the flow field is nearly rotational symmetrically with a distinct recirculation zone. In contrast to the stationary flow the phase resolved measurements revealed a drastic change from a combustion with recirculation to a complete forward directed flow depending on the phase angle. In addition to this flow field measurements we recorded heat release images. The underlying principle of this technique is the use of the chemical excitation of the OH-radical as an indicator of the heat release. This is a simple imaging technique which uses only an intensified CCD-camera together with a wavelength filter permeable for OH* fluorescence. We examined the transition from stationary conditions to combustion oscillations with the help of those heat release images. During combustion oscillations the maximum of the heat release is connected {{to the development of a}} maximum velocity gradient between the recirculation zone and the outer swirled flow. The minimum of the heat release corresponds to a complete forward directed flow with a vanishing recirculation zone. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to engineer, design, fabricate, and field demonstrate a Boiler Burner Energy System Technology (BBEST) that integrates a low-cost, clean burning, gas-fired simple-cycle (unrecuperated) 100 kWe (net) microturbine (SCMT) with a new ultra low-NOx gas-fired burner (ULNB) into one compact Combined Heat and Power (CHP) product that can be retrofit on new and existing industrial and commercial boilers in place of conventional burners. The Scope of Work for this project was segmented into two principal phases: (Phase I) Hardware development, assembly and pre-test and (Phase II) Field installation and demonstration testing. Phase I was divided into five technical tasks (Task 2 to 6). These tasks covered the engineering, design, fabrication, testing and optimization of each key component of the CHP system principally, ULNB, SCMT, assembly BBEST CHP package, and integrated controls. Phase I work culminated with the laboratory testing of the completed BBEST assembly prior to shipment for field installation and demonstration. Phase II consisted of two remaining technical tasks (Task 7 and 8), which focused on the installation, startup, and field verification tests at a pre-selected industrial plant to document performance and attainment of all project objectives. Technical direction and administration was under the management of CMCE, Inc. Altex Technologies Corporation lead the design, assembly and testing of the system. Field demonstration was supported by Leva Energy, the commercialization firm founded by executives at CMCE and Altex. Leva Energy has applied for patent protection on the BBEST process under the trade name of Power Burner and holds the license for the burner currently used in the product. The commercial term Power Burner is used throughout this report {{to refer to the}} BBEST technology proposed for this project. The project was co-funded by the California Energy Commission and the Southern California Gas Company (SCG), a division of Sempra Energy. These match funds were provided via concurrent contracts and investments available via CMCE, Altex, and Leva Energy The project attained all its objectives and is considered a success. CMCE secured the support of GI&E from Italy to supply 100 kW Turbec T- 100 microturbines for the project. One was purchased by the project’s subcontractor, Altex, and a second spare was purchased by CMCE under this project. The microturbines were then modified to convert from their original recuperated design to a simple cycle configuration. Replacement low-NOx silo combustors were designed and bench tested in order to achieve compliance with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) 2007 emission limits for NOx and CO when in CHP operation. The converted microturbine was then mated with a low NOx burner provided by Altex via an integration section that allowed flow control and heat recovery to minimize combustion blower requirements; manage burner turndown; and recover waste heat. A new fully integrated control system was designed and developed that allowed one-touch system operation in all three available modes of operation: (1) CHP with both microturbine and burner firing for boiler heat input greater than 2 MMBtu/hr; (2) <b>burner</b> <b>head</b> only (BHO) when the microturbine is under service; and (3) microturbine only when boiler heat input requirements fall below 2 MMBtu/hr. This capability resulted in a burner turndown performance of nearly 10 / 1, a key advantage for this technology over conventional low NOx burners. Key components were then assembled into a cabinet with additional support systems for generator cooling and fuel supply. System checkout and performance tests were performed in the laboratory. The assembled system and its support equipment were then shipped and installed at a host facility where final performance tests were conducted following efforts to secure fabrication, air, and operating permits. The installed power burner is now in commercial operation and has achieved all the performance goals...|$|E
