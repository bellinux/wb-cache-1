40|$|In current {{viticulture}} {{protection of}} grapevine is obtained with uniform distribution of fungicides, typically repeated according a regular calendar. This continuous protection approach can easily result in {{ten to fifteen}} treatments per season in vineyards of several wine-producing regions. Primary infections exhibit nevertheless discrete foci, with uneven spatial distribution. Hence {{it can be argued}} that detection of symptoms at early disease stages and their targeted treatment would reduce the spread of the infection to wider patches in the vineyard, while enabling reduced use of pesticides. Within the UE-project CROPS, a modular and multifunctional agricultural robot system for specialty crops is being developed and one of the tasks that has to accomplished is selective spraying of diseases. The robotic system setup integrates a six degrees of freedom manipulator, an optical sensor system and a precision <b>spraying</b> <b>actuator.</b> After a brief description of the requirements of the system, this contribution gives a detailed description of its components and discusses the results obtained in first experiments. As case study we consider here the automatic detection and selective spraying of grapevine canopy areas exhibiting symptoms of powdery mildew (Erysiphe necator), one of the major diseases for this crop. Based on optical sensing feedback, the precision <b>spraying</b> <b>actuator</b> is positioned by the manipulator to selectively and accurately apply pesticides solely to infected areas. Disease foci identification and localization is based on on-the-go processing of images sensed by a multispectral camera inspecting the vertical structure of the grapevine canopy. At the end of the manipulator arm is located the precision <b>spraying</b> <b>actuator,</b> constituted by an axial fan with a flow straightener and an axially mounted spraying nozzle. The sprayer can deliver an air-carrier flow with an adjustable velocity, producing a circular spraying pattern of a constant diameter of 0. 15 m over a wide range of spraying distances. A first experiment was conducted in an experimental greenhouse, where vineyard canopy conditions were recreated by aligning plants of grapevine grown in pots. Within the recreated canopy, diseased plants with different levels of disease symptoms were used as targets of automated selective spraying performed by the agricultural robot. The results of these experiments are discussed in view of a possible intelligent, close precision crop protection framework...|$|R

A multi-cycle three-dimensional engine simulation program has been developed and applied to study the effect of injection on in-cylinder mixing and CAI combustion.

40|$|In sprays {{theoretical}} characterization, {{a difficult}} {{step is to}} find the most likely drops size probability distribution with respect to the known mean diameter and the type of atomization. The classical procedure consists of fitting an analytical function (for ex. Rosin-Rammler) on experimental data. Another more logical and more physical meaningful approach is to apply the maximum entropy formalism (M. E. F.), a widely used method which allows to choose among all the possible probability distributions the most suitable to the available knowledge about the phenomena. The classical M. E. F., states that, when given some information about a stochastic process (for ex., given the mean diameter of the spray), the probability distribution that agrees the best with that information is obtained by maximizing Shannon's entropy (() lniS p k p pi i =) subject to the given constraints (written in form of conservation laws). Shannon's entropy, besides other required properties, is additive. Additivity is not a necessary condition for a function to be a measure of uncertainty of a probability distribution. Several authors suggested some other non-additive (non-extensive) forms of entropy. Tsallis introduced a generalized pseudo-additive function: () ((1 / (1)) i q iT p k p q = − −. Tsallis entropy is applied to an increasing number of physical problems. It has been showed that generalized entropy predicts well physical systems involving long-range interactions (anomalous diffusion, granular systems,…). Violent <b>break-up</b> in <b>sprays,</b> fragmentation with high energies, leads to long-range interactions between liquid elements. Spraying regimes where high energies are involved (high pressure or high velocity) may be well depicted by power law distributions as obtained from the Tsallis entropy. An atomizer working at low pressure will follow an exponential Shannon law but when increasing pressure the distribution tends to power Tsallis law, revealing scaling.

40|$|This thesis {{will focus}} on {{experimental}} studies of primary breakup of pressure-atomized sprays. The industrial application that this thesis will address is fuel sprays in modern Diesel engines, and so the focus will be sprays emitting into relatively slow-moving, high pressure, high-temperature gases. The density of the ambient gas {{has been shown to}} affect primary breakup more than the temperature, except in some special cases which will be covered later on in this thesis. It stands to reason, then, that the primary break-up physics of Diesel fuel sprays should be similar to sprays emitting into dense gases at room temperature. Knowledge of the primary <b>break-up</b> of Diesel <b>sprays</b> can also be gained from studies of sprays emitting into atmospheric gases, so long as the Weber number is sufficiently high. This thesis will examine experimental studies of these more simplified sprays, with an emphasis on trans-illumination imaging studies, which provide most of the understanding of primary break-up of pressure atomized sprays that currently exists.

Our {{ultimate goal is to}} improve the efficiency of killing insects while using less aerosol spray, which contains chemicals, oil, and dimethyl ether (DME). The chemical content of the aerosol is greatly reduced in the attachment region 1 - 2 m from the nozzle. Most of the oil and propellant fail to reach the target, and fall on the ground. The propellant is used to break droplets into smaller droplets and to carry them to the target. Most of the propellant’s energy is used for carrying these droplets, although the remaining droplets are very small compared to those produced at the nozzle. We investigated the droplet characteristics over the entire distance from the nozzle to the target. Here, we tested different nozzle dimensions and compared single- and double-hole nozzles. Furthermore, the effect of surfactant on the agglomeration and <b>break-up</b> of <b>spray</b> were investigated. We measured the spray characteristics near the nozzle to evaluate the droplet-forming process by examining droplet separation, agglomeration, collision, and size to elucidate the spray behavior and determine the dominant factors involved in designing and developing a nozzle for spraying insecticides most effectively.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{simulations}} of ignition and combustion of a diesel spray were conducted. The {{primary goal of}} the work was to compare two different CFD codes: OpenFOAM, an object-oriented C++ based code, and KIVA- 3 V. The spray is modelled by the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach in both codes, with several common submodels. Some important sub-models implemented include inter alia a Kelvin-Helmholtz/Rayleigh-Taylor (KH/RT) model for <b>spray</b> <b>break-up,</b> an improved <b>spray</b> collision model, and a Partially Stirred Reactor (PaSR) model for turbulence-chemistry interaction. Both CFD codes solve the chemical reaction equations in a fully coupled manner. A cubic-shaped Cartesian mesh {{was used in the}} KIVA- 3 V simulations, while a polyhedral mesh including a combination of hexagonal and prism-shaped cells was constructed for the OpenFOAM computations. The effects of high EGR and ambient temperature on the ignition and flame lift-off processes of a diesel spray were investigated. Sandia experiments conducted in a high-pressure and high-temperature constant-volume vessel were chosen for the simulations and validations. A single spray was injected into the vessel, and EGR was mimicked by reducing the oxygen concentration. The diesel reference fuel (n-heptane) was considered. For the study, a medium-size mechanism involving 83 species and 338 reactions was employed. The mechanism was validated using the CHEMKIN II package and the reaction rate constants were adjusted on the basis of measurements of auto-ignition delays of n-heptane/air mixtures in shock-tube experiments (with equivalence ratios ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 4 at 50 bar, and from 0. 5 to 2. 0 at 13. 5 bar and 41. 0 bar), laminar flame speeds (1 atm and 3 atm), and flame structure in burner-stabilized premixed flames (1 atm). The simulations demonstrate that both CFD codes are capable of spray ignition and combustion studies, though both show strong grid-dependence. The numerical results show that the ignition delay, flame lift-off and combustion temperature of the spray are strongly influenced by EGR and ambient gas temperature. These predictions are in agreement with measurements. Nevertheless, differences are observed between the results predicted by OpenFOAM and those from KIVA- 3 V, for example, the flame predicted by the former is thinner and longer than that by the latter, which requires further investigation...|$|R

40|$|A {{new model}} for fuel spray {{penetration}} (location of spray tip) is suggested and validated against available experimental data. Simple analytical expressions for fuel spray penetration are derived in two limiting cases: the initial {{stage and the}} two-phase flow regime. At the initial stage, the effects of droplet drag and entrainment of air are accounted for. In {{the case of the}} two-phase flow, it is assumed that the spray droplets have the same velocities as the entrained air. The characteristic time of droplet <b>break-up</b> in the <b>spray</b> is estimated for both bag and stripping break-up mechanisms. For realistic diesel spray parameters, the droplet break-up takes place almost immediately after the droplets leave the nozzle. This leads to a considerable shortening of the initial stage and a rapid conversion of the flow to the two-phase stage. This allows the analysis to be restricted to the two-phase flow approximation for this type of spray. The expressions for spray penetration derived in this paper give more accurate predictions compared with those suggested earlier...|$|R
40|$|By definition, {{spray drift}} is {{composed}} of applied pesticide that has failed to reach the intended target. Most sprayers treat an entire area with little consideration for or ability to adapt to target or environmental conditions. Sensing and control systems for agricultural sprayers can reduce spray drift by adjusting the spray output to focus deposition exclusively on targets, compensate for variable environmental conditions or alter the application rate in accordance with a priori knowledge of the crop or other target. Technology and techniques for such applications is generally referred to as “precision agriculture”. In this paper, the term “precision application ” refers to technologies and strategies where broadcast application of agrochemicals is replaced by targeted application and / or control of the application based on sensing of environmental conditions. Specific examples include target detection systems for field and orchard crops, droplet size and rate control systems and selective application systems that allow reduction or elimination of chemicals with potential drift concerns. Sensing and control systems can significantly reduce the applied rate of pesticide while maintaining target deposition levels necessary for efficacious pest control. Order-of- magnitude reductions can be achieved under some conditions while 25 – 50 % reductions in are present {{at the time of}} treatment. Examples include selective control of emerged weeds and foliar applications of insecticides and fungicides when crop plants are sparse or exhibit spatial non-uniformity.

The qualitative soot concentration was determined using the Laser Induced Incandescence (LII) technique both spatially and temporally at a range of test conditions. Peak soot concentration values were determined, from which a good correlation between soot concentration and injection pressure was observed. The peak soot concentration was found to correlate well with the velocity of the injected fuel jet.

40|$|The {{influence}} of containment sprays on atmosphere behaviour, a sub-task of the Work Package WP 12 - 2 CAM (Containment Atmosphere Mixing), {{has been investigated}} through benchmark exercises based on TOSQAN (IRSN) and MISTRA (CEA) experiments. These tests are being simulated with lumped-parameter (LP) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. Both atmosphere depressurization and mixing are being studied in two phases: a ‘thermalhydraulic part’, which deals with depressurization by sprays (TOSQAN 101 and MISTRA MASPn), and a ‘dynamic part’, dealing with light gas stratification <b>break-up</b> by <b>spray</b> (TOSQAN 113 and MISTRA MARC 2 b). In the thermalhydraulic part of the benchmark, participants have found the appropriate modelling to obtain good global results in terms of experimental pressure and mean gas temperature, for both TOSQAN and MISTRA tests. It can thus be considered that code users have a good knowledge of their spray modelling parameters. On a local level, for the TOSQAN test, single droplet behaviour {{is found to be}} well estimated by some calculations, but the global modelling of multiple droplets, i. e. of the spray, specifically for the spray dilution, is questionable in some CFD calculations. It can lead to some discrepancies localized in the spray region and can thus have a high impact on the global results, since most of the heat and mass transfers occur inside this region. In the MISTRA tests, wall condensation mass flow rates and local temperatures were used for code-experiment comparison and show that improvement of the local modelling, including initial conditions determination, is needed. In this dynamic part, a general result, in both tests, is that calculations do not recover the same kinetics of the mixing. Furthermore, concerning global mixing, LP contributions seem not suitable here. For the TOSQAN benchmark, the one-phase CFD calculations recover partially the phenomena involved during the mixing, whereas the two-phase flow CFD contributions generally recover the phenomena. Moreover, one important result is also that none of the contributions finds the exact amount of helium remaining in the dome above the spray nozzle in the TOSQAN 113.

This customised version of the KIVA II code was used to simulate autoignition in Diesel engines.

40|$|Lateral tape motion (LTM) is {{the motion}} of a tape {{perpendicular}} to the tape transport direction. It {{is a problem in}} magnetic tape recording technology that limits the track density on a tape. To reduce LTM, it is important to characterize the main sources of LTM in tape transports. In this dissertation, the effect of tape edge contact as well as tape tension transients on LTM is investigated. An optical non-contact tension sensor is developed and a correlation between LTM and tension transients is observed. Additionally, a method based on acoustic emission is established to measure tape edge contact. Tape edge contact is observed to cause high frequency LTM, and the magnitude of the impact is shown to be function of the tape pack size. The dynamics of a tape as it moves over a cylindrical guide are studied theoretically and validated experimentally. Good agreement between theory and experiments is observed. In the experimental analysis, the tape/guide friction coefficient is observed to be function of different operating and design parameters. A model for the friction coefficient between a tape and a cylindrical guide is presented and evaluated with experimental data. Finally, the use of laser surface texturing (LST) for improved tape guiding is proposed and investigated both experimentally and numerically. LST guides are observed to create an air bearing at low tape speeds and thus reduce the transition speed between boundary lubrication and full fluid lubrication. Additionally, the design of a dual stage <b>actuator</b> tape <b>head</b> for increased bandwidth track-following is introduced, as a means to enable increased track density on a tape for future high performance tape drive...|$|R
40|$|Models for droplet {{heating and}} evaporation: {{application}} to simulation of the autoignition process in diesel engines A review of liquid and gas phase models for fuel droplet heating and evaporation, suitable for implementation into CFD codes {{with a view}} to modelling the processes in Diesel engines, is presented. To describe properties of ‘hot’ Diesel fuel sprays, new sub-models for <b>spray</b> <b>break-up,</b> droplet heating and evaporation and Shell autoignition were implemented into the KIVA II CFD code. This customised version of the KIVA II code was used to simulate autoignition in Diesel engines. The results of simulation were shown to be consistent with in-house experimental data referring to autoignition timing at in-cylinder pressures from 5 to 9 MPa and an injection pressure of 160 MPa. The autoignition delay time is shown {{to be sensitive to the}} choice of liquid phase models for droplet heating, but not sensitive to the choice of gas phase models. It is recommended that the effective thermal conductivity liquid phase model and the gas phase model taking into account the effects of finite thickness of the thermal boundary layer are used for the simulation of the ignition process in Diesel engines. Some recent non-traditional developments of the models referring to droplet heating and evaporation are discussed. These are the model based on the coupled solution for the liquid and gas phases, the kinetic model of evaporation, and the dynamic decomposition technique for the solution of ordinary differential equations describing droplet heating and evaporation and the ignition of the fuel vapour/air mixture...|$|R
2500|$|Stepper motors can {{be rotated}} to a {{specific}} angle in discrete steps with ease, and hence stepper motors are used for read/write head positioning in computer floppy diskette drives. They {{were used for the}} same purpose in pre-gigabyte era computer disk drives, where the precision and speed they offered was adequate for the correct positioning of the read/write head of a hard disk drive. As drive density increased, the precision and speed limitations of stepper motors made them obsolete for hard drives—the precision limitation made them unusable, and the speed limitation made them uncompetitive—thus newer hard disk drives use voice coil-based <b>head</b> <b>actuator</b> systems. (The term [...] "voice coil" [...] in this connection is historic; it refers to the structure in a typical (cone type) loudspeaker. This structure was used for a while to position the heads. Modern drives have a pivoted coil mount; the coil swings back and forth, something like a blade of a rotating fan. Nevertheless, like a voice coil, modern actuator coil conductors (the magnet wire) move perpendicular to the magnetic lines of force.) ...|$|R
