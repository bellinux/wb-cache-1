The insulating phase, called topological crystalline insulator (TCI), has been intensively investigated and observed in three-dimensional materials. However, the predicted two-dimensional (2 D) {{materials with}} TCI phase are explored much less than 3 D TCIs and 2 D topological insulator, while so far considered 2 D TCIs almost exclusively possess a square lattice structure with the mirror Chern number C_M =- 2.

The Tamm states result from <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> periodic <b>crystal</b> potential at the edge, they can exist even at zero magnetic field and form a conducting band.

30|$|Ultrasonic {{radiation}} {{creates a}} mechanical turbulence {{in the medium}} irradiated. When waves cross within the matter, its particles vibrate so that the emitted energy travels through the matter parallel to the particle vibration. The matter’s inner particles are limited to {{moving back and forth}} following the wave energy. These particles find free movement within the matter. The wave energy causing particle movement disrupts the balance in the substance as it passes through. The particle of matter due to exerted force leaves its equilibrium state and displaces. This displacement is in direct proportion to the force applied to the particle and takes the form of simple harmonic motion (Fakhru’l-Razi et al. 2009). This action distorts the <b>crystals</b> <b>of</b> sodium chloride adhering to the rock and crushes the bonding energy that allows them to stick to the matrix surface. As a result, injected water can readily evacuate separated salts from the core. Another mechanical effect of ultrasonic waves is the creation of distortion in the boundaries, which raises the temperature, increasing the instability between the sodium chloride crystals and rock. Absorbed sound waves are a determinant factor for converting energy into heat in the medium. Furthermore, the friction and abrasion in the boundaries also produce heat, and cavitation is a major factor in releasing excessive heat. All these factors contribute to the heating effect of ultrasonic waves, which is a factor in <b>breaking</b> the <b>crystals</b> <b>of</b> deposited material and increasing its solubility in water. When ultrasonic waves pass through the core sample, they accelerate solubility (Xu et al. 2009). Finally, these waves increase the solubility of sodium chloride with raising temperature, destroying bonding energy and <b>breaking</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>of</b> deposit. In samples with permeability lower than 20  md, ultrasonic waves recover permeability to 80 %. In contrast, water injection alone improves permeability to 29 %. In the core samples with 30 – 100 md of permeability, ultrasonic waves restored permeability to near 42 %, compared to water injection alone, which restored it to around 18.5 %. In the core samples with a permeability range of 100 – 700 md, injection with ultrasonic waves restored permeability to around 87 % and water injection alone to 62 %. In cores with permeabilities higher than 1000 md, the ultrasonic wave could restore permeability to around 81 % while the water injection alone could restore permeability to near 77 %.|$|R

The bottom of the conduction band (BCB) is found to be constituted of a pseudo-band of molecular orbitals that resonate at the same energy on different atomic sites. They display a bonding character between the s orbitals of the metal sites and an anti-bonding character arising from the interaction between the oxygen and metal s orbitals. The energy level of the BCB shifts upon <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crystal</b> symmetry during the amorphization process, which may be attributed to the reduction of the coordination of the cationic centers. The top of the valence band (TVB) is constructed from anti-bonding oxygen p orbitals. In the amorphous state, they have random orientation, in contrast to the crystalline state. This results in the appearance of localized tail states in the forbidden gap above the TVB. Zinc is found to play a predominant role in the generation of these tail states, while gallium hinders their formation. Last, we study the dependence of the fundamental gap and effective mass of IGZO on mechanical strain. The variation of the gap under strain arises from the enhancement of the anti-bonding interaction in the BCB due to the modification of the length of the oxygen–metal bonds and/or to a variation of the cation coordination. This effect is less pronounced for the amorphous material compared to the crystalline material, making amorphous IGZO a semiconductor of choice for flexible electronics. Finally, the effective mass is found to increase upon strain, in contrast to regular materials. This counterintuitive variation is due to the reduction of the electrostatic shielding of the cationic centers by oxygen, leading to an increase of the overlaps between the metal orbitals at the origin of the delocalization of the BCB. For the range of strain typically met in flexible electronics, the induced variation in the effective mass is found to be negligible(less than 1 %). status: publishe...|$|R
