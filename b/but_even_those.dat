Other significant secret societies include Eli Banana, T.I.L.K.A., the Purple Shadows (who commemorate Jefferson's birthday shortly after dawn on the Lawn each April 13), The Sons of Liberty, and the 21 Society. Not all the secret societies keep their membership unknown, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>those</b> who don't hide their identities generally keep most of their good works and activities far from the public eye.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of China, Chinese culture has been heavily {{influenced}} by Confucianism. Credited with shaping much of Chinese thought, Confucianism was the official philosophy throughout most of Imperial China's history, institutionalizing values like filial piety, which implied the performance of certain shared rituals. Thus, villagers lavished on funeral and wedding ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors. Mastery of Confucian texts provided the primary criterion for entry into the imperial bureaucracy, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>those</b> degree-holders who did not enter the bureaucracy or who left it held increased social influence in their home areas, contributing to the homogenizing of Han Chinese culture. Other factors contributing {{to the development of}} a shared Han culture included urbanization and geographically vast but integrated commodity markets.|$|E
25|$|The Ba'ath Party of Syria, which {{advocated}} the ideologies of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism had {{clashed with the}} Muslim Brotherhood, a group with a Sunni Islamist ideology, since 1940. The two groups were opposed in important ways. The Ba'ath party was nominally secular, nationalist. The Muslim Brotherhood, like other Islamist groups, saw nationalism as un-Islamic and religion as inseparable from politics and government. Most Ba'ath party members were from humble, obscure backgrounds and favored radical economic policies, while Sunni Muslims had dominated the souqs and landed power of Syria, and tended to view government intervention in the economy as threatening. Not all Sunni notables believed in fundamentalism, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>those</b> who did not often saw the Brotherhood as a useful tool against the Ba'ath.|$|E

Regarding France's {{internal}} strife, he spared few: “You have to punish not only the traitors, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>those</b> who are indifferent; you have to punish whoever is passive in the republic, and who does nothing for it.” He thought {{the only way to}} create a true republic was to rid it of enemies, to enforce the “complete destruction of its opposite.” Regarding the war, he declared without regret to the Convention, “The vessel of the Revolution can arrive in port only on a sea reddened with torrents of blood.” He urged the deputies to embrace the notion that “a nation generates itself only upon heaps of corpses.” ...|$|E
