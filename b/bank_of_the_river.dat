5|$|Occupying a ridge on {{the west}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Nith, the {{earliest}} phase of the castle consisted of a small bailey or enclosure. This bailey was revealed by the geophysical survey in 2014 which also indicated that it contained timber buildings.|$|E
5|$|Rochester Castle {{stands on}} the east <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Medway in Rochester, Kent, South East England. The 12th-century keep or stone tower, which is the castle's most {{prominent}} feature, {{is one of the}} best preserved in England or France.|$|E
5000|$|People {{residing}} {{both side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> mingled together and this cooperation resulted in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> Irikkur village covering both <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> <b>The</b> name [...] "Irikkur" [...] {{was considered to}} be formed from the Malayalam word 'iru kara ooru' which means a village <b>of</b> both <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b>|$|R

5|$|The English had {{established}} a number of forts on the Leinster <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> including Fort Frankford and, later, Fort Falkland (see Military History). The garrison at Fort Falkland was overrun {{by the forces of}} the Confederate Catholics in 1642 but was recaptured by Cromwell's army in 1650. The Cromwellians established a new fortification on the Connacht <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> leading up to the plantation of Connacht in 1654. The castle was modified in 1817 to enable it to mount artillery with a platform for a 24-pound traversing gun constructed on its roof. Its interior became a powder magazine and housed a garrison of 20 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Wolfe's troops {{landed on}} the south <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> at Point Levis, nearly directly {{across the river from}} Quebec; an artillery battery was established there in early July that nearly levelled the lower town by bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{authorised}} in 1864, work on {{the bridge}} was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea Embankment, since the bridge's design could not be completed until the exact layout of the new roads being built on the north <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> had been agreed. While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Battersea, {{listed as}} Patricesy (St Peter's Water) in the Domesday Book and first {{mentioned}} in records of 693 AD, {{on the south}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> opposite Chelsea, was by contrast low and marshy land, prone to flooding. Conditions were ideal for farming asparagus and lavender, and a small market town grew in the area based on the asparagus and lavender industries.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the bridge}} is Bodiam railway station, the western {{terminus}} of the Kent and East Sussex Railway since 2000. On the north <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> is Bodiam Castle, built soon after 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge. Lord Curzon restored the ruins in 1919 and gave them to the National Trust six years later.

5|$|The {{settlement}} that grew to become Banagher, originated at a ford {{on the east}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Shannon. The river banks and surrounding countryside were flood-free all year round. Travellers intending to cross the Shannon converged on this point along tracks which were the forerunners of the modern roads, and a community grew at this crossing point.|$|E
5|$|The short channel splits into Newmill Channel and Reading Sewer {{a little}} further to the north, the first flowing southwards, and the second {{originally}} flowing northwards, when it was the main channel for the River Rother. A public footpath follows the eastern bank of Potman's Heath Channel, and continues along the north <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to Blackwall Bridge, where it {{becomes part of the}} Sussex Border Path, a long-distance footpath that follows the county boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} that stands {{on what is}} known locally as the Canal Bank, called Cromwell's Castle, primarily derives its current form from the Napoleonic Wars. Similar to the Martello Tower that stands opposite it, on the same <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> Cromwell's Castle was largely reconstructed as a defensive position to repel any invading fleet coming upstream towards Banagher.|$|E
