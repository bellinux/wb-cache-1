5|$|Dopamine-related {{activity}} in the <b>basal</b> ganglia can be directly measured with PET and SPECT scans. A finding of reduced dopamine-related {{activity in}} the <b>basal</b> ganglia can rule out drug-induced parkinsonism, but reduced <b>basal</b> ganglia dopamine-related activity is seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders so these scans are not reliable in distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism.|$|E
5|$|More {{recent studies}} on <b>basal</b> {{pterosaur}} hindlimb morphology seem to vindicate {{a connection to}} Scleromochlus. Like this archosaur, <b>basal</b> pterosaur lineages have plantigrade hindlimbs that show adaptations for saltation.|$|E
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of <b>basal</b> forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The <b>basal</b> forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Chaoyangsaurus is {{recovered}} {{in a more}} <b>basal</b> position than Psittacosauridae, although Chinnery's original analysis finds it within Neoceratopsia. Protoceratopsidae {{is considered to be}} the sister group of Ceratopsoidea. The fragmentary Asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a <b>basal</b> neoceratopsian or as a leptoceratopsid, most likely due to the amount of missing information. Removal of Asiaceratops stabilizes the entire cladogram.|$|E
5|$|For TSH, <b>basal</b> {{measurements}} are usually sufficient, {{as well as}} measurements of thyroxine {{to ensure that the}} pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. Prolactin can be measured by <b>basal</b> level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of hypopituitarism or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a <b>basal</b> theropod, a <b>basal</b> sauropodomorph, a <b>basal</b> saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Alcocer and Martinez {{described}} a new taxon of herrerasaurid, Sanjuansaurus. It could {{be distinguished from}} Herrerasaurus based on multiple features. In the phylogenetic analysis, Herrerasaurus, Sanjuansaurus and Staurikosaurus all were in a polytomy, and Herrerasauridae was the most primitive group of saurischian, outside Eusaurischia, Eoraptor and Guaibasaurus. In 2011, Martinez et al. described Eodromaeus, a <b>basal</b> theropod from the same formation as Herrerasaurus. In a phylogenetic analysis, Eoraptor was placed within Sauropodomorpha, Herrerasauridae was placed as the most <b>basal</b> theropods, and Eodromaeus was placed as the next most <b>basal.</b> A more recent analysis, by Bittencourt et al. (2014), placed Herrerasauridae in a polytomy with Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, with Eoraptor also being in an unresolved position. This cladogram is shown below.|$|E
5|$|In a {{revision}} of <b>basal</b> Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed {{the definition of the}} clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most <b>basal</b> taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|Media (M1-M3) – the <b>basal</b> section {{has been}} lost.|$|E
5|$|Molecular studies {{based on}} DNA {{analysis}} have suggested new relationships among mammal families {{over the last}} few years. Most of these findings have been independently validated by retrotransposon presence/absence data. Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental mammals—Afrotheria, Xenarthra and Boreoeutheria—which diverged in the Cretaceous. The relationships between these three lineages is contentious, and all three possible different hypotheses have been proposed with respect to which group is <b>basal.</b> These hypotheses are Atlantogenata (<b>basal</b> Boreoeutheria), Epitheria (<b>basal</b> Xenarthra) and Exafroplacentalia (<b>basal</b> Afrotheria). Boreoeutheria in turn contains two major lineages—Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{structures}} upon the <b>basal</b> platform underwent two consecutive construction phases during the Early Classic, except Temple 22 which underwent three phases of construction. The structures upon the <b>basal</b> platform all date to the Early Classic period and were {{laid out in a}} symmetrical arrangement over the course of three centuries. This forms the greatest concentration of pure Early Classic architecture at Tikal, using construction methods distinct from that of the major Late Classic temples around the Great Plaza. The Early Classic construction involved the complete finishing of the <b>basal</b> platform as a distinct architectural unit before the additional structures were built upon it.|$|E
5|$|Paddlefish (family Polyodontidae) are <b>basal</b> Chondrostean ray-finned fish.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} include Xenotarsosaurus from Argentina and Compsosuchus from India as <b>basal</b> abelisaurids, {{while others}} consider {{them to be}} outside Abelisauroidea. The French Genusaurus and Tarascosaurus have also been called abelisaurids but both are fragmentary and may be more <b>basal</b> ceratosaurians.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve {{is derived from}} the <b>basal</b> plate of the embryonic spinal segments C1–C6.|$|E
5|$|The <b>basal</b> ganglia are a {{group of}} {{interconnected}} structures in the forebrain. The primary function of the <b>basal</b> ganglia appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory signals to {{all parts of the}} brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the <b>basal</b> ganglia.|$|E
5|$|The <b>basal</b> ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The <b>basal</b> ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the <b>basal</b> ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the <b>basal</b> ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the <b>basal</b> ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (dysphagia).|$|E
5|$|The genus Chrysiridia {{is entirely}} African {{and the only}} other species in the genus is the East African C. croesus. Chrysiridia {{is one of three}} diurnal uraniine genera. The other two genera are Urania, its sister taxon, and Alcides, the most <b>basal.</b> In the group, the use of Endospermum is an ancestral state (a plesiomorphy). The more <b>basal</b> Alcides feed on Endospermum and Omphalea, while Urania and Chrysiridia feed only on Omphalea.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nucleus {{is derived}} from the <b>basal</b> plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata.|$|E
5|$|This {{debate is}} still ongoing; at this time, Scelidosaurus is {{considered}} to be either more closely related to ankylosaurids than to stegosaurids and, by extension, a true ankylosaur, or <b>basal</b> to the ankylosaur-stegosaur split. The stegosaur classification has fallen out of favor, but is seen in older dinosaur books. Cladistic analyses have invariably recovered a <b>basal</b> position for Scelidosaurus, outside of the Eurypoda.|$|E
5|$|Though clearly forelimb-based launchers, <b>basal</b> pterosaurs have hindlimbs well {{adapted for}} hopping, {{suggesting}} {{a connection with}} archosaurs such as Scleromochlus.|$|E
5|$|Yates and Warren {{also named}} Dvinosauria, a clade of small aquatic temnospondyls from the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic. They placed Dvinosauria within Limnarchia, but more recent studies {{disagree}} on their position. For example, a 2007 study places {{them even more}} <b>basal</b> than euskelians, while a 2008 study keeps them as <b>basal</b> limnarchians.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 study {{suggested}} the genus Pereskia was <b>basal</b> within the Cactaceae, but confirmed earlier suggestions {{it was not}} monophyletic, i.e., did not include all the descendants of a common ancestor. The Bayesian consensus cladogram from this study is shown below.|$|E
5|$|A later 1994 {{study by}} Novas instead {{classified}} Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas {{found that the}} primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor <b>basal</b> to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, {{and found that it}} was much more likely that Herrerasaurus was a <b>basal</b> saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae <b>basal</b> to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, and found that Herrerasauridae was <b>basal</b> to Eusaurischia.|$|E
5|$|A later {{study by}} paleontologists Andrew B. Heckert and Spencer G. Lucas in 1999 {{expanded}} {{the number of}} synapomorphies that diagnose Aetosauria to 18. New synapomorphies included temporal fenestrae, or holes, that opened {{on the side of}} the skull rather than the top, lateral osteoderms articulating with the paramedians, and osteoderms covering the limbs. Aetosaurus was still found to be the most <b>basal</b> member, but the phylogeny of more derived aetosaurs differed in that Typothorax and Paratypothorax were split into two different clades with their sister taxa being Desmatosuchus and Longosuchus, respectively. More importantly, a new aetosaur called Coahomasuchus was included in the analysis. Coahomasuchus was found to be a <b>basal</b> aetosaur closely related to Stagonolepis, and also appeared early in the fossil record of aetosaurs. Previously, <b>basal</b> members were only known from later times, occurring after more advanced aetosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} numbers are unknown, the {{vertebral}} column of Megalosaurus was probably divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as {{is common for}} <b>basal</b> Tetanurae.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} {{group of}} root-symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in forests and shrublands {{around the world}} includes Lactifluus, Multifurca, Russula, and Lactarius. The crust-forming genera Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma, all wood-decay fungi, have <b>basal</b> positions in the family.|$|E
5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or <b>basal</b> activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the <b>basal</b> activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
5|$|Compared with Giraffititan, {{the inner}} ear of A. sp. shows a more <b>basal</b> morphology. That feature is {{possibly}} related to a restricted range of possible movements that involve head-turning.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} first three form monophyletic clades. The wolf-like canids and the South American canids together form the tribe Canini. Molecular data imply a North American origin of living Canidae some ten million years ago and an African origin of wolf-like canines (Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon), with the jackals being the most <b>basal</b> of this group. The South American clade is rooted by the maned wolf and bush dog, and the fox-like canids by the fennec fox and Blanford's fox. The grey fox and island fox are <b>basal</b> to the other clades; however, this topological difference is not strongly supported.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term <b>basal</b> is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be <b>basal</b> to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{analyses}} {{had shown}} Kentrosaurus closer {{in the tree}} to Stegosaurus. <b>Basal</b> traits include a prominent paraquadratic foramen at the quadrate in the skull; maxillary teeth with only seven denticles at the margin; and a shoulder spine.|$|E
5|$|Fertility {{awareness}} {{methods that}} rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (<b>basal</b> body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret <b>basal</b> body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|Hexacorallia {{includes}} {{coral reef}} builders: the stony corals (Scleractinia), sea anemones (Actiniaria), and zoanthids (Zoantharia). Genetic studies of ribosomal DNA has shown Ceriantharia to be a monophyletic {{group and the}} oldest, or <b>basal,</b> order among them.|$|E
5|$|Ilokelesia was {{originally}} {{described as a}} sister group to Abelisauroidea. However, Sereno tentatively places it closer to Abelisaurus than to noasaurids, a result which agrees with several other recent analyses. If a stem-based definition is used, Ilokelesia and Rugops are therefore <b>basal</b> abelisaurids. However, as they are more <b>basal</b> than Abelisaurus, they are outside of Abelisauridae if the node-based definition is adopted. Ekrixinatosaurus was also published in 2004, {{so it was not}} included in Sereno's analysis. However, an independent analysis, performed by Jorge Calvo and colleagues, shows it to be an abelisaurid.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Zhou {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} that P. lujiatunensis is <b>basal</b> {{to all other}} species. This {{would be consistent with}} its earlier appearance in the fossil record.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{learning}} {{is the ability}} for rewards and punishments to modify behavior. It is implemented by a network of brain areas centered on the <b>basal</b> ganglia.|$|E
