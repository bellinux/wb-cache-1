50|$|A surf <b>break</b> (also <b>break,</b> shore <b>break,</b> or big wave <b>break)</b> is a {{permanent}} (or semi permanent) obstruction such as a coral reef, rock, shoal, or headland that causes a wave to <b>break,</b> forming a barreling wave or other wave that can be surfed, before it eventually collapses. The topography of the seabed determines {{the shape of the}} wave and type of <b>break.</b> Since shoals can change size and location, affecting the <b>break,</b> it takes commitment and skill to find good <b>breaks.</b> Some surf <b>breaks</b> are quite dangerous, since the surfer can collide with a reef or rocks below the water.|$|R

5|$|While <b>breaking</b> was {{developing}} in New York, other styles of dance were developing in California. Unlike <b>breaking,</b> the funk styles—which {{originated in the}} 1970s in California—were not originally hip-hop dance styles: they were danced to funk music rather than hip-hop music, {{and they were not}} associated with the other cultural pillars of hip-hop (DJing, graffiti writing, and MCing). The funk styles are actually slightly older than <b>breaking</b> due to fact that boogaloo and locking were developed in the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often <b>breaking</b> crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within <b>breaking</b> developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew {{was the only way to}} learn when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In <b>breaking</b> in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the consistency of}} trend <b>break</b> point estimators {{when the number of}} <b>breaks</b> is underspecified. The consistency of <b>break</b> point estimators in a simple location model with level shifts has been well documented by researchers under various settings, including extensions such as allowing a time trend in the model. Despite the consistency of <b>break</b> point estimators of level shifts, there are few papers on the consistency of trend shift <b>break</b> point estimators in the presence of an underspecified <b>break</b> number. The simulation study and asymptotic analysis in this paper show that the trend shift <b>break</b> point estimator does not converge to the true <b>break</b> points when the <b>break</b> number is underspecified. In the case of two trend shifts, the inconsistency problem worsens if the magnitudes of the <b>breaks</b> are similar and the <b>breaks</b> are either both positive or both negative. The limiting distribution for the trend <b>break</b> point estimator is developed and closely approximates the finite sample performance...|$|R

In this paper we survey recent developments in testing for unit roots taking account of possible structural <b>breaks.</b> In doing so we discuss the distinction between taking structural <b>break</b> dates as exogenously determined, an approach initially adopted in the literature, and endogenously testing <b>break</b> dates. That is, we differentiate between testing for <b>breaks</b> when the <b>break</b> date is known {{and when it is}} assumed to be unknown. Also important is the distinction between discrete <b>breaks</b> and gradual <b>breaks.</b> Additionally we describe tests for both single and multiple <b>breaks</b> and discuss some of the pitfalls of the latter. ...|$|R

Goals of the reaserch: Main goal of this essay is to discover how the effectivness of the fast <b>breaks</b> influence the outcome of the top class handball matches during the most important tournaments (ME, MS). Second goal is to discover if there is a link between effectivness of the fast <b>break</b> (or portion of the fast <b>breaks</b> from the total of <b>breaks)</b> and final place scored on the previously mentioned tournaments. Methods: Statistic analysis, ratio of fast <b>breaks,</b> comparism of the ratios Results: It was discovered, the teams with greater efficiency of the fast <b>breaks</b> took better places, in the sample of the reaserched tournaments, than the teams with lesser efficiency of the fast <b>breaks.</b> Teams that won the match used more fast <b>breaks</b> and with greater efficiency than teams that lost. There is a greater ratio of the fast <b>breaks</b> from the total number of <b>breaks</b> in the winning match than in the loosing match.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that a series can contain {{an unknown number of}} smooth <b>breaks</b> raises two distinct problems. First, even if the <b>breaks</b> are sharp, the number of <b>breaks</b> and the <b>break</b> dates themselves are generally unknown and need to be estimated along with the other parameters of the model. Second, even if the number of <b>breaks</b> is known, the possibility of a smooth <b>break</b> means that the functional form of the <b>break</b> is unknown to the researcher. A misspecification of the functional form of the <b>breaks</b> may be as problematic as ignoring the <b>breaks</b> altogether. Moreover, ever if a series contains no <b>breaks,</b> it may be subject to other nonlinearities or parameter instabilities. We summarize a number of papers that use a variant of Gallant’s (1981) Flexible Fourier Form to control for the unknown number and form of the <b>breaks.</b> The paper details and illustrates several unit root tests, stationarity tests, and tests for parameter instability that are based on a Fourier approximation...|$|R

50|$|Power <b>breaks</b> are <b>breaks</b> {{where the}} {{striking}} object is supported. Either the <b>break</b> will employ human holders for horizontal, angular, or upward vertical strikes, or the <b>break</b> will {{require that the}} objects be stacked for downward vertical strikes. For a stacked <b>break</b> the object is placed on sturdy supporting objects, such as concrete blocks, that are placed on the ground. Many color belt (belts before black belt) promotion testing <b>breaks</b> are power breaks—it is substantially easier for an inexperienced person to muster sufficient energy to <b>break</b> a wooden board with a power <b>break</b> (Note, {{this is not true}} for all <b>breaks).</b> The vast majority of these employ human board holders. Often a stronger or more powerful striker may substitute some strength for technique and successfully accomplish the <b>break.</b> Most records that are catalogued are for power <b>breaks.</b> It is very common for black belt tests to use bricks, concrete patio blocks, or several boards stacked on top of supporting objects for challenging downward strikes.|$|R

40|$|Three {{contrasting}} rotation <b>breaks</b> (sown pasture, alternate {{crops and}} bare fallow) were established at five sites in Queensland, Australia, on land {{that had been}} under sugarcane monoculture for at least 20 years. The <b>breaks</b> were in place for 30 – 42 months at four sites and for 12 months at the fifth site. The effects of the <b>breaks</b> on selected soil biological properties were assessed following {{the removal of the}} <b>breaks</b> and before the area was re-planted with sugarcane. At the four sites with the long-term <b>breaks,</b> microbial biomass increased under the pasture <b>break,</b> declined under the bare fallow <b>break</b> and did not change significantly under the crop <b>break,</b> compared to microbial biomass under continual sugarcane. At these sites, populations of the root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus zeae) declined under all three <b>breaks</b> whereas populations of free-living nematodes increased under the pasture and crop <b>breaks</b> but declined under the bare fallow <b>break.</b> At the site with the 12 month <b>breaks,</b> a forage legume pasture increased microbial biomass, reduced lesion nematodes and together with the crop <b>break</b> increased populations of free-living nematodes. At the four sites with the long-term <b>breaks</b> there was an increase in the ratio of fungal:bacterial fatty acids and an increase in fatty acid 16 : 1 ω 5 c (used as a biomarker for mycorrhizal fungi) under the pasture and crop <b>breaks.</b> Also at these sites, the soil microbial community under the pasture, crop and bare fallow <b>breaks,</b> respectively, showed increased, no change or diminished capacity to utilize carbon substrates compared to the soil microbial community under continual sugarcane. The yield of the sugarcane crop following all three <b>breaks</b> was significantly higher than the yield of the crop following continual sugarcane at each of the sites with the long-term <b>breaks.</b> Examination of the longevity of the effect of the rotation <b>breaks</b> on soil biological properties at the sites with the long-term <b>breaks,</b> suggested that effects on some soil organisms (e. g. lesion nematodes) maybe short-lived...|$|R
