500|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw was {{described}} as having similar coloration to the scarlet macaw, but with shorter tail feathers between 38 and 51cm (15 and 20 in) long. In contrast, the tail feathers of the scarlet macaw are 61cm (2ft) long and have <b>blue</b> <b>tips,</b> and the outer feathers are almost entirely blue. In spite of the tail feathers being shorter, it is not certain whether the Lesser Antillean macaw was smaller than the scarlet macaw overall, as the relative proportions of body parts vary between macaw species. The tail feathers were longer {{than those of the}} Cuban macaw, which were 30cm (12in) long.

5000|$|The bigclaw {{snapping}} shrimp {{has a small}} rostrum and no spines on {{the edge}} of its carapace. The big claw or chela which gives it its common name can be either the right or left claw and is disproportionally large, measuring half the length of the body. It has a deep notch on either side beneath the finger joint. The other claw is unmodified and of normal size. The bigclaw is the largest species of snapping shrimp in its home range, growing to a maximum length of 5.5 cm, but most adults are considerably smaller than this. Its colour is a translucent dark green with orange and <b>blue</b> <b>tips</b> to the uropods.|$|E
50|$|The stony {{skeleton}} of Acropora pulchra takes on various forms. It is a branching species, sometimes being tree-like and forming thickets {{and in other}} locations forming tangled colonies with level upper surfaces. The branches are up to 12 mm in diameter and up to 18 cm long. Often the whole colony spreads horizontally and {{is no more than}} 5 cm thick. The growth habit largely depends on where the coral is growing in relation to the tide levels. The polyps protrude from little cup-shaped depressions called corallites which are widely spaced on the branches and which have elongated lower lips. The colour of this coral varies from blue to various shades of brown, often with pale <b>blue</b> <b>tips</b> to the branches.|$|E
5000|$|Figure 2. This figure {{shows the}} {{possible}} H-bond {{interactions between the}} arginines and the UMP in the active site of thymidylate synthase. This {{can be seen by}} the faint lines between the <b>blue</b> <b>tips</b> and the red tips. These arginines are used to hold the position of the UMP molecule so that the interaction may occur correctly. The two arginines in the top right corner that are located next to each other on the back bone are actually from the other protein of this dimer enzyme. This interaction {{is one of the many}} intermolecular forces that holds these two tertiary structures together. The yellow stand in the top-middle region shows a sulfur bond that forms between a cysteine side chain and UMP. This covalently holds the UMP within the active site until it is reacted to yield TMP.|$|E
50|$|The stream bluet (Enallagma exsulans) is {{a species}} of American bluet damselflies in the family Coenagrionidae. Its length is 29-37 mm. Many bluet species prefer ponds and lakes; the stream bluet as its name implies is most at home along moving waters. It can be found along small to {{medium-sized}} rivers. It is occasionally found at lakes too. In many species of damselflies the males have a <b>blue</b> <b>tip</b> to the abdomen. Enallagma exsulans {{is one of those}} less common cases where the female, too, has a <b>blue</b> abdominal <b>tip.</b> Summertime {{is the best time to}} look for stream bluets.|$|R
50|$|The male eastern billabongfly has {{a bright}} blue thorax with black markings, {{and a long}} and slender black abdomen with blue rings and a <b>blue</b> <b>tip.</b> The female is a similar size to the male and is pale blue to grayish-green in colour. The antehumeral stripe of the female is a contrastingly bright green.|$|R
50|$|Layard's parakeet is a green parrot, 29 cm long {{including}} a tail up to 13 cm. The adult has a bluish-grey head and back, {{separated by a}} green collar. There is a broad black chin stripe and the tail is <b>blue</b> <b>tipped</b> yellow. The upper mandible of the male's bill is red and the lower mandible is brown.|$|R
50|$|The Lesser Antillean macaw was {{described}} as having similar coloration to the scarlet macaw, but with shorter tail feathers between 38 and 51 cm (15 and 20 in) long. In contrast, the tail feathers of the scarlet macaw are 61 cm (2 ft) long and have <b>blue</b> <b>tips,</b> and the outer feathers are almost entirely blue. In spite of the tail feathers being shorter, it is not certain whether the Lesser Antillean macaw was smaller than the scarlet macaw overall, as the relative proportions of body parts vary between macaw species.

The morphology of the fossil phalanx bone from Marie-Galante was most similar to the second or third ungual of the scarlet macaw, though the bone is slightly smaller at 15.3 mm compared to 15 - 17 mm.|$|E
50|$|Acropora secale is {{a colonial}} coral that forms low hummocks. The {{branches}} can grow to {{a diameter of}} 20 mm and length of 70 mm. They are cylindrical but gradually taper towards the tips. They grow in a corymbose fashion with the lower branches being longer than the upper ones so that the coral has a level-topped appearance. The corallites are of varying sizes and arranged in vertical rows, often with alternate rows of larger and smaller corallites. The axial corallites are up to 3 mm in diameter while the radial corallites either have long tubular openings or nariform (noselike) openings. The skeleton is covered by a thin ectodermal layer of tissue. When feeding, the polyps protrude from the corallites. Each has a single ring of twelve tentacles, {{one of which is}} longer than the others. The polyps have a mouth which opens into the coelenteron. This interconnects with other polyps through a complex system of channels, the coenenchyme, inside the porous skeleton. Several colour schemes occur in this coral, purple with yellow tips to the branches, pale brown with <b>blue</b> <b>tips,</b> plain green or plain brown.|$|E
5000|$|Subspecies in the {{nominate}} group (including subspecies xantholaema, nattereri and panamensis) have a {{total length}} of 33-38 cm (13-15 in). As most other amazon parrots, it has a short squarish tail and primarily green plumage. It has dark <b>blue</b> <b>tips</b> to the secondaries and primaries, and a red wing speculum, carpal edge (leading edge of the wing at the [...] "shoulder") and base of the outer tail-feathers. The red and dark blue sections are often difficult to see when the bird is perched, while the red base of the outer tail-feathers only infrequently can be seen under normal viewing conditions in the wild. The amount of yellow to the head varies, with nominate, nattereri and panamensis having yellow restricted to the crown-region (occasionally with a few random feathers around the eyes), while the subspecies xantholaema has most of the head yellow. All have a white eye-ring. They have a dark bill with a large horn (gray) or reddish spot on the upper mandible except panamensis, which has a horn colored beak. Males and females do not differ in plumage. Except for the wing speculum, juveniles have little yellow and red to the plumage.|$|E
5000|$|Armor Piercing Incendiary, T15/M14 (1943-?) and M14A1 (?-?): This {{cartridge}} may {{be substituted}} for the M2 armor-piercing round and is normally employed against flammable targets. The tip of the M14 bullet is colored with a <b>blue</b> <b>tip</b> over a black ring. The M14A1 featured an improved core design and incendiary charge. The M14A1 bullet is colored with aluminum paint.|$|R
50|$|Forktails {{are small}} or very small damselflies. The {{compound}} eyes of mature individuals have a dark upper region and contrasting lower part. The thorax is often green {{and may have}} lateral stripes and the abdomen in males is black with a <b>blue</b> <b>tip.</b> Females of some species are polymorphic, some being orangish and darkening with age, while others resemble the male.|$|R
