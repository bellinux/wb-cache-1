5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another <b>being</b> <b>is</b> to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great <b>being</b> <b>is</b> at least possible.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human <b>being</b> <b>is</b> known to have died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E

5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the <b>being</b> <b>is</b> a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E
5|$|After {{an alien}} entity declaring {{itself to be}} God destroys {{spacecraft}} en route to Earth, the Enterprise is launched {{under the command of}} Admiral Kirk to engage the vessel. He re-assembles the former crew, including Spock, and sets out to intercept the alien. As they approach the entity, it transports a humanoid probe on board the Enterprise that takes a variety of forms—including that of Jesus. The crew determine that the being and its craft are from an alternate dimension and have been responsible for the creation of religion of numerous planets to teach their inhabitants its laws in a manner understandable at their points in development. The <b>being</b> <b>is</b> malfunctioning; the crew repair it and send it back to its own dimension.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions {{that are}} capable of making {{autonomous}} attack decisions (man out of the loop) raise moral, ethical, and international humanitarian law concerns because a human <b>being</b> <b>is</b> not involved in making the actual decision to attack and potentially kill humans. Whereas some guided munitions may lock-on after launch or may be sensor fuzed, their flight time is typically limited and a human launches them at an area where enemy activity is strongly suspected. An autonomous loitering munition, on the other hand, may be launched at an area where enemy activity is only probable, and loiter searching autonomously for targets for potentially hours following the initial launch decision. The IAI Harpy and IAI Harop are frequently cited in the relevant literature as they set a precedent for an aerial system (though not necessarily a precedent when comparing to a modern naval mine) in terms of length and quality of autonomous function, in relation to a cruise missile for example.|$|E

5|$|Rudra's {{evolution}} from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme <b>being</b> <b>is</b> first evidenced in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (400–200 BC), according to Gavin Flood. Prior to it, the Upanishadic literature is monistic, and the Shvetashvatara text presents the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva {{is identified as}} {{the creator of the}} cosmos and liberator of souls from the birth-rebirth cycle. The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Shaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali's Mahābhāṣya (2nd-century BC) and in the Mahabharata. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather than being a text just on Shiva theism.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange {{mass of people}} from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an impermeable shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate <b>Being</b> <b>is</b> born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.|$|E
