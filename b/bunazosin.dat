50|$|<b>Bunazosin</b> (INN) is {{an alpha}} 1 antagonist. <b>Bunazosin</b> was {{initially}} developed to treat {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} (BPH). It has been approved in Japan in a topical form to treat glaucoma. The mechanism of action is a reduction of aqueous outflow through the uveoscleral pathway resulting in lowering the intraocular pressure. It also may act to improve {{blood flow to the}} ocular nerve. Systemic Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists have been implicated in Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS). <b>Bunazosin</b> potentially could have the same effect but there has been no research to substantiate this as a risk for cataract surgery.|$|E
40|$|Antiarrhythmic {{effects of}} alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists were {{assessed}} in the reserpinized guinea pig ventricular myocardium. Both <b>bunazosin</b> (1 to 3 x 10 − 7 M), a new alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist, and yohimbine (1 to 3 × 10 − 7 M), another adrenoceptor antagonist, suppressed the transient depolarization and triggered activity induced by a train of rapid stimuli in the solution containing low potassium ion (K+), high calcium ion (Ca 2 +) and strophanthidin (1 to 5 × 10 − 7 M). <b>Bunazosin</b> (3 × 10 − 6 M) abolished the facilitatory effect of hypoxia on beta-adrenoceptor mediated abnormal automaticity. To clarify the mechanisms underlying the antiarrhythmic properties of alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, their electrophysiologic {{effects on the}} fast and slow action potentials were investigated. Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (<b>bunazosin,</b> yohimbine and phentolamine) suppressed the slow response in a dose-related manner. The voltage-dependent block and use-dependent block of the maximal rate of rise (Vmax) of action potentials by <b>bunazosin</b> (10 − 5 to 10 − 4 M) and yohimbine (HT 6 to 10 − 5 M) were studied. The analysis of the onset and recovery kinetics from the use-dependent block of drugs showed that both <b>bunazosin</b> and yohimbine act as slow kinetic drugs. It is concluded that alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists {{seem to have an}} antiarrhythmic effect through the inhibition of fast sodium ion (Na+) and slow Ca 2 +currents of Jhe cell membrane independently of blockade of myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors...|$|E

40|$|We have {{constructed}} a new ocular pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for anti-glaucoma drugs to describe ocular hypotensive effects on intraocular pressure (IOP) after instillation {{of a combination}} of an a 1 -adrenergic antagonist, <b>bunazosin,</b> and a b -adrenergic antagonist, timolol, into rabbits. This model was constructed by the combination of two ocular PK/PD models for <b>bunazosin</b> and timolol by including aqueous humor dynamics based on both action mechanisms. We also verified the reliability of this model by confirming the drug concentrations in aqueous humor and ocular hypotensive effects after instillation of the drug combination. The aqueous humor concentrations of timolol and <b>bunazosin</b> were determined by an HPLC, and ocular hypotensive effect-time profiles were measured using a telemetry system, which was able to record automatically detailed effects. The combined model could simulate the aqueous humor concentrations of both drugs and the additive IOP-lowering effect after instillation of the combination using the MULTI (RUNGE) program and PK/PD parameters which were obtained from ocular hypotensive effects after instillation of <b>bunazosin</b> alone or timolol alone. The theoretical concentration curves of both drugs in the aqueous humor and the theoretical ocular hypotensive effect curves almost agreed with both the observed concentrations and ocular hypotensive effects after instillation of the drug combination. These results indicate the reliability and usefulness of PK/PD modeling considering aqueous humor dynamics to predict IOP in multidrug therapy. This is the first study to develop a PK/PD model for multidrug therapy for the eye...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{pathological}} involvement of the sympathetic nervous system {{in the development of}} cardiomyopathy, a receptor-binding study was carried out on cardiomyopathic Syrian hamsters of strain BIO 14. 6 (BIO) at 21 days (prenecrotic stage); 35 - 42 days (onset of cardiomyopathy); and 70 - 84 days of life (early cardiac hypertrophy). The newly developed α_ 1 -blocker (<b>bunazosin</b> hydrochloride) was initially administered at doses of 100 μg/kg or 10 mg/kg BIO hamsters at 21 days of life and continued for 70 days. At the onset of cardiomyopathy and early cardiac hypertrophy, there was {{an increase in the number}} of α_ 1 -receptors in the BIO hamsters compared to controls, but there were no significant changes at the prenecrotic stage. On histopathological examination, 10 mg/kg <b>bunazosin</b> had a singnificant beneficial effect on cardiomyopathy [area of necrosis 1. 38 % in untreated vs 0. 33 % in treated animals; area of calcification 2. 70 % (untreated) vs 0. 60 % (treated); area of all myocardial injuries 6. 97 % (untreated) vs 3. 19 % (treated) ]. However, 100 μg/kg <b>bunazosin</b> had no effect. It was concluded that the increase in the number of α_ 1 -receptors may not be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy but that α_ 1 -receptors could be implicated in the later progression of the condition. 浜松医科大学学位論文　医博第 91 号(平成 02 年 03 月 26 日）rights:社団法人日本循環器学会rights:本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであ...|$|E

40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is {{a potent}} {{endogenous}} vasodilator in humans, and {{has been reported to}} be localized in peripheral nerve fibers distributed in the cardiovas-cular system. Thus, CGRP is considered as a modulator of peripheral vascular tone. In this study, in order to investigate the pathophysiological role of CGRP in hypertensive dis-eases, plasma CGRP levels (pCGRP) were evaluated in patients with essential hypertension (EHT, n= 31; WHO I-II), primary aldosteronism (PA, n= 13), pheochromocytoma (Pheo, n= 4) and nor-motensive subjects (Control, n= 25), using a sensitive radioimmunoassay previously established in our laboratory. The effects of chronic treatment with Ca?? antagonist (manidipine 20 mg/day) or α?-blocker (<b>bunazosin</b> 3 mg/day) on pCGRP were studied in 11 cases of EHT. pCGRP were also measured after adrenalectomy in 5 cases of PA. EHT showed significantly higher pCGRP compared with Control. Significant positive correla-tions were observed between both systolic and diastolic blood pressures and pCGRP in the combined group of EHT and Control. In 6 EHT, pCGRP decreased significantly after 2 weeks administration of manidipine simultaneously with a marked blood pressure fall. A significant decrease of pCGRP was also observed after 2 weeks treatment with <b>bunazosin</b> in 5 EHT. In secondary hypertension, in spite of their clear differences in humoral factors such as plasma renin activity, plasma cate-cholamine level or plasma aldosterone concentration, both PA and Pheo showed significantly higher pCGRP compared with Control. No significant difference in pCGRP was observed among EHT, PA and Pheo. pCGRP markedly decreased after adrenalectomy accompanied with a significant fall hi blood pressure in PA. Thus, it was suggested in this study that the increased pCGRP observed in EHT, PA and Pheo are a secondary, compensatory reaction to elevated blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|A newly {{developed}} alpha 1 -adrenergic blocker, <b>bunazosin</b> hydrochloride (Detantol, Eisai) was clinically investigated in 17 patients with benign prostatic obstruction and 18 patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Subjective symptoms improved in 11 of the 17 cases (64. 7 %) with prostatic obstruction and in 4 of the 10 cases (40 %) with neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Dose-dependent subjective improvement was observed with dosages of 3 to 9 mg/day. A dosage of 12 mg/day {{did not improve}} subjective symptoms more than did the 9 mg/day dose. In prostatic obstruction, 7 of the 10 objective parameters improved significantly. However, for neurogenic bladder dysfunction, only two parameters improved significantly.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} a local effect of cooling on the plantar skin blood flow (PSBF) of tetrodotoxin-treated rats by laser-Doppler flowmetry. When the air temperature around the left foot was locally cooled from 25 to 10 °C, the PSBF {{of the left}} foot decreased. The response was inhibited by the α-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine, the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>bunazosin,</b> the α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist RS 79948, and bretylium and guanethidine that inhibit noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves. Adrenalectomy of the rats {{did not affect the}} cooling-induced response. The P 2 purinoceptor antagonists suramin and PPADS also significantly suppressed the cooling-induced reduction of PSBF. However, the inhibitory effect of PPADS on the cooling-induced response was abolished after the treatment with phentolamine. Intra-arterial injections of ATPγS, a stable P 2 purinoceptor agonist, at 25 °C caused a transient decrease in PSBF in a dose-dependent manner, which was significantly inhibited by phentolamine and guanethidine. These results suggest a novel mechanism for local cooling-induced reduction of skin blood flow in vivo; moderate cooling of the skin induces the release of ATP, which stimulates presynaptic P 2 purinoceptors on sympathetic nerve terminals and facilitates the release of noradrenaline, thereby causing contractions of skin blood vessels via the activation of α 1 -and α 2 -adrenoceptors...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} nipradilol, an � 1,�-blocker with a nitric oxide donative action, on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) –induced retinal damage in rats and to determine whether topically instilled nipradilol penetrates the ipsilateral posterior retina–choroid at pharmacologically active concentrations in rabbits. METHODS. To determine effects on NMDA-induced damage, drugs were injected alone or with NMDA into the vitreous of one eye, and cell loss in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and thinning of the retinal neural cell layers were histologically evaluated. To evaluate posterior penetration, first, [14 C]-nipradilol was instilled, and its tissue concentration was measured. Second, nipradilol or timolol was instilled, and their effects on intravitreal injection of endothelin- 1 –induced retinal artery contraction were compared, to evaluate whether a pharmacologically active level of nipradilol penetrates the inner limiting layer by topical application. RESULTS. Intravitreous injection of NMDA reduced cell numbers in the GCL and {{the thickness of the}} inner plexiform layer (IPL) to 50. 4 % � 2. 6 % and 47. 8 % � 4. 9 % (n � 8) of control, respectively. Nipradilol alone had no effect. Coadministration of nipradilol with NMDA reduced cell numbers in the GCL and IPL thickness to 67. 8 % � 2. 2 % and 74. 4 % � 5. 2 % of control, respectively (P � 0. 05 – 0. 01). Sodium nitroprusside, but not timolol or <b>bunazosin,</b> also significantly prevented the NMDAinduced reduction of cell numbers in the GCL and IPL thickness. Radioactivity of nipradilol was found in the ipsilateral posterior retina–choroid at 318. 6 � 42. 9 ng/g (n � 4), which was significantly higher than in the contralateral control (107. 4 � 21. 8 ng/g). Topical application of nipradilol, but not timolol, significantly suppressed the endothelin- 1 –induced contraction of the retinal artery (83. 95 % � 8. 15 % and 35. 24 % � 5. 62 % of baseline vessel diameter for nipradilol and timolol, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. Nipradilol suppressed the NMDA-induced retinal damage in rats for which nitric oxide released from nipradilol may be responsible. Posterior penetration studies suggested that an effective concentration of nipradilol reached the posterior retina after topical application. (Invest Ophthalmol Vi...|$|E
