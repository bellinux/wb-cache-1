5|$|Belgrano {{headed north}} with nearly two hundred men, expecting to gather more {{people by the}} end of the Paraná River. Soldiers from the Blandengues regiments of San Nicolás and Santa Fe joined them en route, and later the Junta sent {{reinforcements}} of another two hundred soldiers. The army was welcomed <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population along the way, receiving donations and new recruits. Ultimately the army was composed of nearly 950 men, consisting of infantry and cavalry divided in four divisions with one piece of artillery each.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla's {{official}} portrayal as sole emperor marks a {{break from}} the detached images of the philosopher-emperors who preceded him: his close-cropped haircut is that of a soldier, his pugnacious scowl a realistic and threatening presence. This rugged soldier-emperor, an iconic archetype, was adopted <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following emperors, such as Maximinus Thrax, who were dependent on the support of the troops to rule the empire.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, a {{time when}} federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful, Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its {{population}} during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> downtown businesses moving there as well. While {{cities across the country}} grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Friends of Sound Horses {{launched}} a website containing {{the names of}} the over 8,700 people who had received suspensions from the horse showing and training world under the Horse Protection Act between 1986 and 2010. This list was developed as part of the USDA Horse Protection Operating Plan for 2007–2009, and supported <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USDA-certified HIOs. Despite the work being done to dissuade trainers from soring horses, APHIS inspectors found hundreds of violations {{in the course of their}} work during the 2012 year.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in Antananarivo than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in Antananarivo than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of Antananarivo. Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population.|$|E

5|$|In this context, Castelli and Álzaga plotted to oust Liniers and {{constitute}} a local government Junta, {{similar to those}} of the metropoli. This project was not shared <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natives or by the head of the Regiment of Patricians, Cornelio Saavedra. Manuel Belgrano proposed as an alternative to support the plans of Princess Charlotte, which were supported by Castelli and other criollos. Belgrano, who held monarchist ideas, argued that the Carlotist project would be the most practical means of achieving independence from Spain in the circumstances. On September 20, 1808, Castelli wrote a letter to Charlotte, with the signatures of Antonio Beruti, Hipólito Vieytes, Belgrano, and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña.|$|E
5|$|Jænberht presided at {{a council}} held at London, {{sometime}} after {{the elevation of}} Lichfield, attended <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bishops from southern Britain. Jænberht died on 12 August 792. Jænberht {{was buried in the}} abbey church of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. Jænberht has since been revered as a saint, with a feast day of 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{believed}} that securing the states' accession to India {{was crucial to}} reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. The princes also {{believed that}} he would {{be in a position to}} ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel had asked him to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E

5|$|Neorealism ("The {{world is}} made of {{ordinary}} objects.") Constructed by David Bohm and also associated with Louis de Broglie, this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical pilot wave which {{must be able to}} travel faster than light. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which did away with this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physics establishment.|$|E
5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Miami, Florida over a two-month period {{in the first half}} of 2008. Dostana was the first mainstream Indian film with a gay element and has been credited for exploring a topic largely ignored <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian population. The film was released on 14 November 2008 to positive reviews, with praise for its performances, direction, music, costumes and style. A box-office success, Dostana grossed over 871 million, becoming the eighth-highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.|$|E

5|$|Sampson {{also made}} enemies when he backed Samuel Insull's plan to dam the Cumberland Falls to {{generate}} hydroelectric power. An {{ally of the}} traditional southern power groups—the utility companies and textbook manufacturers—Sampson cited the jobs {{to be gained from}} the plan. The plan was opposed conservationists in the state and <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's newspapers. An alternate plan was proposed by Louisville-born millionaire and Delaware senator T. Coleman du Pont, who offered to purchase the falls for $230,000 {{and turn it into a}} state park. The General Assembly passed legislation giving the state park commission the right of eminent domain over the falls, then voted to accept the du Pont's offer. Sampson vetoed the Assembly's action, but his veto was overridden.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{had been a}} disaster for Asad and his now mainly Syrian army; Muslim control north of the Oxus had collapsed entirely, and while the governor {{had been able to}} escape complete destruction, he had suffered considerable casualties. Asad led his troops back to Balkh, but the Turgesh remained in Tokharistan, where they were joined by Ibn Surayj. As the Arabs customarily did not campaign during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Ibn Surayj's urging, on the other hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack into Lower Tokharistan, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Ibn Surayj and his followers, but <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan.|$|E
5|$|The {{music that}} would {{ultimately}} become the Hybrid Theory album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track demo tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives, including performances for Los Angeles promoter and impresario, Mike Galaxy's showcase at The Gig on Melrose. However, they were initially turned down <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major labels and several independent record labels. The band {{was signed by}} Warner Bros. Records in 1999, {{due in large part}} to the constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally {{these terms}} are {{specific}} to certain geographical areas although some may be used by a particular social group such as pax in the UK, used primarily by children attending private schools.

5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its {{head from side}} to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median horizontal plane. The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E
5|$|Because the new Olimpija is {{supported}} <b>by</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{fans of the}} previous Olimpija, including their ultras group, the Green Dragons, who have a long-standing rivalry with Maribor's own ultras group Viole Maribor, many see the matches between Maribor and the new club as {{the continuation of the}} rivalry and refer to it by the same name. However, there are many fans, either the ones from Maribor or the ones from Ljubljana, that do not share the same view and do not share similar beliefs, including part of the media such as RTV Slovenija and Večer. The overall statistics of {{the old and the new}} Olimpija are tracked separately by the Football Association of Slovenia and the Association of 1. SNL. The first match between Maribor and the new Olimpija took place on 24 October 2007 in a Slovenian cup quarter-final match that was won by Maribor, 3–1. At the time, Olimpija was still competing under the name Olimpija Bežigrad. Statistically, Maribor is the more successful club either in the case of matches from the period from 1962 to 2005 or the whole period from 1962 to present day.|$|E
50|$|Despite one false alarm, no enemy attack took place. <b>By</b> September, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volunteers {{had either}} moved further upriver. By December 1846, {{the camp was}} {{completely}} empty.|$|R
