60|$|As he steered, he kept {{flashing}} {{the torch}} on the <b>boat</b> <b>compass</b> {{so that he}} could keep headed north-east by east a quarter east. Then he remembered that the <b>boat</b> <b>compass,</b> on such course, deviated two whole points from the Arangi's compass, and altered his own course accordingly.|$|E
60|$|Back and {{peering into}} the binnacle, he listened vainly for another wail from Jerry {{in the hope of}} verifying his first hasty bearing. But not long he waited. Despite the fact that by his {{manoeuvre}} the Arangi had been hove to, he knew that windage and sea-driftage would quickly send her away from the swimming puppy. He shouted Borckman to come aft and haul in the whaleboat, while he hurried below for his electric torch and a <b>boat</b> <b>compass.</b>|$|E
60|$|When Mauki was done, {{he carried}} the <b>boat</b> <b>compass</b> and all the rifles and {{ammunition}} down to the cutter, which he proceeded to ballast with cases of tobacco. It was while engaged in this that a hideous, skinless thing {{came out of the}} house and ran screaming down the beach till it fell in the sand and mowed and gibbered under the scorching sun. Mauki looked toward it and hesitated. Then he went over and removed the head, which he wrapped in a mat and stowed in the stern locker of the cutter.|$|E
50|$|Lady Nelson {{anchored}} on {{the southern}} shore of Twofold Bay on 25 October and the crew again had to improvise a raft from the vessel's spars to get ashore. Lady Nelson got under way again on 3 November; attempts to leave on 1 and 2 November were both aborted due to the weather. She encountered the sloop George, which was bound for the Derwent from Port Jackson, shortly after leaving Twofold Bay and its master gave a <b>boat's</b> <b>compass</b> to Symons to replace those lost in the storm.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} dark, and the mist was very damp, and the wind, {{what there was}} of it, very cold, {{especially}} as in his hurry he had forgotten to bring a thick ulster, and had nothing but a covert coat and a thin oil-skin to wear. Moreover, {{he could not see}} in the least where he was going, or do more than lay his course for the Sunk Rocks by means of the <b>boat's</b> <b>compass,</b> which he consulted from time to time by the help of a bull's-eye lantern.|$|R
50|$|Other than {{attempting}} to sink ships, {{in the town}} of Ōtsuki, Hata District Kochi Prefecture, they are said to make the <b>boat's</b> <b>compass</b> malfunction, and in the Toyoma Prefecture, fishing boats that travel to Hokkaido get turned into a funayurei, causing the crew to hang themselves. In Ehime Prefecture, when one encounters a funayurei, if one tries to avoid it by changing the boat's route, the boat runs aground. Also, in the past, to avoid shipwreck on a day of bad weather, people would light a bonfire on land, but a funayurei would light a fire on open sea and mislead the boatmen, and by approaching the fire, one would get eaten by the sea and drown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Don Martin, {{let us take}} up the sweeps and try to {{find the}} Isabels. It is either that or sinking the lighter if the day overtakes us. We must not forget that the steamer from Esmeralda with the {{soldiers}} may be coming along. We will pull straight on now. I have discovered a bit of a candle here, and we must take the risk of a small light to make a course by the <b>boat</b> <b>compass.</b> There is not enough wind to blow it out--may the curse of Heaven fall upon this blind gulf!" ...|$|E
6000|$|After being {{informed}} {{of what had}} been done the revived captain [...] "dropped a bombshell in our midst," [...] by proposing to make for the Shetlands, which were only one hundred and fifty miles off. [...] "The wind is in our favour," [...] he said. [...] "I promise to take you there. Are you all willing?" [...] This--comments the chief engineer--"from a man who but a few hours previously had been hauled back from the grave!" [...] The captain's confident manner inspired the men, and they all agreed. Under the best possible conditions a boat-run of one hundred and fifty miles in the North Atlantic and in winter weather would have been a feat of no mean merit, but in the circumstances it required uncommon nerve and skill to carry out such a promise. With an oar for a mast and the boat-cover cut down for a sail they started on their dangerous journey, with the <b>boat</b> <b>compass</b> and the stars for their guide. The captain's undaunted serenity buoyed them all up against despondency. He told them what point he was making for. It was Ronas Hill, [...] "and we struck it as straight as a die." ...|$|E

60|$|On her side, fearing for his safety, {{she begged}} him to remain. This, he declared, could not be. 'I cannot break faith with my friend,' said he. Had he stood alone he would have {{abandoned}} his plan. But Christoph, with the <b>boat</b> and <b>compass</b> and chart, was waiting on the shore; the tide would soon turn; {{his mother had been}} warned of his coming; go he must.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Ajax and Achilles {{closed to}} 13000 yd and started making {{in front of}} Admiral Graf Spee, causing her to split her main {{armament}} at 06:30 and otherwise use her 149 mm guns against them. Shortly after, Exeter fired two torpedoes from her starboard tubes but both missed. At 06:37, Ajax launched her Fairey Seafox spotter floatplane from its catapult. At 06:38, Exeter turned {{so that she could}} fire her port torpedoes and received two more direct hits from 283 mm shells. One hit [...] "A" [...] turret and put it out of action, the other entered the hull and started fires. At this point, Exeter was severely damaged, having only [...] "Y" [...] turret still in action under local control, with Jennings on the roof shouting instructions to those inside. She also had a 7° list, was being flooded and being steered with the use of her small <b>boats</b> <b>compass.</b> However, Exeter dealt the decisive blow; one of her 8" [...] (203mm) shells had penetrated two decks before exploding in Graf Spee′s funnel area, destroying her raw fuel processing system and leaving her with just 16 hours fuel, insufficient to allow her to return home.|$|R
500|$|Mourners were viewing Lincoln's remains {{when the}} funeral train steamed into Harrisburg at 8:20p.m., while Booth and Herold were {{provided}} with a <b>boat</b> and <b>compass</b> by Jones to cross the Potomac at night on April 21. Instead of reaching Virginia, they mistakenly navigated upriver to {{a bend in the}} broad Potomac River, coming ashore again in Maryland on April 22. The 23-year-old Herold knew the area well, having frequently hunted there, and recognized a nearby farm as belonging to a Confederate sympathizer. The farmer led them to his son-in-law, Col. John J. Hughes, who provided the fugitives with food and a hideout until nightfall, for a second attempt to row across the river to Virginia. Booth wrote in his diary: ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{account of}} a wreck in the area was carried by a Portland newspaper article of 1847 which described [...] "a wreck, about two miles on the Belfast side of Warrnambool…of…a three hundred ton vessel …thrown completely into the sand hummocks". The article went on to connect the wreck to the 1841 discovery {{of a number of}} articles of French manufacture found strewed along the beach. In 1981, writer Ian McKiggan also found further evidence of an 1841 French shipwreck in the area in the journal of Government Surveyor C.J. Tyers. Tyers wrote that the wreckage (including a keg containing a <b>boat</b> <b>compass</b> by maker Devot of Harve) indicated an unknown French whaler had been lost in the area.|$|E
50|$|The first boat {{to leave}} the ship during the {{landings}} carried half of Warrens beach party, along with {{several members of the}} Army shore party embarked. Due to the heavy smoke screen and a faulty <b>boat</b> <b>compass,</b> the landing craft landed on a Japanese held beach near the town of Damortis. It was a fatal mistake. Before it could get underway, the boat came under artillery, mortar, and machine gun fire, wrecking the vessel, killing several men, and wounding others. The remaining men abandoned the craft and began to swim away from the beach, but the Japanese automatic weapons opened up on them as they struggled to get out of range. Only 17 men out of 28 survived the deadly hail of fire. It was two hours before the survivors - many of them badly wounded - were picked up.|$|E
50|$|The {{boat was}} {{fitted with a}} periscope, but this proved {{unsatisfactory}} and its use was abandoned. Diving was delayed {{by the need to}} fix or stow the periscope and water seals proved to be unreliable and on a couple of occasions led to dangerous flooding. A small conning tower was added in 1898. The <b>boats</b> had a <b>compass</b> and gyroscope although these were not entirely reliable. The ship was equipped with two 14-inch torpedo tubes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yonder is the brig; and we {{are heading}} for her as {{straight}} {{as if she was}} the pole, and the keel of this <b>boat</b> was a <b>compass.</b> I see how it is, Miss Rose, and a'ter all, I must give in. I suppose some other opportunity will offer for me to get on board of the brig ag'in, and I'll trust to that. If you won't go off with the mate alone, I suppose you'll not refuse to go off in my company." ...|$|R
60|$|Each <b>boat</b> had a <b>compass,</b> a quadrant, {{a copy of}} Bowditch's 'Navigator,' and a Nautical Almanac, and the captain's {{and chief}} mate's boats had chronometers. There were thirty-one men all told. The captain took an account of stock, with the {{following}} result: four hams, nearly thirty pounds of salt pork, half-box of raisins, one hundred pounds of bread, twelve two-pound cans of oysters, clams, and assorted meats, a keg containing four pounds of butter, twelve gallons of water in a forty-gallon 'scuttle-butt', four one-gallon demijohns full of water, three bottles of brandy (the property of passengers), some pipes, matches, and a hundred pounds of tobacco. No medicines. Of course the whole party {{had to go on}} short rations at once.|$|R
50|$|There were 189 survivors: 54, 54, 55, 57 and 55 {{aboard the}} larger {{lifeboats}} 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8, respectively, whilst the smaller Lifeboat 2 held 17 people (for {{a total of}} 292 survivors). After assessing the situation, {{it was decided to}} attempt to reach the nearest land, St Helena, despite the danger of overshooting the small island and becoming lost. Each <b>boat</b> had a <b>compass,</b> but there was only one sextant among them. These, along with Master William Rogerson's Rolex watch, would be needed for navigation, and this would require the boats to remain together. The survivors hoped to reach St Helena within two or three weeks, and water was rationed at 110 ml a day per person, despite the tropical heat.|$|R
40|$|How can a {{fisherman}} troll from a motorboat without simultaneously piloting the boat? Our Aquatic Guidance System, with both conventional and auto-pilot steering, allows fishermen {{to concentrate on}} fishing. This guidance system integrates automated steering, transmission, and throttle control with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows the user to control the boat, input commands, and choose path specifications. Sensor data is used to display readings for the <b>boat’s</b> current depth, <b>compass,</b> and GPS data (current location and heading). A two-dimensional (2 -D) lake map featuring boat position, trace of the path taken, and the projected path is also displayed. For steering, throttle, and mechanical requirements, our design utilizes components designed by Kairos Autonomi, a manufacturer of systems that enable vehicles to become autonomous. Our design includes a safety system that involves manual override, shoreline avoidance, and emergency stopping. For the GUI, our design uses the objectoriented programming language C # which is suitable for systems in which the computer is completely dedicated to the device it controls. Our platform is a 19. 5 foot Bayline...|$|R
