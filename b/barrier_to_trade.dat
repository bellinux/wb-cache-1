The Ministers took note of the broader objectives of the European Union proposed Registration, Evaluation and Authorization and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Legislation, in respect of the protection of human health and the environment. They expressed their concern for the consequences REACH may have on the developing economies of the South. Such consequences will negatively affect the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals in these countries.

With the {{decrease}} of regulations of tariff barrier and non-tariff barrier, the export market of Chinese textile products has been expanded and the market shares have been increased, which arouses great attention of many countries in the world.

Using the gravity model, we find that home bias remains substantial for products where the EU has sought to introduce harmonized technical regulations <b>to</b> remove technical <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> but mutual recognition sectors exhibit the smallest home bias. Based upon the analysis on the evolution of home bias in the EU, we find no evidence that the home bias has decreased for products where differences in technical regulations are important. home bias, gravity model, European integration, technical <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade...</b>|$|R

From 1847 Spicer's Gap replaced Cunningham's Gap (1828) as the preferred route in the southern Downs region.

Small businesses are a large voter base of the LDP and had a strong stance in government-business relations.

5000|$|A tariff {{is a tax}} {{placed on}} a {{specific}} good or set of goods exported from or imported to a country, creating an economic <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade.</b> Usually the tactic is used when a country's domestic output of the good is falling and imports from foreign competitors are rising, particularly if there exist strategic reasons for retaining a domestic production capability. Some failing industries receive a protection with an effect similar to a subsidies in that by placing the tariff on the industry, the industry is less enticed to produce goods in a quicker, cheaper, and more productive fashion. The third reason for a tariff involves addressing the issue of dumping. Dumping involves a country producing highly excessive amounts of goods and dumping the goods on another foreign country, producing the effect of prices that are [...] "too low". Too low can refer to either pricing the good from the foreign market at a price lower than charged in the domestic market of the country of origin. The other reference to dumping relates or refers to the producer selling the product at a price {{in which there is}} no profit or a loss. The purpose and expected outcome of the tariff is to encourage spending on domestic goods and services.|$|E

30|$|A {{commonly}} concerned {{issue is}} whether mandatory COOL of the main ingredient would be a technical <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> for developing countries. Since developing countries usually produce primary materials but do not manufacture foods with ingredients imported from other countries, mandatory origin indication of the main ingredient on the label of a finished product should not directly influence the customs procedures for the export of primary materials from a developing country if main ingredient traceability is not mandatory. Otherwise, mandatory traceability would become a technical <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> for the developing country. To avoid the possible protectionism, traceability systems should not be mandatory when the originating place of the main ingredient indicated on the label of a finished product is a developing country. Proposing such a policy would also take into consideration that the statement of origin from a developing country {{is less likely to}} involve fraudulent practice.|$|E
