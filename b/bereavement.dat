5|$|A {{subfield}} of {{the sociology}} of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology {{is the study of}} death, dying and <b>bereavement,</b> sometimes referred to broadly as {{the sociology of}} death. This topic is exemplifed by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of discharges from hospice {{are due to}} the death of the patient, although hospice treatment may not end then as care also provides for a period of <b>bereavement</b> counseling for the family afterward. However, there are several other scenarios when a patient may be discharged from hospice.|$|E
5|$|Assessing Valencia's hitting during 2010 spring training, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said: “I {{guarantee}} you one thing, he can hit a fastball; {{and if he}} sits on a breaking ball, he can hit that, too.” On June 3, Valencia was called up to replace Michael Cuddyer, who had {{been placed on the}} <b>bereavement</b> list following the death of his father-in-law. In his debut that day, he went 1 for 3.|$|E

50|$|Eliza Berkeley (née Frinsham; 1734-1800) was an English author. She was {{connected}} to the Blue Stockings Society, and after <b>bereavements</b> in the 1790s began to edit family papers, and write on her own account.|$|R
5|$|Abuse during {{childhood}} is {{accepted as a}} primary social factor increasing the incidence of self-harm, as is <b>bereavement,</b> and troubled parental or partner relationships. Factors such as war, poverty, and unemployment may also contribute. Self-harm is frequently described as an experience of depersonalisation or a dissociative state. As many as 70% of individuals with borderline personality disorder engage in self-harm. An estimated 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders engage in self-harm at some point, including eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting, and head-banging.|$|E
5|$|Müller {{was born}} in Weilheim, Upper Bavaria, {{and grew up in}} the nearby village of Pähl, which became the centre of media {{attention}} during his World Cup exploits. His parents are Klaudia and Gerhard, and he has a brother, Simon, who is {{two and a half years}} younger. He married his long-time girlfriend Lisa Trede, a semi-professional equestrian who works on a farm, in December 2009 after being engaged for two years. In June 2011, he became an ambassador for YoungWings, a charity that helps children who have suffered <b>bereavement</b> or trauma. He is Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included <b>bereavement</b> and harsh discipline by parents. The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by others who have previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E

5|$|The devotion that Beatrice showed to {{her mother}} was {{acknowledged}} in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for Beatrice grew stronger. The Queen suffered another <b>bereavement</b> in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at Balmoral. Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on Beatrice for support. Unlike her siblings, Beatrice had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company; indeed, they had worked together {{to carry out the}} Queen's wishes.|$|E
5|$|In 1918–19, the Senators won {{the second}} half of the split {{schedule}}. Clint Benedict had the top goalkeeper average, and Cy Denneny and Frank Nighbor placed third and fourth in scoring with 18 and 17 goals in 18 games, respectively. The schedule was abbreviated by the Toronto Arenas club suspending operations, so the Senators and Canadiens played off in the first best-of-seven series. Due to a family <b>bereavement,</b> Ottawa was without star centre Frank Nighbor for the first three games and lost all three. Ottawa asked to use Corb Denneny of Toronto, but the Canadiens turned down the request. Nighbor returned for the fourth game in Ottawa, which Ottawa won 6–3. The series ended in five games, as the Canadiens won the final match 4–2 to win the series. The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Seattle was left undecided, as an influenza outbreak suspended the final.|$|E
5|$|In April 1930, Zelda was {{admitted}} to a sanatorium in France where, after months of observation and treatment and a consultation with one of Europe's leading psychiatrists, Doctor Eugen Bleuler, she was diagnosed as a schizophrenic. Initially admitted to a hospital outside Paris, she was later moved to a clinic in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and because of her profound psychological problems she was moved to a psychiatric facility, in Prangins {{on the shores of}} Lake Geneva. She was released in September 1931, and the Fitzgeralds returned to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Sayre, was dying. Amid her family's <b>bereavement,</b> Scott announced that he was leaving for Hollywood. Zelda's father died while Scott was gone, and her health again deteriorated. By February 1932, she had returned to living in a psychiatric clinic.|$|E

Shortly after this she was faced with one {{of her first}} major tasks when she was called on {{to play a role in}} helping to wind up the affairs of Console, a suicide <b>bereavement</b> counselling charity, after the organisation was plunged into crisis by a scandal involving the misuse of funds. McEntee worked with the charity's chief executive to ensure the services it provided would continue to be available. Console's functions were taken over by Pieta House in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|Rajam died of typhoid in 1939. Her death {{affected}} Narayan {{deeply and}} he remained depressed {{for a long}} time; he was also concerned for their daughter Hema, who was only three years old. The <b>bereavement</b> brought about {{a significant change in}} his life and was the inspiration behind his next novel, The English Teacher. This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following Swami and Friends and The Bachelor of Arts. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that The English Teacher was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam's death.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Arsenal {{travelled}} to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Pirès and Wiltord {{were dropped}} by Wenger {{in favour of}} Ray Parlour and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family <b>bereavement.</b> In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence; he attempted to kick out at striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, which was seen by referee Steve Bennett. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty in the 90th minute, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (Ashley Cole, Lauren, Keown, Parlour, Lehmann, Vieira) were later charged with improper conduct by The Football Association (FA), while the club were fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given one-match suspensions.|$|E
50|$|His {{earliest}} works {{included a}} volume of sermons (1787), a tragedy Inez (1796) and Constantia, a dramatic poem (1800). Family <b>bereavements</b> reduced his writings thereafter. His major works were a Life of Milton, prefixed to an edition of Milton's work (1806), a rhyming translation of the Aeneid (1817) and a Life of Shakespeare, prefixed to an 1826 edition of Shakespeare's works.|$|R
6000|$|But {{now they}} were to be met by family friends--by friends who were {{thinking}} of nothing but their <b>bereavements.</b> Old Mr. Price came to meet them on board, and Mrs. Cox's uncle; old gentlemen with faces prepared for sadness, and young ladies with sympathetic handkerchiefs. How signally surprised the sad old gentlemen and the sympathetic young ladies must have been! ...|$|R
50|$|Jack Wills {{suffered}} various family <b>bereavements,</b> losing {{before the}} age of thirty both his father in 1911 and his sister Edith in 1913.

He had several serious medical issues, suffering a severe coronary thrombosis shortly after his retirement, losing the sight of one eye, and losing all his body hair to alopecia.|$|R
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child <b>bereavement</b> counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered <b>bereavement.</b> After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Jonathan Powell was keen to put {{the serial}} into {{production}} and offered the scripts to producer Michael Wearing who was immediately impressed by the scenes in the first episode, “Compassionate Leave”, depicting Craven's reaction to Emma's death, describing them as “the most sustained evocation of individual grief in <b>bereavement</b> that I can remember”. The budget was set at £2 million, of which £400,000 came from an American co-producer, Lionheart Television International. Director Martin Campbell came on board shortly afterwards and soon clashed with Troy Kennedy Martin, demanding rewrites, in particular {{to the notion that}} Craven had known about Emma's involvement with GAIA right from the start; this was removed at Campbell's behest. Further clashes over the script occurred between Kennedy Martin and star Bob Peck over the conclusion in which his character would turn into a tree; Peck recalled that “it didn't seem to be working in script terms, it seemed as though we wouldn't {{be able to make it}} work for the audience”, a view echoed by Michael Wearing who felt that it was “likely not to come off as an effect”. Kennedy Martin capitulated, introducing instead the concept of the black flowers seen in the finished production. However, some elements of Kennedy Martin's original vision persist in the final script: for example, in episode three, “Burden of Proof”, the ghost of Emma urges Craven, as he undergoes a breakdown, to be strong, like a tree.|$|E
60|$|Forth, then, they went, through open {{leafless}} groves {{and down}} snow-clad alleys, under the white {{face of the}} winter moon; Dick and Joanna walking hand in hand and in a heaven of pleasure; and their light-minded companion, her own <b>bereavements</b> heartily forgotten, followed a pace or two behind, now rallying them upon their silence, and now drawing happy pictures of their future and united lives.|$|R
50|$|Coppock, {{the founder}} of Trendex Research in San Antonio, Texas, was an economist. He had been asked by the Episcopal Church to {{identify}} buying opportunities for long-term investors.

He asked the church bishops how long that normally took for people, their answer was 11 to 14 months and so he used those periods in his calculation.|$|R

25|$|In the United States and Canada, a <b>bereavement</b> {{flight is}} a flight {{purchased}} when {{a close relative}} has died or is dying. <b>Bereavement</b> fares used to be offered by many airlines, but as of 2015, most have stopped providing them.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bereavement</b> flights {{often have}} {{flexible}} rules, {{and sometimes a}} reduced rate, however, {{the price of the}} fare depends on the airline.

25|$|United Airlines {{no longer}} offers <b>bereavement</b> fares, but still has more {{flexible}} options for changing and canceling flights.

6000|$|At first, as I have said, poor Mrs Gaff {{was quite}} inconsolable at the <b>bereavements</b> she had {{sustained}} {{in the loss}} of her husband and son and brother.

'They little know, who coldly talk of {{the poor}} man's <b>bereavements,</b> as a happy release from pain to the departed, and a merciful relief from expense to the survivor--they little know, I say, what the agony of those <b>bereavements</b> is.

The child had sat at his parents' feet for hours together, with his little hands patiently folded in each other, and his thin wan face raised towards them. They had seen him pine away, from day to day; and though his brief existence had been a joyless one, and he was now removed to that peace and rest which, child as he was, he had never known in this world, they were his parents, and his loss sank deep into their souls.|$|R
