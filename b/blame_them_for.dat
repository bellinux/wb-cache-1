5|$|The {{remaining}} posse {{is captured}} by Chiricahua Apache Native Americans, who <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> the alien attacks. After Ella's corpse is dumped on a fire by a Chiricahua warrior, she is resurrected and {{emerges from the}} fire. Ella reveals herself to be from another alien race, who had travelled to Earth to help resist the invaders after they destroyed her home world. The aliens, who are mining gold and abducting people to conduct experiments to find humans' weaknesses, are far stronger and more durable than humans, and have superior weaponry, but are not invulnerable. They can be stabbed and shot to death, but only Jake's gauntlet weapon or a well-aimed shot with a rifle can kill them with a single blast. Ella tells them that the aliens which previously attacked them are just scouts.|$|E
5|$|Simba {{returns to}} the Pride Lands and finds them barren because their natural {{resources}} have been squandered and abused by Scar. After witnessing Scar strike his mother Sarabi, Simba orders Scar to resign. At first thrown {{by the fact that}} he is alive, Scar soon regains composure and forces Simba to reveal that he is responsible for Mufasa's death, while cornering him at the edge of Pride Rock, hoping to subject him to a similar fate as his father. Having grown overconfident, Scar finally reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba tackles Scar and forces him into announcing this to the pride, initiating a battle between Simba's pride of lionesses, Timon, Pumbaa and Scar's army of hyenas. Simba eventually defeats Scar and throws him into a pit, where he is cornered and killed by the hyenas, who overheard Scar <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> what he'd done.

25|$|That {{evening at}} the ball, {{everyone}} makes their grand entrances and the couples dance. Henry has developed a crush on a girl named Violet and, after encouragement from David, introduces himself and shares his iPod Nano with Violet. Leroy is able to convince Belle to stop worrying about Rumpelstiltskin and gets her to join the dance. However, the event is about to end early when Percival reveals that he had witnessed Regina slaughter his entire family as a child. He also reveals that knows {{that she is the}} Evil Queen and not the Savior, a fact he confirmed earlier by observing her through the enchanted necklace, and that he kept all of this from Arthur because he would have prevented him from killing Regina. Percival tries to kill Regina, but Robin steps in and fights him, only to be stabbed in the process before David kills Percival. Regina is desperate to save Robin, but her magic does not work due to an enchantment spell placed on Percival's sword. This prompts Regina to ask Emma to help save Robin by using her magic, but Hook does not want Emma to trigger her dark side. Meanwhile, King Arthur does not <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> Percival's death, saying that his action was inexcusable, and admits that he suspected Regina's identity, but says that Camelot is a place of second chances. He later confesses to Guinevere that he thinks that there is something suspicious about the new arrivals, but he has to trust them, as they are his only hope of freeing Merlin and finding the missing piece of Excalibur. Emma eventually decides to help Regina despite the risk, but the magic triggers her vision of Rumpelstiltskin, who warns her that a price has to be paid if she saves Robin's life. Emma ignores the manifestation and uses her magic to save Robin, but in the process it triggers the darkness in her, as forewarned by Hook, with Emma's hand beginning to resemble that of a Dark One's.|$|E
500|$|Rabbits {{have long}} been {{associated}} with bad luck on Portland; use of the name is still taboo—the creatures are {{often referred to as}} [...] "underground mutton", [...] "long-eared furry things" [...] or just [...] "bunnies". The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers: they would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would pack up and go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured. Local fishermen too would refuse to go to sea if the word was mentioned.|$|E
500|$|According to Miguel, Jive marketed {{him as a}} [...] "typical R artist" [...] {{during their}} {{promotion}} of All I Want Is You: [...] "That album was a huge learning experience. I left the marketing of my album and me as an artist up to {{the discretion of the}} label ... I can't really <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> , because that's what they know. But that's not what my lifestyle was." [...] Four singles were released from the album: the title track [...] "All I Want Is You", [...] "Sure Thing", [...] "Quickie", and [...] "Girls Like You". As the title track gradually received radio airplay, Miguel began touring as a supporting act for Usher and Trey Songz. By May 2011, [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] and [...] "Sure Thing" [...] had reached a combined digital/mobile sales of over 825,000 units.|$|E

500|$|Reasons {{cited for}} the failure of the Dreamcast include hype for the PS2; a lack of support from EA and Squaresoft, {{considered}} the most popular third-parties in the U.S. and Japan respectively; disagreement among Sega executives over the company's future, and Okawa's lack of commitment to the product; Sega's lack of advertising money, with Bellfield doubting that Sega spent even [...] "half" [...] the $100 million it had pledged to promote the Dreamcast in the U.S.; that the market was not yet ready for online gaming; Sega's focus on [...] "hardcore" [...] gamers over the mainstream consumer; and poor timing. Perhaps the most frequently cited reason is the damage to Sega's reputation caused by several previous poorly supported Sega platforms. Writing for GamePro, Blake Snow stated that [...] "The much beloved console launched years ahead of the competition but ultimately struggled to shed the negative reputation [...] had gained during the Saturn, Sega 32X, and Sega CD days. As a result, casual gamers and jaded third-party developers doubted Sega's ability to deliver." [...] Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead noted that the [...] "wait and see" [...] approach of consumers and the lack of support from EA were symptoms rather the cause of Sega's decline, concluding [...] "Sega's misadventures during the 1990s had left both gamers and publishers wary of any new platform bearing its name." [...] According to 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish, [...] "While {{it would be easy to}} point an accusatory finger at Sony and <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> killing the Dreamcast by overselling the PS2... there's a certain level of intellectual dishonesty in such a stance... 's poor U.S. support for hardware like the Sega CD, the 32X, and the Saturn made gamers gun shy. Many consumers felt burned after investing in expensive Sega machines and finding the resulting libraries comparatively lacking".|$|E
2500|$|There is anecdotal {{evidence}} that many Americans {{complain about the}} presence of homeless people, <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> their situation, and feel that their requests for money or support (usually via begging) are unjustified. In the 1990s, particularly, many observers and media articles spoke of [...] "compassion fatigue" [...] a belief that the public had grown weary of this seemingly intractable problem.|$|E
2500|$|He {{often said}} that even within the narrow {{boundaries}} of the concentration camps he found only two races of Men to exist: decent ones and unprincipled ones. These were {{to be found in}} all classes, ethnicities, and groups. [...] "Under such conditions, who could <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> trying to dope themselves?" [...] "These were the men who were employed in the gas chambers and crematoriums, and who knew very well that one day they would have to leave their enforced role of executioner and become victims themselves." ...|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, many {{planners}} felt that modernism's clean lines {{and lack of}} human scale sapped vitality from the community, <b>blaming</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> high crime rates and social problems.|$|R

2500|$|Following the {{breaking}} of the curse, Emma is still in shock at realizing her parents are fairy tale characters. In revenge for imprisoning Belle, Mr. Gold sends a wraith to kill Regina; however, Emma is able to use Jefferson's hat to open a portal to the Enchanted Forest to banish it. However, the wraith pulls her and Snow into the portal. David takes Emma's place as sheriff to maintain order in Storybrooke, especially after it's revealed that magic being brought to town causes everyone to forget their true selves once they cross the townline. Regina attends sessions with Archie to help better herself and become a worthy mother for Henry. In the Enchanted Forest, Emma and Snow are captured by Mulan and Aurora, who <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> the wraith killing Prince Phillip; the hostility between them is extinguished due to the threat of Regina's mother, Cora, and Captain Hook, who are wishing to head to Storybrooke (Cora for Regina; Hook for revenge on Mr. Gold).|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 Mark Katz's article [...] "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," [...] {{stated that}} [...] "very few women [...] battle; the matter {{has been a}} topic of {{conversation}} among hip-hop DJs for years." [...] In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states [...] "the male-centricity of EDM culture" [...] contributes to [...] "a marginalisation of women in these [...] spaces." [...] While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as [...] "male technophilia." [...] Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: [...] "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field … is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put {{the burden of proof}} entirely on women and to <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values. An equally challenging question is why and how boys have come to love things technical, how boys have historically been socialized as technophiles." ...|$|E
2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I knew I did have to focus on defending myself.|$|E
5000|$|Father Handy {{thinks of}} the phrase in {{reference}} {{to millions of people}} killed by nerve gas. He then subverts the phrase to [...] "de mortuis nil nisi malum" [...] in <b>blaming</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> complacently voting in the politicians responsible.|$|R

2500|$|Focus on the Family {{ministry}} sponsors {{the monthly}} conference Love Won Out, where participants hear [...] "powerful stories of ex-gay men and women." [...] Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) has protested against {{the conference in}} Orlando, questioning both its methodology and supposed success. In regards to the conference, Dobson has stated that [...] "Gay activists come with preconceived notions {{about who we are}} and what we believe and about the hate that boils from within, which is simply not true. Regardless of what the media might say, Focus on the Family has no interest in promoting hatred toward homosexuals or anyone else. We also don't wish to deprive them of their basic constitutional rights... The Constitution applies to all of us." [...] Dobson strongly opposes the movement to legitimize same-sex relationships. In his book Bringing Up Boys, Dobson states, [...] "he disorder is not typically 'chosen.' Homosexuals deeply resent being told that they selected this same-sex inclination in pursuit of sexual excitement or some other motive. It is unfair, and I don't <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> being irritated by that assumption. Who among us would knowingly choose a path that would result in alienation from family, rejection by friends, disdain from the heterosexual world, exposure to sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, and even a shorter lifespan?" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to some reports, {{the police}} {{actions on the}} protesters has {{resulted}} in a breakdown of citizens' trust in the previously respected police force. The police deny accusations that they failed to act diligently. The media have reported on individuals who have quit their jobs, or students abroad who have rushed home {{to become a part of}} history, and one protester saw this as [...] "the best and last opportunity for Hong Kong people's voices to be heard, as Beijing's influence grows increasingly stronger". Police officers have been working 18-hour shifts to the detriment of their family lives. Front line police officers, in addition to working long hours, being attacked and abused on the streets, are under unprecedented stress at home. Psychologists working with police officers in the field report that some felt humiliated as they may have been unfriended on Facebook, and family may <b>blame</b> <b>them</b> <b>for</b> their perceived roles in suppressing the protests. Although the media has often dubbed it [...] "Asia's Finest", the reputation of the police has taken a serious drubbing following the heavy-handed treatment of protesters, as well as police brutality captured on camera and made viral. Andy Tsang, the police commissioner appointed in 2011, is held responsible for the procedural escalation of police violence in the face of protesters, through deployment of riot police and 87 instances in which tear gas was released; dispersal of unarmed students also caused disquiet among senior police staffers.|$|E
