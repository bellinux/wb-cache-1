5|$|Parts of Greece were {{occupied}} by the Allied Entente forces, but Constantine I refused to modify his policy and faced increasingly open opposition from the Entente and the Venizelists. In July 1916, an arson attack ravaged Tatoi Palace and the royal family barely escaped the flames; Alexander was not injured but his mother narrowly saved Princess Katherine <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> her through the woods {{for more than two}} kilometers. Among the palace personnel and firefighters who arrived to deal with the blaze, sixteen people were killed.|$|E
5|$|The British {{military}} {{was surprised by}} the attack on Convoy Faith, as it had been believed that the Condors no longer posed a serious threat. In response, the convoy route between Britain and Africa was moved to the west. The German Condor force attempted to repeat its success against Convoy Faith <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> out similar attacks on other convoys, but sustained heavy losses from Allied anti-aircraft guns and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{attempted}} {{to build on}} their success against Convoy Faith <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> out further medium-altitude attacks on convoys. III./KG 40 sank another four ships between July and September 1943, but suffered heavy losses from Allied aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. From October, Heinkel He177s largely took over the Condors' anti-shipping role, and the last Condor sorties were made over the Atlantic in early 1944.|$|E

5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E
5|$|With the {{fighting}} at an end, {{the task of}} bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.

On 20December, 3,000troops boarded her and departed France for Newport News, arriving there on 1January 1919. Among those carried were Major General Charles T. Menoher, the newly appointed chief of the air service, and elements of the 39th Infantry Division. The Matoika arrived with another 2,000troops on 11February.|$|E
5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April, Breckinridge made daily {{visits to}} an ailing Henry Clay. Clay died June 29, 1852, and Breckinridge {{garnered}} nationwide praise and enhanced popularity in Kentucky after eulogizing Clay in the House. Days later, {{he spoke in}} opposition to increasing a subsidy to the Collins Line for carrying trans-Atlantic mail, noting that Collins profited <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> passengers and cargo on mail ships. In wartime, the government could commandeer and retrofit Collins's steamboats as warships, but Breckinridge cited Commodore Matthew C. Perry's opinion {{that they would be}} useless in war. Finally, he showed Cornelius Vanderbilt's written statement promising to build a fleet of mail ships at his expense and carry the mail for $4 million less than Collins. Despite this, the House approved the subsidy increase.|$|E
5|$|Dutton {{joined the}} Calgary Canadians of Alberta's Big-4 League for the 1920–21 season, then moved onto the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) in 1921–22 where he scored 16 goals and 21 points in 22 games. Two seasons later, in 1923–24, Dutton and the Tigers won the WCHL championship. He {{assisted}} on the championship winning goal in a 2–0 {{victory over the}} Regina Capitals <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> the puck {{the length of the}} ice before passing to Cully Wilson who scored.

5|$|Following {{this the}} unit became {{involved}} in largely defensive operations as the 1st Special Service Brigade dug in. Nevertheless they kept up {{the pressure on the}} Germans <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> out offensive patrols, small scale raids and sniping. In mid-July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. No. 3 Commando was involved in this advance, moving to Varaville where they caught up with the German rearguard and proceeded to clear the village. The advance continued into the following month and on 19 August they were ordered to seize the high ground to the north of Dozule. Attacking at night, the brigade advanced with No. 3 Commando leading the main body behind the vanguard and was able to infiltrate the German positions before the lead sections ran into the German headquarters units.|$|E
5|$|Male spiders {{identify}} themselves {{by a variety}} of complex courtship rituals to avoid being eaten by the females. Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans. Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs. Females of many species care for their young, for example <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> them around or by sharing food with them. A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals. Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing. Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|One of the zoo's famous {{inhabitants}} {{during the}} post-war period was Voytek, a Syrian brown bear. Voytek {{had been sold}} {{to a group of}} Polish soldiers during the war. He learned to help the soldiers <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> crates of ammunition, and became an unofficial mascot. In 1944 the Polish II Corps sailed to Italy to join the British 8th Army. Voytek had to be officially drafted into the Polish army in order to secure his passage on a British transport ship. In 1946 the II Corps were demobilised and settled in Scotland, at Winfield Camp near Hutton, Berwickshire. Voytek retired to Edinburgh Zoo in 1947 and lived there until his death in 1963. During his time in the army Voytek had developed a liking for cigarettes, and this may have contributed to his popularity as an attraction at the zoo.|$|E

5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the air pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E
5|$|These {{aircraft}} {{were due}} to become obsolete in the late 1950s, and the RAN considered purchasing modern aircraft of French or Italian design, which were better suited to light carrier operations than equivalent British aircraft, or replace Melbourne with a larger carrier. Instead of pursuing either alternative, the Australian government announced in 1959 that Melbourne would be reconfigured during her 1963 refit to operate as a helicopter carrier. The fixed-wing aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm were marked for replacement by 27 Westland Wessex anti-submarine helicopters. A reduction of embarked plane numbers to four Sea Venoms and six Gannets, along with regular rotation and careful use of the aircraft, extended their service life until the mid-1960s, while {{the size of the}} air group was maintained <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> up to ten Wessex helicopters. The decision to retire the fixed-wing component of the Fleet Air Arm was rescinded in 1963, and on 10 November 1964, a AU£212million increase in defence spending included the purchase of new aircraft for Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{proposed}} {{building a}} dock accessed by the railway for export of coal, iron and limestone, and import of hay, grain and vegetables for the mining districts. The idea was also attractive to railway developers of the period. The Ogmore Valley Railway Company wanted to increase revenue <b>by</b> <b>carrying</b> coal for shipment to the docks at Cardiff and Penarth. H. Voss, the engineer of the Ely Valley Railway Company and the Great Western Railway, also saw its commercial potential, {{and made a}} proposal to Jenner of Wenvoe Castle to build a dock at Barry, {{the largest in the}} district, which would be connected by rail to Peterston-super-Ely on the main South Wales line.|$|E
