40|$|The study {{seeks to}} unveil the {{operational}} forces surrounding and compelling gangsterism and sycophancy in Nigerian politics {{by examining the}} level of influence economics has on politics as the two concepts are very highly dependent. Political decisions tend to be overwhelmingly influenced by economic benefits. The primary cause of restiveness, communal and ethnic clashes, tension and class antagonism {{is believed to be}} largely defined by economic factors. This state of affairs has impacted negatively on the ideological foundations of political parties in Nigeria and has given vent to the formation of gangs and sycophantic groups within the political parties with the principal aim, though latent, of looting the national treasury. The activities of the gangs and the sycophantic groups in Nigeria currently appear to be uncontrollable and seem to steer the wheel of governance in the Nigerian polity. This is detrimental to democratic and economic institutional development in Nigeria. The country’s electoral system, therefore, needs an overhaul. The Electoral Commission should encourage and bring to <b>bear</b> <b>strategies</b> that will engender ideological principles in Nigerian political parties. The media, as the vanguard and watchdog of the society, should re-evaluate its role and in the circumstance, elect to be independent and astutely critical in its holistic delivery of the needs and demands of democracy...|$|R

The results indicate that market timing does lead to a lower variability of returns than a buy-and-hold strategy.

40|$|We {{argue that}} strategizing {{fundamentally}} concerns disequilibrium phenomena, such as discovery, innovation, resource-combination, imagination - in short, entrepreneurship. Therefore, {{the understanding of}} strategizing {{is likely to be}} led astray by drawing too heavily on equilibrium theories. Arguably, the three dominant economic approaches to strategy - the Porter industry analysis approach, the new industrial organization, and the ressourcebased approach - are characterized precisely by their strong reliance on equilibrium methodology. We argue that the market process approach in its Austrian version offers much inspiration for bringing process issues to <b>bear</b> on <b>strategy</b> issues.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} the problematic of derivatives {{which can be}} applicable for commodity risk hedging. The futures contracts and options are utilized for hedging commodity risk on oil market. For purposes of this work is designed a trading strategy, which consists of exponential moving average and expiration cycle of the options. The strategy is tested on historical oil prices. Because the strategy shows promising outputs it was employed on setting options strategy as well. The hedging options strategy collar is tested on historical prices of oil. Testing on historical prices discovered that it is profitable for processor to hedge the oil price by futures contracts. For producer it is more profitable to hedge the price by employing standard collar strategy. On the other side the <b>bear</b> collar <b>strategy</b> generated quite unconvincing outputs for processor.

40|$|Urban {{water supply}} systems may be managed through supply-side and demand-side strategies, which focus on water source {{expansion}} and demand reductions, respectively. Supply-side <b>strategies</b> <b>bear</b> infrastructure and energy costs, while demand-side <b>strategies</b> <b>bear</b> costs of implementation and inconvenience to consumers. To evaluate {{the performance of}} demand-side strategies, the participation and water use adaptations of consumers should be simulated. In this study, a Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) framework is developed to simulate consumer agents that change their consumption to affect the withdrawal from the water supply system, which, in turn influences operational policies and long-term resource planning. Agent-based models are encoded to represent consumers and a policy maker agent and are coupled with water resources system simulation models. The CAS framework is coupled with an evolutionary computation-based multi-objective methodology to explore tradeoffs in cost, inconvenience to consumers, and environmental impacts for both supply-side and demand-side strategies. Decisions are identified to specify storage levels in a reservoir that trigger: (1) increases in the volume of water pumped through inter-basin transfers from an external reservoir; and (2) drought stages, which restrict the volume of water that is allowed for residential outdoor uses. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for Arlington, Texas, water supply system to identify non-dominated strategies for an historic drought decade. Results demonstrate that pumping costs associated with maximizing environmental reliability exceed pumping costs associated with minimizing restrictions on consumer water use...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to re-specifying {{a number of}} the phenomena of interest to organisational studies in terms of patterns of socio-material practices and their effects. It does so by outlining a vocabulary and strategy that make up a framework for theorising work and organisational practices. The vocabulary is based on number of sensitising concepts that connote practice as an open-ended, heterogeneous accomplishment which takes place within a specific horizon of sense and a set of concerns which the practice itself brings to <b>bear.</b> The <b>strategy</b> is based on the metaphorical movement of "zooming in" and "zooming out of" practice. The zooming in and out are obtained through switching theoretical lenses and repositioning in the field, so that certain aspects of the practice are fore-grounded while others are bracketed. Building on the results of an extended study of telemedicine, the paper discusses in detail the different elements of the framework and how it enhances our capacity to re-present practice. The paper concludes with some considerations on how the proposed approach can assist us in advancing the research agenda of organizational and work studies...|$|R

40|$|After the September 11 attacks, {{several major}} newswires {{reported}} that there were insiders who tried to profiteer from the futures market {{in anticipation of the}} event. We use the Student’s t-statistics and several non-parametric statistics to test whether there was abnormal trading in S&P 500 (SPX) index options prior to the September 11 attacks. Our findings from the out-of-the-money (OTM), at-the-money (ATM) and in-the-money (ITM) SPX index put options and ITM SPX index call options lead us to reject the null hypotheses that there was no abnormal trading in these contracts prior to the September 11 attacks. We also find evidence consistent with three bearish speculation strategies, namely the Put Purchase <b>strategy,</b> the Put <b>Bear</b> Spread <b>strategy,</b> and the Naked ITM Call Write strategy. In addition, we conclude that there is evidence of abnormal trading in the September 2001 OTM, ATM and ITM SPX index put options immediately after the 9 - 11 attacks. We also employ the CBOE VIX to confirm the conclusion drawn from the call and put options. This, in turn, is consistent with insiders anticipating the 9 - 11 attacks...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe tensor {{completion}} {{problem is}} to recover a low-n-rank tensor from a subset of its entries. The main solution strategy {{has been based on}} the extensions of trace norm for the minimization of tensor rank via convex optimization. This <b>strategy</b> <b>bears</b> the computational cost required by the singular value decomposition (SVD) which becomes increasingly expensive as the size of the underlying tensor increase. In order to reduce the computational cost, we propose a multi-linear low-n-rank factorization model and apply the nonlinear Gauss–Seidal method that only requires solving a linear least squares problem per iteration to solve this model. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can reliably solve a wide range of problems at least several times faster than the trace norm minimization algorithm...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the brown bear habitat suitability in an 8000 km 2 study area encompassing Abruzzo, Latium, and Molise regions in central-southern Italy. Based on long-term field surveys and published records, we classified bear habitat as occupied or unoccupied in 92 out of 320 sample squares (5 _ 5 km). For each sample square 36 habitat variables were measured from topographic maps and Corine land-cover III level digital maps. The influence of habitat features on bear presence was investigated by multivariate and one-way {{analyses of variance}} and by logistic regression analysis. The logistic model correctly classified 95. 5 % of sample squares of bear presence and 93. 8 % of those where bears were absent. Average altitude, deciduous woodlands and ecotone length, showed a positive relationship with bear presence, whereas vineyard-olive groves and shrublands were negatively correlated with bear presence. No specific land management guidelines or <b>strategies</b> exist for <b>bear</b> conservation in central Italy, based on knowledge of habitat–population relationships.

40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} {{superior}} returns {{can be obtained from}} a market timing investment strategy on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange that makes use of derivative instruments. Traditional timing approaches, where timed switches are made between risky equities and risk-free cash, suffer from various liquidity and cost constraints. Timing using options is proposed as a more practical and efficient alternative. Two timing <b>strategies</b> are considered: <b>bear</b> timing, where put options are purchased in an attempt to protect an equity portfolio from market downturns, and bull timing where call options are purchased to enable a pure cash investor to participate in market upturns. Fair Value Models and Black-Scholes Option Pricing Models are used to price put and call options on the All Share Index and All Share Index Future for the period 1963 - 1992. Computer simulations are used to simulate the timing decision-making processes of investors with varying abilities in forecasting market movements. The research shows that extraordinary rewards are achievable from timing strategies using options. However, superior accuracy in forecasting market movements is still a critical factor in determining success. Bear timing is preferable to bull timing in efficient and rational markets. Nonetheless, in markets where deviations from the fair value of futures contracts occur, bull timing provides large arbitrage opportunities. A <b>bear</b> timing <b>strategy</b> with a short review period would appear to offer an attractive risk/return trade-off. market timing investments hedging portfolio insurance...|$|R

Progress may require in-depth {{understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms of neutralization by monoclonal antibodies. We have analyzed the molecular actions of two rare, broadly neutralizing, human monoclonal antibodies, 4 E 10 and 2 F 5, which target the transiently exposed epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV- 1 gp 41 envelope during viral entry. Both have long CDR H 3 loops with a hydrophobic surface facing away from the peptide epitope. We find that the hydrophobic residues of 4 E 10 mediate a reversible attachment to the viral membrane {{and that they are}} essential for neutralization, but not for interaction with gp 41.
