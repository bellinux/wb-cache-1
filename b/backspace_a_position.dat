40|$|Abstract—In recent work, we {{proposed}} <b>BackSpace,</b> <b>a</b> {{new paradigm}} for using formal analysis, augmented with some onchip hardware, to support post-silicon debugging. BackSpace allows the chip {{to run at}} full speed, but then provides the effect {{of being able to}} run backwards from a crash or observed bug, computing a trace of exactly what led up to the problem. In the original paper, we presented the theoretical framework and some preliminary simulation results. This paper recapitulates the basics of the theory and then presents our results moving <b>BackSpace</b> to <b>a</b> more realistic design: an OpenRISC 1200 processor implemented in hardware (FPGA). The result is successful, we can run simple software on the processor, at full speed, but then stop the chip at arbitrary states and back up for hundreds of cycles. I...|$|R

5000|$|In early designs, some {{characters}} were produced by printing two symbols with the carriage {{in the same}} position. For instance, the exclamation point, which shares a key with the numeral 1 on modern keyboards, could be reproduced by using a three-stroke combination of <b>an</b> apostrophe, <b>a</b> <b>backspace,</b> and <b>a</b> period. A semicolon ( [...] ;) was produced by printing a comma ( [...] ,) over a colon (:). <b>As</b> the <b>backspace</b> key is slow in simple mechanical typewriters (the carriage was heavy and optimized {{to move in the}} opposite direction), a more professional approach was to block the carriage by pressing and holding the space bar while printing all characters that needed to be in <b>a</b> shared <b>position.</b> To make this possible, the carriage was designed to advance forward only after releasing the space bar.|$|R

50|$|Pressing the <b>backspace</b> key on <b>a</b> {{computer}} terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or <b>Backspace,</b> <b>a</b> control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code {{could also be}} accessed by pressing Control-H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which {{did not have the}} backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H) when the backspace key was pressed. Even if a terminal did interpret backspace by deleting the preceding character, the system receiving the text might not. Then, the sender's screen would show a message without the supposedly deleted text, while that text, and the deletion codes, would be visible to the recipient. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough; in this case, however, the ^H symbol is faked by typing a regular '^' key followed by typing a regular 'H' key.|$|R

Their boss Yaga tells Patti to look for incoming rejections. At the headquarters of a newspaper company, its CEO rejects a design proposal for a cartoon man named Mustacki, sending the file to the trash and emptying it. After Mustacki is sent to Backspace, Patti calls Yaga for a hovercraft so they can fly him throughout the world. Patti and her workers explain that there are three types of deletions: [...] "good-bad" [...] ones, which are sent back; [...] "lousy-bad" [...] ones, which are counseled and repaired; and [...] "evil-bad" [...] ones, which are tortured and shredded. Patti becomes distracted by a group of singing cubes, called soundcubes, and leaves the brothers to explain that [...] "Krampses" [...] are a group of [...] "evil-bad" [...] deletions whom are difficult to purge. Herschel tells that Ranklin, leader of the Krampses, was captured by Sweatpants, but Sweatpants suggests that it was actually Herschel who did so.|$|R

40|$|With the {{ever-increasing}} {{complexity of}} integrated circuits, {{the elimination of}} all design errors before fabrication is becoming more difficult. This increases the need to find design errors in chips after fabrication. This task, termed post-silicon debug, can be made easier if it is possible to obtain a trace of states that leads to <b>a</b> known state. <b>BackSpace,</b> <b>a</b> proposal for a new debug infrastructure which provides such a trace has been recently presented. BackSpace combines formal analysis with on-chip instrumentation. In this thesis, we show that BackSpace can be made practical by modifying the architecture and debug flow to address the area overhead, and also by addressing on-chip realities such as non-determinism and signal propagation delay. Additionally, this thesis describes a proof-of-concept implementation of a complex processor instrumented with the debug architecture and shows that BackSpace can produce traces hundreds of cycles long. Our results indicate that the area overhead of the breakpoint circuit, a main component of the debug architecture, can be reduced to 5 % for our prototype, while still allowing the debug flow to create state-accurate traces. ii Table of Contents Abstract [...] i...|$|R
