5|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was fifteen minutes in length, {{and was used}} to set positions eleven through to sixteen. It was once again topped by Nico Rosberg, {{who was the first}} person to set a time under 1:43.000 all weekend. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton locked his brakes on the approach to turn 7, damaging his race tyres. Hamilton narrowly avoided elimination, setting a time good enough to proceed on his last attempt. Romain Grosjean was eliminated in eleventh, having overcome issues with his <b>brake</b> <b>balance.</b> Nico Hülkenberg was a surprise elimination in twelfth, having run consistently at the front of the field throughout the weekend. His elimination was attributed to a miscommunication between himself and his engineer over the amount of fuel he had on board. Carlos Sainz Jr. and Fernando Alonso finished thirteenth and fourteenth to fill the seventh row of the grid, ahead of Gutiérrez.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher revealed that his early pit stop was down to a possible sensor failure which caused his team to receive misinformation. He also added that the wet-weather conditions forced him to change the entire <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> towards {{the front of his}} car. Barrichello said that he informed Ferrari technical director Ross Brawn that it would be quicker to make an extra pit stop had it rained for ten more laps. Nevertheless, he stated that he trusted his team in their judgement and revealed his car developed an clutch issue during the Grand Prix. Fisichella stated that he was driving a conservative race as he was on a one-stop strategy. Additionally, he praised the team for their achieving a continued run of consistent podium position finishes at the circuit.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{achieved}} {{his sixth}} pole {{position of the}} season, and his first at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 13.014 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Alonso, with teammate Massa in third, giving Ferrari their best qualifying performance of the season. Webber {{had not been able to}} use his car's KERS and qualified fourth, four-tenths of a second behind Vettel. Hamilton and Button qualified in fifth and seventh respectively and McLaren blamed the slow pace on too high levels of downforce on the high-speed circuit. The Mercedes drivers qualified in sixth and eighth, and Heidfeld and Vitaly Petrov completed the top ten. Paul di Resta was in 11th position, ahead of fellow rookies Pastor Maldonado and Kobayashi. Adrian Sutil struggled with grip throughout the session and was 14th; following him were Sébastien Buemi, Barrichello and de la Rosa. Jaime Alguersuari qualifying in 18th complained of insufficient grip and <b>brake</b> <b>balance,</b> and at the back of the grid were the Lotus, HRT and Virgin drivers. D'Ambrosio did not qualify after failing to set a time within 107% in the first qualifying session. However the stewards allowed him to race, having considered he was using a new chassis after an accident in Friday practice, where he had set faster lap times.|$|E

25|$|The Corvair's sales {{exceeded}} 200,000 {{for each}} of its first six model years. The rear-engine design offered packaging and economy advantages, providing the car with a lower silhouette, flat passenger compartment floor, removing the need for power assists, and offered improvements in ride quality, traction, and <b>braking</b> <b>balance.</b> The design also attracted customers of other makes, primarily imports. The Corvair stood out, with engineering significantly different from other American offerings. It used GM's Z-body, with design and engineering that advanced the rear-engine, rear-wheel drive layout pioneered by cars including the Tatra 77, Tucker Torpedo, Porsche 356, Volkswagen Beetle, Renault Dauphine, Subaru 360, and NSU Prinz—and employed by the concurrent and short-lived Hino Contessa.|$|R

25|$|Later Senna, in a rain-soaked Monaco GP (Rd.6), he {{finished}} {{in a close}} 2nd place behind Alain Prost, whose McLaren MP4/2 was suffering from a <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> problem that Prost reported was getting worse with each lap. In the wet conditions the McLaren's carbon front brakes were not generating heat and, as a result, were locking up with increasing regularity {{over the last few}} laps; this led the Frenchman, who had re-taken the lead on lap 15 following Nigel Mansell's crash, to drive slower and slower. The torrential conditions forced the clerk of the course (Jacky Ickx) to stop the race after 31 of the scheduled 78 laps. It was a controversial decision as Ickx had not consulted the race stewards before holding out the red flag, and one that stirred up a conspiracy theory. Prost's McLaren was powered by the Porsche designed TAG engine and Ickx was the lead driver for the factory backed Rothmans Porsche Group C Sports car team, and it was rumored that the Belgian had stopped the race to ensure the Porsche engined car won. The early stopping of the race resulted in much debate about whether Senna would have won. It was also reported by Toleman that Senna's suspension was on the point of collapse after an earlier incident and his consistent running over the curbs at the Chicane du Port, with the team believing that the damage was sufficient to cause his retirement within 2-3 laps of when competition was halted. Senna set the fastest lap of the race, his first in Formula One, but wasn't the quickest on the circuit {{at the time of the}} red flag. Catching both Prost and Senna was the Cosworth powered Tyrrell of West German driver Stefan Bellof who, while finishing third on the road, was later disqualified when the entire Tyrrell team was disqualified from the 1984 season due to technical infringements.|$|E
500|$|The two Sauber {{drivers were}} eighth and ninth with Heidfeld {{in front of}} Räikkönen; Heidfeld was happy with his {{position}} after losing track time on Friday while Räikkönen complained {{that he had been}} blocked by Fisichella who was on an out lap. de la Rosa rounded out the top ten qualifiers and was happy after Jaguar engineer Humphrey Corbett corrected an issue with understeer on de la Rosa's car. Button took eleventh position and reported that his Benetton was well balanced. Frentzen took twelfth and said his qualifying position was more significant than his fourth-place finish in the Belgian Grand Prix. Irvine struggled with <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> which shifted towards the rear of his Jaguar which meant he managed thirteenth. He also was unable to set a faster time after Olivier Panis blocked him by driving to the first corner apex and stopped his car. Fisichella used his Benetton team's spare car because his race car developed an hyradulic failure in practice but had an engine issue in the spare car which restricted him to fourteenth. BAR drivers Jacques Villeneuve and Panis took the fifteenth and seventeenth positions and both reported that {{there was a lack of}} aerodynamic grip but mechanical grip was fine. The two were separated by Alesi in the slower of the two Jordan cars and described his session as [...] " [...] the worst qualifying session I could imagine on a circuit which love" [...] because he had <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> and handling issues. Verstappen and Bernoldi took the eighteenth and nineteenth positions for the Arrows team. Enge set the twentieth fastest time in his first Formula One qualifying session, and had two engine problems in both his race car and the spare monocoque tuned for Frentzen. The two Minardi drivers qualified at the rear of the field with Fernando Alonso ahead of Yoong; both drivers stopped on their out laps with gearbox actuator failures and were required to share the spare Minardi car.|$|E

40|$|International audience— A novel robotic device, {{aimed at}} {{assisting}} a urol-ogist in performing prostate biopsies guided by an endorectal ultrasound probe, is described. The paper describes the robot kinematics and the actuation system. The actuation system combines electromagnetic <b>brakes,</b> <b>balancing</b> springs, and electrical motors with cable transmissions. The robot supports two modes of operation: the free mode, where the entire {{control of the}} probe movements is left to the urologist, and the blocked mode, where the robot precisely maintains the probe at a given position and orientation {{with respect to the}} prostate. For the blocked mode, the set of specifications is antagonistic: firstly, a security constraint requires a low robot stiffness to allow to compliantly adapt to potential movements from the patient; secondly, a precision constraint requires a high robot stiffness {{in order to maintain the}} position and orientation of the probe in the presence of unmodeled external forces, when the robot is switched from the free mode to the blocked mode. A control strategy is developed to obtain this behavior. It combines an inner impedance controller with a relatively low stiffness and an outer intelligent position integrator that operates only during a limited period of time, when switching from the free mode to the blocked mode. Both in vitro and in cadavero experimental results show the efficiency of this approach...|$|R
50|$|Car tuning {{was also}} introduced, which allowed any cars {{handling}} to be customized by adjusting low or high end properties for engine tuning and gear ratios, front or back <b>brake</b> <b>balance,</b> slow or fast braking speed, soft or stiff suspension, low or high aerodynamics {{as well as}} rain or racing tires. Any of these options could be modified via sliders to offer a digit-sensitive, percentage-based effect to the selected cars overall performance. Higher-end engine and gear tuning, for example, will compromise acceleration for better tops speeds. Rear-based <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> and slow braking speeds make for wider, drifting turns, and aerodynamics provide even higher speeds {{at the loss of}} handling.|$|E
50|$|All drivers use {{the same}} chassis specifications, as well as engines, tires and other major parts. Alterations are {{prohibited}} and are a subject of strict control of technical scrutineers.

5000|$|Formula BMW was {{strictly}} a [...] "control" [...] formula. This term describes a formula {{in which every}} major aspect of equipment and suppliers is restricted. Control formulae normally have only one chassis specification, one engine, and single suppliers of tires and fuel. Modifications to the chassis, bodywork and engine are not permitted and this is strictly enforced through scrutineering. In the case of Formula BMW, tuning is restricted to basic adjustment of the gear ratios, suspension, <b>brake</b> <b>balance,</b> and wing angles. The engines are sealed to prevent illegal modifications and are serviced by Schnitzer Motorsport.|$|E

50|$|The {{hand brake}} was {{originally}} {{intended for use}} in case of mechanical failure where the regular footbrake was inoperable or compromised (hence the emergency brake name). Modern brake systems are typically very reliable and equipped with dual-circuit hydraulics and low-brake-fluid sensor systems. Using the hand brake in any emergency is likely to badly upset the <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> {{of the car and}} vastly increase the likelihood of loss of control of the vehicle, for example by initiating a rear-wheel skid. Additionally, the stopping force provided by using the handbrake is small and would not significantly aid in stopping the vehicle. Therefore it is generally unadvisable to use the hand brake for slowing down a vehicle if the footbrake is still operational.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the second}} round of stops, the final order of finish was nearly determined. While most of the field slowed to {{conserve}} engines, Alonso continued pushing hard on Barrichello's heels. Barrichello, despite battling a <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> problem, was able to answer the challenge, and held off Alonso for second. Fisichella, who flawlessly managed the gap to his nearest opponent all race long, easily took the chequered flag for his second career victory, with his only other victory coming for Jordan in [...] He never put a foot wrong, and his R25 chassis, although not seriously challenged, performed flawlessly to claim the inaugural race of the season. Teammate Alonso clocked the fastest lap of the race, and was noticeably the fastest car on track for most of the event.|$|E
5000|$|Deliberate skids {{are used}} in {{aerobatics}} and aerial combat. Deliberate slips done with vigorous application of roll and opposite rudder (lower the right wing and step on the left rudder) {{can be used as}} a dive <b>brake.</b> By <b>balancing</b> the roll's turn to the right with the rudder's yaw to the left, the plane continues to fly straight ahead but it presents its side rather than its nose to the airstream. The drag from this aerodynamically [...] "dirty", clumsy position slows the otherwise sleek airplane. By modulating the amount of skid with rudder and aileron, the pilot can modulate the braking. Thus the plane can be slowed down quickly in level flight or the descent to a landing can be dramatically steepened while holding the approach speed to a desired value.|$|R

40|$|Conventional brakes {{require a}} {{powerful}} actuator, leading to large, heavy {{and in most}} cases energy consuming brakes. This paper introduces a fundamen-tally different brake concept called statically <b>balanced</b> <b>brakes</b> (SBBs). SBBs do not require any actuation force to maintain a braking torque and only have to move a small mass to vary that torque. Therefore, their energy consumption is potentially very low. In an SBB, one of the two friction surfaces is connected through springs to a braking block. This braking block is connected through a mechanism to a second set of springs, the other side of which connects to the ground. The total energy in the two sets of springs is constant, which results in a zero-force characteristic at the braking block. The position of this statically <b>balanced</b> <b>braking</b> block determines the displacement of the first set of springs and thus the normal force between the friction surfaces. We categorize mech-anisms {{that can be used in}} SBBs and show two embodiments: one with leaf springs with a range of positions with negative stiffness and one with torsion springs and a non-linear cam mechanism. Results show that the actuation force can be reduced by approximately 95 - 97 % in comparison to regular brakes. This shows that in SBBs, the actuation force can be almost eliminated and thus showing the potential of SBBs to be small, lightweight and energy efficient...|$|R

50|$|The GT3 R {{has adopted}} {{the concept of}} the central {{radiator}} from its 911 RSR big brother. By eliminating the side radiators, the position of the centre of gravity is improved, the radiator is better protected against collision damage, and the venting of hot air through louvres in the front cover is enhanced. The two-metre wide rear wing lends aerodynamic balance and distinctive wheel arch air vents on the front fairings increase downforce at the front axle. The GT3 R's front McPherson strut suspension and multi-link rear suspension are adjustable in height, camber and toe, and there are adjustable anti-roll bar blades at both ends. All wheel hubs come with centre-lock wheel nuts. There are two separate brake circuits for the front and rear axles; driver adjustable via a <b>brake</b> <b>balance</b> bar system.

40|$|Autophagy, {{a highly}} {{regulated}} catabolic process, {{is controlled by}} the action of positive and negative regulators. While many of the positive mediators of autophagy have been identified, very little is known about negative regulators that might counterbalance the process. We recently identified death-associated protein 1 (DAP 1) as a suppressor of autophagy and as a novel direct substrate of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). We found that DAP 1 is functionally silent in cells growing under rich nutrient supplies through mTOR-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation on two sites, which were mapped to Ser 3 and Ser 51. During amino acid starvation, mTOR activity is turned off resulting in a rapid reduction in the phosphorylation of DAP 1. This caused the conversion of the protein into a suppressor of autophagy, thus providing a buffering mechanism that counterbalances the autophagic flux and prevents its overactivation under conditions of nutrient deprivation. Based on these studies we propose the “gas and brake” concept in which mTOR, the main sensor that regulates autophagy in response to amino acid deprivation, also controls the activity of a specific <b>balancing</b> <b>brake</b> to prevent the overactivation of autophagy...|$|R
40|$|International audience: The {{purposes}} of this present research were, in the first study, to determine whether age impacts a measure of postural control: the braking force in walking, and, in a second study to determine whether exergame training in physically-simulated sport activity would show transfer, increasing the braking force in walking and also improving balance assessed by clinical measures, functional fitness, and health-related {{quality of life in}} older adults. For the second study, the authors developed an active video game training program (using the Wii system) with a pretest-training-posttest design comparing an experimental group (24 1 -hr sessions of training) with a control group. Participants completed a battery comprising <b>balance</b> (<b>braking</b> force in short and normal step conditions), functional fitness (Senior Fitness Test) and health-related quality of life (SF- 36). Results show that 12 weeks of videogame-based exercise program training improved the braking force in the normal step condition along with the functional fitness as measured by the Senior Fitness Test of lower limb strength, cardiovascular endurance, and motor agility. Only the global mental dimension of the SF- 36 was sensitive to exergame practice. Exergames appear to be an effective way to train postural control in older adults. Because of the multimodal nature of the activity, exergames provide an effective tool for remediation of age-related problems...|$|R
