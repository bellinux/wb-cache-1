25|$|Much of the {{province}} is undeveloped, so populations of many mammalian species that have become rare {{in much of the}} United States still flourish in British Columbia. Watching animals of various sorts, including a very wide range of birds, has long been popular. Bears (grizzly, blackincluding the Kermode bear or spirit bear) live here, as do deer, elk, moose, caribou, <b>big-horn</b> <b>sheep,</b> mountain goats, marmots, beavers, muskrats, coyotes, wolves, mustelids (such as wolverines, badgers and fishers), cougars, eagles, ospreys, herons, Canada geese, swans, loons, hawks, owls, ravens, harlequin ducks, and many other sorts of ducks. Smaller birds (robins, jays, grosbeaks, chickadees, and so on) also abound.|$|E
60|$|Otherwise {{sport was}} not very good. No more wapiti came up, but black and white tail deer were {{occasionally}} shot, and five or six <b>big-horn</b> <b>sheep</b> also fell to their rifles. One day on approaching the beaver meadow the chief pointed to some deep footprints. No explanation was needed. All {{knew that they were}} made by a big grizzly, and that the animal was going up the valley. No horses were in view on the flat, and grasping their rifles they hurried towards the wood. Just as they reached it the horses came galloping to meet them, whinnying and snorting.|$|E
50|$|The Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge {{includes}} <b>big-horn</b> <b>sheep,</b> pronghorn, sage grouse, predatory {{birds and}} migratory birds. The Lake County Examiner {{is located in}} Lakeview and has been published continuously since the late 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|Ernest Ingersoll {{wrote in}} his 1892 [...] "Canadian Guide Book" [...] that the {{mountain}} takes its name [...] "from the traditional story that some years ago a brave old Assiniboine woman sustained her husband, who lay sick for several months in their lodge at its base, by hunting upon its top and sides, where there are open glades which still form favourite spring feeding-places for the <b>big-horn</b> or mountain <b>sheep.</b> The name became official in 1922. The adjacent Cascade Mountain used {{to be referred to}} as Stoney Chief, though this name is now largely defunct.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} {{representative}} wildlife around Summerland includes mule deer, Canada geese, California quail, ravens, coyotes, red wolves (half coyote, half wolf), blue grouse, bald eagles, and black widow spiders. Back {{into the hills}} surrounding Summerland is natural habitat for black bear, white-tailed deer, moose, cougars and bobcats, California <b>big-horn</b> <b>sheep,</b> mountain goats, and rattlesnakes.|$|E
50|$|Native Americans {{were the}} first to utilize Rollins Pass as a natural, low {{crossing}} over the Continental Divide for the purposes of communal hunting of large game, including <b>big-horn</b> <b>sheep</b> and elk. There are more than 96 documented game drives, including the Olson Game Drive, found largely above timberline and near the summits of multiple mountain ridges. Handmade rock walls drove prey towards hunters waiting in blinds. These unique high-altitude constructs were built, refined, and continually used over millennia. Currently the game drives are being studied by Colorado State University archaeology graduate students led by Dr. Jason M. LaBelle, associate professor, Department of Anthropology, Center for Mountain and Plains Archaeology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins.|$|E
