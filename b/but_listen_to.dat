500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics who praised its party sound and Beyoncé's vocals. Chris Richards of The Washington Post {{referred to the}} track a [...] "club-hungry come-ons" [...] with a [...] "dexterous melody". He further stated that the [...] "skeletal" [...] track [...] "keeps Beyoncé tethered to the ground". Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "a piddly home hi-fi can hardly capture the thunderous grandeur of 'Get Me Bodied,' which sets Beyoncé's harmonies above a pummeling track overseen by rap producer Swiss Beatz". Tim Finney of Pitchfork Media called the track a [...] "percussive, Diwali-esque jam". Us Weekly described [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] a [...] "snappy dance number." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker noted that the song sounds [...] "anxious." [...] Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that the song {{is very similar to}} Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] (2005) and expressed further praise about [...] "Get Me Bodied", writing: [...] " [...] Beyonce’s glorified version of a 'Hollaback Girl'-type song. [...] <b>But</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> way she wails and shouts throughout the song! Gwen Stefani certainly isn’t capable of vocal gymnastics like this. When she sings [...] you can visualize beads of perspiration coming off of her as she shakes to this song." ...|$|E

He began {{singing at}} an early age: He would regularly sing at family gatherings, weddings and in his school choir. Jones did not like school or sports, but gained confidence through his singing talent. At 12 {{he was diagnosed with}} tuberculosis. Many years later he said: [...] "I spent two years in bed recovering. It was the worst time of my life." [...] During convalescence he could do little else <b>but</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> music and draw.|$|E

60|$|Lord Roehampton {{was seated}} between an ambassadress and Berengaria, indulging in gentle and sweet-voiced raillery; the Count of Ferroll was {{standing}} beside Lady Montfort, and Mr. Wilton was opposite to the group. The Count of Ferroll rarely spoke, <b>but</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> Lady Montfort {{with what she}} called one of his dark smiles.|$|R

6000|$|... "Guk-uk-uk-uk! guk-uk-uk-uk!" [...] {{was the way}} he laughed; and if {{you think}} a {{hippopotamus}} does not laugh this way you have <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> one and you will find I am right.|$|R
50|$|American {{troops had}} regular access to radio {{in all but}} the most {{difficult}} combat situations, and not only did soldiers know specific songs, but specific recordings. This gave a nature to American troops music during WWII, not as much songs sung around a fire or while marching, <b>but</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> between combat on Armed Forces Radio.|$|R
50|$|Pastorius {{is a fan}} of many genres <b>but</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> a lot of hip hop, 80's, {{and heavy}} metal.

50|$|Cuban hip hop that {{addresses}} political issues, however, are not widely commercialized. These {{types of music}} that can be <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> by all Cubans of any age, tend to stay underground and are suppressed by the government, leaving a majority of Cubans no choice <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> salsa, reggaeton, or mainstream rap.|$|R

500|$|Egan {{has said}} that he started <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> music during puberty. He was {{initially}} influenced by 1960s melodic pop such as Simon & Garfunkel, later <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> American hardcore punk such as the Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, Black Flag <b>but</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> many styles of music overall. The single [...] "Strike Me Down" [...] has been compared to MSTRKRFT and the French synthpop quartet Phoenix. Memories of a childhood show by heavy metal band Mastodon led him to write the song [...] "Phil Lynott". He also enjoys newer Irish acts such as Villagers.|$|R

60|$|It was {{delightful}} {{not to hear}} {{for an hour or}} so the sullen thrashing of the rain; <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the leaping of the fishes, {{the soft}} swirl raised by some water-rat, swimming stealthily among the rushes, the restless twitterings of the few still wakeful birds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exceedingly angry!" [...] he repeated; [...] "but {{that was}} no fault of mine. When Miss Baker sent for me, I could not but go to her. When I was there, I could not <b>but</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> her. When Caroline {{told me that she}} was wretched--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Albinia, {{this is not}} right. It is not thankful or trustful. No, do not cry, <b>but</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> me. Your {{child is}} as likely to do well as any child in the world, but nothing is so likely to do him harm as your want of composure.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alas!' sobbed Veronique, 'now she {{is getting}} to be a saint outright. She will be sure to die! Ah, Madame--dear Madame! do <b>but</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> me.

6000|$|Mat <b>listened</b> attentively <b>to</b> these words, <b>but</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> nothing more. A sturdy legal altercation {{immediately}} ensued {{between the}} two solicitors--but it hardly reached his ears. Mr. Tatt took his arm, and led him out, talking more fluently than ever; {{but he had not}} the poorest trifle of attention to bestow on Mr. Tatt. All his faculties together seemed to be absorbed by this one momentous consideration: Had he really and truly lost the last chance of tracing Arthur Carr? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll stay to {{tea with}} us, of course," [...] she said. [...] "There {{is no one}} here but mother and I, and we can talk things all over. This is my mother," [...] she said, {{presenting}} an elderly lady with a broad, placid face. She said nothing whatever during his stay, <b>but</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> all that was said with unchanging gravity. It was plain she worshipped her daughter, and never questioned what she said.|$|R
50|$|Music {{selection}} is also affected by selective exposure. A 2014 {{study conducted by}} Christa L. Taylor and Ronald S. Friedman at the SUNY University at Albany, found that mood congruence was effected by self-regulation of music mood choices. Subjects in the study chose happy music when feeling angry or neutral <b>but</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> sad music when they themselves were sad. The choice of sad music given a sad mood was due less to mood-mirroring {{but as a result}} of subjects having an aversion <b>to</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> happy music that was cognitively dissonant with their mood.|$|R
