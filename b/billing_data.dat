40|$|This article evaluates {{and compares}} “president ” and “presidency ” {{centered}} explanations of presi-dential activity {{with respect to}} one important presidential power, the veto. Using individual <b>bill</b> <b>data</b> for nine congresses characterized by divided party government, I estimate a logistic regression model of presidential vetoes. This contrasts with previous research, which has used annual aggre-gate <b>data.</b> Using individual <b>bill</b> <b>data</b> allows controls for objectionable legislation passed by Con-gress and enables me to measure and compare the “propensity to veto ” of different presidents. I conclude that presidential vetoes are in substantial measure caused by Congress passing objection-able bills, but that even controlling for congressional behavior, presidents exhibit strikingly differ-ent veto behavior. Ford was most prone to using the veto, and Reagan, the least. Although external factors exert great influence on the president’s veto decision, the individual choices and strategies of presidents also have an important influence. A paradox of the American presidency is that this office, routinely called the most powerful on Earth, is also said by many observers to allow its incumbent relatively little autonomy. Neustadt (1960) asked whether the president was a “leader or clerk. ” Similarly, recent work has focused on “president ” versus “pres...|$|R

This function is unobservable; therefore, this result opens a way to estimate the jump size directly from data in the markets together with the risk-neutral drift and jump intensity estimations. Then, we investigate the finite sample performance of this approach with a test problem. Moreover, we analyze the effect of estimating the risk-neutral jump size instead of assuming that it is artificially absorbed by the jump intensity, as usual in the interest rate literature.

40|$|Abstract. We develop two {{likelihood}} based {{approaches to}} semiparametrically estimate the time-inhomogeneous diffusion process: log penalized splines (P-splines) {{and the local}} log-linear method. Positive volatility is naturally embedded and this positivity is not guaranteed in most existing diffusion models. We investigate different smoothing parameter selection methods. Separate bandwidths are used for drift and volatility estimation. In the log P-splines approach, different smoothness for different time varying coefficients is feasible by assigning different penalty parameters. We also provide accompanying theorems for both approaches. Finally, we present a case study using the weekly three-month Treasury <b>bill</b> <b>data</b> from 1954 to 2004. We find that the log P-splines approach seems to capture the volatility dips in mid- 1960 s and mid- 1990 s the best...|$|R

Constant-coefficient models cannot capture these changes as they give rise to time-homogeneous distributions. Maximum likelihood fitting of a one-factor time-dependent Extended-CIR model of the term structure, whose closed-form solution was previously obtained by the author, shows that it can capture these changes, as well as achieve significantly higher likelihood value. It is shown that exploitation of the closed-form solutions substantially improves the accuracy and efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations over high-order discretization algorithms. It is also shown that the feasibility of exact one-to-one calibration of the model to any continuous yield curve allows valuation of bond options significantly more accurately and efficiently...|$|R
