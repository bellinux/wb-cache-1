The {{best way to}} increase the {{fuel efficiency}} without sacrificing safety is to employ fiber reinforced composite materials in the cars. Bumper is {{the one of the}} part having more weight. In this paper the existing steel bumper is replaced with composite bumper. In this work the design and fabrication of composite bumper made up of glass fiber reinforced polymer is carried out by which weight of the bumper can be reduced. Fabrication of composite bumper is carried out by hand layup process by using E- Glass / Epoxy <b>bidirectional</b> <b>laminates.</b> Composite bumper is analysed and Charpy impact tests are carried out. Compared to steel bumper, the composite bumper is found to have 64 % higher factor of safety and 80 % less in cost. From the fabrication {{it was found that the}} weight reduction of 53. 8 % is achieved using composite material without sacrificing the strength. I...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} a thin elastic <b>bidirectional</b> symmetric composite <b>laminate</b> {{subjected to a}} uniform axial strain. All interlaminar stresses are determined by a zeroth-order perturbation analysis of the governing equations. The method of solution considers the laminate to be composed of an interior region (removed from the free edge) and a boundary layer region. The interior region is analyzed by dropping terms related to powers of the thickness-to-width ratio in the dimensionless elasticity equations. The boundary layer region is studied by introducing a stretching transformation to the governing equations. A uniform solution is then formed by satisfying Prandtl's matching principle of perturbation theory. Results for a four-layer <b>bidirectional</b> graphite-epoxy <b>laminate</b> are compared with existing finite-difference results. It is shown that the perturbation analysis provides more insight into the stress distribution near the free edge...|$|R

In an effort to improve our understanding of delamination phenomena in composite bodies, an approximate method to define the distribution of the interlaminar normal stress, &sigma; 2, along the central plane of a symmetric, finite-width, composite laminate is presented. The approach is based upon a modified version of a recent theory developed by Whitney and Sun and accounts for the influence of the pertinent material and geometric parameters on the shape of the distribution. The accuracy of the approach is demonstrated by comparison with an existing three-dimensional elasticity solution. Finally, an elementary expression for &sigma;z in practical <b>bidirectional</b> <b>laminates</b> is derived...|$|R

The effectiveness of the proposed technique is assessed by comparing different confinement schemes on concrete cylinders: (1) uniaxial glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates; (2) alkali-resistant fiberglass grids bonded with a cement-based mortar; (3) <b>bidirectional</b> basalt <b>laminates</b> preimpregnated with epoxy resin or latex and then bonded with a cement-based mortar; and (4) a cement-based mortar jacket.

40|$|The {{objectives}} were to evaluate popular shear test methods for {{various forms of}} graphite-epoxy composite materials and to determine the shear response of graphite-epoxy composites with various forms of fiber architecture. Numerical and full-field experimental stress analyses were performed on four shear test configurations for unidirectional and <b>bidirectional</b> graphite-epoxy <b>laminates</b> to assess the uniformity and purity of the shear stress (strain) fields produced in the specimen test section and to determine the material in-plane shear modulus and shear response. The test methods were the 10 deg off-axis, the +/- 45 deg tension, the Iosipescu V-notch, and a compact U-notch specimen. Specimens were prepared from AS 4 / 3501 - 6 graphite-epoxy panels, instrumented with conventional strain gage rosettes and with a cross-line moire grating, and loaded in a convenient testing machine. The shear responses obtained for each test method and the two methods of specimen instrumentation were compared. In a {{second phase of the}} program the shear responses obtained from Iosipescu V-notch beam specimens were determined for woven fabric geometries of different weave and fiber architectures.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{is widely}} used to characterize damage occurring in composite materials: however, the discrimination between AE signatures due to different damage mechanisms is still an open issue. In this work, the various failure mechanisms in <b>bidirectional</b> glass/epoxy <b>laminates</b> subjected to uni-axial tension are identified using AE monitoring. AE data recorded during the tensile testing of a single layer specimen are used to identify matrix cracking and fiber failure. In contrast, delamination signals are characterized using a two layer specimen with a pre induced defect, produced by artificially inserting a 10 mm wide Teflon tape in the middle portion of the two layers. Twelve-layer GFRP laminates were also tested as a reference for the comparison of results. The procedure leading to signal discrimination involves a number of steps. First, Fuzzy C-means clustering associated with principal component analysis are used to discriminate between failure mechanisms, whilst parametric studies using AE count rate and cumulative counts allowed damage discrimination at various stages of loading. The two above methods led to AE waveform selection: on the selected waveforms, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) enabled calculating the frequency content of each damage mechanism. Continuous wavelet transform allowed identifying frequency range and time history for failure modes in each signal, whilst noise content associated with the different failure modes is calculated and removed by discrete wavelet transform.

40|$|The translaminar {{fracture}} toughness of fibre reinforced polymers (FRP) {{is important for}} characterising the failure resistance of composite structures. Measuring the translaminar {{fracture toughness}} for any possible layup is not feasible. Therefore, it is of interest to relate the translaminar toughness of a laminate to that of its plies. Numerous studies have measured the translaminar fracture toughness of composite laminates and of individual plies. However, any attempts to relate the two have so far been very limited, and restricted to initiation values. This work presents experimental and analytical research on Compact Tension (CT) tests on several T 800 s/M 21 carbon-epoxy laminates with different combinations of 0 °, ± 45 and 90 ° plies, and with various ply thicknesses. Post-mortem techniques, such as X-ray, optical and scanning electron microscopy, {{were used to determine}} the damage extent in each specimen. Acoustic emission (AE) was also used to sequence the occurrence of the failure mechanisms. Failure mechanisms found in the multidirectional laminates included a combination of the failure mechanisms found on <b>bidirectional</b> <b>laminates</b> (/ 90 °) made of its constituent plies. Ply splitting, fibre bridging and fibre pull-out were the main features characterizing the fracture surfaces. Assuming that the damage can be represented as a single crack, the resistance curve (R-curve) for each layup was extracted from these tests. From each laminate R-curve, three distinct fracture toughness values were obtained for each layup: non-linearity onset, initiation and propagation. The R-curves were used to define a trilinear cohesive law for each layup, and the specimens were then successfully simulated using a cohesive approach in a Finite Element (FE) model. On the one hand, there was good agreement supporting the representation of translaminar damage as a cohesive crack. On the other hand, damage was considerably diffuse when the laminate included substantial ply-blocking, thus suggesting that a single equivalent crack may, in some cases, neglect some important aspects of translaminar damage (as well as delamination). Four analytical predictive models were used to predict the translaminar toughness of the laminates from that of the constituent plies. The assumption of translaminar fracture toughness additivity by means of a rule of mixtures correlated best with the experimental results. The experimental results for a mode I crack propagation in a 45 ° ply were shown to corroborate a simple analytical model which relates the critical energy release rate of a 45 ° ply to those of 0 and 90 plies. Thickness size effects were investigated by using different 0 ply thicknesses, by means of 0 ° ply-blocks and using two grades of the same material system. Since it was found that excessive ply-blocking can lead to significantly diffuse damage, a second study with thin-ply TR 50 s/K 51 carbon-epoxy system was conducted, leading to the first translaminar fracture characterisation of a 0 ° CFRP ply for a range of thicknesses from 0. 03 mm to 0. 12 mm. The toughness of the 0 ° plies was confirmed to be significantly dependent on the thickness, even for ranges of thicknesses where delamination does not play a significant role. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium- {{glass fiber}} {{reinforced}} plastics (GFRP) sandwich panels are hybrid laminates consisting of GFRP bonded with thin aluminum sheets on either side. Such sandwich materials are increasingly used in airplane and automobile structures. Laminates with varying aluminium thickness fractions, fiber volume fractions and orientation in {{the layers of}} GFRP were fabricated by hand lay up method and evaluated for their impact performance by conducting drop weight tests under low velocity impacts. The impact energy required for initiating {{a crack in the}} outer aluminium layer as well as the energy required for perforation was recorded. The impact load-time history was also recorded to understand the failure behavior. The damage depth and the damage area were measured to evaluate the impact resistance. Optical photography and scanning electron micrographs were taken to visualize the crack and the damage zone. The <b>bidirectional</b> cross-ply hybrid <b>laminate</b> (CPHL) has been found to exhibit better impact performance and damage resistance than the unidirectional hybrid laminate (UDHL). Increase in aluminium thickness fraction (Altf) and fiber volume fraction (Vf) resulted in an increase in the impact energy required for cracking and perforation.

In this study, the behaviour of hemp fibre epoxy composites subjected to a low-velocity impact loading, using an instrumented falling weight impact equipment, is presented. Two types of hemp reinforcements were used: unidirectional and bi-directional fabric and three balanced laminates (0 °/ 90 °) different in thickness were studied: 4 plies, 8 plies, 12 plies. The results were compared. The laminates were fabricated by RIFT process using a common epoxy matrix. The reached volumetric fibre percentage Vf was not too high. It assumed a value of 34 % for the unidirectional reinforcement and an average value of 30 % for the <b>bidirectional</b> one. Some <b>laminates</b> were impregnated by PLA resin at the aim to obtain a completely natural system. The impact behaviour was analysed carrying out tests impacting square specimens, 100. ×. 100. mm, with a hemispherical tup geometry with a diameter of 19. 8. mm and a velocity of 4. 0. m/s. Both penetration and indentation tests were performed at the aim to investigate about the damage start and evolution. The impact induced damage, characterised by an optical microscope, includes matrix cracking, delamination, fibre breakage and fibre pullout. An interesting compressed central zone of the laminate under the impact point was noted. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
