5|$|Malaria {{is usually}} {{confirmed}} by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDT). In some areas, RDTs {{need to be able}} to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by Plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-P. falciparum infections. Microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about 165 million blood films were examined for malaria in 2010. Despite its widespread usage, diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks: many settings (especially rural) are not equipped to perform the test, and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the <b>blood</b> <b>film</b> and the levels of the parasite in the blood. The sensitivity of blood films ranges from 75–90% in optimum conditions, to as low as 50%. Commercially available RDTs are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites, but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer, and are unable to tell how many parasites are present.|$|E

MethodsGiemsa-stained thin and thick <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> were prepared from blood samples of 294 foreign migrant workers recruited in the study. Microscopic examination of these <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> was performed for malaria detection. ResultsBlood film examination revealed 1. 36 % malaria infections in these 294 subjects. All positive cases were male Myanmar workers in which their <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> only ring stage of Plasmodium spp. was found at low parasite density (mean= 144 parasites/μ L of blood). The prevalence of malaria infections was not significantly different among foreign migrant workers classified by age, gender, and resident province (P> 0. 05). Thin <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> of these workers also showed 78. 91 % hypochromic erythrocytes and 61. 9 % relative Eosinophilia. ConclusionsThese findings indicate {{a high risk of}} malaria transmission. Therefore active malaria surveillance by using molecular methods with more sensitive and specific than microscopy should be considered for malaria control in foreign migrant workers...|$|R

25|$|P. falciparum {{does not}} have a fixed {{structure}} but undergoes continuous change during the course of its life cycle. A sporozoite is spindle-shaped and 10-15 μm long. In the liver it grows into an ovoid schizont of 30-70 μm in diameter. Each schizont produces merozoites, each of which is roughly 1.5 μm in length and 1 μm in diameter. In the erythrocyte the merozoite form a ring-like structure, becoming a trophozoite. A trophozoites feed on the haemoglobin and forms a granular pigment called haemozoin. Unlike those of other Plasmodium species, the gametocytes of P. falciparum are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8-12 μm long and 3-6 μm wide. The ookinete is also elongated measuring about 18-24 μm. An oocyst is rounded and can grow up to 80 μm in diameter. Microscopic examination of a <b>blood</b> <b>film</b> reveals only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes that are in the peripheral blood. Mature trophozoites or schizonts in peripheral blood smears, as these are usually sequestered in the tissues. On occasion, faint, comma-shaped, red dots are seen on the erythrocyte surface. These dots are Maurer's cleft and are secretory organelles that produce proteins and enzymes essential for nutrient uptake and immune evasion processes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Thick <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> are {{routinely}} used to diagnose Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Here, {{they were used}} to diagnose volunteers exposed to experimental malaria challenge. Methods The frequency with which <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> were positive at given parasite densities measured by PCR were analysed. The poisson distribution was used to calculate the theoretical likelihood of diagnosis. Further in vitro studies used serial dilutions to prepare thick films from malaria cultures at known parasitaemia. Results Even in expert hands, thick <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> were considerably less sensitive than might have been expected from the parasite numbers measured by quantitative PCR. In vitro work showed that thick films prepared from malaria cultures at known parasitaemia consistently underestimated parasite densities. Conclusion It appears large numbers of parasites are lost during staining. This limits their sensitivity, and leads to erroneous estimates of parasite density. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} a {{technique}} that is more sensitive than the use of Romanowsky-stained thick <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> for detecting malaria parasites at low concentration in the blood is well recognized. One of the more promising methods appeared to be fluorochrome staining with acridine orange. However, reports on {{the efficacy of the}} technique were contradictory and it was not clear to what extent <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> taken under survey conditions would contain fluorescing artefacts that might confuse diagnosis. An investigation indicated that, provided reasonable care was taken, <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> made under survey conditions contained few confusing artefacts. However, it was found that, while acridine orange staining might have a slight advantage when large malaria parasites were present, it was inferior to routine Romanowsky staining for the detection of young trophozoites, the inferiority becoming more pronounced as the parasite concentration decreased...|$|R

2500|$|Infected human {{red blood}} cells are {{incubated}} in a culture dish or flask at 37°C together with a nutrient medium and plasma, serum or serum substitutes. A special feature of the incubation is the special gas mixture of mostly nitrogen (93% nitrogen, 4% carbondioxide, [...] 3% oxygen) allowing the parasites to grow at 37°C in a cell incubator. An alternative to gasing the cultures with the exact gas mixture, {{is the use of}} a candlejar. The candlejar is an airtight container in which the cultures and a lit candle are placed. The burning candle consumes some of the oxygen and produces carbon dioxide (...) , which acts as a fire extinguisher.

40|$|Traditional Giemsa-stained thick <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> were {{compared}} with 2 fluorescence microscopy techniques, acridine orange (AO) staining of thin <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> and the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) method, for the microscopical diagnosis of malaria. Of 200 samples examined, 141 were positive by Giemsa staining, 146 by AO and 137 by QBC. Overall sensitivities for the 2 fluorescence techniques compared to Giemsa staining were good: AO 97. 9 % and QBC 93. 6 %. However, with parasitaemias < 100 /microL the QBC sensitivity fell to 41. 7 % whereas that of AO was 83. 3 %. Both AO and QBC were unable to differentiate accurately between individual malaria species. We conclude that the QBC technique alone cannot replace Giemsa-stained thick <b>blood</b> <b>films</b> for most purposes in an African setting. However, apart from species differentiation, the AO method is an appropriate technique for the laboratory diagnosis of malaria in developing countries...|$|R
