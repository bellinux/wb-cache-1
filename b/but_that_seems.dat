25|$|Ironically, the {{tolerant}} Penn transformed himself almost into a Puritan, in {{an attempt}} to control the fractiousness that had developed in his absence, tightening up some laws. Another change was found in Penn's writings, which had mostly lost their boldness and vision. In those years, he did put forward a plan to make a federation of all English colonies in America. There have been claims that he also fought slavery, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> unlikely, as he owned and even traded slaves himself and his writings do not support that idea. However, he did promote good treatment for slaves, including marriage among slaves (though rejected by the Council). Other Pennsylvania Quakers were more outspoken and proactive, being among the earliest fighters against slavery in America, led by Daniel Pastorius, founder of Germantown, Pennsylvania. Many Quakers pledged to release their slaves upon their death, including Penn, and some sold their slaves to non-Quakers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{proof of}} Sheldon having feelings for Amy {{is given in}} the season 8 episode [...] "The Prom Equivalency", when he finally admits being in love with her: [...] "I love you too. There's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way. I briefly considered I had a brain parasite, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> even more far-fetched. The only conclusion was love." ...|$|E
2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet {{the funny thing is}} those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production just a little too refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> like a perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to go back a long way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs to Remember to establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} in Berlin Thaer had an {{encounter}} with Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, {{the head of the}} German General Staff, who was of course several ranks senior to Thaer's. [...] The incident sheds light on the social nuances of honour and military etiquette that were a feature of the imperial Prussian office corps at the time. [...] In 1910 von Thaer returned from an absence of several months during which he had been on holiday in Russia and reported back {{to the head of the}} chief of staff, General von Moltke. [...] Von Moltke invited his candid opinion on the state of relations between Germany and Russia. [...] It seems likely that von Moltke misunderstood his junior officer's reply. [...] He understood von Thaer to have advocated a Preventive war against Russia. [...] There was much concern in Germany at this time that the military power balance with Russia was shifting in Russia's favour, and there were many who thought that since military confrontation was inevitable, the outcome would be more likely to favour the German empire if war came sooner rather than later. [...] Von Moltke was firmly opposed to the [...] "preventive war" [...] idea, however. [...] Thaer, in his report of his conversation with von Moltke, insists that he too was similarly opposed to any [...] "preventive war" [...] proposals. [...] <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> not to have been what von Moltke thought he had heard. [...] In any case, von Molkte concluded the interview frostily with the formal phrase, [...] "Ich danke Ihnen, Herr Hauptmann" [...] ("I thank you, Mr Officer"). [...] Thaer saw this choice of words as an insult. [...] The customary formulation at the time (even if strictly speaking [...] "incorrect") would have been [...] "Ich danke Ihnen, Thaer", using the name of a brother officer despite the difference in their actual ranks. [...] Thaer waited for 24 hours and then submitted a complaint. [...] Von Moltke apologised and clarified the matter to him. [...] There is no obvious evidence that Thaer's subsequent military career was damaged by the incident.|$|E

60|$|The {{appearance}} of the dolphin when {{just out of the}} water beggars description. Very few anglers in the world have ever had this experience. Not many anglers, perhaps, care for the beauty of a fish. But I do. And for the sake of those who feel the same way I wish I could paint him. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> impossible. For even while I gazed the fish changed color. He should have been called the chameleon of the ocean. He looked a quivering, shimmering, changeful creature, the color of golden-rod. He was the personification of beautiful color alive. The fact that he was dying made the changing hues. It gave me a pang--that I should be the cause of the death of so beautiful a thing.|$|E
