5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for ventilatory support can <b>be</b> <b>anticipated</b> by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe respiratory failure.|$|E

In the US, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) {{has determined that}} 1,3-dichloropropene may reasonably <b>be</b> <b>anticipated</b> to be a carcinogen. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that 1,3-dichloropropene is possibly carcinogenic to humans. The EPA has classified 1,3-dichloropropene as a probable human carcinogen.|$|E

25|$|Professor Taylor {{offered a}} gas {{theory of the}} explosion, in which he contended that {{deflagration}} would cause a pressure of gas to build up sufficiently quickly in the vaults - the entrance to which was small and through the roof—to cause the explosion. The difficulty with this explanation was in believing that the vaults were well enough sealed as to result in an explosion, when a more gradual forcing up of the cellar roof might more reasonably <b>be</b> <b>anticipated.</b>|$|E
25|$|The binding affinities of {{iprindole}} {{for various}} biological targets {{are presented in}} the table to the right. It is presumed {{to act as an}} inhibitor or antagonist/inverse agonist of all sites. Considering the range of its therapeutic concentrations (e.g., 63–271nM at 90mg/day), only the actions of iprindole on the 5-HT2 and histamine receptors might <b>be</b> <b>anticipated</b> to be of possible clinical significance. However, it is unknown whether these actions are in fact responsible for the antidepressant effects of iprindole. The plasma protein binding of iprindole and hence its free percentage and potentially bioactive concentrations {{do not seem to be}} known.|$|E
25|$|On remand, EPA {{found that}} six {{greenhouse}} gases “in the atmosphere may reasonably <b>be</b> <b>anticipated</b> both to endanger {{public health and}} to endanger public welfare.” On February 16, 2010, the states of Alabama, Texas, and Virginia and several other parties sought judicial review of EPA's determination in the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit. On June 26, 2012, the court issued an opinion which dismissed the challenges to the EPA's endangerment finding and the related GHG regulations. The three-judge panel unanimously upheld the EPA's central finding that GHG such as carbon dioxide endanger public health and were likely responsible for the global warming experienced over the past half century.|$|E

Our decision is based on a subsequent ruling by the Supreme Court, which could not <b>be</b> <b>anticipated</b> by Judge McCurn in his handling of this case over more than twenty years.|$|E
25|$|Position of {{the body}} can have a {{considerable}} influence in protection from blast effects. Lying prone on the ground will often materially lessen direct blast effects because of the protective defilade effects of irregularities in the ground surface. Ground also tends to deflect some of the blast forces upward. Standing close to a wall, even on the side from which the blast is coming, also lessens some of the effect. Orientation {{of the body}} also affects severity {{of the effect of}} blast. Anterior exposure of the body may result in lung injury, lateral position may result in more damage to one ear than the other, while minimal effects are to <b>be</b> <b>anticipated</b> with the posterior surface of the body (feet) toward the source of the blast.|$|E
25|$|The age of {{the various}} {{elements}} in synagogal song may be traced from {{the order in which}} the passages of the text were first introduced into the liturgy and were in turn regarded as so important as to demand special vocalization. This order closely agrees with that in which the successive tones and styles still preserved for these elements came into use among the Gentile neighbors of the Jews who utilized them. Earliest of all is the cantillation of the Scriptures, in which the traditions of the various rites differ only as much and in the same manner from one another as their particular interpretations according to the text and occasion differ among themselves. This indeed was to <b>be</b> <b>anticipated</b> if the differentiation itself preserves a peculiarity of the music of the Temple (see Jew. Encyc. iii. 539a, s.v. Cantillation).|$|E

500|$|As these {{qualifying}} exams {{are extremely}} rigorous, support is usually available to people progressing through the exams. Often, employers provide paid on-the-job study time and paid attendance at seminars {{designed for the}} exams [...] Also, many companies that employ actuaries have automatic pay raises or promotions when exams are passed. As a result, actuarial students have strong incentives for devoting adequate study time during off-work hours.

Others loyal to Diệm then became fearful that they would soon be removed too. Minh's junta proceeded slowly and gradually, hoping to avoid pre-emptive coups by officers fearing a demotion or sacking.
