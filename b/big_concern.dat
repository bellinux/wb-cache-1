5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the Roman Catholic Church {{sex abuse}} scandal {{involving}} local priests became public. The Archdiocese of Boston {{was found to}} have knowingly moved priests who sexually molested children from parish to parish and to have covered up abuse. The revelations caused the resignation of the archbishop, Cardinal Bernard Law, and resulted in a $85 million settlement with the victims. With the large Irish and Italian Catholic populations in Boston, this was a <b>big</b> <b>concern.</b> The diocese, under financial pressure, closed many of its churches. In some churches, parishioners camped out in the churches to protest and block closure.|$|E
25|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a <b>big</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E

500|$|Professional teams coveted Gyorko for his hitting ability, {{though they}} did not expect him to play shortstop at the {{professional}} level. Though his throwing arm was viewed as strong enough {{to allow him to}} play at any position in the infield, analysts believed that Gyorko would not have sufficient range or speed to play shortstop professionally, and Gyorko understood he would likely change positions. Regarding his defense, Gyorko said [...] "where I play [...] isn't a <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> for me. I'm just ready for this chance to live a dream and it will all work out." ...|$|E
500|$|The Queen Anne's Revenge {{was built}} atop the Sunset, the same ship used {{to depict the}} Black Pearl in {{previous}} installments. On February 2010, the Sunset was sailed from Long Beach to a shipyard in Hawaii for the reforms, where a <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> was to make it imposing, with three stories, without sacrificing actual seakeeping. Given Blackbeard {{was meant to be}} the meanest pirate to appear in the series, the look for the Queen Anne's Revenge was ominous, with sails dyed blood red, various elements on fire, and a decoration based on skulls and bones (drawing inspiration from the Sedlec Ossuary in Czech Republic). Damage from cannon fire was also added to show that [...] "not only Blackbeard was a dying man, but his ship is also a dying ship". The ship's figurehead also drew inspiration from Blackbeard's pirate flag. The replica ship HMS Surprise was used for Barbossa's ship, the HMS Providence, and all the scenes aboard the Providence were shot on the Long Beach shore as the Surprise could not be sailed to Hawaii. Over 50 designs were considered for the Fountain of Youth, with the final one representing a temple built by an ancient civilization around the Fountain, which itself was located in a round rocky structure to represent [...] "the circle of life". The locations leading up to the Fountain were shot in the Hawaiian islands of Kauai and Oahu, but the Fountain itself was built at the 007 Stage on Pinewood.|$|E

2500|$|For {{many people}} {{choosing}} an office suite, prime considerations include how much value having learned that office suite {{will prove to}} potential employers, and how well the software interoperates with other users. [...] That is, since learning to use an office suite takes many hours, users want to invest that time learning the office suite that will make them most attractive to potential employers and clients, and {{they also want to}} be able to share documents. Similarly, finding already-trained employees is a <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> for employers when deciding which office suite to purchase or standardize on.|$|E
2500|$|Piracy {{was also}} a <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> for the Pope. Domagoj was accused of attacking a ship which was {{bringing}} home the papal legates {{who had participated in}} the Eighth Catholic Ecumenical Council. In 874, Pope John VIII intervened by requesting Duke Domagoj as a Christian to restrain the pirates who were in his name ravaging the Adriatic assaulting Christian sailors and that exile would be a more suitable punishment for the rebels instead of death penalties, but his request wasn't successful. Pope John VIII referred to Domagoj in letters as [...] "Famous duke" [...] (...) , but also wrote that he won't find Domagoj innocent if piracy was not dealt with.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: [...] or adult F. gigantica: 25–75×12mm, fasciolosis is a <b>big</b> <b>concern.</b> The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans. Treatment with triclabendazole has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as bithionol are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing cholangitis [...] has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and toxaemia may be treated with prednisolone.|$|E

2500|$|Nabokov was {{considered}} one of the elite goaltenders in the NHL, and was often ranked {{as one of the top}} ten, if not top five goaltenders in the NHL by magazines like ESPN The Magazine and The Hockey News. However, the 2005–06 season was an off year for Nabokov as his save percentage of under [...]900 was a <b>big</b> <b>concern</b> to the team. He was relegated to the role of backup goaltender behind Vesa Toskala. Despite his less-than-stellar play, Nabokov was signed to a four-year contract extension worth roughly $21.5 million in February 2006. The contract had a no-trade clause that was activated on the condition that San Jose made the playoffs.|$|E

It had ceased to be a blank space of {{delightful}} mystery--a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. It had become a place of darkness. But there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost {{in the depths of the}} land. And as I looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird--a silly little bird. Then I remembered there was a <b>big</b> <b>concern,</b> a Company for trade on that river. Dash it all! I thought to myself, they can't trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water--steamboats! Why shouldn't I try to get charge of one? I went on along Fleet Street, but could not shake off the idea. The snake had charmed me.|$|E
