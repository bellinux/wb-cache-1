5|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} {{to a number of}} Amanita species. It can be distinguished from A.praegraveolens microscopically <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> clamp connections between the cells in S.thiersii. Both S.thiersii and A.aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe and the whole fruit body is yellower. A.silvifuga is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It can be distinguished by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.|$|E

5|$|A {{least one}} {{transportation}} {{study in the}} early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 {{to open up the}} area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway, and included more landscaping and less grade separation. In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> an extended I-275 from the state's freeway network.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface. A.cinereoconia is distinguished from A.onusta <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> clamps, its powdery-wooly to powdery-warty cap, {{as well as the}} absence of warts or scales {{at the base of the}} stipe. A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride of lime. Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the warts on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E

5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> any red {{color in the}} cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may {{be confused with the}} blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria calvescens {{is rather}} similar in appearance, {{and can only}} be {{reliably}} distinguished from A.gallica by observing microscopic characteristics. A.calvescens has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the Great Lakes. A.mellea has a thinner stem than A.gallica, but can be more definitively distinguished <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> clamps {{at the base of}} the basidia. Similarly, A.cepistipes and A.gallica are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. Molecular methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing DNA sequences in the gene coding translation elongation factor 1-alpha.|$|E
5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For recruiting purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first recruiting efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> SPAR recruiting personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES {{to become the first}} SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The recruiting information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E

Lysmata rauli sp. nov. was identified from fresh material collected in tide pools. L. rauli sp. nov. appears to be rare in the region with only two specimens collected from Salvador, Brazil. The new species can be readily distinguished from all other species <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> a well developed accessory branch, number of carpal segments of the second pereiopod, presence of a well developed pterygostomial tooth and number of teeth on the rostrum, {{as well as by}} color pattern...|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} of the VH series, Commodore sales were {{beginning}} to decline. Holden's six-cylinder engine, which was carried over from the Kingswood, could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive. Continual improvements made to Commodore's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more fuel-efficient or better performing despite the smaller size. This was curtailed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> any major powertrain revisions by {{the time of}} the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB. Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid-size Camira from 1982, which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption, and for less than the Commodore pricing point. Camira sales were strong initially, but as fuel prices had stabilised, buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon, which overtook the Commodore as Australia's bestselling car for the first time in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Following Martin's departure, Trey Spruance {{was brought}} on {{to perform on}} the album, having also been in Mr. Bungle with singer Mike Patton. Production of the album was further marred by the band {{suffering}} a car accident, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> keyboard player Roddy Bottum, who was affected by the deaths of both his father and Kurt Cobain, whose wife was his close friend. Spruance was replaced on the supporting tour by the band's former roadie Dean Menta. However, Spruance played live with Faith No More {{for the first time}} in November 2011, playing the entire album during a show in Chile.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{the adults}} may be {{confused}} with large native frogs from the genera Limnodynastes, Cyclorana, and Mixophyes. These species can be distinguished from the cane toad <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> large parotoid glands behind their eyes {{and the lack of}} a ridge between the nostril and the eye. Cane toads have been confused with the giant burrowing frog (Heleioporus australiacus), because both are large and warty in appearance; however, the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver-grey (as opposed to gold) irises. Juvenile cane toads may {{be confused with}} species of the Uperoleia genus, but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colouring on the groin and thighs.|$|E
40|$|Terahertz {{radiation}} {{was measured}} from InN and compared to p-InAs excited by femtosecond optical pulses at 1060 and 800 nm. At 800 nm, atomically smooth InN with low background electron concentration exhibit higher THz emission than the highly effective material p-InAs. The higher THz emission efficiency of InN is caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> any intervalley scattering, {{which in the}} case of InAs increases the effective mass of the photo generated electrons and, thus, reduces the Dember field, which is responsible for THz emission. Consequently, InN is a promising material for THz emission; however, further improvement of the material quality (surface roughness and carrier concentration) is needed...|$|R

5|$|In a {{match between}} the Australians and Nottinghamshire, Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline {{practitioners}} of 1932–33, employed the strategy with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height. Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg-side bowling was repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would {{not return to the}} country in the future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already angered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day.

5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{adhered to}} the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary {{responsibility}} for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln vetoed only four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the Homestead Act in 1862, making {{millions of acres of}} government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' First Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.|$|E
