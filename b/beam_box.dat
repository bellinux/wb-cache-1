The structural configurations resulting from the single cell <b>beam</b> <b>box</b> method are integrated for further analysis and design optimization with a Finite Element Model (FEM). The benefits of using the box beam method in conjunction with FEM include achieving quick snapshots for preliminary member sizing requiring minimum resources, increased accuracy, easy data manipulations and design iterations leading to weight savings through virtual prototyping.

40|$|Adjacent <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> bridges in Indiana are {{not meeting}} their design life due to {{premature}} deterioration of shear keys and prestressing strands. Cracked shear key joints between <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> allow chloride-laden water to migrate through the superstructure and initiate corrosion. As a result, load distribution between <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> may be reduced, promoting independent beam action and differential deflections. Furthermore, loss of strands from corrosion has serious consequences on the flexural {{capacity of the}} bridge. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the evolution of <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> design in Indiana to understand the lack of performance and durability. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) standards and bridge design manuals were reviewed to track the historical development of <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> bridges in the State. Two timelines were produced tracking important updates to <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> design. Adjacent <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> bridges within INDOT’s bridge database were also analyzed. Superstructure ratings were compared with bridge age as well as bridge characteristics to highlight possible causes for deterioration. Analyzing the INDOT inventory, data shows that the condition of adjacent <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> bridges may be affected by location, type of wearing surface, and the use of deck membranes. Six bridges were then inspected to identify common deficiencies and specific problems. Exterior beams and beams within the wheel load path tend to have higher levels of deterioration. Furthermore, leaking joints between beams lead to corrosion of reinforcement ultimately resulting in spalling, fracture of prestressing strands, and loss of structural capacity. ...|$|R

Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials {{have been used in}} the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer’s experience.

This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre {{composite structures}} used in civil engineering such as; plate, <b>beam,</b> <b>box</b> beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck.

The proposed system {{has the ability}} to record different inventory data, has tools for condition rating, priority ranking and cost optimization at both bridge and network levels. Condition rating is based on the type, extent, and severity of defects and urgency of intervention, all based on observations made during the inspections. It also takes into account the importance of the deteriorated elements. Priority ranking is evaluated {{on the basis of a}} knowledge-base stored in the system. It is calculated using four parameters: condition rating; remaining service life; safety index; and impact of the structure on the network. The developed framework of EBRMS consists of three main modules: database and inspections, condition rating and decision making modules. Details of each of the system capabilities are based on the published research work, mainly on the BRIME project. Testing and verification of the proposed scheme are carried out using a virtual bridge network and available published data as the knowledge base.

40|$|The National Road {{network of}} Sri Lanka {{consists}} of 4326 bridges. There are 365 bridges which Have the length more than 30 m. Only 800 bridges {{are made of}} prestressed concrete superstructures and all others are with reinforced concrete, steel and arches. The most popular types of prestressed beams used in Sri Lanka are inverted T, M, I, and the <b>box</b> <b>beams.</b> The inverted T and M beams are widely used. Further, for 30 m span simply supported bridges, space rectangular <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> and spaced trapezoidal <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> were used. For the continuous bridges big spine beams also have been used with post tension pre-stressing system in recent bridge constructions. For longer span bridges, <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> are highly suitable. Generally <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> has higher torsional capacity because of its closed geometry. The enhanced torsional stiffness of the <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> sections improves the load distribution properties for the superstructure. It has higher bending carrying capacity and requires reduced beam height compared to other beam section for a particular span. Hollow spaces in <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> {{can be used for}} services and it is also aesthetic. In Sri Lanka 19 % of the existing bridges are with prestressed concrete and presently many highway projects are under construction. Therefore, the usage of <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> will improve the effect on the time of construction, cost, construction easiness, aesthetic considerations and utility services. There are different types of <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> available {{that can be used for}} this simply supported span range. They are standard <b>box</b> <b>beam,</b> standard U <b>beam</b> and spaced <b>box</b> <b>beams.</b> The rectangular spaced <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> has been used for a two lane bridge in a 30 m simply supported span and the trapezoidal spaced <b>box</b> <b>beam</b> has been used for a four lane elevated flyover in Sri Lanka. Comparative analysis and design on all these <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> are useful for future bridge constructions. This research is concentrated on the design of 30 m simply supported four lane bridge super structures using the above different types of prestressed <b>box</b> <b>beams</b> separately. The results of analysis and design and the properties of the beams are compared. The total width of the designed bridges is 17. 4 m. It has a central reserve of 1. 2 m. There are four lanes; each lane is 3. 5 m width. There are two pedestrian walk ways of 1. 1 m width. All the bridge decks were modeled in SAP 2000 for the grillage analysis. Loading was done according to BS 5400 : Part 2, 1978, and bending moments, shear forces and torsional moments were found for critical load combination. Prestressing designs were carried out for all beams and the final results are compared. Cost for each deck also compared. The different launching methods adapted for these Bridges are also compared.
