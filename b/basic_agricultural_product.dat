South Africa faces {{numerous}} {{economic and}} social challenges. Three very important challenges are high unemployment rate, high poverty rate and high inequality. Agriculture is identified as a sector {{with the potential to}} contribute towards the amelioration of high unemployment and high poverty rates. Agro-processing in particular is identified as having the potential to improve the sustainability and profitability of farming enterprises. The potential of agro-processing remains unexploited. Agro-processing refers to a set of technological and economic activities undertaken on a <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> with the aim of transforming it into a usable item such as food, fibre, fuel or industrial material. The study addressed a research gap by focusing on smallholder farmers and linking entrepreneurship with agro-processing. This research empirically tested the relationships between participation in agro-processing activities by smallholder farming entrepreneurs and human capital, social capital and market access {{and the degree to which}} each was moderated by the transaction cost. Further, the study tested the relationship between participation in agro-processing activities, all variables jointly and cumulatively. Structured questionnaires were administered during smallholder farmer meetings in three provinces namely, Western Cape, Limpopo and Gauteng. A hierarchical multi-regression analysis was used as the main statistical tool to test hypotheses. The main findings of the study were that the relationship between human capital and participation in agro-processing activities by smallholder farming entrepreneurs is positive and significant. Similarly, the relationship between social capital and participation in agro-processing activities is positive and significant. However, the relationship between market access and participation in agro-processing activities was negative and significant. Finally, transaction cost had an enhancing moderating effect on the relationship between market access and participation in agro-processing activities by smallholder farming entrepreneurs. iii Findings further suggest that human capital is fundamental to sustainable development considering participation in agro-processing activities. Social capital of smallholder farming entrepreneurs may be enhanced through mentorships and partnerships with neighbouring commercial farmers and agro-processors. Lower transaction costs were likely to enhance market access by smallholder farmers...|$|E
40|$|Addressing the Second International Conference on Globalisation at the University of Leuven on November 20 th 2002 Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler {{acknowledged}} that 'the CAP still contains more protectionist elements than it should'. However, he expressed {{the belief that}} 'its support has become far less trade distorting over the years', but agreed that 'There {{is a need for}} further reform of the CAP {{in order to make it}} more acceptable to our society and further reduce trade distortions. Recently, the Chief Economist of the World Bank said that the mid-term review was dead. To paraphrase Mark Twain: The news of its death is premature. I can tell you: the reform process is not over yet. There is still a lot of work to do. We also need to deal with dairy and sugar, the two sectors where the absence of reform clearly constrains our negotiating margins in the Doha Round and stains the image of the CAP. ' The Commissioner warned that further reform would not be easy, pointing out that the EU Summit in Copenhagen had set a ceiling on CAP expenditures up to 2013, which would actually mean 'a reduction in real terms'. This will require a reallocation of funds from existing areas to new areas, making the formulation of future reform proposals highly controversial. He rejected the contention that European agricultural subsidies are driving their poorest competitors out of the market, maintaining that: apart from sugar and rice, few developing countries produce temperate agricultural products; market protectionism among developing countries is a far more important hindrance to their competitiveness; developing country manufacturing exports have dramatically increased from 1980 from 25 % to over 80 % of their total exports. He also maintained that the EU is losing market share internationally across a range of agricultural products and that this declining EU global position is scarcely consistent with increased dumping. Finally, Commissioner Fischler pointed out that the EU is the largest importer of agricultural products from the developing world, importing more than the USA, Japan, Canada and Australia combined, with the EU taking more than two-thirds of Africa's global exports. He closed by pointing out that the complete elimination of EU price- and income-support would primarily benefit other developed economies and more competitive developing country exporters such as Brazil, while preferred partners in Africa would lose out as a result of declining EU prices. Comment: From an ACP perspective the figures cited by Commissioner Fischler on the level of developing country exports are seen to be highly misleading. Agriculture continues to account for 36 % of ACP exports to the EU, with mineral products accounting for a similar percentage (depending on basic commodity prices and the €/US$ exchange rate). For ACP countries manufactured goods (as popularly understood) continue to account for a relatively small percentage of total exports to the EU. Agriculture- related issues are thus of paramount importance to ACP countries. EU trade policy towards ACP countries therefore needs to be based on the recognition that the actual proportion of manufactured exports is below 30 % of the total. The claimed share of 80 % derives from a quite different collection of so-called 'developing countries' that even includes Slovenia and Malta, whose situation bears little relationship to the trade reality confronting most ACP countries. Turning to the issue of the EU's market share and the impact of CAP reform on 'dumping', while it is indeed true that in a number of major products the EU is losing market share internationally it is important to look at the reasons behind this. First, with the end of the Cold War the scale of international trade has expanded considerably and a decline in the EU's relative market share was to be expected. Second, the EU is increasingly exporting value-added food products internationally rather than basic agricultural products, and such products now account for a majority of EU food exports. The EU's share of <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>product</b> markets has thus declined. Third, in a number of areas EU production and exports are constrained by WTO agreed ceilings on export refunds, and by internally agreed production quotas. As global trade has expanded, the EU has been unable to participate fully in this expansion and consequently its market share has fallen. Fourth, in key products more cost competitive third-country producers have greatly expanded their production and exports eroding the EU's market share (Australia and New Zealand in the case of dairy products, Brazil in the case of sugar). However the process of CAP reform is designed to address this problem. As the EU's recent report 'Prospects for Agricultural Markets' ([URL] highlights, EU cereals production continues to expand, with production levels in 2009 projected to be 24. 4 % higher than the peak in the pre-reform period. In addition as a result of reforms the EU is now able to export wheat without the need for any export subsidies. Had the Euro not appreciated around 10 % against the US $ in the last year, the volume of unsubsidised EU wheat exports would be increasing even faster. The impact of CAP reform on other sectors such as the poultry sector is even more dramatic, where as a result of decreases in feed costs, EU poultry exports have been able to increased 150 % since the pre-reform period, creating problems for small-scale poultry producers in many African countries. It is developments in these sectors which point the way in which the external trade effects of the CAP are moving. Addressing the Second International Conference on [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} reform fosters approaching of State and cooperative proparty, {{but does not}} effect elimination of essential differences between them. On the other hand, State and cooperative forms alternate in a higher degree in several domains. Simultaneously, the reform causes higher alternation of cooperative and private forms. Those circumstances must be accounted for in order {{to solve a problem}} of demonopolization of certain spheres of production and market, including agricultural market. Transformation from a one-subject to multi-subject organizational structure on that market can aid demonopolization processes but is not able to perform their role. The following are the main directions of structural and organizational transformations on the agricultural market: creating new cooperative or mixed State- -cooperative units, sometimes private units having retained the legal monopoly of the socialist state to purchase <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> At the same time it seems indispensable to improve organization and functioning of rural cooperatives. Transformations of property and organizational structure on agricultural market ought to be gradually carried out as favourable economic conditions develop, especially when a buyer market is formed.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the current state}} and {{the main trends in}} the development of agriculture (on the example of agricultural enterprises in the Vologda Oblast). Nowadays there is a trend of decline in the production of <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> The insufficient financing of agricultural enterprises {{is one of the key}} reasons for this situation. Internal and external sources of funding can be such tools. As world practice shows, the largest share in the funds, which are at the disposal of agricultural enterprises, accounts for direct budgetary financing. However, in the Russian Federation there is another trend: over the last decades there is noticeable reduction in direct state support of agricultural producers. In addition, in the framework of Russia’s accession to the WTO there will be further decline in such support and simultaneous transfer of financial burden onto agricultural enterprises. Therefore, the government faces an acute problem of planning and forecasting volumes of state support and earnings of agricultural enterprises. In this regard, this work makes a forecast calculation of the amount of public support and the revenue size of agricultural enterprises. To make forecasts the author uses methods of econometric modeling and forecasting (in particular, the method of correlation and regression analysis). The forecasts are presented in 3 scenarios: most realistic, optimistic and pessimistic. The article offers recommendations on determining the actual needs of regional agricultural enterprises in the amount of state support...|$|R

40|$|According to the April 2003 {{report of}} the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service 'world flour trade has dropped 30 % {{in just the past}} seven years' as the pattern of trade has changed. Privatisation and an {{expansion}} of capacity of milling facilities in major markets has 'shifted demand from imported flour to imported wheat'. As a consequence 'competition has increased for the shrinking flour market'. Regional flour suppliers are increasing their market share by 'providing quicker delivery, smaller shipments and cheaper transportation to quality sensitive buyers'. As a consequence 'the EU - once the world's dominant flour supplier - has seen its exports drop nearly 60 %. Many French mills, which were built near ports for export, have slashed capacity in half or closed, whereas a third of Italy's mills have already closed. Comment: This trend is most noticeable in markets in north Africa, the middle east, India and the former Soviet Union. This means that the ACP flour market is increasing in importance as the European milling industry faces a major crisis. ACP countries could find themselves increasingly targeted by EU flour suppliers with substantial surplus capacity. In addition, developments in the global flour trade throw current French proposals for a temporary cessation of export refunds on agricultural exports to African markets into a different light. If such a cessation were to apply only to <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> and not to other products in the value chain then this proposal could provide significant relief to a depressed French milling sector.

40|$|The {{well known}} events which {{had taken place}} in our country over the period 1989 - 2001 {{provoked}} adverse effects on foreign trade exchange of the total economy, agriculture and commodities of plant origin. These effects and changes were analyzed using corresponding indices for the sub periods 1989 - 1992 and 1998 - 2001. The foreign trade exchange balance was substantially negative in both sub periods over the analyzed period showing an aggravating trend. Export covering import declined from 78. 09 % to only 47. 71 %. The positive balance of exchange of agricultural, especially commodities of plant origin in the first four years was turned into a negative balance of exchange in the second four years. Export covering import at the agricultural level declined from 164. 79 % to 78. 58 % and at the level of commodities of plant origin from 201, 76 % to 87. 35 %. There was a significant disturbance of commodity and regional structure exchange. The share of agriculture in the total export of the country was raised from 13. 82 % to 18. 16 %. The share of plant originating commodities in the total export of agriculture was raised from 71, 96 % to 86, 34 %. <b>Basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> predominated in the export. In addition, in the domestic export the share of developed countries decreased which contributed to poor export results and increased the import dependence of the country. Considering the above said, the need arises to increase substantially agricultural production, i. e. commodities of plant origin. The structure and output of these productions should meet the needs of both domestic and foreign markets. International standards need to be applied in order to take hold of new foreign markets, exporting high technology processed products, using intensive and efficient promotive activities. Subsequently, greater investments and a planned production are needed, liberalization and especially the system of import control in foreign trade exchange of <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> i. e. plant originating commodities, need to be harmonized with the level and dynamics of production...|$|R

It {{is one of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products</b> with social and economic importance. However, there is no much report in the literature on the determination of heavy metals levels in tobacco leaves and local cigarettes. Hence this study is an initial attempt to investigate the accumulation level of selected heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Pb & Zn) concentration in tobacco leaves and local cigarettes of Kota Marudu, Sabah. Digestion of all samples was done using an acid digestion method which is using nitric acid (HN 03). However, the methods that used to digest the samples of tobacco leaves and local cigarettes are different. Digestion of tobacco leaves was undergo 85 °C- 150 °C for 2 hours whereas for local cigarettes was 100 °C for 2 hours. Inductively Coupled Plasma- Optical Emission Spectrometry(ICP-OES) is used to determine the concentration of heavy metals. Analysis from ICP-OES shows the accumulation of heavy metals in tobacco leaves are Co<Pb<Cr<Cd<Cu<Ni<Zn<Fe<Mg whereas the sequence for local cigarettes is Co<Pb<Cd<Cr<Ni<Cu<Zn<Fe<Mg. Highest heavy metals found in both tobacco leaves samples and local cigarettes samples are Mg with the value of 217. 395 mg/L ± 13. 072 and 217. 743 mg/L ± 9. 374 respectively. On the other hand, the lowest heavy metals that found in both samples is Co with the concentration of 0. 022 mg/L ± 0. 017 in tobacco leaves and 0. 033 mg/L ± 0. 001 in local cigarettes.

30|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a {{commercial}} plant. Tobacco leaves naturally accumulate and concentrate relatively {{high levels of}} heavy metals and particular cadmium in leaves. Tobacco {{is one of the}} <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products,</b> in Ethiopia, with social and economic importance. However, there is no report in the literature on the determination of levels of heavy metals in Ethiopian tobacco leaves. Hence this research is intended to determine the levels of heavy metals in the raw and processed Ethiopian Virginia tobacco leaves. Samples of raw Virginia tobacco leaves were collected from two different regions of Ethiopia (Billate and Shewa Robit). The three processed tobacco samples were collected from National Tobacco Enterprise, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The samples were wet-digested using 3  mL HNO 3 (69 – 72  %) and 3  mL HClO 4 (70  %) at 350  °C for 3.5  h and concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in the samples were determined by flame atomic absorption spectrometer. The mean metals concentrations (in µg/g dry weight) in the raw Virginia tobacco leaves from Billate and Shewa Robit, respectively, were: Cu (4.38, 7.30), Zn (53.7, 33.2), Cd (1.20, 1.30), Cr (ND, 1.45), Ni (ND, 1.90). The mean metals concentrations (in µg/g dry weight) in the processed tobacco from Billate and Shewa Robit, respectively, were: Cu (9.80, 12.8), Ni (2.35, 2.20) Cd (1.45, 1.90), Cr (1.65, 1.75), Zn (101, 83.8). The mean metals concentrations (in µg/g dry weight) in the processed tobacco Nyala (Ethiopian cigarette leaves) were: Cu (8.95), Cd (1.55), Cr (1.62), Ni (4.70), Zn (79.3). The concentrations of Cr and Ni in tobacco leaves from Billate and Pb in all the tobacco samples were below the detection limits. This study showed that the metal contents of tobacco leaves varied with the geographical origin in which the tobacco plant grows. The metal contents of processed tobacco were higher than the corresponding raw leaves. Pb was not detected in both the raw and processed Ethiopian tobacco leaves.|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} CAP reform and Cancun {{was the subject}} of an address by Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler to the Washington International Trade Association on July 28 th 2003. He put forward three key propositions: that EU and US {{policies}} have more in common than is generally believed, with both being committed to the need for farm support; that the EU's June 26 th 2003 reform package constituted a 'radical reform' since it decoupled a major part of farm payments from production through a substantial reduction in support prices linked to a new system of single farm payments (this will allow the EU to cut trade-distorting domestic support, export subsidies and import tariffs); that CAP reform was consistent with the needs of developing countries. With reference to the impact of CAP reform on developing countries, Commissioner Fischler denounced what he called the 'sloganised' critique of the impact of EU farm policy on developing countries, and asserted the need to pursue wider objectives through public support, since these services are not reflected in market prices. He maintained that this could be achieved in non-trade-distorting ways, and also argued that the EU's declining share of world commodity markets and the openness of the EU market to developing country products hardly marked the EU down as the 'international market predator it is sometimes painted as'. He argued strongly that the WTO has no competence to determine national agricultural policies and was merely a forum to 'reduce and even eliminate trade distortion via balanced negotiation'. In this context the Commissioner argued that the main issue was not how much money was spent but how it was spent. Comment: It is difficult to sustain the argument that the new EU system of farm payments is non-trade distorting when, in the face of price declines (sometimes as much as 40 %), production is maintained and even expanded. Clearly normal market forces of supply and demand are not at work here. The supply response of farmers to price declines is distorted by the direct aid payments made to the farmers. Given that EU production of all major products is tending to increase despite much lower prices, it is implausible to claim that the new EU farm-support scheme is non-trade distorting. Furthermore, unfair competition is generated and trade flows are distorted when EU farmers receive public aid to help them to meet higher EU standards, while these standards are also applied to imports from third countries without their own farmers enjoying similar public assistance in meeting these standards. With regard to the EU's declining share of world commodity markets, this cannot be divorced form the massive expansion of EU value-added food-product exports. EU agricultural policy is increasingly about the promotion of EU value-added food-product export industries and less and less about exporting <b>basic</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>products.</b> It is this phenomenon which accounts for the EU's declining share in world commodity markets and not the absence of distortions arising from the provision of a growing level of public aid to the EU agricultural sector. The issue of CAP reform and Cancun was the [...] ...|$|R
