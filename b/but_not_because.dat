Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous {{to adopt the}} Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E

25|$|In October 1999, Cinar was {{investigated}} for tax fraud. It {{was revealed that}} the husband-and-wife chairman Micheline Charest and president Ronald Weinberg invested $122 million (US) into Bahamian bank accounts without the board members' approval. Cinar had also paid American screenwriters for work while continuing to accept Canadian federal grants for content. However, Arthur itself {{was not involved in}} the scandal as it was publicly known to be co-produced with an American company. Head writers Joe Fallon and Ken Scarborough left around that time, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of the scandal; Fallon left about a year before the investigation began.|$|E
25|$|Piper {{teaches that}} God {{has only one}} {{covenant}} people, mostly believing Jews in the Old Testament, and now that people consists of all the followers of Christ, or the Church, whether Jew or Gentile. Piper asserts that Israel has rights from God to dwell in that land, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> they are merely Jewish, and Jews who reject Jesus as Messiah have no divine right of claim on those promises. Piper also believes that all Christians, Jew or Gentile, will inherit the earth, including the land of Israel, when Christ sets up the Millennial Kingdom in the Second Coming.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 the Vartiokylä dumping ground was closed, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of its {{environmental}} impact. The official story was that the place was full and could not accommodate further waste materials. Since it had originally been a hole from which gravel had been taken, it did not stick out from the surrounding areas, such as the Iso-Huopalahti dumping ground and the Vuosaari dumping ground did and still do. (These two dumping grounds now replaced the Vartiokylä dumping ground.) Thus, when {{the construction of the}} Myllypuro neighbourhood was begun, the new residents most likely were oblivious {{to the fact that there}} had once been such a site there.|$|E

25|$|Manuilă {{kept his}} {{government}} post after Sănătescu fell {{and was replaced}} with Nicolae Rădescu, but was forced out by the communist purge of the power structures, in March 1945. He returned to the ICS, but found himself in conflict with both the party cell and the corporate trade union. Having lost his job at ALRUS and his seat on the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, he was eventually demoted by the Institute in August 1947. His position was filled in by Golopenția, who, although a protegé of the communist Miron Constantinescu, was seen by Manuilă as a worthy successor. Manuilă became a political suspect, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of his Nazi contacts; rather, Manuilă was perceived as an Americophile.|$|E
500|$|Before the 19th century, no scholar {{was allowed}} to study or edit the Codex Vaticanus, and {{scholars}} did not ascribe any value to it; {{in fact it was}} suspected to have been interpolated by the Latin textual tradition. John Mill wrote in his Prolegomena (1707): [...] "in Occidentalium gratiam a Latino scriba exaratum" [...] (written by a Latin scribe for the western world). He did not believe there was value to having a collation for the manuscript. Wettstein would have liked to know the readings of the codex, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> he thought that they could have been of any help to him for difficult textual decisions. According to him, this codex had no authority whatsoever (sed ut vel hoc constaret, Codicem nullus esse auctoris). In 1751 Wettstein produced the first list of the New Testament manuscripts, Codex Vaticanus received symbol B (because of its age) and took second position on this list (Alexandrinus received A, Ephraemi – C, Bezae – D, etc.) until the discovery of Codex Sinaiticus (designated by ℵ).|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] rating. He {{felt that the}} episode worked {{extremely}} well on a visual and character-based level. Handlen felt that, because the show was [...] "often scariest when it’s implying, rather than flat out stating," [...] its [...] "mythology only really works as something just out of sight". For this reason, {{he felt that the}} episode mixed [...] "the compelling with the absurd" [...] with [...] "mixed results". Handlen concluded that the episode [...] "has its moment," [...] but is ultimately hurt {{by the fact that it}} refuses [...] "to come to any serious conclusions," [...] as well as [...] "the inherent limitations of the [...] form". Not all reviews were glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris criticized the death scene of the Syndicate, noting that it was [...] "clumsily contrived, allowing [...] and Fowley to escape, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> it makes sense, but because the show needs them to return at some point".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in June 2011. He said that he liked the episode, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> it was a typical Next Generation episode, saying that it was instead [...] "a story about an old man who has been carrying guilt for four decades over something stupid he did in his youth, and he tries to recapture his youth in a move of even greater stupidity". He described the return of Michael Pataki to Star Trek as [...] "triumphant" [...] but thought that Clayton Rohner was [...] "simply horrible", and that Marsha Hunt [...] "creates no impression whatsoever". He summed up the episode saying that it was a [...] "missed opportunity", and gave it a score of 5/10. James Hunt watched the episode in January 2013 for the website Den of Geek. He felt that the episode had a good story at the core but highlighted the [...] "rather dubious make-up and over-acting". His main criticism was that Jameson was [...] "fundamentally unlikeable", and the lack of a Subplot in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Days {{prior to}} this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that [...] "there is no {{precedent}} where government will go after people for costs just because they have {{money to pay for}} it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for", although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons. At an April 10, 2008 Legislature's Interim Finance Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, [...] "We are doing an audit <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong". Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond. In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation. Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.|$|E
500|$|Season 2 leaves Tyrion [...] "broke, beaten, scarred {{for life}} and {{stripped}} of his power," [...] despite having been instrumental in saving King's Landing from invasion. It is his chance to escape the sordid and deadly [...] "game of thrones," [...] but he cannot bring himself to, confessing, [...] "Bad people are what I'm good at." [...] So Tyrion finds he must submit to Tywin's plan of marrying him to Sansa Stark; despite being drunk in order to soothe his many woes, Tyrion manages to save Sansa from being publicly stripped and likely raped by Joffrey, and later [...] "chooses decency over filial loyalty and elects not to consummate the marriage after all." [...] Tyrion is also now powerless against Joffrey's malice, but Tywin has asserted his control over the young king, if only when it serves his own desires; he stops Joffrey from presenting Sansa with her brother's head, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> he cares about Sansa or Tyrion's outrage. Despite Tywin's continuous determination to make Tyrion feel [...] "miserable and unloved," [...] he believes {{he is a good}} father – because he resisted the urge to cast Tyrion into the sea at birth. Though he should not be surprised by his father's coldblooded machinations, Tyrion is horrified by Tywin's involvement in the Red Wedding; Todd VanDerWerff writes, [...] "only Tyrion seems to understand that the blood they spilled will eventually be avenged. The North may have calmed for now, but it won't be calm always." [...] Of that storyline, Matt Fowler of IGN notes, [...] "Only an event that powerful could keep series-favorite Tyrion out of an episode for the first time." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{enormous}} {{success of the}} [...] "Swell Guys" [...] and [...] "P. E.

The characters of this comedy {{are a little bit}} light-headed and constantly get into awkward situations, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of their own stupidity, as it often happens in such stories, but rather due to their naivety and frankness. One of the starring actors, Sergei Styopin, admits that [...] "he does not even know what part of the scenario is really “fictional”. Anton Shchukin confirms that the [...] "real point" [...] of this sitcom is to try to show the funny within the natural and the habitual: ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Nozick {{argued that}} {{government}} redistributes wealth by force (usually {{in the form}} of taxation), and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force. [...] However, Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property, and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of the inequalities themselves. John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole, including the poorest members. [...] Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice. [...] Some see Rawls's argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism; others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawls's theory of justice.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 21, in 1952, he {{made his}} solo first recording, Franz Liszt's Weihnachtsbaum, the work's world premiere recording. His first concerto recording, Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 5 had been {{made a couple of}} years earlier. He went on to make a string of other records, {{including}} three complete sets of the Ludwig van Beethoven piano sonatas (one on Vox Records and two on Philips Records). He was the first performer to record the complete solo piano works of Beethoven. He has also recorded works by Liszt, Brahms (including Brahms' concertos), Robert Schumann and particularly Franz Schubert. An important collection of Alfred Brendel is the complete Mozart piano concertos recorded with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, which is included in the Philips 180 CD complete Mozart Edition. He has recorded or performed little of the music of Frédéric Chopin, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>because</b> of any lack of admiration for the composer. [...] He considers Chopin's Preludes [...] "the most glorious achievement in piano music after Beethoven and Schubert".|$|E
