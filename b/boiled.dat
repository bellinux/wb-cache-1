5|$|A laserdisc {{edition of}} Hard <b>Boiled</b> was {{released}} by The Criterion Collection in December 1995. A Region Free DVD of Hard <b>Boiled</b> {{was released by}} The Criterion Collection on 10 July 1998. A second Region 1 DVD of the film was released by Fox Lorber. Fox Lorber released the film as a stand-alone release and as a double feature with The Killer on 3 October 2000. Originally, when Miramax bought the rights to Hard <b>Boiled,</b> The Killer, and Bullet to the Head, they intended to release it in a cut version on video, it was until Woo prevented them from releasing it except Woo prefers his cut of his films to be released. The most recent Region 1 release of Hard <b>Boiled</b> was from Dragon Dynasty, who released a two disc DVD of the film on 24 July 2007. A Blu-Ray version of the film was included {{as part of the}} Stranglehold Limited Edition for the PlayStation 3, and was later released as a standalone title by Dragon Dynasty.|$|E

5000|$|DNB is {{also known}} as Transition <b>boiling,</b> {{unstable}} film <b>boiling,</b> and partial film <b>boiling.</b> For water <b>boiling</b> as shown on the graph, transition <b>boiling</b> occurs when the temperature difference between the surface and the <b>boiling</b> water is approximately [...] to [...] above the TS. This corresponds to the high peak and the low peak on the <b>boiling</b> curve. The low point between transition <b>boiling</b> and film <b>boiling</b> is the Leidenfrost point.|$|R
50|$|<b>Boiling</b> {{is also a}} phase {{transition}} from the liquid phase to gas phase, but <b>boiling</b> is the formation of vapor as bubbles of vapor {{below the surface of}} the liquid. <b>Boiling</b> occurs when the equilibrium vapor pressure of the substance is greater than or equal to the environmental pressure. The temperature at which <b>boiling</b> occurs is the <b>boiling</b> temperature, or <b>boiling</b> point. The <b>boiling</b> point varies with the pressure of the environment.|$|R

At the premiere the {{audience}} response was very positive with people stomping {{their feet and}} yelling at the screen. This reception surprised producer Terence Chang who did not expect such a positive reaction. Hard <b>Boiled</b> received wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.|$|E
50|$|A <b>boiling</b> chip, <b>boiling</b> stone, or anti-bumping granule is a tiny, {{unevenly}} shaped {{piece of}} substance added to liquids {{to make them}} <b>boil</b> more calmly. <b>Boiling</b> chips are frequently employed in distillation and heating. When a liquid becomes superheated, a particle of dust or a stirring rod can cause flash <b>boiling.</b> This very rapid <b>boiling</b> can be extremely violent and cause reagents to splatter, possibly causing severe burns, ruining experiments, and damaging equipment. <b>Boiling</b> chips work by providing nucleation sites so the liquid <b>boils</b> smoothly without becoming superheated or bumping.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} bubble {{nucleation}} on <b>boiling</b> heat transfer enhancement {{has been investigated}} xperimentally. Results show whether <b>boiling</b> heat transfer is enhanced or not depends directly on effective activation of vapor embryos on the heat transfer surface to initiate <b>boiling.</b> The mechanism of <b>boiling</b> heat transfer enhancement is analyzed and the influence factors of incipient <b>boiling</b> superheat are summarized. In light of bubble nucleation effect, the possible techniques for enhancing <b>boiling</b> heat transfer and eliminating <b>boiling</b> hysteresis are proposed and further developed as a principle to guide the research of <b>boiling</b> heat transfer enhancement...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} way of {{preventing}} bumping is by adding {{one or two}} <b>boiling</b> chips to the reaction vessel. However, these alone may not prevent bumping {{and for this reason}} it is advisable to <b>boil</b> liquids in a <b>boiling</b> tube, a <b>boiling</b> flask, or an Erlenmeyer flask. In addition, heating test tubes should never be pointed towards any person, just in case bumping does occur. Whenever a liquid is cooled below its <b>boiling</b> point and re-heated to a <b>boil,</b> a new <b>boiling</b> chip will be needed, as the pores in the old <b>boiling</b> chip tend to fill with solvent, rendering it ineffective.|$|R

Aspects of film <b>boiling</b> involving an unconstrained liquid mass are considered, giving attention to the evaporation time, the Leidenfrost temperature, solid-liquid contacts, the thermal properties of the solid, effects of coating or scale, wettability, the metastable condition, and the velocity effect on drops. Developments discussed with regard to pool <b>boiling</b> are related to vertical surfaces, film <b>boiling</b> from horizontal surfaces, film <b>boiling</b> from a horizontal cylinder, film <b>boiling</b> from a sphere, and film <b>boiling</b> of helium.

50|$|Common {{characteristic}} {{include a}} bowl-shaped <b>boil,</b> an elevated center, a {{formation of an}} organic layer on the outer edge, and resistance of the soil surface to vegetation colonization.

In warm seasons (summer), the elevated center of the frost <b>boil</b> is moderately well drained compared to the depressed inter <b>boil.</b> The permafrost table surface is also affected by differing activity across the <b>boil.</b> The inner <b>boil</b> is more active and generally has more than twice the active depth than the inter <b>boil,</b> which causes the permafrost table surface to be in a nearly perfect bowl shape.|$|R

5|$|The Māori used {{various parts}} of Cordyline australis to treat {{injuries}} and illnesses, either <b>boiled</b> up into a drink or pounded into a paste. The kōata, the growing tip of the plant, was eaten raw as a blood tonic or cleanser. Juice from the leaves was used for cuts, cracks and sores. An infusion of the leaves was taken internally for diarrhoea and used externally for bathing cuts. The leaves were rubbed until soft and applied either directly or as an ointment to cuts, skin cracks and cracked or sore hands. The young shoot was eaten by nursing mothers and given to children for colic. The liquid from <b>boiled</b> shoots was taken for other stomach pains. The seeds of Cordyline australis are high in linoleic acid, one of the essential fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on <b>boiled</b> eggs, toast soaked in water, <b>boiled</b> rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and <b>boiled</b> rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E

50|$|<b>Boiling</b> is {{the rapid}} {{vaporization}} of a liquid, which {{occurs when a}} liquid is heated to its <b>boiling</b> point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid {{is equal to the}} pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere. The higher the pressure the higher the <b>boiling</b> point. There are two main types of boiling; nucleate <b>boiling</b> where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux <b>boiling</b> where the <b>boiling</b> surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface. Transition <b>boiling</b> is an intermediate, unstable form of <b>boiling</b> with elements of both types. The <b>boiling</b> point of water is 100 °C or 212 °F, but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes.|$|R

Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of the sap before it was <b>boiled,</b> increasing processing efficiency.|$|E
