50|$|<b>Bonded</b> <b>leather</b> can {{be found}} in furniture, bookbinding, and various fashion accessories. Products that are {{commonly}} constructed with different varieties of <b>bonded</b> <b>leather</b> include book covers, cases and covers for personal electronics, shoe components, textile and accessory linings, portfolios and briefcases, handbags, belts, chairs, and sofas. A more fragile paper-backed <b>bonded</b> <b>leather</b> is typically used to cover books such as diaries and Bibles, and various types of desk accessories. These bonded leathers might contain a smaller proportion of leather than those used in the furniture industry, and have some leather exposed in the product's surface, producing the characteristic odor associated with leather.|$|E

50|$|Lower-quality {{materials}} {{may suffer}} flaking {{of the surface}} material {{in as little as}} a few years, while better varieties are considered very durable and retain their pattern and color even during commercial use. Because the composition of <b>bonded</b> <b>leathers</b> and related products varies considerably (and is sometimes a trade secret), {{it may be difficult to}} predict how a given product will perform over the course of time. There is a wide range in the longevity of <b>bonded</b> <b>leathers</b> and related products; some better-quality <b>bonded</b> <b>leathers</b> are claimed to be superior in durability over low-quality genuine leather.|$|R
50|$|Para {{tertiary}} butylphenol formaldehyde resin {{also known}} as p-tert-butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBP-FR) or 4-(1,1-dimethylethyl) phenol (PTBP Formaldehyde) is a phenol-formaldehyde resin found in commercial adhesives, and in particular in adhesives used to <b>bond</b> <b>leather</b> and rubber. It has broad usage in a large variety of industries {{and can be found}} in many household items and textile products, and in particular it is used in the manufacture of shoes.|$|R
30|$|The {{mechanical}} properties considered {{important in the}} manufacture of shoes are the following: peel strength and heat resistance, properties that determine the final strength of the bond. In terms of properties, this paper focuses on the peel strength, which is intended to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of the PU adhesive solvent-based when <b>bonding</b> <b>leather</b> to TR or PU soles, while taking into account {{the presence or absence of}} surface treatments on the substrates. The peel strength is a property which determines the strength required to peel off two materials, where at least one of the substrates is flexible; it is possible to distinguish if an adhesive is fragile or ductile.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bonded</b> <b>leather</b> {{is made by}} {{shredding}} leather scraps {{and leather}} fiber, then mixing it with bonding materials. The mixture is next extruded onto a fiber cloth, or paper backing, and the surface is usually embossed with a leather-like texture or grain. Color and patterning, if any, are a surface treatment that does not penetrate like a dyeing process would. The natural leather fiber content of <b>bonded</b> <b>leather</b> varies. The manufacturing process is somewhat similar {{to the production of}} paper.|$|E

5000|$|Once {{the surface}} is prepared, a number of {{adhesives}} {{can be used for}} bonding. These include epoxies, polyurethanes, and cyanoacrylates. Epoxies have shown [...] shear strength on mechanically abraded surfaces and [...] on chemically treated surfaces. Cyanoacrylates are useful for <b>bonding</b> to metal, <b>leather,</b> rubber and other plastics.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{application}} for the Kinect V 2 sensor is described in the robotic field. The sensor {{is used as a}} vision device for detecting position, shape and dimensions of an object on the working space of a robot in order to planning the end effector path. The algorithms used for the recognition of contour and spatial position of planar shapes are described. The technique adopted for the recognition of 3 D objects are presented. The first results provided by a prototype of gluing robot for the <b>bonding</b> of <b>leather</b> patches and shoe soles are presented. The results confirm the possibility of using the Kinect V 2 sensor {{as an alternative to the}} well consolidated 3 D measuring devices which are definitely more accurate, but also much more expensive...|$|R
5000|$|The US Federal Trade Commission {{recommends}} {{according to}} 16 C.F.R. Section 24:"For example: An industry product {{made of a}} composition material consisting of 60% shredded leather fibers may be described as: <b>Bonded</b> <b>Leather</b> Containing 60% Leather Fibers and 40% Non-leather Substances." [...] The Federal Trade Commission has said that [...] "The guidelines caution against misrepresentations about the leather content in products containing ground, reconstituted, or <b>bonded</b> <b>leather,</b> and state that such products, when {{they appear to be}} made of leather, should be accompanied by a disclosure as to the percentage of leather or other fiber content. The guidelines also state that these disclosures should be included in any product advertising that might otherwise mislead consumers as to the composition of the product." ...|$|E

30|$|In the {{footwear}} industry, {{the most}} important method for joining materials is adhesive bonding. In 1906 nitrocellulose adhesives were introduced, being replaced in 1949 by polychloroprene adhesives (PCP), which due to their versatility present good results in <b>leather</b> <b>bonding,</b> textiles and other materials. In 1970 the PU adhesives are then introduced in the footwear industry. Subsequently adhesives based on styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), latex, aqueous dispersions and hotmelts were used [4]. However, for the bonding of upper/soles, adhesives used are based on PCP and PU. This work discusses the PU solvent-based adhesives because {{they are able to}} bond various types of materials, regarding the application upper/soles [5].|$|R
5000|$|Heat is the {{transference}} of {{kinetic energy}} to the leather. When this occurs, the internal molecules of the leather increase in speed and begin colliding with one another at a rate so fast that the <b>bonds</b> of the <b>leather</b> molecules are no longer capable of remaining intact and thus break. The effect of heat is most often associated with long term exposure and rapid fluctuations in temperature on the leather. When exposed to heat in either condition, leather may lose the ability to absorb water from {{the air and the}} result is a hard or brittle state, this is referred to as hysteresis. This is due to the interconnected nature of external heat and moisture content in leather. Water: see the above relationship of heat and moisture content in leather ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bonded</b> <b>leather</b> or {{reconstituted leather}} is an {{economical}} material that uses leftover organic leather (from tanneries or workshops) that are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or latex on to a fiber sheet. The varying degree of organic leather {{in the mix}} (10% to 90%) affects the smell and texture. Its reduced cost makes it popular for furniture upholstery, especially for commercial furniture that requires durability—though durability can vary widely depending on the formulation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bonded</b> <b>leather,</b> {{also called}} reconstituted leather or blended leather, {{is a term}} used for a {{manufactured}} upholstery material which contains animal hide. It is made as a layered structure of a fiber or paper backer, a pulp made from shredded leather, and a polyurethane coating which is embossed with a leather-like texture. Related products, bicast leather or coated leather, are made by splitting, shaving, or grinding leather to reduce its thickness, and then laminating it.|$|E
5000|$|The actual leather {{content of}} <b>bonded</b> <b>leather</b> varies {{depending}} on the manufacturer and the quality level they are selling. In the home furnishings industry there is much debate and controversy over the ethics of using the term [...] "bonded leather" [...] to describe an upholstery product, which is actually a reconstituted leather. Opinion in the leather industry says that calling a product [...] "bonded leather" [...] is [...] "deceptive {{because it does not}} represent its true nature. It's a reconstituted hide, not an organically grown leather".|$|E

50|$|Folio {{publications}} {{are printed}} {{in a range}} of standard sizes (in 1951, for example, these included Royal Octavo, Medium Octavo, Crown Octavo and Demy Octavo), and custom sizes are also employed. The most common material for bindings is buckram or a similar bookcloth, but there are many exceptions: aluminium foil was used in binding Aldous Huxley's Brave New World in 1971, and vegetable parchment in binding Voltaire's The Calas Affair in 1994; more commonly, marbled papers (often produced by Ann Muir Marbling Ltd.) have been used for several volumes in recent years, either as endpapers or as board-papers of quarter bindings; moiré silk (usually artificial) has been used sporadically over the years as a binding material, and leather (vellum and goatskin) and <b>bonded</b> <b>leather</b> are sometimes used, chiefly for the more expensive editions. Most bindings for works of fiction are designed by the illustrator. Non-fiction binding designers include David Eccles, Jeff Clements, and Neil Gower.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the direct strand-deposition process to manufacture long-glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic carrier structures like for instrument board carriers, inside door panels or front-ends. This process is capable to process waste materials out of long- and endless-fiber reinforced thermoplastic components by maintaining the long fibers that the waste materials are providing. A much higher efficiency is obtained compared to recycling methods using the injection molding process where the fibers are degraded through the process. In addition, new recycled compo-leather or <b>bonded</b> <b>leather</b> materials offer {{the possibility to}} perform an integrated coating using the direct strand-deposition process for above mentioned applications. Formerly expensive leather interiors within automobiles can be replaced by those cheaper compo-leather materials having the same optics and haptics...|$|E
