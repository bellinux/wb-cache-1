40|$|This paper defines an {{algorithm}} {{for predicting}} worst and <b>best</b> case <b>execution</b> times, and determining execution time constraints, of control-flow paths through real-time programs using their partial correctness semantics. The algorithm produces a linear approximation of path traversal conditions, worst and <b>best</b> case <b>execution</b> times and strongest postconditions for timed paths in abstract real-time programs. We further derive techniques {{to determine the}} set of control-flow paths with decidable worst and <b>best</b> case <b>execution</b> times. The approach {{is based on a}} weakest liberal precondition semantics and relies on supremum and infimum calculations similar to standard computations from Linear Programming and Presburger Arithmetic. The methodology is generic in that it is applicable to any executable language that can be supplied with a predicate transformer semantics and hence provides a verification basis for high level as well as assembler level execution time analysis techniques...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} theory for {{computing}} worst and <b>best</b> case <b>execution</b> times of real-time programs. We provide an abstract command language for real-time programs and outline how a partial correctness semantics {{can be used}} to compute execution times. The notions of a timed command, refinement of a timed command, the command traversal condition, and the worst case and <b>best</b> case <b>execution</b> time of a command are formally introduced and investigated {{with the help of an}} underlying weakest liberal precondition semantics. The central result is an abstract `algorithm 2 ̆ 7 for the computation of worst and <b>best</b> case <b>execution</b> times from the underlying semantics based on supremum and infimum calculations. Furthermore, stability properties for execution times are proven for program development with timed commands refinement. The framework is applied to the high-level program analysis of a methane sampler example where execution times are computed for a particular control-flow path. The results are generic in that they are applicable to any real-time language that can be supplied with a predicate transformer semantics...|$|R

5000|$|Alpha {{profiling}} [...] is {{an application}} of machine learning to optimize the execution of large orders in financial markets by means of algorithmic trading. The purpose is to select an execution schedule that minimizes the expected implementation shortfall, or more generally, ensures compliance with a <b>best</b> <b>execution</b> mandate.Alpha profiling models learn statistically-significant patterns in the execution of orders from a particular trading strategy or portfolio manager and leverages these patterns to associate an optimal execution schedule to new orders. In this sense, it is {{an application of}} statistical arbitrage to <b>best</b> <b>execution.</b> For example, a portfolio manager specialized in value investing may have a behavioral bias to place orders to buy while an asset is still declining in value. In this case a slow or back-loaded execution schedule would provide better execution results than an urgent one. But this same portfolio manager will occasionally place an order after the asset price {{has already begun to}} rise in which case it should best be handled with urgency; this example illustrates the fact that Alpha Profiling must combine public information such as market data with private information including as the identity of the portfolio manager and the size and origin of the order, to identify the optimal execution schedule.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} JAWS, a JavaScript {{framework for}} adaptive work sharing between CPU and GPU for data-parallel workloads. Unlike conventional heterogeneous parallel programming environ-ments for JavaScript, which use only one compute device when executing a single kernel, JAWS accelerates kernel execution by exploiting both devices to realize full performance potential of het-erogeneous multicores. JAWS employs an efficient work partition-ing algorithm that finds an optimal work distribution {{between the two}} devices without requiring offline profiling. The JAWS runtime provides shared arrays for multiple parallel contexts, hence elimi-nating extra copy overhead for input and output data. Our prelim-inary evaluation with both CPU-friendly and GPU-friendly bench-marks demonstrates that JAWS provides good load balancing and efficient data communication between parallel contexts, to signifi-cantly outperform <b>best</b> single-device <b>execution...</b>|$|R
