Despite charging lower loan rates, <b>banks</b> <b>controlled</b> by government experience higher bad loans ratios.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} corporate governance on the risk taking of Japanese firms. We show that family control and ownership concentration are associated with higher idiosyncratic risk, whereas <b>bank</b> <b>control</b> has the opposite effect. Considering the link between idiosyncratic risk and firm performance, the results provide an economic rationale for the higher (lower) performance of family-controlled firms (bank-controlled firms). The results also explain the higher performance of firms with concentrated ownership by relating their governance structures to the risk-taking strategies that generate greater competitive advantages. Finally, we show {{that the impact of}} governance structures on risk taking is stronger after controlling for endogeneity.
