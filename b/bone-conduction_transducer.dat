40|$|An {{acoustical}} model using simplified ear anatomy {{was designed}} to predict the ear-canal sound pressure occlusion effect in humans. These predictions were compared perceptually {{as well as with}} ear-canal sound pressure occlusion effect measurements using a foam earplug with shallow insertion, a foam earplug with deep insertion into the bony part of the ear canal, and a circumaural earmuff. There was good resemblance between model predictions and ear-canal sound pressure measurements. It was also found that all occlusion positions, even deep ear-canal occlusion, produced noticeable occlusion effects. With the <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>transducer</b> at the forehead, the perceived occlusion effect was close to that obtained from ear-canal sound pressure data in the 0. 3 to 2 kHz frequency range; when the stimulation was at the mastoid the difference between the perceived and measured ear-canal sound pressure occlusion effect was around 10 dB at frequencies below 1 kHz. Further, the occlusion effect was obtained in two clinical settings: with supra-aural earphones (TDH 39), and insert earphones (CIR 22). Although both transducers produced occlusion effects, insert earphones produced a greater effect than surpaaural earphones at the low frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the reliability of}} the Bone Conduction-HeadBand (BC-HB) test for predicting the postoperative functional outcome of a round-window (RW) vibroplasty. Study Design: Within-subject comparison of the functional results of the BC-HB test, which is routinely used for the preoperative evaluation of a <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>transducer,</b> with an active middle ear implant (AMEI) placed onto the round window. Setting: Tertiary referral university hospital center. Patients: Seven patients with similar anatomic (absent stapes superstructure) and functional (moderate, mixed hearing loss) sequelae from open tympanoplasty technique. Intervention: All subjects underwent preoperative audiologic assessment with the BC-HB. Subsequently, all subjects underwent surgical placement of an AMEI onto the round window. Main Outcome Measure: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet and noise were assessed. Additionally, evaluation of specific satisfactory targets was performed using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement. Results: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet established that both devices had very similar performance and provided remarkable improvement compared with the unaided condition. However, high-frequency gain and speech audiometry in noise demonstrated better performance with RW-AMEI. Conclusion: In patients presenting with mixed hearing loss as a sequela from middle ear surgery, the preoperative BC-HB test may be helpful in predicting the final functional outcome and patient satisfaction with RW-AMEI...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionPersonal {{portable}} {{information technology}} is advancing at a breathtaking speed. Google has recently introduced Glass, {{a device that}} is worn like conventional glasses, but that combines a computerized central processing unit, touchpad, display screen, high-definition camera, microphone, <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>transducer,</b> and wireless connectivity. We have obtained a Glass device through Google's Explorer program and have tested its applicability in our daily pediatric surgical practice and in relevant experimental settings. MethodsGlass was worn daily for 4 consecutive weeks in a University Children's Hospital. A daily log was kept, and activities with a potential applicability were identified. Performance of Glass was evaluated for such activities. In-vitro experiments were conducted where further testing was indicated. ResultsWearing Glass throughout the day for the study interval was well tolerated. Colleagues, staff, families and patients overwhelmingly had a positive response to Glass. Useful applications for Glass were hands-free photo/videodocumentation, making hands-free telephone calls, looking up billing codes, and internet searches for unfamiliar medical terms or syndromes. Drawbacks encountered with the current equipment were low battery endurance, data protection issues, poor overall audio quality, as well as long transmission latency combined with interruptions and cut-offs during internet videoconferencing. ConclusionGlass has the some clear utility in the clinical setting. However, {{before it can be}} recommended universally for physicians and surgeons, substantial improvements to the hardware are required, issues of data protection must be solved, and specialized medical applications (apps) need to be developed...|$|E
40|$|Virtual and {{augmented}} reality applications {{provide us with}} increasingly compelling il- lusory worlds by combinations of different sensory cues. Although spatial sound technologies are often used in such applications, headphone based sound reproduction can create an undesired “mediation awareness” for an end-user. An alternative can be provided by bone-conducted sound technologies, traditionally used in hearing aids applications. Recent studies with bilaterally fitted <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>transducers</b> suggest that binaural sound cues can be rendered using this technology. In this paper we used binaural bone-conducted sound reproduction for enhancing a multi-modal self-motion sim- ulator prototype. Similar to previous results from headphone based reproduction, the present study shows that the addition of moving sound images to visual stimuli significantly increase vection and spatial presence responses. These results provide empirical evidence that convincing auditory scenes can be created using spatial bone-conducted sound and HRTF’s of at least 600 horizontal resolu- tion. The present research demonstrates the feasibility of using binaural bone-conducted sound in mediated environments...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{three-dimensional}} auditory displays (V 3 DADs) use {{digital signal}} processing to deliver sounds (typically through headphones) that seem to originate from specific external spatial locations. This set of studies investigates the delivery of V 3 DADs through <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>transducers</b> (BCTs) in addition to conventional headphones. Although previous {{research has shown that}} spatial separation can be induced through BCTs, some additional signal adjustments are required for optimization of V 3 DADs, due to the difference in hearing pathways. The present studies tested a bone-conduction adjustment function (BAF) derived from equal-loudness judgments on pure tones whose frequencies were spaced one critical band apart. Localization performance was assessed through conventional air-conduction headphones, BCTs with only transducer correction, and BCTs with a BAF. The results showed that in the elevation plane, the BAF was effective in restoring the spectral cues altered by the bone-conduction pathway. No evidence for increased percept variability or decreased lateralization in the bone-conduction conditions was found. These findings indicate that a V 3 DAD can be implemented on a BCT and that a BAF will improve performance, but that there is an apparent performance cost that cannot be addressed with BAFs measured using the methodology in the present studies.

40|$|Middle ear {{surgical}} procedures are {{typically associated with}} {{a high rate of}} improvement in air-conduction thresholds and a low rate of sensorineural hearing loss in the conventionally assessed frequency range (0. 25 – 8 kHz). Hearing loss in the extended high-frequency (EHF) range (8 – 16 kHz), however, may be common, although its characteristics are not well understood. To elucidate the effects of middle ear surgery on auditory function, prospective investigations were performed to provide data that allowed transient and permanent changes in EHF hearing to be distinguished, and to establish the nature of EHF hearing loss. Changes in hearing at 0. 25 to 16 kHz were documented in 88 patients following stapedectomy, ossiculoplasty, and tympanoplasty. Hearing was measured preoperatively, and 1 week, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Results showed that elevation of EHF air-conduction thresholds occurred frequently following all three surgeries and was most severe one week postoperatively. Although significant recovery of hearing was recorded by three months, 12 months after surgery, 50 % of patients who underwent stapedectomy, 42 % who had a tympanoplasty and 20 % who underwent ossiculoplasty retained a reduction in their highest audible frequency. A TEAC HP-F 100 <b>bone-conduction</b> <b>transducer</b> was modified for use in EHF audiometry and used in a small pilot study to demonstrate that EHF hearing loss following stapedectomy may be composed of both conductive and sensorineural elements. It was hypothesised that changes to utricular responses reflective of trauma to the vestibular portion of the inner ear may also occur following middle ear surgery. Measurements of tap-evoked ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs) were performed in the same group of patients in which audiometric data was collected. Overall, the oVEMP data provided no evidence of a postoperative change in utricular responses. To assess clinical importance of EHF hearing loss, its role in one aspect of auditory function, localisation ability, was investigated in 46 participants; 23 with EHF hearing loss and 23 with normal EHF hearing. Overall, the results agreed with previous studies that localisation accuracy decreased when was EHF spectral content was removed by filtering, however the difference between hearing groups was significant only when speakers were positioned in the lateral vertical orientation. Regardless of the clinical consequences, the increased vulnerability of EHF hearing acuity to the effects of middle ear surgery provides a useful model which could be used to efficiently assess the effect of technical factors of surgery or the efficacy of ototherapeutic treatments on hearing outcomes...|$|E
