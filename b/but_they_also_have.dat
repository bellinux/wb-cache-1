5|$|Among 19 {{isotopes}} of curium, {{the most}} accessible are 242Cm and 244Cm; they are α-emitters, but with much shorter lifetime than the americium isotopes. These isotopes emit almost no γ-radiation, but undergo spontaneous fission {{with the associated}} emission of neutrons. More long-lived isotopes of curium (245–248Cm, all α-emitters) are formed as a mixture during neutron irradiation of plutonium or americium. Upon short irradiation, this mixture is dominated by 246Cm, and then 248Cm begins to accumulate. Both of these isotopes, especially 248Cm, have a longer half-life (3.48 years) and are much more convenient for carrying out chemical research than 242Cm and 244Cm, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a rather high rate of spontaneous fission. 247Cm has the longest lifetime among isotopes of curium (1.56 years), but is not formed in large quantities because of the strong fission induced by thermal neutrons.|$|E
5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E

25|$|The Numerical Stroop effect {{demonstrates}} the {{close relationship between}} numerical values and physical sizes. Digits symbolize numerical values <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> physical sizes. A digit can be presented as big or small (e.g., 5 vs. 5), irrespective of its numerical value. Comparing digits in incongruent trials (e.g., 3 5) is slower than comparing digits in congruent trials (e.g., 5 3) and the difference in reaction time is termed the numerical Stroop effect. The effect of irrelevant numerical values on physical comparisons (similar {{to the effect of}} irrelevant color words on responding to colors) suggests that numerical values are processed automatically (i.e., even when they are irrelevant to the task).|$|E
25|$|South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! is a 2009 {{video game}} {{based on the}} American {{animated}} television series South Park, released on the Xbox Live Arcade service for the Xbox 360 video game console.

Let's Go Tower Defense Play is a tower defense game, with the added element of being a fast-paced action game as well. Thus, players do not only build towers to eliminate destructive forces, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> to control multiple characters in order to successfully protect the town of South Park. South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! is the first South Park video game released after three early titles released between 1998 and 2000.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{heuristic}} algorithm {{relies on}} the iterative strategy, scilicet based on a comparison method, optimizing the results of multiple sequence alignment by the iterative process. Davie M proposed using particle swarm optimization algorithm to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem; Ikeda T proposed a heuristic algorithm {{which is based on}} A* search algorithm; Bimey E first proposed using hidden Markov model to solve the multiple sequence alignment problem; and many other biologists use genetic algorithm to solve it. All these algorithms generally are robust and insensitive to the number of sequences, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> shortcoming, for example, the result got from particle swarm optimization algorithm is unstable and its merits depend on the selection of random numbers, the runtime of A * search algorithm is too long and the genetic algorithm is easy to fall into local excellent.|$|E

25|$|The Department is {{administered}} and {{governed by the}} Police Commissioner, who is appointed by the Mayor. Technically, the commissioner serves a five-year term; as a practical matter, the commissioner serves at the Mayor's pleasure. The commissioner in turn appoints numerous deputy commissioners. The commissioner and his subordinate deputies are civilians under an oath of office and are not uniformed members of the force who are sworn officers of the law. However, a police commissioner who comes up from the uniformed ranks retains that status while serving as police commissioner. This has ramifications for their police pensions {{and the fact that}} any police commissioner who is considered sworn does not need a pistol permit to carry a firearm, and does retain the statutory powers of a police officer. Some police commissioners (like Ray Kelly) do carry a personal firearm, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> a full-time security detail from the Police Commissioner's (Detective) Squad.|$|E

500|$|Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases {{composed}} of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. with the dog, for my friend, to school, in England. Prepositions have {{a wide range of}} uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs. For example, in the phrase I gave it to him, the preposition to marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb to give. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, [...] "with her", [...] "to me", [...] "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as that of [...] no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} Stockholm, Sweden in September 2010. Production mostly {{took place at}} multiple locations in the city's central business district, including at the Stockholm Court House. One challenge was realizing the Vanger estate. They picked an eighteenth-century French architecture mansion Hofsta located approximately [...] southwest of Stockholm. Filmmakers wanted to use a typical [...] "manor from Småland" [...] that was solemn, formal, and [...] "very Old Money". [...] "The Swedish {{are very good at}} the modern and the minimal <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> these wonderful country homes that can be juxtaposed against the modern city—yet both speak to money." [...] Principal photography relocated in October to Uppsala. On Queen Street, the facade of the area was renovated to mimic the Hotel Alder, after an old photograph of a building obtained by Fincher. From December onward, production moved to Zurich, Switzerland, where locations were established at Dolder Grand Hotel and the Zurich Airport. Because of the [...] "beautiful" [...] environment of the city, Fincher found it difficult to film in the area. Principal photography concluded in Oslo, Norway, where production took place at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Recorded for over fifteen hours, twelve extras were sought for background roles. Filming also took place in the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
