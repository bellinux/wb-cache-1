[...] "Tangerine" [...] features blunt lyrics concerning strip club themes and a lascivious guest rap by T.I. The song incorporates various musical elements, including exotic Afro-polyrhythms, psychedelic instrumental effects, booming bass, tribal beats, synthesizer vamps, and slow, reverbing grunge rock guitar. Tom Breihan notes that the song [...] "somehow simultaneously sounds like strip-club ass-shake material and Funkadelic covering Morricone", while music journalist Alexis Petridis writes that it [...] "improbably burst into something that most closely resembles a P-Funk take on the mid-60s Batman theme.

500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in a <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna Kill that Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.|$|E

[...] Powers added [...] "Her lyrics, though hardly {{avoiding}} familiar sex talk, meld common exhibitionism with convincing intimacies. [...] Jackson brings bliss back to a subject that too many dirty-mouthed hotties have made tedious through overexposure." [...] The album was also considered a [...] "soul-baring, bedroom-eyed record" [...] which was [...] "swimming in pop hooks." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian rated Damita Jo {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Damita Jo's opening salvo is an object lesson in keeping things concise. Four tracks, each barely three minutes long, go hurtling past in a head-spinning <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> snapping rhythms, buzzing synthesized noise and oddly disconnected samples: cut-up vocals and glockenspiel on Strawberry Bounce, rattling tablas on Sexhibition. Elsewhere, there are impossibly lithe basslines - notably on All Nite (Don't Stop) and I Want You, an intriguing electronic reconstruction of an early 1970s soul ballad." [...] Petridis heralded the record as [...] "not only inventive, but brilliantly constructed," [...] with nagging hooks and [...] "explosive" [...] choruses.

Katherine Dacey of Manga Bookshelf found the art's anatomy lacking, but complimented its {{characterization}} and composition, concluding that the manga has [...] "a vital, improvisatory energy missing from Tatsumi's later period". Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics liked the manga's tense situations, but felt that the second half was slow with a weak ending, and said that Tatsumi's art is [...] "blocky and crude in places, but there's an energy about it that helps propel those early pages forward." [...] Connie C. of Comic Book Resources described it as a [...] "very straightforward crime story, [...] is well told, but doesn't get much more elaborate", but called it a [...] "beautiful example" [...] of a pulp short story. Tom Spurgeon called the manga [...] "a fun but rough work, full of character types and situations entirely too on the nose to reflect the nuances of certain moral questions brought to bear", especially disliking the ending and saying of the art: [...] "the best scenes in Black Blizzard have a physical immediacy that only arises from fundamentally solid cartooning with a corresponding attention to movement". Publishers Weekly called the story and layouts simple, and the art sometimes crude, but [...] "with a cinematic use of perspective, intensified via the characters and their circumstances, Tatsumi constructs a thrilling narrative with emotional depth." [...] Michelle Smith of Comic Book Resources said that the manga is [...] "a quick and fun hard-boiled adventure yarn", feeling that the story was [...] "silly" [...] and Shinpei's connection [...] "too convenient", but complimenting the [...] "fast-paced narrative" [...] and finding the rough art to suit the characters. The A.V. Club described the manga as a [...] "head-spinning <b>blur</b> <b>of</b> hardboiled suspense", likening the climax to Mickey Spillane's work, and calling Tatsumi's early art [...] "necessarily loose and frantic". Shawn O'Rourke of PopMatters compared the story's nervous tension to EC Comics stories and said that the art [...] "while simplistic, conveys a depth and nuance that engages the reader", adding that [...] "unwieldy exposition or narrative declarations" [...] are avoided, and that the manga [...] "is still eminently enjoyable in a way that so many of dated classics of that era are not." [...] ICv2 said that [...] "Tatsumi skillfully uses the conventions of the crime story to examine his characters who come from very different social backgrounds", calling Black Blizzard [...] "one of the first examples of the realistic, socially conscious, and adult (in the best sense of the term) gekiga genre of manga."
