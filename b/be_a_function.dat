5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of how aware a person is that they are being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E

25|$|Because the {{velocity}} u {{is not a}} function of position x along the plate, the pressure gradient ∂p/∂x is also independent of x (but the pressure p varies linearly with x). Moreover, the Navier–Stokes equation for {{the velocity}} component perpendicular to the wall reduces to ∂p/∂z=0, so the pressure p and pressure gradient ∂p/∂x are also independent of {{the distance to the}} wall z.

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{serving as a}} countermeasure to prey adaptation, pursuit predation has evolved in some species as an alternative, facultative mechanism for foraging.

This alternative predatory strategy {{may serve as a}} back-up resource when optimal foraging is circumstantially impossible, or may even <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of filling dietary needs.|$|E

25|$|The same {{directionality}} {{occurs when}} rats {{participate in the}} radial arm maze. The radial arm maze consists of a central circle from which several arm-like projections radiate. These projections either contain food or do not. Some consider the firing or lack of firing of place cells depending on the arm to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of goal-oriented behavior. However, when moving from one arm to another when they both contain food, place cells only fire in one direction, meaning that one cannot attribute firing purely to a goal-approach. A directionality component must be added: for example, a North goal {{as opposed to a}} South goal.|$|E
25|$|Below, {{the voltage}} gain of the {{amplifier}} with feedback, the closed-loop gain AFB, is derived {{in terms of}} the gain of the amplifier without feedback, the open-loop gain AOL and the feedback factor β, which governs how much of the output signal is applied to the input (see Figure 1). The open-loop gain AOL in general may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of both frequency and voltage; the feedback parameter β is determined by the feedback network that is connected around the amplifier. For an operational amplifier, two resistors forming a voltage divider may be used for the feedback network to set β between 0 and 1. This network may be modified using reactive elements like capacitors or inductors to (a) give frequency-dependent closed-loop gain as in equalization/tone-control circuits or (b) construct oscillators. The gain of the amplifier with feedback is derived below {{in the case of a}} voltage amplifier with voltage feedback.|$|E
25|$|The {{species is}} known to undergo a dietary shift as it grows to adulthood. Young {{individuals}} less than 10cm in length consume considerable volumes of copepods and minor amounts of polychaetes, but once they reach around 10cm, the diet shifts to a polychaete-dominated one. Further growth sees {{an increase in the}} volume of amphipods, small fish and oligochaetes taken. These changes appear to be unrelated to mouth morphology, instead the fish becomes more mobile and possesses a larger mouth {{to be able to take}} these prey. The yellowfin whitings' diet also varies spatially and temporally, which appears to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of prey availability at different sites and periods of the year. There is little resource partitioning between the small individuals of sillaginids which inhabit shallow inshore habitats, with Sillago vittata, S. burrus and Sillaginodes punctatus also taking copepods as their primary prey in southwest Western Australia. This changes as each species grows, with S. vittata and S burrus moving to deeper waters to avoid interspecific competition, whilst the remaining S. schomburgkii and Sillaginodes punctatus partition the resources, with S. punctatus consuming more decapods and shrimps.|$|E

25|$|For {{refractory}} materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely {{high melting point}} (typically considered to be above, say, 1800°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical pyrometer. For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body is known to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> of its temperature. An optical pyrometer matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated {{as a function of}} temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the intensity of radiation is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using Planck's law of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.|$|E
