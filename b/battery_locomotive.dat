5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive</b> at the other. One advantage of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|A <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive</b> (or battery-electric locomotive) {{is powered}} by {{on-board}} batteries; a kind of battery electric vehicle. Such locomotives are used where a conventional diesel or electric locomotive would be unsuitable. An example is maintenance trains on electrified lines when the electricity supply is turned off, such as by the London Underground battery-electric locomotives.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Basinghall Mining Syndicate {{took control}} of the mine in 1936 urgent repair work was done on both Smith's Shaft and Murray's Shaft. The 150Fathom Level had flooded and needed to be pumped out, and roof falls on other levels needed {{clearing}}. After buying the mine in 1937 the Lucy Tongue Level was refurbished. Roof falls needed clearing and retimbering, the worst of the sharp bends were straightened out, and some narrow stone-arched sections were rebuilt. All the rails were replaced, as was the nearly fifty-year-old locomotive, and new side-tipping wagons were introduced. At the same time Murray's Shaft was deepened and a new 175Fathom Level was begun from the bottom. A small <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive</b> was installed for tramming on that level. Horses were still used on the other levels, but in time they too were replaced by battery locomotives.|$|E

2500|$|Another use for <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> is in {{industrial}} facilities where a combustion-powered locomotive (i.e., steam- or diesel-powered) {{could cause a}} safety issue due to the risks of fire, explosion or fumes in a confined space. <b>Battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> are preferred for mines where gas could be ignited by trolley-powered units arcing at the collection shoes, or where electrical resistance could develop in the supply or return circuits, especially at rail joints, and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground. An early example was at the Kennecott Copper Mine, Latouche, Alaska, where in 1917 the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> of [...] tons.|$|R

50|$|<b>Battery</b> powered <b>locomotives</b> {{and systems}} solved {{many of the}} {{potential}} problems that combustion engines present, especially regarding fumes, ventilation and heat generation. Compared to simple electric <b>locomotives,</b> <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> do not need trolley wire strung over each track. However, batteries are heavy items which used to require long periods of charge to produce relatively short periods of full-power operation, resulting in either restricted operations or {{the need for the}} doubling-up of equipment purchasing.|$|R
25|$|In August 1977, all {{redundant}} fittings {{and equipment}} {{from the old}} system were sold at a public sale at Broomloan Works. During the 1977–1980 modernisation, two Clayton <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> were used by the contractors Taylor Woodrow to haul construction trains.|$|R

50|$|The GE three-power boxcab, a {{switcher}} locomotive model {{built in}} 1930, was also capable of operating as a <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive,</b> retired from service.|$|E
5000|$|In the 19th century, {{there was}} {{considerable}} speculation about the potential use of battery locomotives in mines. [...] By 1899, Baldwin-Westinghouse had delivered an experimental <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive</b> to a Virginia mine; battery recharging occurred whenever the locomotive was running under trolley wire, while it could run from battery when working on temporary trackage near the face. This locomotive was eventually successful, but only after the voltage on the trolley system was stabilized. [...] A Siemens and Haske pure storage <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive</b> was in use in a coal mine in Gelsenkirchen (Germany) by 1904.|$|E
25|$|These <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> were {{converted}} from the driving motor cars from former Class 501 electric multiple units. They were powered by large batteries, and were based at Birkenhead North TMD and were employed around Birkenhead on the Merseyrail system (97701-702) or around North London (rest).|$|R

50|$|In 1966 a new diesel Locomotive type JW 15 was {{acquired}} from the Jenbacher Werke. It {{was used for}} snow removal, work trains and functioned as a back-up replacement for the <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives.</b> At {{the end of the}} operations in 2011, the train was only used for food transport, which took place {{two or three times a}} day.|$|R
50|$|The line {{uses only}} {{internal}} combustion locomotives. It has {{never intended to}} use steam locomotives and therefore has no facilities for them. The railway {{is home to a}} number of electric <b>locomotives</b> (five <b>battery,</b> one overhead); however, these are not used. All of the <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> are likely to require new batteries before being used again.|$|R

50|$|A <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive</b> tows small freight/passenger cabs, a {{few times}} a day. Battery {{locomotives}} are used because the High Temperature Tunnel may flash off the fuels of engines. Unlike Kurobe Gorge Railway which closes during winter, Jōbu Track operates whole year. This is because the line is almost entirely under a tunnel, so it is not affected by heavy snow.|$|E
5000|$|The railway's main {{locomotive}} is Greenbat, a 1.5 LT, [...] "trammer" [...] type <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{built by}} Greenwood and Batley of Leeds. Greenbat incorporated a folding cab, {{to allow the}} locomotive to fit down small mineshafts. It was ordered by a steel mill, who specifically requested the cab be fixed. Greenbat herself has never been underground, working in various steel mills.|$|E
50|$|Crab {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} a winch for pulling cars out of the un-powered tracks. This approach allowed use of temporary track that was too light to carry {{the weight of the}} a cable-reel or <b>battery</b> <b>locomotive.</b> The disadvantage of a crab locomotive was that someone had to pull the haulage cable from the winch to the working face, threading it over pulleys at any sharp turns.|$|E
50|$|In 1925, the {{construction}} company Langfelder & Sohn was commissioned to replace all turntables by switches and to lay grooved rails at the intersections {{with the local}} tramway. Furthermore, four <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> were bought from AEG, which were still operational in modified form until 2011. The railway was also equipped with new flat waggons with a handbrake on one side.|$|R
5000|$|The {{site has}} a [...] narrow gauge {{electric}} railway with <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives</b> {{which was used}} for transporting munitions and now visitors around the armory. [...] The tour runs on Sundays and runs on a circuit that partly goes outside the boundary of the Newington Armory into a publicly accessible area where the tracks cross over the Louise Sauvage Pathway twice.|$|R
5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include <b>battery</b> <b>locomotives,</b> diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|R
