2500|$|The third {{issue of}} notes (the second by the Bahrain Monetary Agency) {{with the same}} {{denominations}} of [...] to 20 dinars was released in March 1993. This series was upgraded during 1998 with various modifications to colour and security features. However, a fake order for banknotes had recently been placed with the Argentinian printer [...] who did not verify it with the legitimate authorities in Bahrain and obtained genuine banknote paper from Arjo Wiggins to print over 7 million unauthorised replicas of the 20-dinar note (of the 1993 design), equivalent to US$365 million. These differed from genuine notes in two respects: different <b>background</b> <b>shading</b> to the Arabic name of the Bahrain Monetary Agency, and a large {{gap between the two}} Arabic letters in the horizontal serial number.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine how the background luminance and shading affect the apparent depth from shading. Experiment 1 showed that the ratio of luminance between background and shaded circle didn't affect, the apparent depth perception in circular gradation condition. It is because that the shaded circle with circular gradation tended {{to be perceived as}} a sphere. Experiment 2 and 3 showed that, the shaded background affected apparent depth perception whatever gradation condition is linear or circular. The <b>background</b> <b>shading</b> promotes concave perception when the highlight was located at the top, and promotes convex perception when the highlight was located at the bottom. The results suggest that background's depth is strong cue to apparent depth perception from shading...|$|E
30|$|The {{following}} is an outline of the process used to create the synthetic SIRM scan of the UMN logo. The values in the original grayscale image range from 0 to 255. To create the set of magnetic sources requiring {{the application of the}} non-negativity constraint, we multiply the few grayscale values less than 75 by - 1. Those grayscale values in the image less than 75 correspond to relatively low-intensity <b>background</b> <b>shading</b> pixels in the original image. All of the values are then scaled such that the maximum value of the logo is 4.3233 × 10 ^- 11, and the minimum value of the logo is - 1.4788 × 10 ^- 12, which is in the typical range of magnetization intensity for natural samples measured in Am^ 2. All orientations are in the ±z-direction (i.e., in or out of the page), where the sign of the converted grayscale value determines the orientation in the z-direction. These new pixel values are then treated as magnetic sources (each source is 100 × 100 m^ 2 for this synthetic sample) and used to calculate the vertical component of the magnetic field, B_z, at a height, h above the synthetic magnetic sources.|$|E

A map of Bouguer anomalies in the area was completed and a profile across the mountains was taken. Calculations of the crustal thickness beneath the Los Angeles basin, the San Gabriel Mountains, and the Eajave tesert were made using the sin x/x method and a method described by Bott. These calculations indicate that there is a crustal thinning under the San Gabriel Mountains to 27 km. Values of 35 and 38 km were obtained for the Los Angeles basin and the IMojave Desert respectively. These results correspond quite closely to seismic determinations of the crustal thickness in this area. They indicate that forces originating in the mantle were important in the uplift of the San Gabriel Mountains...|$|E
40|$|Humans use shading as a cue to {{three-dimensional}} form by combing lowlevel {{information about}} light intensity with high-level knowledge about objects and the environment. Here, we examine how cuttlefish Sepia officinalis respond to {{light and shadow}} to shade the white square (WS) feature in their body pattern. Cuttlefish display the WS {{in the presence of}} pebble-like objects, and they can shade it to render the appearance of surface curvature to a human observer, which might benefit camouflage. Here we test how they colour the WS on visual backgrounds containing two-dimensional circular stimuli, some of which were shaded to suggest surface curvature, whereas others were uniformly coloured or divided into dark and light semicircles. WS shading, measured by lateral asymmetry, was greatest when the animal rested on background of shaded circles and three-dimensional hemispheres, and less on plain white circles or black/white semicircles. In addition, shading was enhanced when light fell from the lighter side of the shaded stimulus, as expected for real convex surfaces. Thus, the cuttlefish acts as if it perceives surface curvature from shading, and takes account of the direction of illumination. However, the direction of WS shading is insensitive to the directions of <b>background</b> <b>shading</b> and illumination, but instead the cuttlefish tend to turn to face the light sourc...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general {{benchmark}} for interac-tive segmentation algorithms. The main contribution {{can be summarized}} as follows: (I) A new dataset of fifty images is released. These images are categorized into five groups: animal, artifact, human, building and plant. They cover several major challenges for the interactive image segmen-tation task, including fuzzy boundary, complex texture, clut-tered <b>background,</b> <b>shading</b> effect, sharp corner, and over-lapping color. (II) We propose two types of schemes, point-process and boundary-process, to generate user scribbles automatically. The point-process simulates the human in-teraction process that users incrementally draw scribbles to some major components of the image. The boundary-process simulates the refining process that users place more scribbles near the segment boundaries to refine the details of result segments. (III) We then apply two precision mea-sures to quantitatively evaluate the result segments of dif-ferent algorithm. The region precision measures how many pixels are correctly classified, and the boundary precision measures how close is the segment boundary to the real boundary. This benchmark offered a tentative way to guar-antee evaluation fairness of person-oriented tasks. Based on the benchmark, five state-of-the-art interactive segmen-tation algorithms are evaluated. All the images, synthesized user scribbles, running results are publicly available on the webpage 1. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a chroma keying system that {{automatically}} estimates the alpha map and the reliable intrinsic color of foreground objects {{in front of}} solid background. Our system {{is designed to be}} capable of distinguishing the transparent foreground from the re flective foreground and shaded background, thereby making the artifacts of the composited image less conspicuous. Speci cally, we assume that the transparent region tends to be with higher saturation and lightness compared with region re ecting background light. With this assumption, a threshold function (TF) on a saturation-lightness plane is de ned according to human visual experiments. The pixels with color mixed with the background light (conventional unknown pixels) are now further categorized into re ective pixels and transparent pixels according to TF. In this case, the re ective and the transparent regions are separated to improve the alpha matte quality. Furthermore, a new color representation model is proposed to estimate the intrinsic color of each pixel according to the global color distribution of the image. The underlying assumption of our proposed model is that all colors in a natural image can be approximated by a limited number of chrominance values (dominant colors). Speci cally, the color statistics are counted by 2 D histogram analysis. Then, we approximate the color distribution by the sum of a set of Gaussian mixture functions (GMF), whose centroids are the dominant colors (Dc) of the image. By choosing colors around each Dc, the possible intrinsic colors for each pixel can be comprehensively and e fficiently selected. Considering the fast development of IP-based video broadcasting, we present a data hiding scheme that can protect the chroma keying results when the image/video data is recorded in the JPEG/H. 264 format. According to our simulation, the proposed chroma keying system generates high quality composited images that are little a ected by re ecting, <b>background</b> <b>shading,</b> and intrinsic color missing...|$|E
