5000|$|A fly (or flysheet) {{consists}} of a single rectangular sheet of material. Two opposite sides are held {{up in the middle}} by poles, or sometimes just a rope between conveniently placed trees. The tops of the poles are attached via <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> to pegs, {{in order to keep the}} poles upright. Additional <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> are attached to the lower edges to pull them outwards away from the poles.|$|R
5000|$|Stakes (or tent pegs) or screws {{may be used}} {{to fasten}} the tent to the ground. Some are {{attached}} to <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> that pull outward on the poles and/or fabric to help shape the tent or give it additional stability. Others are used to anchor the bottom edge of the fabric to the ground. Pegs may be made of wood, plastic, or metal. A mallet may be needed to drive thicker pegs into the ground. Skewer metal pegs consisting essentially of a length of thick wire with a hook on one end can usually be inserted by hand, except if the ground is very hard, but may not be as strong as more substantial pegs. Pegs used for <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> should not be driven vertically into the ground; instead for maximum strength they should be driven in at an angle so that the peg is at right angles to the <b>guy</b> <b>rope</b> attached to it. Lighter free standing tents may need some <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> and pegs to prevent them from being blown away.|$|R

40|$|Systematic {{monitoring}} of rotational vibration (both torsion and swivelling) of guyed mast shafts has been performed in ITAM since 2005. The occurrence {{of this phenomenon}} is conditioned {{by the fact that}} the <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> are attached to the construction of the shaft, i. e. out of its axis. The simple static calculation model serves for making the proof of the occurrence of the torsional moment, affecting the shaft, which is <b>guyed</b> by three <b>ropes.</b> The exact theoretical solution of the real phenomenon assumes the introduction of dynamics of <b>guy</b> <b>ropes,</b> which vibrate in 3 D shapes during the shaft’s movement along the orbit and it’s torsion (swivelling) ...|$|R
50|$|A {{rolling hitch}} {{is used to}} tie {{the end of each}} rope to the {{standing}} part of the other. Clifford Ashley suggested it for tying <b>guy</b> <b>ropes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bell tent is {{characteristically}} differentiated {{from the}} sibley tent by its walls, raised larger entrance and <b>guy</b> <b>ropes,</b> without the extendable tripod or smoke hole, which were {{characteristics of the}} tipi.|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} weaving by <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> in {{association}} with egg stalk was observed under scanning electron microscope in Panonychus citri (McGregor). The egg stalk was vertical having a base of 15. 5 μm wide and its length was 146 μm. Initially few <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> extended {{from the tip of}} the stalk to the leaf surface of host plant. The ropes rolled up to 125 μm on the stalk tip and were stretched towards the surface. Several thin ropes combined together to form strong strand. The ropes were roughly surfaced and possessed granular materials. The development of new net was accomplished with further extension of thinner ropes, which were twisted over the thicker ones and pasted on the leaf. Mites used adhesive material for the fixation of threads on the leaf as well as for webbing. The thick <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> were segregated before sticking on the leaf surface. The surface of the leaf was covered with adhesive, which was invisible. Several ropes overlaps the hatching egg vertically and horizontally. ...|$|R
60|$|This {{operation}} concluded, they hastily clambered {{over her}} sides, {{sliding down the}} <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> to the ground. The last warrior to leave the deck turned and threw something back upon the vessel, waiting an instant to note the outcome of his act. As a faint spurt of flame rose from {{the point where the}} missile struck he swung over the side and was quickly upon the ground. Scarcely had he alighted than the <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> were simultaneously released, and the great warship, lightened by the removal of the loot, soared majestically into the air, her decks and upper works a mass of roaring flames.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was {{standing}} there close by the <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> when we {{were getting ready to}} let the canvas down. One of the side poles fell and struck him on the head, or shoulder, I don't know which," [...] replied a man.|$|R
5000|$|A ridge tent or wall tent {{can sleep}} 5 to 8 people or more. They {{usually have a}} {{rectangular}} floor of size ranging from 8 ft by 10 ft up to 16 ft by 20 ft, and ridge heights around 6 ft to 9 ft. The side walls are usually about 3 ft high. They normally have a single upright pole at each end with the tops joined by a horizontal ridge pole. Longer models might have an additional upright pole in the centre to help support the ridge pole. They often have two <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> at each corner, and <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> every 2 ft along the sides. If strong winds are expected then two additional storm <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> {{are attached to the}} top of each pole. Ridge tents are often used by hunters and outfitters as they will accommodate several persons, their equipment and related gear. Many can be equipped with wood stoves for heating and cooking. There are several manufacturers in the U.S. and Canada that make wall tents that have foot prints of greater than 220 square feet. The canvas of wall tents may be treated for water, mildew and fire retardancy.|$|R

50|$|A {{military}} NVIS antenna is the AS-2259 Antenna, {{which consists}} of two V-shaped dipoles: the four dipole wires also serve as <b>guy</b> <b>rope</b> for the antenna mast. An alternative configuration consists of a transmitting loop antenna which is configured for maximum signal transmission upwards.|$|R
5000|$|... 28 August 2008 - A {{transmission}} {{tower in}} the Marlborough Sounds was found buckled after its foundations slipped. The tower was reinforced with steel <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> until {{it could be}} replaced, as the link couldn't be shut down without causing widespread power shortages in the South Island.|$|R
50|$|Many tents {{which use}} rigid steel poles are {{free-standing}} {{and do not}} require <b>guy</b> <b>ropes,</b> though they may require pegs around the bottom edge of the fabric. These tents are usually so heavy (25 to 80 kg) {{that it takes a}} rather strong wind to blow them away.|$|R
50|$|This form of {{construction}} has only become more rigorously analyzed and widespread in large {{structures in the}} latter part of the twentieth century. Tensile structures have long been used in tents, where the <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> and tent poles provide pre-tension to the fabric and allow it to withstand loads.|$|R
5000|$|The Crosstree {{serves as}} a fresh base to spread {{the next level of}} {{supporting}} [...] <b>guy</b> <b>ropes,</b> thereby providing a stable height extension to the masts. Without the crosstree, the ship's mast would have been severely limited in height, in relation to the width [...] (beam) of the ship.|$|R
50|$|When required, {{the tent}} was {{unrolled}} and erected as a whole. A climbing rope {{was used to}} go over the crossing of each pair of poles and along the ridge underneath the roof material. The rope was held taught in front of and behind the tent but <b>guy</b> <b>ropes,</b> as such, were not used.|$|R
5000|$|Tunnel tents {{may offer}} more usable {{internal}} space than a dome tent {{with the same}} ground area, but almost always need <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> and pegs to stay upright. These are almost always double wall tents. Sizes range from 1-person tents with very limited headroom up to 8 or 10-person tents with headroom exceeding 180 cm.|$|R
50|$|Wesley and Giles {{drop off}} Buffy, Willow and Angel at City Hall. Everything goes fine until Buffy's <b>guy</b> <b>rope</b> sticks and an alarm goes off.

The Mayor's anger and the gang's relief reverse {{when it is}} {{discovered}} that Faith has captured Willow.|$|R
50|$|All {{the tents}} listed here had a canvas fabric and most used a {{substantial}} number of <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> (8 to 18). The guys had to be positioned and tensioned fairly precisely in order to pitch the tent correctly, so some training and experience were needed. Pup tents might use wooden or metal poles, but all the other styles mentioned here used wooden poles.|$|R
5000|$|A Sibley tent (bell tent) had a {{circular}} floor plan some 10 ft to 15 ft across, a single central pole some 10 ft high, and walls about 3 ft high. <b>Guy</b> <b>ropes</b> were connected every 2 ft {{around the top}} of the walls - these had to carefully tensioned to hold the pole upright and keep the tent in shape.|$|R
5000|$|Any {{vertical}} structure like a mast {{is subject to}} dynamic swaying stress from wind, which levers immense force {{at the base of}} the mast. Such stress is countered through [...] <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> which are diagonally supporting ropes from mast top to its base. These ropes share the load on the mast tops and communicate that force to the base structure.|$|R
5000|$|Pes anserinus ("goose foot") {{refers to}} the {{conjoined}} tendons of three muscles that insert onto the anteromedial (front and inside) surface of the proximal extremity of the tibia. The muscles are the sartorius, gracilis and semitendinosus {{sometimes referred to as}} the <b>guy</b> <b>ropes.</b> The name [...] "goose foot" [...] arises from the three-pronged manner in which the conjoined tendon inserts onto the tibia.|$|R
500|$|The {{extremely}} distinctive Morris C8 four {{wheel drive}} tractors, known as [...] "Quads" [...] that pulled the 25 pounder guns and their limbers also had to be disguised, as their presence directly advertised the presence of artillery. They were more simply camouflaged, again as trucks with real wheels, by draping a net over four poles tied {{to the sides of}} the vehicle and braced with <b>guy</b> <b>ropes.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The large tent, {{probably}} {{a revision of}} the SO-22 awning model, has also been called the [...] "privy tent" [...] because most models seen today have a bathroom in the rear side wall. This is a zippered, metre-square room that sticks out toward the back, and is held up by telescoping poles and <b>guy</b> <b>ropes.</b> Open grommets are placed near the top for ventilation.|$|R

5000|$|A pup tent {{is a small}} {{version of}} a ridge tent {{intended}} for 1 to 3 people. It usually has a rectangular floor of size ranging from 4 ft by 6 ft up to 6 ft by 8 ft, and ridge heights ranging from 3 ft up to 5 ft. Larger versions have side walls, usually about 1 ft high. There are <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> for each pole. Versions with sides add guys at each corner and in the centre of each side. These <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> help to maintain the required shape. Earlier versions had a single upright pole at each end, while later versions often have two poles at each end, arranged rather like an 'A' shape, {{in order to make}} access easier. Some models have a horizontal ridge pole joining the tops of the end poles to support the centre of the tent. Many armies issue pup tents as shelter halves, with each soldier carrying half a tent in his field gear, so two soldiers together can pitch a tent and share it.|$|R
5000|$|A tent [...] is {{a shelter}} {{consisting}} of sheets of fabric or other material draped over, {{attached to a}} frame of poles or attached to a supporting rope. While smaller tents may be free-standing or attached to the ground, large tents are usually anchored using <b>guy</b> <b>ropes</b> tied to stakes or tent pegs. First used as portable homes by nomadic peoples, tents are now more often used for recreational camping and temporary shelters.|$|R
50|$|The R-905 is a {{microwave}} transmission station {{that is used}} in the Swiss Army. The directional station consists of a transmitting and receiving device (SE R-905) - in which the antenna reflector is also integrated - the operator terminal (BT) - a handset with keypad and LCD - and a supply equipment (SA 95/1). There are a 24-V battery, a tripod with <b>guy</b> <b>ropes,</b> and a camouflage net. All the mentioned sums up to about 230 kg but can be man-carried separately.|$|R
60|$|Another {{tremendous}} {{section of}} the glacier rumbled earthward.
