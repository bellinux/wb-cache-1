In the Middle Ages, Popes gave generously of their personal fortunes. Social responsibility is a social norm. This norm holds that any social institution, including the smallest family unit and the largest corporation responsible for the behaviour of its members, may be held accountable for their misdeeds. It is implicitly stated that an organisation's responsibility extends far beyond the internal maintenance of its human resources to the external work environment as well. An organization fulfills its social responsibility when it meets economic and legal obligations. A socially responsive organisation acts the way it does because of its desire to satisfy some expressed social need. Social responsiveness is guided by social norms...|$|R

Minimally responsible threateners include those who knowingly commit a wrongful harm under duress, those who are epistemically justified but mistaken in their belief that a morally risky activity will not cause a wrongful harm, and those who commit a harm while suffering from a cognitive impairment which makes it prohibitively difficult to recognize and act on what is morally required of them. The chapter argues that minimally responsible threateners can indeed be morally liable for the harms they impose. Put differently, culpability is not a necessary basis for liability...|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1987 Hugo Portisch, advisor {{of the federal}} {{chancellor}} Franz Vranitzky, recommended the government to immediately and unconditionally admit the responsibility of Austria and to recant before the outcast Jews; Vranitzky concurred this opinion, but had no courage to act. Only in July 1991, one year {{before the end of}} Waldheim's term, when a political influence of Vranitzky and social democrats has noticeably increased, the chancellor made a public apology on behalf of the nation and admitted its <b>responsibility</b> (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> the guilt) for the crimes of the past. But neither Americans nor Israelis were impressed by this cautious confession made inside the Austrian Parliament.

5000|$|Under FOB {{terms the}} seller bears all costs and risks {{up to the}} point the goods are loaded on board the vessel. The seller's <b>responsibility</b> does <b>not</b> <b>end</b> at that point unless the goods are [...] "appropriated to the contract" [...] that is, they are [...] "clearly set aside or {{otherwise}} identified as the contract goods." [...] Therefore, FOB contract requires a seller to deliver goods on board a vessel that is to be designated by the buyer in a manner customary at the particular port. In this case, the seller must also arrange for export clearance. On the other hand, the buyer pays cost of marine freight transportation, bill of lading fees, insurance, unloading and transportation cost from the arrival port to destination. Since Incoterms 1980 introduced the Incoterm FCA, FOB should only be used for non-containerized seafreight and inland waterway transport. However, FOB is commonly used incorrectly for all modes of transport despite the contractual risks that this can introduce.

The colonial era British publications state they were [...] "defaced by the zeal of Mahommedans and Portuguese".
