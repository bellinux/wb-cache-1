After the end of World War II the flag was used by Belarusian diaspora in the West and by small groups of anti-Soviet resistance in <b>Belarus</b> itself.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1917 Russian Revolution, <b>Belarus</b> declared independence as the Belarusian People's Republic, which was conquered by Soviet Russia. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia became a founding constituent republic of the Soviet Union in 1922 and was renamed as the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Byelorussian SSR). <b>Belarus</b> lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. Much of the borders of <b>Belarus</b> took their modern shape in 1939, when some lands of the Second Polish Republic were reintegrated into it after the Soviet invasion of Poland, and were finalized after World WarII. During WWII, military operations devastated <b>Belarus,</b> which lost about a third of its population {{and more than half of}} its economic resources. The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945 the Byelorussian SSR became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR.|$|E

5|$|The {{banking system}} of <b>Belarus</b> {{consists}} of two level: Central Bank (National Bank of the Republic of <b>Belarus)</b> and 25 commercial banks.

5|$|The {{national}} emblem of <b>Belarus,</b> which replaced the historic Pahonia {{arms in a}} 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag, a map of <b>Belarus,</b> wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of <b>Belarus,</b> although this is incorrect {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of <b>Belarus.</b> Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria.|$|E

Opposition groups have continued to use this flag, though its display in <b>Belarus</b> has been restricted {{by the government of}} <b>Belarus,</b> which claims it was linked with Nazi collaboration during the Second World War. The white-red-white flag is used in protests against the government and by the Belarusian diaspora.|$|E
5|$|When {{drafting}} the <b>Belarus</b> Constitution, the Supreme Soviet deputies {{were influenced by}} the constitutions of various countries, including Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and the United States. Internally, the Constitution {{was influenced by the}} period of Soviet domination and a desire to bring back traditions brushed aside by the Soviet Government. The structure of the Constitution is similar to the Russian Federation: for example, the office of the President has powers analogous to those granted to the President of Russia. Overall, the Constitution sought to preserve the statehood of <b>Belarus</b> from pro-Russian unity movements, provide a strong head of state that could cure the ailments <b>Belarus</b> would endure in the post-Soviet era, and lay out a compromise between the political factions in <b>Belarus.</b>|$|E
