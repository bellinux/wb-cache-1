Some of these resemble rein-deer and are accompanied by alphabetic symbols similar to those on many ceramic tablets from Glozel. In order to verify the species identification, photographs of ten bone and stone artifacts with engraved or sculptured cervids were sent to a curator at the Zoological Museum in Bergen, Norway, who identified all of them as reindeer Although the alphabetic symbols accompanying the reindeer suggest that the artifacts are the same age as the ceramic tablets, firmly dated by thermoluminescence to Gallo-Roman times, the reindeer on bone are apparently much more recent.

5000|$|The {{primary sector}} employs 4.9% of {{regional}} assets (France: 6.8%) for 3.5% of regional {{gross domestic product}} (GDP). It is a sector in decline, particularly in mountain areas, as it fails to provide farmers with sufficient incomes, since their incomes are below {{a quarter of the}} average national income. Nevertheless, the region remains a large agricultural region. This sector is divided evenly between crops and livestock. The latter is varied: Ain, the Alps and the Rhone raise 1.2 million cattle (ranked 7th nationally) and produce 15.5 million hectoliters of milk (ranked 5th nationally), in the Drome region and the ardeche region pigs and sheep are prominent, whilst the Bresse region is famous for its poultry. Crops produced in the Ain region and the left bank of the Rhone are mostly grain, including maize (700 000 tons, with a national ranking of 5th [...] ). However, in the south (Drôme, Ardèche), fruit and vegetables are grown in the Rhone valley (the Valencia region in particular). The Rhône-Alpes is the largest producer of apricots and the second largest producer of peaches, raspberries, walnuts, cherries and tinned tomatoes. Milk and wine production are the second most important agricultural produce in the Rhône-Alpes [...] The Coteaux du Beaujolais (whose wine sales in the start of November is greatly influenced by the media) and the Côtes du Rhône provide 3.6 million hectoliters per year (see wines of Côtes du Rhône).

50|$|The {{location}} of Tauredunum {{has long been}} debated.

The landslide is now thought to have occurred on the mountain of Le Grammont, near Les Evouettes at the point where the Rhône empties into Lake Geneva. Such collapses, known as éboulements or bergfalls, are not uncommon in the Alps; in October 1963, the collapse of the side of Monte Toc in Italy caused 260 million m³ of debris to fall into the lake behind the Vajont Dam, sending a wave of water into the valley that killed up to 2,500 people. Mountainside collapses have caused similar though smaller lake tsunamis in at least three lakes in Switzerland - Lake Lucerne, Lake Lauerz and Lake Brienz. The danger is recognised by Switzerland's Federal Office for Civil Protection, which takes the risk of landslide-caused tsunamis into account in its disaster planning. Certain mountains, such as the Rigi and the Bürgenstock, present more of a risk. It is not uncommon for large boulders to fall off the Bürgenstock into Lake Lucerne, though this presents little risk of a tsunami because of the relatively low amount of energy released in such falls.|$|E

40|$|Background <b>Bois</b> <b>noir</b> is an {{important}} disease of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), caused by phytoplasmas. An interesting, yet elusive aspect of the <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> disease is “recovery”, i. e., the spontaneous and unpredictable remission of symptoms and damage. Because conventional pest management is ineffective against <b>bois</b> <b>noir,</b> deciphering the molecular bases of recovery is beneficial. The present study aimed to understand whether salicylate- and jasmonate-defence pathways might {{have a role in}} the recovery from the <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> disease of grapevine. Results Leaves from healthy, bois noir-diseased and bois noir-recovered plants were compared, both in the presence (late summer) and absence (late spring) of <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> symptoms on the diseased plants. Analyses of salicylate and jasmonate contents, as well as the expression of genes involved in their biosynthesis, signalling and action, were evaluated. In symptomatic diseased plants (late summer), unlike symptomless plants (late spring), salicylate biosynthesis was increased and salicylate-responsive genes were activated. In contrast, jasmonate biosynthesis and signalling genes were up-regulated both in recovered and diseased plants at all sampling dates. The activation of salicylate signalling in symptomatic plants might have antagonised the jasmonate-mediated defence response by suppressing the expression of jasmonate-responsive genes. Conclusions Our results suggest that grapevine reacts to phytoplasma infection through salicylate-mediated signalling, although the resultant full activation of a salicylate-mediated response is apparently ineffective in conferring resistance against <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> disease. Activation of the salicylate signalling pathway that is associated with the presence of <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> phytoplasma seems to antagonise the jasmonate defence response, by failing to activate or suppressing both the expression of some jasmonate responsive genes that act downstream of the jasmonate biosynthetic pathway, as well as the first events of the jasmonate signalling pathway. On the other hand, activation of the entire jasmonate signalling pathway in recovered plants suggests the potential importance of jasmonate-regulated defences in preventing <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> phytoplasma infections and the subsequent development of <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> disease. Thus, on one hand, recovery could be achieved and maintained over time by preventing the activation of defence genes associated with salicylate signalling, and on the other hand, by activating jasmonate signalling and other defence responses...|$|E

PCR and dot-blot analyses were used to detect stolbur phytoplasma. The life span of the planthopper was tested in the laboratory on broadbean, periwinkle, nettle and grapevine. Nymphs were found only on roots of Urtica dioica L., and many more adults were captured in nettle beds than on grapevine. Flight activity started in the middle of June and ended middle of September, with a flight peak at the end of July. In the laboratory, the longest life span was observed on nettle whereas broadbean and grapevine were not suitable for survival. Natural infec-tivity was 6 - 8 % for nymphs and 9 - 50 % for adults.

40|$|<b>Bois</b> <b>noir</b> is an {{important}} grapevine yellows disease in Europe that can cause serious economic losses in grapevine production. It is caused by stolbur phytoplasma strains of the taxonomic group 16 Sr-XII-A. Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret (Hemiptera: Cixiidae) {{is the most important}} vector of <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> in Europe. This polyphagous planthopper is assumed to mainly use stinging nettle [Urtica dioica L. (Urticaceae) ] and field bindweed [Convolvulus arvensis L. (Convolvulaceae) ] as its host plants. For {{a better understanding of the}} epidemiology of <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> in Switzerland, host plant preferences of H. obsoletus were studied in the field and in the laboratory. In vineyards of Western Switzerland, adults of H. obsoletus were primarily captured on U. dioica, but a few specimens were also caught on C. arvensis, hedge bindweed [Calystegia sepium (L.) R. Brown (Convolvulaceae) ], and five other dicotyledons [i. e., Clematis vitalba L. (Ranunculaceae), Lepidium draba L. (Brassicaceae), Plantago lanceolata L. (Plantaginaceae), Polygonum aviculare L. (Polygonaceae), and Taraxacum officinale Weber (Asteraceae) ]. The preference of the vector for U. dioica compared to C. arvensis was confirmed by a second, more targeted field study and by the positioning of emergence traps above the two plant species. Two-choice experiments in the laboratory showed that H. obsoletus adults originating from U. dioica preferred to feed and to oviposit on U. dioica compared to C. arvensis. However, H. obsoletus nymphs showed no host plant preference, even though they developed much better on U. dioica than on C. arvensis. Similarly, adults survived significantly longer on U. dioica than on C. arvensis or any other plant species tested [i. e., L. draba and Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (Lamiaceae) ]. In conclusion, although nymphs of H. obsoletus had no inherent host plant preference, adults tested preferred to feed and oviposit on U. dioica, which is in agreement with the observed superior performance of both nymphal and adult stages on this plant species. Urtica dioica appears to be the principal host plant of H. obsoletus in Switzerland and plays therefore {{an important}} role in the epidemiology of the <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> disease in Swiss vineyards...|$|E

A first semi-field test was performed on young leafhoppers obtained from hundreds of wild H. obsoletus adults that had been captured and allowed to breed in a greenhouse with nettle pots during the previous summer. In late spring, pots containing groups of these juveniles were treated by sprinkling the ground with selected strains of entomopathogenic fungi (Beauveria bassiana and Paecilomyces lilacinus) and nematodes (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema feltiae). The mortality of H. obsoletus was recorded on day 7, 14, and 21 after the treatment. A second trial was made in field conditions selecting plots (3 m 2 surface) in proximity of vineyards with a high quantity of nettle. These plots were sprayed on the middle of July at the ground level with the same enthopathogenic agents strains used for the first test. The plots were isolated with proper cages and the number of emerged adults was monitored during the whole flight period using yellow sticky traps.

The overwintering nymphs of the vector acquire the phytoplasma feeding on roots of herbaceous plants, including Urtica dioica L. (stinging nettle). In German and Italian vineyards the possibility to control the H. obsoletus nymphs feeding on stinging nettle roots using chemical weeding and insecticides was investigated. In particular, the effect of herbicides, applied in autumn and in different spring timings, and neonicotinoid insecticides on vector adult emergence was evaluated. Trials conducted to control nettle with glyphosate or a mixture of glyphosate+flazasulfuron significantly reduced the density of emerging adult vectors. The efficacy of herbicides was highest when they were applied in autumn or in early spring with the nymphs not older than the fourth instar. Herbicides applied too close {{to the beginning of the}} emergence of adults reduced numbers only during the late part of the planthopper flight-period. Although neonicotinoid insecticides applied in early spring gave efficacy comparable to herbicides, their use is not advisable for the negative side effects on non-target arthropods (e. g. honeybees).

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{reconstruct}} spatiotemporal patterns of past landslide reactivation in a forested area of the Barcelonnette Basin (<b>Bois</b> <b>Noir</b> landslide, Southern French Alps). Analysis of past events was based on tree ring series from 79 heavily affected Mountain pine (Pinus uncinata Mill. ex Mirb) trees growing near or next to the landslide body. Dendrogeomorphic analysis focused on the presence of compression wood and growth reductions, with the first reaction being used for a dating of past reactivations with seasonal precision. A total of 151 growth disturbances were identified in the samples representing eight different stages of reactivation of the landslide body between 1874 and 2008. The spatiotemporal accuracy of the reconstruction is confirmed by historical records from neighboring sites and by aerial photographs. The onset of compression wood formation allows identifying five stages of landslide reactivation during the dormant season or the very beginning of the growing season of trees, i. e., between early October and late May, and three stages toward the end of the growth period. Monthly rainfall data from the HISTALP database demonstrate that the rainfall during four out of the eight reactivations are characterized by summer rainfall totals (July-August) exceeding 200 mm, pointing to the important role of summer rainstorms in the triggering of events at the <b>Bois</b> <b>Noir</b> landslide body...|$|E
40|$|Wild {{herbaceous}} dicotyledonous plants (dicots) showing symptoms ascribable to phytoplasma disorders {{were found}} to be widely distributed in organic vineyards in central Tuscany (Italy) affected by <b>bois</b> <b>noir,</b> a grapevine yellows disease caused by “ Candidatus Phytoplasma solani”. In 2010 symptomatic dicots were tentatively identified to species level and the incidence of symptoms estimated in two selected vineyards in the province of Florence. Incidence ranged from 2 to 77 %, and was not related to the relative abundance of hosts since very common species as well as relatively rare ones were consistently found to be symptomatic. PCR indexing and 16 S rRNA sequence analyses indicated that two phytoplasmas co-existed in the vineyards: “ Ca. P. solani”, infecting the root systems of 17 taxa, and a phytoplasma closely related to “ Ca. P. phoenicium”, infecting 11 taxa, and occasionally co-infecting the same plant. Regardless of the high frequency of both pathogens in the vineyards, only “ Ca. P. solani” could be detected in the grapevines. Population screening by means of tuf sequence analyses revealed the presence of only the tuf-b “ Ca. P. solani” type both in dicot hosts and grapevine. This supports current notions of <b>bois</b> <b>noir</b> epidemiology, indicating that some infected dicots act as sources of “ Ca. P. solani” inoculum whereas others are dead-end hosts. When the same specimens were screened by sequence analysis of the vmp 1 gene, evidence was found that different phytoplasma genotypes may be predominant in grapevines and dicots. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bois</b> <b>Noir</b> phytoplasma is an {{emerging}} disease of Vitis vinifera in several {{regions of the}} world. No completely resistant grapevine cultivars are known and the physiology of disease remains still poorly understood so far. Affymetrix GeneChip® oligonucleotide arrays {{have been used to}} identify differentially expressed genes between infected and recovered samples from cv. Chardonnay and between infected and healthy samples from cv. Manzoni Bianco. In the field, cv. Manzoni showed reduced symptoms,while cv. Chardonnay was highly susceptible to the disease. Results showed that expression levels of few hundreds genes were altered in infected plants, both common and specific for each cultivar, with effects on various metabolic pathways. In cv. Chardonnay a serious inhibition of whole photosynthetic chain and photosystem I activity, Calvin-cycle enzymes transcription, lipid metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was observed. Increasing physical barriers to limit phytoplsma spread in the plant was observed in both Chardonnay and Manzoni infected plants, with the repression of genes responsible for cell wall degradation and the induction of genes involved in cell wall reinforcement. Interestingly, specifically in cv. Manzoni the expression of a Myb transcription factor, belonging to a gene family that has a role in defense response, was induced. This is the first analysis of gene expression profiling in a grapevine-phytoplasma interaction using Affymetrix GeneChip® array. Presented data provide an interesting picture of the transcriptional response of grapevine to <b>Bois</b> <b>Noir</b> and allowed the selection of several candidate genes for future functional analysis...|$|E
40|$|Surveys and {{investigations}} of grapevine diseases, checking the presence/absence of phytoplasmas - causal agent of grapevine yellows in different variety of grapevine, {{were made for}} the first time during the period of 2006 and 2007, in the bigger vineyards in Macedonia. 7 localites and 13 regions under grapevine were analysed in this study. Phytoplasmas are cell wall-less plant pathogenic prokaryotes, causing more than 700 diseases in different plant species. 	The following pathological changes have been recorded on diseased vines: yellowing-or-reddening of leaves, wilting and triangle-shaped leaves rolling, drying of flowers and clusters, withering and bitter taste of berries, unlignificated and rubbery canes and their freezing during winter, as well as decline and death of vines in case of very sensitive variety. The consequences of the mentioned symptoms are yield loss and not proper quality of wine. 	The vines infected by phytoplasmas remain permanently diseases. 	 Mass and severe decline of vines infected by phytoplasmas was recorded in vineyards with chardonnay cv. and vranec, which showed to be very sensitive to the studied pathogens. Somewhat, less susceptibility to GY have shown by riesling italian and rhein riesling. Molecular detection and identification of phytoplasmas were done using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR following by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The results have shown the presence of <b>Bois</b> <b>noir</b> phytoplasma in all investigated region in Macedonia.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the mandatory control of Flavescence dorée (FD) in Italy, a monitoring programme for the pres- ence of the phytoplasma agent of this disease and its vector Scaphoideus titanus Ball. was initiated in Apulia (southern It- aly) since 2005. Surveys were carried out annually from June to October and, whenever observed, vines with yellows-like symptoms were tested by nested PCR. For vector catching, sticky traps were placed in a few vineyards and/or nurseries {{in each of the}} six Apulian provinces and replaced every two weeks, during the whole insect fly period (mid-June to late September). In 2013, 19 adults of a leafhopper with the morphological traits of S. titanus, as determined using the Douglas and Barnett (1976) key, were captured {{for the first time in}} Apulia, on traps exposed from mid August to mid September. The collected specimens were brought to the laboratory and 17 of them were tested individually by nested PCR for the presence of phytoplasmas. The insects were in- dividually ground in CTAB-based buffer (Marzachì et al., 1998), aliquots (2 μl) of the recovered total nucleic acid were subjected to nested PCR using two pairs of generic primers (P 1 ⁄P 7, R 16 F 2 n⁄R 16 R 2) that amplify phytoplasma 16 S rD- NA (Gundersen and Lee, 1996). No positive amplifications were obtained. The few vines with yellows-like symptoms present in some vineyards were PCR-positive but, after se- quencing of their amplicons, proved to be infected by Can- didatus Phytoplasma solani, the agent of <b>Bois</b> <b>noir.</b> Whereas <b>Bois</b> <b>noir</b> is known to occur in Apulia, though sporadically, S. titanus represents a new finding and a threatening one for the well-being of the local viticultural industry...|$|E
