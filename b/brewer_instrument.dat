Intercomparison of the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument</b> with other UV-B monitoring devices have shown agreement to within plus or minus 10 percent. Comparisons of UV-B spectra measured on fair weather days reveal the well known increasing influence of ozone on UV-B irradiance with decreasing wavelengths.

40|$|Brewer {{total ozone}} column {{measurements}} started in Sodankylä in May  1988, 9  months after the signing of The Montreal Protocol. The <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument</b> has been well maintained and frequently calibrated since then to produce a high-quality ozone time series now spanning more than 25  years. The data have now been uniformly reprocessed between  1988 and  2014. The quality of the data has been assured by automatic data rejection rules {{as well as by}} manual checking. Daily mean values calculated from the highest-quality direct sun measurements are available 77  % of time with up to 75  measurements per day on clear days. Zenith sky measurements fill another 14  % of the time series and winter months are sparsely covered by moon measurements.

40|$|A {{one week}} field {{campaign}} {{took place in}} September 2002 at El Arenosillo, Spain. The objective was to compare total ozone column (TOC) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from near ultraviolet to near infrared, measured by several Spanish and French instruments. Three spectroradiometers, Brewer, SPUV 02, and LICOR, and a CIMEL photometer, have been used simultaneously {{and the results are}} presented for four clear days. TOC values are given by the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument,</b> and by SPUV 02, using two different methods. The ground instruments compare satisfactorily (within 5 &nbsp;DU) and the values are consistent with TOMS data (within 10 &nbsp;DU). AOD from the various instruments are compared at seven different wavelengths between 320 nm and 1020 nm: the agreement is very good at 350, 380, and 870 nm; at the four other wavelengths the difference is smaller than 0. 03, which can be explained by a relative difference of 4 % only between the calibrations of the various instruments. Larger AOD diurnal variations were observed at short wavelengths than in the visible and near infrared; this is most likely due to changes in aerosol size along the day, during the campaign...|$|E
40|$|The Arosa site is {{well known}} in the ozone {{community}} for its continuous total ozone column observations that have been recorded since 1926. Originally based on Dobson sun spectrophotometers, the site has been gradually complemented by three automatic <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments,</b> in operation since 1998. To secure the long-term ozone monitoring in this Alpine region and to benefit from synergies with the World Radiation Center, the feasibility of moving this activity to the nearby site at Davos (aerial distance of 13  km) has been explored. Concerns about a possible rupture of the 90 -year-long record has motivated a careful comparison of the two sites, since great attention to the data continuity and quality has always been central to the operations of the observatory at Arosa. To this end, one element of the Arosa Brewer triad has been set up at the Davos site since November  2011 to realize a campaign of parallel measurements and to study the deviations between the three <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments.</b> The analysis of the coincident measurement shows that the differences between Arosa and Davos remain within the range of the long-term stability of the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments.</b> A nonsignificant seasonal cycle is observed, which could possibly be induced by a stray-light bias and the altitude difference between the two sites. These differences are shown to be lower than the short-term variability of the time series and the overall uncertainty from individual <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> and therefore are not statistically significant. It is therefore concluded that the world's longest time series of the total ozone column obtained at Arosa site could be safely extended and continued with measurements taken from instruments located at the nearby Davos site without introducing a bias to this unique record...|$|R

This campaign was a joint effort of COST Action ES 1207 EUBREWNET and the Area of Instrumentation and Atmospheric Research of INTA. Twenty one Brewer instruments from eleven countries participated and their ozone and solar 5 UV irradiance calibrations were performed, {{in the latter case}} using the traveling reference standard QASUME instrument of the World Radiation Center for UV (WRC-UV). This work shows a general overview of the ozone comparison focused on the correction of the stray light effect for the single- monochromator Brewer spectrophotometer, derived from the comparison with a reference double-monochromator <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument.</b> At the beginning of the campaign, 16 out of the 21 participating Brewer instruments (76  %) agreed within better 10 than ± 1  %, and 10 instruments (50  %) agreed within better than ± 0. 5  %.

These data sets have already been extensively validated and are assured to be of high accuracy. Continuity and consistency of data sets among the various satellite instruments as well as ground networks is essential for detecting an ozone recovery and climate change. Our objective, as part of the Envisat CaWal program, is to validate SCIAMACHY, MIPAS, and GOMOS ozone products using these heritage instruments. In addition we plan to validate SCIAMACHY Level 1 radiance using heritage satellite data and ground observations using a radiative transfer model. Ground based data included US ozonesonde profiles and a double monochromator <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument</b> located at Goddard Space Flight Center. To date we have tested our intercomparisons algorithms using available Envisat data compared with SBW/ 2 and the ground based observations.

40|$|Daily {{total ozone}} column (TOC) {{measurements}} from the Brewer spectroradiometer located at El Arenosillo (Spain) and the Spectrometer for Atmospheric TRAcers Monitoring (SPATRAM) located at Évora (Portugal) are analyzed for the period 2006 – 2008. The main goal {{of this study is}} to compare TOC estimates retrieved with the passive differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) methodology from zenith-sky observations by the SPATRAM spectrometer with highly accurate TOC estimates retrieved from direct-sun recordings by a well-calibrated <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument.</b> On average, SPATRAM TOC estimates are (1. 69 ± 0. 18) % smaller than collocated Brewer TOC estimates. Significant relative differences between SPATRAM and Brewer total ozone data are detected in some periods caused by the influence of high aerosol load episodes over the SPATRAM data. Satellite data recorded by the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) -DOAS algorithm aboard the NASA EOS-Aura satellite have been used to quantify the natural spatial variability of TOC over the region of interest as a potential source of uncertainty in the SPATRAM-Brewer comparison. Our results show that the differences observed between both systems is not associated with the natural spatial variability of TOC. In addition, the OMI-DOAS total ozone data have been compared to the ground-based spectroradiometer data showing an excellent agreement for the Brewer spectroradiometer (R 2 ∼ 0. 95) and a fairly good agreement for the SPATRAM instrument (R 2 ∼ 0. 89) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{methodology}} used by Brewer spectroradiometers {{to estimate}} the ozone column is based on differential absorption spectroscopy. This methodology employs the ozone air mass factor (AMF) to derive the total ozone column from the slant path ozone amount. For the calculating the ozone AMF, the Brewer algorithm assumes that the ozone layer is located at a fixed height of 22 km. However, for a real specific site the ozone presents a certain profile, which varies spatially and temporally depending on the latitude, altitude and dynamical conditions of the atmosphere above the site of measurements. In this sense, this work address {{the reliability of the}} mentioned assumption and analyses the influence of the ozone profiles measured above Madrid (Spain) in the ozone AMF calculations. The approximated ozone AMF used by the Brewer algorithm is compared with simulations obtained using the libRadtran radiative transfer model code. The results show an excellent agreement between the simulated and the approximated AMF values for solar zenith angle lower than 75 &deg;. In addition, the relative differences remain lower than 2 % at 85 &deg;. These good results are mainly {{due to the fact that}} the altitude of the ozone layer assumed constant by the Brewer algorithm for all latitudes notably can be considered representative of the real profile of ozone above Madrid (average value of 21. 7 &plusmn; 1. 8 km).

However, to take advantage of this the instruments must be better calibrated and it is also necessary that the ground-based <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> are operated in a mode that is different from the routine operational mode.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that SO 2 columnar amounts have significantly increased following the five largest volcanic eruptions {{of the past}} decade in the Northern Hemisphere. A strong positive signal was detected by all the existing networks either ground based (Brewer, EARLINET, AirBase) or from satellites (OMI, GOME- 2). The study particularly examines the adequacy of the existing Brewer network to detect SO 2 plumes of volcanic origin in comparison to other networks and satellite platforms. The comparison with OMI and 45 GOME- 2 SO 2 space-borne retrievals shows statistically significant agreement between the Brewer network data and the collocated satellite overpasses. It is shown that the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument</b> is capable of detecting significant columnar SO 2 increases following large volcanic eruptions, when SO 2 levels rise well above the instrumental noise of daily observations, estimated to be of the order of 2 DU. A model exercise from the MACC project shows that the large increases of SO 2 over Europe following the Bárðarbunga eruption in Iceland were not caused by local sources or ship emissions but are clearly linked to the eruption. We propose that by combining Brewer data with that from other networks and satellites, a useful tool aided by trajectory analyses and modeling could be created which can be used to forecast high SO 2 values both at ground level and in air flight corridors following future eruptions...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of the recently developed Pandora spectrometer by comparing it with the Brewer reference triad. This triad was established by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in the 1980 s and is used to calibrate Brewer instruments around the world, ensuring high-quality total column ozone (TCO) measurements. To reduce stray light, the double <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument</b> was introduced in 1992, and a new reference triad of double Brewers is also operational at Toronto. Since 2013, ECCC has deployed two Pandora spectrometers co-located with the old and new Brewer triads, making it possible to study {{the performance of}} three generations of ozone-monitoring instruments. The statistical analysis of TCO records from these instruments indicates that the random uncertainty for the Brewer is below 0. 6  %, while that for the Pandora is below 0. 4  %. However, there is a 1  % seasonal difference and a 3  % bias between the standard Pandora and Brewer TCO data, which is related to the temperature dependence and difference in ozone cross sections. A statistical model was developed to remove this seasonal difference and bias. It was based on daily temperature profiles from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim data over Toronto and TCO from the Brewer reference triads. When the statistical model was used to correct Pandora data, the seasonal difference was reduced to 0. 25  % and the bias was reduced to 0. 04  %. Pandora instruments were also found to have low air mass dependence up to 81. 6 ° solar zenith angle, comparable to double Brewer instruments...|$|E
40|$|Concurrent {{measurements}} were taken using the Brewer spectrometer no. 30, the filter ozonometer M 124 no. 200 and the Dobson spectrophotometer no. 71 from September 1987 to December 1988 at Potsdam. The {{performance of the}} instrument types and the compatibility of ozone data was checked under the conditions of a field measuring station. Total ozone values derived from Dobson AD direct sun {{measurements were}} considered as standard. The Dobson instrument had been calibrated at intercomparisons with the World Standard Dobson instrument no. 83 (Boulder) and with the Regional Standard instrument no. 64 (Potsdam), while the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument</b> was calibrated several times with the Travelling Standard Brewer no. 17 (Canada). The differences between individual Brewer DS (direct sun) ozone data and Dobson ADDS are within plus or minus 3 percent with half of all differences within plus or minus 1 percent. Less than 0. 7 percent of the systematic difference can be due to atmospheric SO 2. Due to inadequate regression coefficients Brewer ZB (zenith blue) ozone measurements are by (3 [...] . 4) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone values. M 124 DS ozone data are systematically by (1 [...] . 2) percent higher than Dobson ADDS ozone with 50 percent of the differences within plus or minus 4 percent, but with extreme differences up to plus or minus (20 [...] . 25) percent. M 124 ZB ozone values are by (3 [...] . 5) percent higher than Dobson ADDS with all the differences within plus or minus 10 percent, i. e. the scatter of differences is smaller for ZB than for M 124 DS measurements, Results for differences in the daily mean ozone values are also addressed.

We describe a data assimilation system (TM 3 -DAM, version 3) which is currently in use to assimilate near-real time GOME ozone data, and which produces (three-day or longer) ozone forecasts. The model is a tracer transport model, called TM 3, with a parameterised description of stratospheric ozone chemistry. The model is driven by meteorological fields from the ECMWF weather prediction model. The assimilation is based on near-real time level- 2 ozone data from the GOME instrument on the ESA ERS- 2 satellite. This data assimilation model is used to investigate the record low ozone values as observed over northwestern Europe by GOME, <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> and ozone sondes.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the adequacy of}} the existing Brewer network to supplement other networks from the ground and space to detect SO 2 plumes of volcanic origin. It was found that large volcanic eruptions of the last decade in the Northern Hemisphere have a positive columnar SO 2 signal seen by the Brewer instruments located under the plume. It is shown that {{a few days after the}} eruption the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instrument</b> is capable of detecting significant columnar SO 2 increases, exceeding on average 2  DU relative to an unperturbed pre-volcanic 10 -day baseline, with a mean close to 0 and σ [*]=[*] 0. 46, as calculated from the 32 Brewer stations under study. Intercomparisons with independent measurements from the ground and space as well as theoretical calculations corroborate the capability of the Brewer network to detect volcanic plumes. For instance, the comparison with OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and GOME- 2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment- 2) SO 2 space-borne retrievals shows statistically significant agreement between the Brewer network data and the collocated satellite overpasses in the case of the Kasatochi eruption. Unfortunately, due to sparsity of satellite data, the significant positive departures seen in the Brewer and other ground networks following the Eyjafjallajökull, Bárðarbunga and Nabro eruptions could not be statistically confirmed by the data from satellite overpasses. A model exercise from the MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) project shows that the large increases in SO 2 over Europe following the Bárðarbunga eruption in Iceland were not caused by local pollution sources or ship emissions but were clearly linked to the volcanic eruption. Sulfur dioxide positive departures in Europe following Bárðarbunga could be traced by other networks from the free troposphere down to the surface (AirBase (European air quality database) and EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network)). We propose that by combining Brewer data with that from other networks and satellites, a useful tool aided by trajectory analyses and modelling could be created which can also be used to forecast high SO 2 values both at ground level and in air flight corridors following future eruptions...|$|E
40|$|Comparisons {{of total}} column ozone {{measurements}} from Dobson, <b>Brewer</b> and SAOZ <b>instruments</b> are presented {{for the period}} 1990 to 1995 at seven stations covering the mid- and the high northern latitudes, {{as well as the}} Antarctic region. The main purpose of these comparisons is to assess, by reference to the well established Dobson network, the accuracy of the zenith-sky visible spectroscopy for the measurement of total ozone. The strengths and present limitations of this latter technique are investigated. As a general result, the different instruments are found to agree within a few percent at all stations, the best agreement being obtained at mid-latitudes. On average, for the mid-latitudes, SAOZ O 3 measurements are approximately 2 % higher than Dobson ones, with a scatter of about 5 %. At higher latitudes, both scatter and systematic deviation tend to increase. In all cases, the relative differences between SAOZ and Dobson or Brewer column ozone are characterised by a significant seasonal signal, the amplitude of which increases from about 2. 5 % at mid-latitude to a maximum of 7. 5 % at Faraday, Antarctica. Although it introduces a significant contribution to the seasonality at high latitude, the temperature sensitivity of the O 3 absorption coefficients of the Dobson and <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> is shown to be too small to account for the observed SAOZ/Dobson differences. Except for Faraday, these differences can however be largely reduced if SAOZ AMFs are calculated with realistic climatological profiles of ozone, pressure and temperature. Other sources of uncertainties that might affect the comparison are investigated. Evidence is found that the differences in the air masses sampled by the SAOZ and the other instruments contribute significantly to the scatter, and the impact of the tropospheric clouds on SAOZ measurements is displaye...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{ground-based}} instruments used {{to report}} total column ozone (TOC) are Brewer and Dobson spectrophotometers in separate networks. These instruments make {{measurements of the}} UV irradiances, and through a well-defined process, a TOC value is produced. Inherent to the algorithm {{is the use of}} a laboratory-determined cross-section data set. We used five ozone cross-section data sets: three data sets that are based on measurements of Bass and Paur; one derived from Daumont, Brion and Malicet (DBM); and a new set determined by Institute of Experimental Physics (IUP), University of Bremen. The three Bass and Paur (1985) sets are as follows: quadratic temperature coefficients from the IGACO (a glossary is provided in Appendix A) web page (IGQ 4), the Brewer network operational calibration set (BOp), and the set used by Bernhard et al. (2005) in the reanalysis of the Dobson absorption coefficient values (B 05). The ozone absorption coefficients for <b>Brewer</b> and Dobson <b>instruments</b> are then calculated using the normal Brewer operative method, which is essentially the same as that used for Dobson instruments. Considering the standard TOC algorithm for the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> and comparing to the Brewer standard operational calibration data set, using the slit functions for the individual instruments, we find the IUP data set changes the calculated TOC by − 0. 5 %, the DBM data set changes the calculated TOC by − 3. 2 %, and the IGQ 4 data set at − 45 °C changes the calculated TOC by + 1. 3 %. Considering the standard algorithm for the Dobson instruments, and comparing to results using the official 1992 ozone absorption coefficients values and the single set of slit functions defined for all Dobson instruments, the calculated TOC changes by + 1 %, with little variation depending on which data set is used. We applied the changes to the European Dobson and <b>Brewer</b> reference <b>instruments</b> during the Izaña 2012 Absolute Calibration Campaign. With the application of a common Langley calibration and the IUP cross section, the differences between Brewer and Dobson data sets vanish, whereas using those of Bass and Paur and DBM produces differences of 1. 5 and 2 %, respectively. A study of the temperature dependence of these cross-section data sets is presented using the Arosa, Switzerland, total ozone record of 2003 – 2006, obtained from two Brewer-type instruments and one Dobson-type instrument, combined with the stratospheric ozone and temperature profiles from the Payerne soundings in the same period.

These instruments were installed between 1957 and 1964 at five Canadian sites and replaced by the more advanced <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> in the mid- 1980 s. Ozone measurements have also been made from satellites and in particular the daily global total ozone has been measured by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) during the period October 1978 through May 1993. Since the 1970 s the vertical profile of ozone concentration has also been measured with balloonsondes at several Canadian sites. Recent studies of ozone trends over Canada have shown negative trends in total ozone (WMO, 1994). In this thesis ozone trends in the troposphere and the lower to midstratosphere are examined using the three types of data sets. The purpose has been to investigate the ozone variation pattern in the northern hemisphere and to determine the possible effects of some meteorological factors on this variation during the period from January 1979 to December 1992. A statistical model for a trend analysis of the ozone time series has been used. The model included terms for seasonal variations in mean ozone and seasonal variations in ozone trends as well as the effect of some meteorological factors. An attempt to assess stratospheric temperature and ozone-temperature trends in the troposphere and lower and mid-stratosphere has also been made. It is concluded that while there is clear evidence for a negative trend in the total ozone column, the full coupling is masked by the seasonal variation...|$|R

The instrument measures 10 3 20 3 4. 3 cm and weighs 600 g. A principal design goal was the measurement of total ozone to within 1 % of ozone measurements made by much larger, heavier, and more expensive Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers. This goal has been met for a maximum air mass of up to; 2. 5, as demonstrated by comparisons of MICROTOPS II and its immediate predecessor, Supertops, with Dobson and <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> at various locations. Conventional interference filters are subject to gradual and unpredictable degradation. MICROTOPS II avoids these problems by using highly stable ultraviolet filters manufactured with an ion deposition process. The 2. 4 nm (FWHM) band pass of the UV filters was selected to balance noise and ozone measurement performance. The optical collimators and electronics of the instrument were carefully designed to optimize pointing accuracy, stray light rejection, thermal and long-term stability, signal-to-noise ratio, and data analysis. An internal microcomputer automatically calculates the total ozone column based on measurements at three UV wavelengths, the site’s geographic coordinates, and universal time, altitude, and pressure. The coordinates can be entered manually or by a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. A built-in pressure transducer automatically measures pressure. MICROTOPS II saves in nonvolatile memory up to 800 scans of the raw and calculated data. Measurements can be read from a liquid crystal display or transferred to an external computer. 1...|$|R

In addition, ground-based observations represent a valuable tool to validate satellite-derived products. To our knowledge, details about processing software packages to retrieve the TOC from Brewer spectrophotometer measurements are seldom specified in studies concerning such datasets, although some discrepancies can arise from the use of different algorithms and implementations. The deviations among retrieved TOCs from the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> located at Rome and Aosta (Italy), using different processing software (Brewer Processing Software, O 3 Brewer software and EUBREWNET products (Level 1. 5) are investigated.

Although the overall agreement of the BPS and O 3 Brewer TOC data with EUBREWNET data is clearly very good (as expected) and in most cases within the Brewer declared uncertainty less than 2  %, it is worth noticing that slight differences have been seen depending on the software in use. Such differences become larger when the instrumental sensitivity exhibits a long-term drift and even in short-term episodes due to the different algorithm for the standard lamp correction.

40|$|A {{differential}} absorption method, {{developed by the}} Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA), is applied to retrieve the total ozone column from UV global irradiance spectra under clear and cloudy sky conditions. Contrarily to clear sky, cloudy sky generates a high uncertainty in the retrieved ozone column. This study shows that under cloudy conditions the daily ozone mean is a rather good estimation of the true value. The standard deviation allows us to estimate the relative uncertainty of this mean value, i. e., about 7 %. Results for all conditions from 3 years at Villeneuve d'Ascq are presented, {{as well as a}} comparison with TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer) data. The results are very similar to those obtained for clear days: In 75 % of cases both values agree to within 5 %; however, some cases present larger relative differences. Over the 3 years considered, there is a bias less than 3 % (LOA>TOMS). This method is applied to five other European sites involved in the EDUCE (European Database for UV Climatology and Evaluation) project. Three of them are Brewer stations. The results of the comparison between the LOA-retrieved ozone and TOMS data show that a relative difference smaller than 5 % is obtained in 63 - 80 % of the cases, depending on site and year. Biases smaller than 3 % are observed (LOA>TOMS). The comparison between the LOA-retrieved ozone and total ozone data from direct sun and zenith sky observations of the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> shows better agreement. For more than about 80 % of cases, except at one site, the relative difference is smaller than 5 %, and the biases are smaller than 1 %.

Vertical ozone profiles measured in Dobson units (DU) are currently retrieved based on laboratory measurements of the ozone absorption cross-section spectrum between 270 and 400 nm published in 1985 by Bass and Paur (BP). Recently, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the European Space Agency (ESA) proposed using the set of ozone cross-section measurements made at the Daumont laboratory in 1992 (BDM) for revising the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) satellite ozone profiles and total ozone column retrievals. Dobson Umkehr zenith sky data have been collected by NOAA ground-based stations at Boulder, CO (BDR) and Mauna Loa Observatory, HI (MLO) since the 1980 s. The UMK 04 algorithm {{is based on the}} BP ozone cross-section data. It is currently used for all Dobson Umkehr data processing submitted to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) under the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) program of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Ozone profiles are also retrieved from measurements by the Mark IV Brewers operated by the NOAA-EPA Brewer Spectrophotometer UV and Ozone Network (NEUBrew) using a modified UMK 04 algorithm (O 3 BUmkehr v. 2. 6, Martin Stanek). Records from Dobson and <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> located at MLO and BDR were used to produce Umkehr ozone retrievals using BDM ozone cross-sections and compared to profiles produced using the BP ozone cross sections. Additional effects of the out-of-band stray light and stratospheric temperature variability on Umkehr profile retrievals are also discussed in this paper. This paper describes the sensitivity of the Umkehr retrievals with respect to the proposed ozone cross-section changes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccurate {{long-term}} {{monitoring of}} total ozone {{is one of}} the most important requirements for identifying possible natural or anthropogenic changes in the composition of the stratosphere. For this purpose, the NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) UV-visible Working Group has made recommendations for improving and homogenizing the retrieval of total ozone columns from twilight zenith-sky visible spectrometers. These instruments, deployed all over the world in about 35 stations, allow measurements of total ozone twice daily with little sensitivity to stratospheric temperature and cloud cover. The NDACC recommendations address both the DOAS retrieval parameters and the calculation of air mass factors (AMF) needed for the conversion of O 3 slant column densities into vertical column amounts. The most important improvement is the use of O 3 AMF look-up tables calculated using the TOMS V 8 O 3 profile climatology, that allows accounting for the dependence of the O 3 AMF on the seasonal and latitudinal variations of the O 3 vertical distribution. To investigate their impact on the retrieved ozone columns, the recommendations have been applied to measurements from the NDACC/SAOZ (Système d'Analyse par Observation Zénithale) network. The revised SAOZ ozone data from eight stations covering all latitude regions have been compared to TOMS, GOME-GDP 4, SCIAMACHY-TOSOMI, OMI-TOMS, and OMI-DOAS satellite overpass observations, as well as to those of collocated Dobson and <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments.</b> A significant improvement is obtained after applying the new O 3 AMFs, although systematic seasonal differences between SAOZ and all other instruments remain. These are shown to mainly originate from i) the temperature dependence of the ozone absorption cross sections in the UV being not or improperly corrected by some retrieval algorithms, and ii) the longitudinal differences in tropospheric ozone column being ignored by zonal climatologies. For those measurements sensitive to stratospheric temperature like TOMS, OMI-TOMS, Dobson and Brewer, the application of a temperature correction results in the almost complete removal of the seasonal difference with SAOZ, improving significantly the consistency between all ground-based and satellite total ozone observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of ozone in the chemistry and the radiative {{balance of the}} atmosphere is well established. Several ground and satellite based methods are available for measuring total column or the vertical distribution of ozone. The most common ground based instruments that measure ozone are the Dobson and the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments,</b> while ozone sondes measure vertical distribution of ozone. There are six Dobson instruments located in Australia, and ozone sondes are launched from one location (Laverton, Victoria). Solar atmospheric spectroscopy is an established technique to measure the total column amounts of trace atmospheric gases and aerosols. Ozone has a rich spectrum extending from the far ultraviolet to the microwave region. At Wollongong University a high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (HR-FTIR), a diode array ultraviolet spectrometer and a diode array visible spectrometer have been coupled to the same solar tracker to ensure all three instruments are viewing the same atmospheric column. One aim of this thesis {{is to develop a}} rugged, reliable inexpensive solar ultraviolet and visible spectrometer system, suitable to determine total column atmospheric ozone, based on the diode array spectrometer. The shape of the absorption features of the infrared spectrum is influenced by the temperature and pressure environment of the absorbing molecule, and therefore potentially contains information on the vertical distribution of the absorbing molecule. In contrast, in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the spectrum, the environment of the absorbing molecules has limited influence on the shape of the absorption features, and there is greater potential for retrieving accurate total column atmospheric ozone. The thesis also aims to develop the techniques required to determine total column atmospheric ozone from ground based solar high resolution FTIR, and to assess if the complementary information available from solar infrared, ultraviolet and visible spectra can be used to determine some vertical information on atmospheric ozone. The analysis algorithm requires some prior knowledge of the pressure-temperature and ozone vertical profile. Monthly averaged profiles, compiled from data collected remote from the measurement site (Laverton, 1000 km south, and Mascot airport, 80 km north) are used...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) {{is a key}} {{component}} of the Earth's atmosphere, being involved in the ozone destruction and production and influencing the radiative balance of our planet. Furthermore, it impacts on human health and contributes to the tropospheric pollution. Techniques to measure atmospheric nitrogen dioxide from both the space and the ground have noticeably advanced in the last decades and provide valuable information, while also presenting some serious limitations. In 1985, an automated Brewer ozone spectrophotometer was modified to add capability to measure solar visible radiation and retrieve atmospheric nitrogen dioxide besides total ozone and sulfur dioxide. Since then, more than 60 MKIV Brewer spectrophotometers have been put in operation in a worldwide network and long-term nitrogen dioxide records have been collected at several sites. However, the original algorithm, developed in the 1980 's, has never been officially updated and, although notable efforts have been done in the last years to improve the retrieval by the Brewer, high-quality estimates of nitrogen dioxide by this instrument are still difficult to acquire. This work introduces substantial innovation in measuring nitrogen dioxide with MKIV Brewers. For the first time, an instrument of this type was thoroughly characterised in its operating spectral range. A novel mathematical framework supporting observations was then developed to update the Brewer processing algorithm, to better understand its potentials and limitations and to optimise the measurement technique. The spectroscopic data sets used within the algorithm were completely updated using the most recently published absorption cross sections. Model calculations were performed with top-level radiative transfer codes to test the new algorithm, which not only allows more accurate estimates of nitrogen dioxide, but also introduces new capabilities in Brewer measurements, such as the retrieval of the oxygen dimer (O 4) and the degree of the linear polarisation of skylight. To test the new method, four field campaigns were organised. The limitations in the traditional calibration techniques due to the daily evolution of nitrogen dioxide were overcome by employing an innovative method and one Brewer (# 066) was successfully calibrated and compared to an instrument belonging to the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change. The two different observation techniques in which the Brewer operates, namely by looking directly to the sun or vertically to the zenith, were proven to be equivalent within the stated uncertainty. The latter was thoroughly evaluated by means of a Monte Carlo based method. The new algorithm was effectively applied to reprocess the long-term series recorded in the European Brewer stations of Saint-Christophe and Rome (Italy), Athens (Greece), Hradec Kralove (Czech Republic). To this purpose, two empirical methods to calibrate the <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> through statistical analyses were validated. The results were compared with satellite total column data retrieved from the SCIAMACHY, GOME- 2 and OMI instruments and with in-situ measurements of tropospheric concentrations {{to assess the impact of}} anthropogenic emissions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{activity}} “Absorption Cross-Sections of Ozone” (ACSO) {{started in}} 2008 as a joint {{initiative of the}} International Ozone Commission (IO 3 C), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the IGACO (“Integrated Global Atmospheric Chemistry Observations”) O 3 /UV subgroup to study, evaluate, and recommend the most suitable ozone absorption cross-section laboratory data {{to be used in}} atmospheric ozone measurements. The evaluation was basically restricted to ozone absorption cross-sections in the UV range with particular focus on the Huggins band. Up until now, the data of Bass and Paur published in 1985 (BP, 1985) are still officially recommended for such measurements. During the last decade it became obvious that BP (1985) cross-section data have deficits for use in advanced space-borne ozone measurements. At the same time, it was recognized that the origin of systematic differences in ground-based measurements of ozone required further investigation, in particular whether the BP (1985) cross-section data might contribute to these differences. In ACSO, different sets of laboratory ozone absorption cross-section data (including their dependence on temperature) of the group of Reims (France) and, 1992, 1995, abbreviated as BDM, 1995) and those of [8], and [7], (abbreviated as SER, 2014) were examined for use in atmospheric ozone measurements in the Huggins band. In conclusion, ACSO recommends:- The spectroscopic data of BP (1985) should no longer be used for retrieval of atmospheric ozone measurements. - For retrieval of ground-based instruments of total ozone and ozone profile measurements by the Umkehr method performed by <b>Brewer</b> and Dobson <b>instruments</b> data of SER (2014) are recommended to be used. When SER (2014) is used, the difference between total ozone measurements of <b>Brewer</b> and Dobson <b>instruments</b> are very small and the difference between Dobson measurements at AD and CD wavelength pairs are diminished. - For ground-based Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) measurements the use of BDM (1995) or SER (2014) is recommended. - For satellite retrieval the presently widely used data of BDM (1995) should be used because SER (2014) seems less suitable for retrievals that use wavelengths close to 300 nm due to a deficiency in the signal-to-noise ratio in the SER (2014) dataset...|$|R
40|$|This study {{exploits}} nadir spectral measurements in 325 - 335 nm {{range to}} infer total column ozone (TCO) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) and SCaning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY(SCIAMACHY) instruments. TCO {{from these two}} instruments retrieved using the Weighting Function Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (WFDOAS) are presented. Unlike in standard DOAS where the fitting procedure results inozone slant column which needs to be converted into vertical column (TCO) by using air mass factor (AMF), in our novel approach direct retrieval of vertical column amounts of ozone is possible by fitting vertically integratedozone weighting function to the sun-normalized radiances. Other implementations include proper modelling of the Ring effect including Raman correction for ozone absorption, the implicit use of the effective albedo and effective sceneheight accounting for cloud effects, and an ozone temperature correction. The new algorithm has been extensively validated with ground-based Dobson andBrewer TCO measurements. In general, the agreement between GOME WFDOAS and ground stations data is very good and the validation shows that the retrieval accuracy of WFDOAS is within the uncertainty of current ground-based instruments. Better agreements are observed in the comparison withBrewer measurements than with Dobson measurements. This may be explained {{to a large extent}} by the neglect of ozone temperature correction in the standard retrieval for Dobson and Brewer. Temperature correction has a larger effect onthe Dobson results. The accuracy of WFDOAS retrievals makes GOME data very attractive for evaluating the ground-based network data. Eight years of GOME data are used to assess the quality of the WOUDC-archived Brewer data. It is shown that monitoring of Brewer data quality and identification ofproblems in <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments</b> are possible. This method can also be applied to other ground-based instruments. Despite improvement with WFDOAS, somewhat larger differences between satellite TCO and ground based measurements remain at high latitudes under low sun conditions. The persistent TCO differences are due in part to profile shape sensitivity of satellite TCO retrieval algorithms. Improved ozone and temperature profile climatologies, which is prepared and presented in this thesis, will lead to improved satellite ozone measurements. The effect of ozone and temperature profiles on TCO retrievals is explored. The studydemonstrates that an improved and updated ozone and temperature climatological profiles can reduce the systematic errors in the retrieved GOME TCO, inparticular at high solar zenith angles. For SCIAMACHY application, the only change of algorithm is for calculating the reference spectra online in each iteration during retrievals rather than using look-up tables. Scaled SCIAMACHY FM ozone cross-section and wavelength pre-shifted by 0. 016 nm, as determined from our comprehensive investigation performed in this thesis, is used for the calculation of reference spectra and the Ring spectra. Improved cloud products and the new ozone and temperature profile climatologies are used. Quality of theretrieved TCO is assessed by correlative measurements from GOME and selected Brewer spectrophotometers. In general a good agreement is achieved apart from a scan angle dependent offset of about - 1 % to - 2 %. The reason for the offset is not understood but part of the offset might be related to thecalibration errors in the level 1 data. Nevertheless, combined data set from GOME and SCIAMACHY as retrieved from WFDOAS algorithm presented in this thesis will be valuable for long-term ozone studies...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{effects are}} one of the major {{uncertainties}} in assessing global climate change, ecosystem processes and human health. This is because they critically change the balance between the radiation entering and leaving the atmosphere, as well as influencing cloud formation and having direct effects on biological systems e. g. through the respiratory system. It is the direct radiative effects of aerosol that are the focus of this work. The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) {{is a measure of the}} extinction of radiation by aerosol throughout the depth of the atmosphere. It is wavelength dependent and is traditionally measured at a number of visible wavelengths, but there is little AOD data available at UV wavelengths especially in the UVB. The Brewer spectrophotometer makes direct sun measurements in the UV spectral range, which can in principle be used to calculate AOD at those wavelengths using a form of Beer's law. This work explores the capabilities of the Brewer for UV AOD measurements and applies the results to data from the Tropics and temperate mid-latitudes. Instrument specific weighting functions were tested for their ability to improve the AOD retrieval, but while they changed the partitioning of absorption between ozone and SO 2, they had negligible effect on the resulting AOD. After correcting the existing Brewer software for AOD retrieval, data from Manchester UK were compared with independent measurements of AOD, and measurements from the Manchester instrument were also evaluated against a standard Brewer on location in Spain. The inter Brewer comparisons were consistent with differences of the order 6 - 10 %, while comparison with independent methods was qualitatively consistent, but absolute differences were of the order 10 - 30 %. This might partially be attributed to wavelength mismatches between the different methods, and assumptions in the various methods of calculating the AOD. Following the validation exercise the AOD was retrieved from <b>Brewer</b> <b>instruments,</b> using standard weighting functions, in Manchester from 2000 - 2008 and Reading from 2003 - 2008. Based on this work in the UK, the method was then applied to data from Malaysia (1998 - 2007), where the climate is totally different to that of the UK. The AOD data obtained from the UK and from the Tropics have been compared. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia gave the highest average AOD values probably due to it being a developing city with high pollution levels indicating a human impact on climate change. Brewer AOD measurements obtained at a narrow range of wavelengths were then used to calculate Angstrom parameters by applying Volz Method. The results, often generating a negative alpha, were deemed unreliable at the UK sites. This was largely attributed to the high solar zenith angle and low signal to noise of the direct sun measurement, exacerbated by a limited number of clear sky measurements available for the work. However, calculation of Angstrom parameters was more successful in Malaysia due to a low solar zenith angle, high intensity, and greater frequency of truly could free sky. Results indicated that aerosol particles in the capital Kuala Lumpur show a clear domination by fine mode. This domination is probably caused by urban pollution, mainly from road traffic, industrial and anthropogenic activities, which is consistent with a large capital city undergoing rapid development. Thus the capabilities and limitations of the Brewer spectrophotometer to provide both AOD data at UV wavelengths, and from those further aerosol properties, has been tested and demonstrated in two contrasting climatic regions. Air mass, limiting the UV signal, and stray-light within the instrument are two of the factors that limit the success of the Brewer for these measurements, which proved more reliable when the sun was high in the sky as in the Tropics.
