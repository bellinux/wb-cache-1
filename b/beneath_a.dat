5|$|A lead coffin in a rock-cut grave was {{discovered}} {{at a site}} adjacent to the Fosse Way in 1988. This discovery, and the impending commercial development of the site by the landowner, Showerings, led archaeologists to undertake more extensive excavations in the 1990s. The grave {{was part of a}} larger cemetery which contained 17 burials lying on a rough east-west alignment, indicating probable Christian adherence. Two other, smaller, cemeteries contained graves aligned north-south, possibly signifying pagan religious practices. One burial was in a substantial stone coffin which had been positioned <b>beneath</b> <b>a</b> mausoleum, the foundations of which remained.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 16. The wave axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed <b>beneath</b> <b>a</b> cold-core upper-level low. By August 27, the wave axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between Florida and the Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5mph (7km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230miles (370km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure <b>Beneath</b> <b>a</b> Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would be challenging, and he knew he would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E
5|$|From about 4000 BC, Neolithic {{settlers}} arrived introducing cereal cultivars, domesticated animals such {{cattle and}} sheep, large timber building, and stone monuments.

An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world, consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops.|$|E
