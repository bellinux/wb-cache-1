25|$|Williams' {{personal}} life began to unravel: His maternal grandmother {{with whom he}} was very close died in 1976; he lost his counseling job in 1977 after being implicated in a robbery that was committed by two youths from a group home that Williams supervised; he was denied an opportunity to compete in an amateur bodybuilding contest after {{it was discovered that}} he was a gang leader (Williams would later appear on the 1970s variety show The Gong Show performing a posedown routine); and his gangbanger lifestyle was beginning to take a mental toll on him, which included a brief stay in the psychiatric ward of a hospital after Williams experienced a <b>bad</b> <b>trip</b> while high on PCP. With each of these setbacks, Williams found himself using PCP more and more. To support his drug habit and obtain PCP, Williams would intimidate and/or rob drug dealers in South Central L.A.. Williams' addiction to PCP would prove to be his undoing.|$|E
500|$|Users {{having a}} {{pleasant}} experience can {{feel a sense}} of connection to others, nature, and the universe; other perceptions and emotions are also often intensified. Users having an unpleasant experience (a [...] "bad trip") describe a reaction accompanied by fear, other unpleasant feelings, and occasionally by dangerous behavior. In general, the phrase [...] "bad trip" [...] is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions, not just transitory experience of such feelings. A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a <b>bad</b> <b>trip,</b> including [...] "tripping" [...] during an emotional or physical low or in a non-supportive environment (see: set and setting). Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs, including alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of a <b>bad</b> <b>trip.</b> Other than the duration of the experience, the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of LSD or mescaline. However, in the Psychedelics Encyclopedia, author Peter Stafford noted, [...] "The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer, not as forceful and less isolating. It tends to build connections between people, who are generally much more in communication than when they use LSD." ...|$|E

Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a <b>bad</b> <b>trip</b> home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E

We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a <b>bad</b> <b>trip</b> home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark.

[...] A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic Jonathan Meades. [...] "I went [...] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking. I said, 'What's up?' and he sort of giggled and said, 'That's Syd having a <b>bad</b> <b>trip.</b> We put him in the linen cupboard'". Storm Thorgerson responded to this claim by stating [...] "I do not remember locking Syd up in a cupboard. It sounds to me like pure fantasy, like Jonathan Meades was on dope himself." [...] Other friends assert that Barrett's infamous flatmates, [...] "Mad Jock" [...] and [...] "Mad Sue," [...] believed that acid held all the answers and thought of Barrett as a genius or [...] "god," [...] and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behavior continued. Watkinson and Anderson included quotes from a story told to them by Thorgerson that underscored how volatile Barrett could be. [...] "On one occasion, I had to pull him off Lindsay (Barrett's girlfriend at the time) because he was beating her over the head with a mandolin". On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house. These strange behaviors contradicted Barrett's usually gentle nature. According to Gilmour in an interview with Nick Kent, the other members of Pink Floyd approached psychiatrist R. D. Laing with the 'Barrett problem'. After hearing a tape of a Barrett conversation, Laing declared him [...] "incurable".|$|E

[...] He had {{both good and bad}} trips. [...] One <b>bad</b> <b>trip</b> left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966. [...] Crumb created a number of his best-known characters during his years of LSD use, including Mr. Natural, Angelfood McSpade, and the Snoid.|$|E

After his stint in Superstar, they took over as his producers and resumed writing songs for him. Young's third single [...] "It's Only Love" [...] was released in March 1974, but failed to chart in the top 50. The B Side was a track called <b>Bad</b> <b>Trip.</b> Young said [...] "no one liked it. It was a disappointment. It was about suicide but they must've thought it was about drugs because of the title. It wasn't banned or anything, they just didn't play it." [...] Young considered {{a part in the}} musical Godspell but decided against it, preferring to go back to sheet metal work.

[...] Raisa Bruner from Time {{described}} the video's content as [...] "return to peak Gaga": [...] "shocking costumes, uninhibited group choreography and over-the-top stunt work for maximum visual impact." [...] She gave a positive review to the video's direction: [...] "Gaga and Åkerlund aren't afraid to make the viewer uncomfortable and play with the destructive impacts of violence and passion, which is a good match for the masochism of the song." [...] Spins Anna Gaca wrote in her review of the video: [...] "This Jonas Åkerlund-directed acid horror Western is a hell-on-wheels <b>bad</b> <b>trip,</b> jam-packed with neon lighting, vampy looks, and 'professional driver on a closed course' stunts." [...] Gaca commented that the video was even more [...] "overstuffed" [...] than the song.|$|E

50|$|Later {{reexamination of}} Leary's data reveals his results to be skewed, whether {{intentionally}} or not; {{the percent of}} men in the study who ended up back in prison later in life was approximately 2% lower than the usual rate. Leary was later introduced to LSD, and he then incorporated that drug into his research as his mental catalyst of choice. Leary claimed that his experiments produced no murders, suicides, psychotic breaks, or <b>bad</b> <b>trips.</b> On the contrary, almost all of Leary's participants reported profound mystical experiences which they felt had a tremendously positive effect on their lives. While it is true that Leary's experiments did not lead to any murders, he willfully chose to ignore the <b>bad</b> <b>trips</b> which occurred, as well as the attempted suicide of a woman the day after she was given mescaline by Leary.|$|R

50|$|The manifestations {{can range}} from {{feelings}} of vague anxiety and alienation to profoundly disturbing states of unrelieved terror, ultimate entrapment, or complete loss of self-identity.
