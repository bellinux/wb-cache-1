5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} produce [...] "cycling dryers". These store a cold {{mass that}} cools {{the air when}} the compressor is OFF. When the refrigeration compressor runs, the large mass takes much longer to cool, so the compressor runs longer, and stays OFF longer. These units operate at lower dew points, typically in the 35-40 °F range. When selected with the optional [...] "cold coalescing filter", these units can deliver compressed air with lower dew points. Non-cycling dryers use a hot gas <b>by</b> <b>pass</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent the dryer from icing up.|$|E
40|$|The IBM System 4 Solar Energy System is {{described}} and evaluated. The system {{was designed to}} provide 35 percent of the space heating and 63 percent of the domestic hot water preheating for a single family residence located within the United States. The system consists of 259 square feet of flat plate air collectors, a rock thermal storage containing 5 1 / 2 ton of rock, heat exchangers, blowers, a 52 gallon preheat tank, controls, and associated plumbing. In general, {{the performance of the}} system did not meet design expectations, since the overall design solar fraction was 48 percent and the measured value was 32 percent. Although the measured space heating solar fraction at 32 percent did agree favorably with the design space heating solar fraction at 35 percent, the hot water measured solar fraction at 33 percent did not agree favorably with the design hot water solar fraction of 63 percent. In particular collector array air leakage, dust covered collectors, abnormal hot water demand, and the preheat tank <b>by</b> <b>pass</b> <b>valve</b> problem are main reasons for the lower performance...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the fire protection and life safety features for UW Medicine Lake Union, a research and laboratory building, in accordance with Seattle Building Code (SBC), International Building Code (IBC), and Life Safety Code (NFPA 101). The objective of this report is to identify if UW Medicine Lake Union meets both the prescriptive and performance based code. The primary fire safety goal is to provide life safety system that reduced the risk of fire-related injuries and loss of life due to fire. The prescriptive analysis is used to identify the building integrity per code. This evaluates the egress capacity, fire detection, fire suppression and structural fire protection. The UW Medicine Lake Union includes numerous laboratories that regularly utilize various hazardous materials. According to the literature in the Architectural drawings, the design team worked with the university does that the chemical quantities in these areas would not exceed the limits set forth in the code. With these limits in place, portions of the facility {{did not need to be}} classified as hazardous occupancy, and the special provisions associated with a hazardous occupancy. Although its spaces are used in various ways, the building was able to be classified as business occupancy. Hazardous occupancy areas were not required because hazardous materials were limited to the code-defined exempt quantities. These details helped simplify the overall life safety and egress system, while providing appropriated levels of life safety. UW Medicine Lake Union Building is high rise building with seven story research and development laboratory and two levels of below grade parking garages. It includes testing and research laboratories, laboratory support, offices and conference room. It is approximately 317, 382 square feet in gross area and a building height of 109 feet. It is classified as B occupancy classification. The facility is protected throughout by automatic sprinkler and fire alarm systems. The building was constructed in 2011 in accordance with the 2009 Seattle Building Code with a Type 1 A construction. See 2. 6 Type and Description of Construction. The total occupant load is 2797 occupants. See Table 4 : Summary of Occupant Loads. The UW Medicine Lake Union building has six (6) exit discharge. The Main and Back Entrance exit door have 72 ” doors; P 1 (Stair 1), Retail and South exit (stair 3) door have 36 ” doors, and the garage exit door (stair 4) have 44 ” door that leads to the public way. See Figure 19 : Egress Capacity, Travel Distance 2 ̆ 6 Wall Rating - Level 1 for location of exit discharge. Stair 1, 3 and 4 have 44 ” stairs with 36 ” door. Stair 2 have 62 ” stairs with 4 doors around it namely (2) 36 ”,(1) 42 ” and (1) 48 ”doors. Stair 15 has 36 ” stairs with 36 ” door. The basic requirement for all exit access path is that direct and unobstructed paths to exits are provided through easily identifiable routes. The Fire Alarm System is comprised of a Notifier NFS 2 - 3030 D Fire Alarm Control Panel, smoke detectors, manual pull stations, addressable interface modules, addressable interface relays, Fire Alarm Horn/Strobes (Clear Strobes), Smoke detection are located in transformer, electrical and communication rooms that do not have sprinkler protection, elevator machine rooms and elevator lobbies, within 5 feet of doors leading to pressurized stairways (except at Parking areas) and duct smoke detection. Refer to Chapter 3 Fire Alarm and Detection. Emergency voice alarm/communication system is provided in accordance with SBC 907. 5. 2. 2. Notification devices are activated by smoke or heat detectors, sprinkler waterflow, or manual pull stations. Audible alarms are provided per SBC 907. 5. 1 and visible alarms per SBC 907. 5. 3. A code alternate is provided for Vivarium and BSL 3 areas. See 3. 2. 2. 3 Code Alternate for Vivarium and BSL 3. Fire Protection standpipe and automatic fire sprinkler systems are supplied by an electric fire pump with automatic transfer switch to emergency generator power. The fire pump will draw water from an on-site storage tank (secondary water supply) located next to the fire pump room on Basement Level 3. The capacity of the water storage tank is 44, 300 gallons with a net usable water capacity of 33, 000 gallons. The water storage tank fill will be a 6 ” diameter water line supplied by a dedicated fire water service connection to the city water control valves and a 6 ” manual <b>by</b> <b>pass</b> <b>valve.</b> The fire pump room is constructed with 2 -hour fire rated construction. Refer to Chapter 4 Fire Suppression Systems. The performance based design is used to determine how the building will perform under a fire condition. The tenability criteria are: temperature less than 60 °C, carbon monoxide less than 1400 ppm, visibility greater than 10 meters and a smoke layer height to be greater than 2 meters off the floor. See Chapter 8 Performance Based Analysis for analysis...|$|E
40|$|Sirs: Long-term malpositioning of transvenous pa-cing {{leads in}} the left {{ventricle}} has been occasionally described in the literature and may remain undis-covered for a long time. Possibly, its prevalence is higher than thought [4].

As expected, the concentration was increased with increasing number of cycles. With 16  cycles, the concentration reached a maximum value of 0.4  mg/ml. However, further {{increasing the number of}} cycles, the concentration was basically unchanged. In the exploitation process <b>by</b> needle <b>valve,</b> <b>passing</b> the suspension through the valve more than once could result in the fragmentation of graphite, which was favorable for exploitation {{due to the fact that}} smaller graphite pieces are easier to delaminate into graphene than larger ones [25]. However, as the graphite flakes become smaller, the size of graphite was comparable with that of cavitation bubbles [39]. Therefore, the formation of new graphene flakes becomes difficult.|$|R
