40|$|A key {{ingredient}} for the Multi-Turn Extraction (MTE) at the CERN Proton Synchrotron is the <b>beam</b> <b>trapping</b> in stable islands of transverse phase space. In a previous paper a method allowing analytical {{estimation of the}} fraction of <b>beam</b> <b>trapped</b> into resonance islands {{as a function of}} the Hamiltonian parameters has been presented. Such amethod applies to one-degree of freedom models of betatronic motion. In this paper, the analysis is extended to the more realistic and challenging case of two-degree of freedom systems, in which the interplay between the horizontal and vertical motion is fully included. Numerical simulations are presented and the results are discussed in detail...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a system combining an ion <b>beam</b> <b>trap</b> {{and a low}} energy electron target in which the interaction between electrons and vibrationally cold molecular ions and clusters can be studied. The entire system uses only electrostatic fields for both trapping and focusing, thus being able to store particles without a mass limit.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to multiport switching in arrays of nonlinear waveguides is proposed. While other schemes have relied on suppressing the inherent transverse discreteness, this approach takes advantage of th is feature of the array. One {{of the effects of}} discreteness is to keep intense <b>beams</b> <b>trapped</b> in a single waveguide for the length of the array. Switching may be achieved by using a controlled perturbation to displace such a <b>trapped</b> <b>beam</b> in the transverse direction. This displacement is quantized to an integer number of waveguides, thus allowing unambiguous selection of the output channel. 1...|$|R
40|$|At the CERN Proton Synchrotron, {{a series}} of beam {{experiments}} proved beam splitting by crossing the one-fourth resonance. Depending on {{the speed at which}} the horizontal resonance is crossed, the splitting process is more or less adiabatic, and a different fraction of the initial <b>beam</b> is <b>trapped</b> in the islands. Experiments prove that when the trapping process is reversed and the islands merged together, the final distribution features thick tails. The beam population in such tails is correlated to the speed of the resonance crossing and to the fraction of the <b>beam</b> <b>trapped</b> in the stable islands. Experiments and possible theoretical explanations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{practical}} {{geometric optics}} method for derivation of the optical forces from light rays was described. By this method, the forces from a G. P. W. (Gaussian Plane Wave) {{and a general}} TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam were calculated and studied. For a G. P. W. beam, there were two forces which acted on small particles located inside the electromagnetic field; one, called the scattering force, directed in the beam propagation direction, pushed particles axially. The other, called the gradient force, due to the non-uniformity of the electromagnetic field, acted like an optical well and confined the particles of the beam axis. The forces from a general TEM$ sb infty$ beam behaved differently due to {{the profile of the}} beam. It was shown that axial confinement was also possible for a highly focused TEM$ sb infty$ beam, therefore providing the possibility of single <b>beam</b> <b>trapping.</b> The relationship between the forces and the profile of a TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam was investigated comprehensively. Three experimental stations were designed and built. Both upward and downward accelerating experiments were constructed to confirm the existences of the scattering force and the gradient force in a G. P. W. beam. Furthermore, the scattering force was studied quantitatively. A single <b>beam</b> <b>trapping</b> experiment was designed to verify the possibility of axial constraint of small particles by a higher focused TEM$ sb infty$ laser beam. The single <b>beam</b> <b>trapping</b> conditions found in the experiment were in agreement with the results of the theoretical analysis...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that simple “optically bound” chains of {{dielectric}} microparticles can form in a counter propagating Gaussian beam optical trap. Here we report experimental observations of more complex trapped states, which do not reflect the underlying symmetry of the optical <b>beam</b> <b>trap</b> they are confined in. We discuss both stationary off-axis trapping and dynamic motion. We confirm the results using a rigorous Mie scattering model and also give a physical explanation for these static and dynamic off-axis trapped states...|$|E
40|$|We propose two optical {{neutral atom}} traps for quantum {{computing}} involving {{the intersection of}} two or three laser beams. We simulate both the intensity and the potential energy of the interference pattern. From these simulations we create animations of how the potential energy and intensity change with varying angles of separation between the laser beams in the system. We parameterize lines through our interference pattern and fit simple harmonic oscillator potential energies to the potential energy wells calculated to characterize our interference pattern’s atom trapping capabilities. Finally, we investigate a possible quantum entanglement routine by observing how the geometry of both the intensity pattern and potential energy changes in our different animations. For the case of the double <b>beam</b> <b>trap</b> with different beam waists at θ = π/ 2, we found η = 41. 8 KHz and ∆Utrap = 0. 042 mK for BEC atoms, and η = 41. 2 KHz and ∆Utrap = 12. 4 mK for MOT atoms. For the case of the triple <b>beam</b> <b>trap</b> with all beams having equal parameters at θ = π/ 2, θ 2 = 0, and γ = 3 π/ 4 we found η = 8. 00 KHz and ∆Utrap = 0. 62 mK...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) was {{demonstrated}} in a dilute atomic gas [1], rotating BECs {{have been of}} interest to researchers due to their quantized circulation. We propose a new method of creating controlled vortices in a BEC. Atoms are held in {{the focus of a}} scanning beam that rapidly scans to produce a time-averaged potential [2]. We have made theoretical calculations to measure the heating caused by a scanning <b>beam</b> <b>trap</b> and to find the regime where a scanning beam produces a time-averaged potential. The scanning beam splits the BEC into four parts then imprints a relative phase on each part such that, when the parts recombine, a vortex forms. We have simulated such a system using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and have demonstrated the laser scanning pattern using a two-dimensional acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The optics for the scanning <b>beam</b> <b>trap</b> have been designed and the experimental trap dimensions are used in our simulations. To carry out the experimental part of this project, we are currently building and testing an all-optical BEC apparatus: we have made a magneto-optical trap (MOT) which cools the 87 Rb atomsto 30 uK. We are currently setting up an optical dipole trap to perform the final stages of cooling...|$|E

We load a single <b>beam</b> dipole <b>trap</b> directly from a magneto-optic trap (MOT) using an optimized loading sequence. After evaporation in the single beam, a second crossed beam is used for compression. The intensity in both beams is then reduced for evaporation to BEC.
