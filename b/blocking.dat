5|$|The {{attacks on}} Bien Hoa forced {{a change in}} tactics for the Australians, and 1 ATF's mission was quickly changed from reconnaissance-in-force to a <b>blocking</b> {{operation}} designed to intercept withdrawing communist forces. Between 31 January and 1 February, the Australian battalions moved into company <b>blocking</b> positions {{and a number of}} minor contacts occurred, resulting in some Viet Cong casualties and the capture of more weapons and equipment. Once in position, the intensity of these clashes increased as the Australians sprung platoon ambushes. Indeed, during early February, the nature of contacts in AO Columbus began to change, with the Australians increasingly faced by larger company-sized Main Force units located in static defensive positions. During the first week of February the Viet Cong began streaming through the AO, retreating from Saigon in the wake of heavy losses during Tet. Although the Viet Cong managed to avoid becoming decisively engaged, around 90 were killed and five captured, as the Australians maintained their <b>blocking</b> positions.|$|E
