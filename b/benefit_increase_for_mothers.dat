40|$|Results {{illustrating}} an atypical neural processing in {{the early}} and late differentiation of infant faces have been obtained with neglectful mothers. The present study explores whether a different pattern of response is observed when using non-infant affective pictures. We examined the event-related evoked potentials and induced delta, theta and alpha activity in 14 neglectful mothers and 14 control mothers elicited while categorizing positive, negative and neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System. Self-reports of anhedonia and empathy were also recorded. Early posterior negativity, P 200 and late positive potential components were modulated by the emotional content of pictures in both groups. However, the LPP waveform had a more delayed and more attenuated maximum in neglectful mothers than in control mothers.

40|$|Policymakers, educators, {{researchers}} and practitioners are devoting increasing {{attention to the}} challenges faced by low-income families in urban communities. Research indicates that poor women with young children are particularly susceptible to experiencing depression. Maternal depression {{has been associated with}} numerous negative outcomes <b>for</b> both <b>mothers</b> and their children. In view of the high prevalence of maternal depression and the myriad stressors faced by poor families in high crime neighborhoods, there is an urgent need to identify factors that may attenuate the negative impact of mother's depression on preschoolers' socioemotional development. Thus, the major {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the potential of social support and church attendance to moderate the relationship between maternal depression and children's behavior problems. 	The present study utilized secondary data from a larger, three-year study funded by the U. S. Department of Education. The sample for this study consisted of low-income African American mothers in violent neighborhoods in Washington, DC and Prince George's County, Maryland. All mothers had a three-to-five year old child enrolled in Head Start. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews utilizing culturally-sensitive measures. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the main and interaction effects for predictor (maternal depressive symptoms), moderator (social support, church attendance), and criterion variables (child internalizing and externalizing behavior problems). 	Results revealed that maternal depressive symptomology significantly predicted children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. Findings further revealed that social support moderated the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms and children's externalizing behavior problems. When the level of social support <b>increased</b> <b>for</b> <b>mothers</b> who did not exhibit extreme depressive symptomology, children had fewer externalizing behavior problems. In contrast, when social support <b>increased</b> <b>for</b> <b>mothers</b> with very severe depressive symptoms, children had greater externalizing problems. Maternal social support did not buffer preschoolers' internalizing problems. Maternal church attendance likewise failed to buffer the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms and internalizing or externalizing problems. Findings suggest a need for culturally-sensitive strategies to increase the support networks of low-income, urban, African American mothers of preschoolers. Such efforts may help educators and family practitioners to reduce the impact of maternal depression on preschoolers' externalizing behavior problems...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{increase}} in the number of foreigners in Italy has raised public interest in their demographic behaviour. In 2001 - 2007 the annual number of births to at least one foreign parent has more than doubled, from about 41, 000 to more than 86, 000. The main objective of this study is to give an overview of the demographic characteristics of foreign mothers in Italy. We investigate the risk of having another birth for women who became mothers between 2002 and 2006. The new approach in this study is the application of a deterministic record linkage to Italian administrative data on births, which allows a longitudinal analysis of birth histories.

The possibility of an `assimilative behaviour' to fertility patterns of native Italians <b>increases</b> <b>for</b> <b>mothers</b> whose partner is Italian. ...|$|R

RESULTS: The perinatal mortality rate was 22. 1 per thousand births. The multivariate analysis showed the following risk factors: low socioeconomic level, male sex and maternal age above 35 years.

40|$|Gastroschisis is an {{abdominal}} wall defect {{more prevalent in}} offspring of young mothers. It {{is known to be}} increasing in prevalence despite the general decrease in the proportion of births to young European women. We investigated whether the increase in prevalence was restricted to the high-risk younger mothers. We analysed 936 cases of gastroschisis from 25 population-based registries in 15 European countries, 1980 - 2002. We fitted a Bayesian Hierarchical Model which allowed us to estimate trend, to estimate which registries were significantly different from the common distribution, and to adjust simultaneously for maternal age, time (in grouped years) and the random variation between registries. The maternal age-standardised prevalence (standardised to the year 2000 European maternal age structure) increased almost fourfold from 0. 54 [95 % Credible Interval (CrI) 0. 37, 0. 75] per 10, 000 births in 1980 - 84 to 2. 12 [95 % CrI 1. 85, 2. 40] per 10, 000 births in 2000 - 02.
