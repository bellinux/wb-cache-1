40|$|In {{this work}} we reconsider the problem {{discussed}} by Caldeira and Leggett (CL), and generalize their results for a quantum oscillator coupled bilinearly to a reservoir with dense discrete spectrum of harmonic oscillators. We show that for such systems dynamic evolution {{of any state}} of the CL Hamiltonian consists of recurrence cycles with partial revivals of the initial state amplitude. This revival or Loschmidt echo appears in each cycle due to reverse (from the reservoir) transitions (not existing {{in the limit of}} a macroscopic <b>bath).</b> <b>Width</b> and number of the Loschmidt echo components increase with the recurrence cycle number, eventually leading to irregular, stochastic-like time evolution. Standard for continuous spectrum thermal bath CL dynamics dissipative dynamics (exponential decay) takes place only within the initial cycle. In terms of the effective CL Hamiltonian, where the reservoir degrees of freedom are integrated out, our results mean oscillatory (time periodic) behavior of the effective mass. Only in the initial cycle, we found the known for CL Hamiltonian exponential in time increase of the effective mass. We do believe that the basic ideas inspiring our work can be applied to a large variety of interesting nano-systems and molecular complexes. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{two types}} of strongly disordered one-dimensional Hamiltonian systems coupled to baths (energy or particle reservoirs) at the boundaries: strongly disordered quantum spin chains and disordered classical harmonic oscillators. These systems are believed to exhibit localization, implying in particular that the conductivity decays exponentially in the chain length L. We ask however for {{the profile of the}} (very slowly) transported quantity in the steady state. We find that this profile is a step-function, jumping {{in the middle of the}} chain from the value set by the left bath to the value set by the right <b>bath.</b> The <b>width</b> of the step grows not faster than √(L). This is confirmed by numerics on a disordered quantum spin chain of 9 spins and on much longer chains of harmonic oscillators. In the case of harmonic oscillators, we also observe a drastic breakdown of local equilibrium at the step, resulting in a chaotic temperature profile. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|A random matrix theory {{approach}} is applied {{in order to}} analyze the localization properties of local spectral density for a generic system of coupled quantum states with strong static imperfection in the unperturbed energy levels. The system is excited by an external periodic field, the temporal profile of which is close to monochromatic one. The shape of local spectral density is shown to be well described by the contour obtained from a relevant model of periodically driven two-states system with irreversible losses to an external thermal <b>bath.</b> The shape <b>width</b> and the inverse participation ratio are determined as functions both of the Rabi frequency and of parameters specifying the localization effect for our system {{in the absence of}} external field.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: High quality {{guidance}} in home strategies {{is needed to}} enable older people to measure their home environment and {{become involved in the}} provision of assistive devices and to promote consistency among professionals. This study aims to investigate the reliability of such guidance and its ability to promote accuracy of results when measurements are taken by both older people and professionals. Method: Twenty-five health professionals and 26 older people participated in a within-group design to test the accuracy of measurements taken (that is, person’s popliteal height, baths, toilets, beds, stairs and chairs). Data were analysed with descriptive analysis and the Wilcoxon test. The intra-rater reliability was assessed by correlating measurements taken at two different times with guidance use. Results: The intra-rater reliability analysis revealed statistical significance (P< 0. 05) for all measurements except for the <b>bath</b> internal <b>width.</b> The guidance enabled participants to take 90 % of measurements that they were not able to complete otherwise, 80. 55 % of which lay within the acceptable suggested margin of variation. Accuracy was supported by the significant reduction in the standard deviation of the actual measurements and accuracy scores. Conclusion: This evidence-based guidance can be used in its current format by older people and professionals to facilitate appropriate measurements. Yet, some users might need help from carers or specialists depending on their impairment...|$|R
