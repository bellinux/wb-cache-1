It is an extraordinary thing, that knowledge of kind to kind.

30|$|I’ve {{written a}} <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> (Augier and March 2007, 2011). Mostly, what I’ve written {{is that the}} pursuit of {{relevance}} is the enemy of the pursuit of knowledge. I don’t believe that absolutely. I think the pursuit of relevance actually has some advantages. It gives you focus, {{it gives you a}} sense of progress {{and a lot of other}} things like that. In our field, the pursuit of relevance leads you to abandon, too fast, the pursuit of knowledge and to become a kind of second rate consultant. Most of that is tied to the extent to which our studies are keyed to finding out what makes a difference in organizational performance. It’s a topic that is almost certainly not going to yield results as we know enough already to know that untangling what makes results positive results or negative results, is very hard to determine from a case study or even a relatively numerous study. Yet the pressure to do that is so strong, that a very common dependent variable is performance.|$|E

30|$|Hedonic {{insights}} {{are applied}} to understanding human well-being here.

This in turn may be linked to how hedonic systems interact with other brain systems relevant to self-understanding and the meaning components of eudaimonic happiness. Finally, we speculate a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> how brains <b>that</b> generate hedonia states might link to eudaimonia assessments to create properly balanced states of positive well-being that approach true happiness.|$|R

Rae joined the Liberal Party in April 2006 (he had previously been a Liberal in the 1960s) before launching a centrist campaign that month.

5000|$|Another {{important}} part of the brief was [...] "Whatever you do, no moving parts".

Heatherwick said “When we proposed the most moving parts ever in an Olympic cauldron, we were nervous and feeling a <b>bit</b> guilty <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> But the same man who’d said that to us {{was the first person to}} say yes.” Heatherwick wanted the cauldron to be a focal point, like an altar in a church, and he described it as symbolising [...] "the coming together in peace of 204 nations for two weeks of sporting competition ... a representation of the extraordinary, albeit transitory, togetherness that the Olympic Games symbolise" [...] The Olympic cauldron comprised 204 separate copper 'petals', and the Paralympic one 164 - one petal from each of the competing nations.|$|R

500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{incorporates}} elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I just accept where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. I get that somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet.

And of course it's a pop song so you more or less always find a slightly sexual slant on the ideas that are in your brain, because you're writing a pop song. They're kind of sexy. I didn't have the sexual double entendre in my mind. I didn't expect it to be perceived quite as sexually as it has been. I'm actually a <b>bit</b> shy <b>about</b> all <b>that.</b> It surprises me that I wrote a song like that, you know? ...|$|R

In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance.
