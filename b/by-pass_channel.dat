30|$|In the <b>by-passed</b> <b>channel,</b> two {{contrasting}} {{sections were}} distinguished. From the dam to the confluence with the Guiers River {{and to the}} beginning of the anastomosed sector (KP 103 to KP 96), seven stations harbored stygobite species in their interstitial assemblages (Section a, Figure  3). The abundance and richness of stygobite species greatly varied, with locally significant values being obtained, especially for the varied abundance (15 individuals at KP 101 and 13 individuals at KP 99), suggesting punctual inputs of groundwater into the <b>by-passed</b> <b>channel.</b> Here, the stygobite species consisted of shallow interstitial fauna (Fabaeformiscandona wegelini, Islamia moquiniana, Niphargopsis casparyi and Niphargus rhenorhodanensis). Downstream of this section (KP 91 to KP 96), no stygobite fauna was sampled in the <b>by-passed</b> <b>channel,</b> suggesting little or no groundwater inputs there (Section b, Figure  3). This result was consistent with the geomorphological characteristics of this section, which is associated with sediment deposition and clogging.|$|R
40|$|The Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros {{waterworks}} {{construction on}} Danube river in Slovakia (1977 − 1992) was followed with major ecological consequences. The water level and flow velocity was decreased {{in the original}} <b>by-passed</b> <b>channel</b> {{in order to keep}} high water level for shipping in the bypass canal. The decrease in discharge and lowering flow velocity resulted in the channel narrowing and increase in the vertical accretion magnitude in new floodplain pockets along both sides of <b>by-passed</b> <b>channel.</b> What is more, anthropic intervention in form of groynes structures built for channel adjustment before 1992 dramatically accelerated this process. Vegetation colonisation took place on the new floodplain. In this paper, we analysed land cover changes - vegetation succession using aerial photographs taken in 1986, 1996, 2004 and 2013 as well as field surveys. After the flood in 2013, the area of the new floodplain reached 57 % (310 ha) of the original channel area...|$|R

Cooks Mills, located {{on the other side}} of the <b>By-Pass</b> <b>channel</b> than the rest of Welland, has arguably been protected against the impact of urban sprawl, but the necessity of using one of the two highway tunnels to cross the canal causes some residents to head to nearby Niagara Falls instead. Dain City, located in the south of the city where the two channels meet, is separated by the massive approaches to the Townline Tunnel required to provide the low grade for the rail lines that use the tunnel. Dain City was built for, and by, the Dain Manufacturing Company (Now known as John Deere), the main employer in the area, as a [...] "company town". John Deere announced in September 2008 that it would be closing its plant and relocating manufacturing to Wisconsin and Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Taihu Lake, {{the third}} largest {{freshwater}} lake in China, {{is located in the}} Chanjiang Delta of the Yangtze River. Its waters are used by agriculture, industry and as major drinking water for several cities including Shanghai and Wuxi. The lake also is important for tourism, aquaculture and flood control. Taihu Lake and its surrounding areas are facing three major water-related threats: deteriorating water quality with inflow and runoff from its watershed; flooding during the rainy seasons; and water shortages during drier months. Noxious algae blooms are occurring with increasing frequency and water quality continues to decline. Remedial actions implemented to date have been ineffective. This paper proposes that the problems could be remedied by constructing a <b>by-pass</b> <b>channel</b> (BPC), which would divert low-quality water from the lake during low precipitation periods and allow better quality water to flow into the lake during high flow periods. This remedial action would simultaneously deal with the deteriorating water quality of Lake Taihu and maintain its water level at a desired level. A preliminary assessment of this strategy shows that, if the BPC were implemented, the water quality of Taihu Lake would be improved significantly in few years, the flood disaster would be greatly mitigated, and the water shortage problem in the basin would be alleviated...|$|E
30|$|The {{river and}} its {{floodplain}} have been considerably modified by a {{hydroelectric power station}} that was constructed between 1982 and 1984 (Figure  1). A derivation dam divides the river channel into two branches from KP 104 to KP 91 (KP 103, Champagneux dam). Upstream from this dam, the channel {{has been transformed into}} a 12 -km long reservoir (KP 112 to KP 103). Downstream of this dam, the former braided channel (KP 103 to KP 91) is now a <b>by-passed</b> <b>channel</b> with a regulated discharge that ranges from 80  m 3 /s in the winter to 150  m 3 /s in the summer (Bornette et al. 1994). This <b>by-passed</b> <b>channel</b> is also fed by the Guiers River (KP 99). Most of the Rhône River water is diverted by the upstream dam to an 8 -km derivation canal (KP 1 to KP 9) that feeds a hydroelectric facility (KP 6) with a maximum fall of approximately 14.3  m (Q[*]=[*] 780  m 3 /s). To collect water that exfiltrates {{along the banks of the}} derivation canal and the reservoir, two drainage canals have been dug at the foot of the reservoir and two at the foot of the derivation canal to reduce the potential rise in the floodplain groundwater level (Claret et al. 1999).|$|R

However, over rapidly fading wireless channels, extra transceiver modules are necessary to enable differential transmission. Relying on a basis expansion model for time and frequency selective (doubly-selective) channels, we derive such a generalized block differential (BD) codec that achieves the maximum Doppler and multi-path diversity gains, while affording low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. We further show that existing BD systems over frequency-selective or time-selective channels follow as special cases of our novel system. Simulations corroborate our theoretical analysis. I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince 2000, {{an ambitious}} {{ecological}} restoration program {{was carried out}} on the Rhône River (France). The two main restoration measures were the increase of minimum flow in by-passed sections and the floodplain channels rehabilitation. An inter-disciplinary research program was initiated since 1995 to evaluate the effects of restoration measures on both physical habitats and biological components (fish and aquatic macroinvertebrates communities). The objectives were to identify and quantify i) the main physical factors modified by restoration measures and ii) the impacts of these modifications on metrics related to aquatic communities. A predictive approach was choosen allowing the possibility to test the adequation between predictions obtained with models and observed values collected during the post-restoration monitoring. Results showed that the restoration measures increased the proportion of taxa that are fluvial specialists in <b>by-passed</b> <b>channels</b> and the beta diversity of macroinvertebrates communities within the floodplain. These results represent an important amount of knowledge usable {{for the management of}} large rivers...|$|R
40|$|Navigation in {{the port}} of Zeebrugge can be {{hindered}} {{by the presence of}} a high concentrated benthic suspension (hcbs). Depth averaged suspended sediment concentrations (including the hcbs layer) range from 10 mg. l - 1 up to 4,OOOmg. l - 1. The suspended sediment concentration within the benthic layer can reach several tens of grams per litre. The top of this hcbs layer is identified by the 210 kHz acoustic reflection surface. The Nautical Bottom, a site-specific upper limit for the bulk density, above which navigation is concerned to be safe, is defined at l, 200 kg. m - 3. A better understanding of the human and environmental effects on the hcbs layer could result in countermeasures reducing siltation and maintenance dredging. A statistical analysis of parameters such as weekly dredging intensity, location of the top of the mud layer, growth rate of the mud layer, fresh water input from the Leie <b>by-pass</b> <b>channel,</b> wind force and wave height in the period from 1999 till 2005 resulted in poor correlation coefficients. Three interpretations are given. Week averaged hydro-meteo data masks the occurrence of short-time events such as storms. The mud layers calculated growth rate can be levelled out due to the variable time span between soundings. Finally, dredging works are not planned solely based on the level of nautical depth, which reduces the correlation between environmental conditions and dredged volumes. However, seasonally trends are clearly visible in both human and environmental effects...|$|E
40|$|An {{inflatable}} dam, {{owned and}} operated by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), was constructed across the Susquehanna River in the late 1960 s near the City of Sunbury. The dam consists of seven eight-foot-highinflatable bags totaling 2, 100 feet in length, making it the longest inflatable dam in the world. The dam is typically inflated in mid-May and deflated in early October. During this period the inflatable dam prevents the upstream migration of anadromous fish. A condition of the original dam permit issued in 1966 was that fish passage be provided once successful fish passage is obtained at the four downstream hydroelectric dams. Since 1970, the downstream restoration efforts have showed great promise in restoring the migratory fish patterns of the river. Consequently, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) is now requesting that fish passage be provided. In 2001, DCNR authorized Gannett Fleming to evaluate and design a fish passage facility located at the east abutment of the dam. This design took the form of a serpentine vertical-slot fish way. The vertical-slot fish way project was bid in 2004. However, due to market conditions and other factors, the construction of the serpentine vertical-slot fishway was postponed. In 2007, the possibility of providing effective fish passage at the west abutment of the dam was investigated. The topography of the west abutment was found to be favorable to support a “nature-like” <b>by-pass</b> <b>channel</b> fish way. The facility consists of fifteen pool and weir structures and the design allows for fish passage during all times of the year. This presentation presents the author’s experience related to providing fish passage at the inflatable dam in Sunbury. The unique history of the site and key design considerations are discussed. The presentation will focus on the nature-like fish way which is proposed for the west abutment...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010 a nature-like fishway was {{constructed}} around a two meter tall dam at the outlet of Digdequash Lake on Linton Stream, which drains into the Magaguadavic River near St. George, New Brunswick, Canada. The goal {{of the project was}} to reestablish historic fish passage as compensation for a gas line project in the region. The project location was selected from several other potential sites through consultation ·with DFO, the Atlantic Salmon Federation, and staff at the Department of Natural Resources. The recommendations identified brook trout, anadromous Atlantic Salmon, American eel, and gaspereau as the target species for the project. An assessment of the site, condition of the dam, water and access needs of a nearby salmon hatchery and construction cost concluded that the best alternative for fish passage was a nature-like channel around {{the north side of the}} dam. The fish passage channel had a controlled inlet, was constructed of large rock and cobble, was sealed with bentonite at all locations up gradient of the dam, had a step-pool structure, and ensured upstream and downstream fish passage during the spring and fall of the year. There was also a recreational boat landing on the north side of the dam that needed to be relocated to the north to accommodate the <b>by-pass</b> <b>channel.</b> Anecdotal evidence of fish passage was observed by members of the design and construction team. A multi-year fish monitoring and tagging program was planned to begin in {{the summer of}} 2011, however, the proposed study was interrupted by a greater than 100 -Year storm event that occurred at the site in the spring of 2011. The flood breached the dam, leaving the nature-like fish passage in stable condition, ·with minor erosion of some of the bio-engineered bank features...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{investigation}} was to understand the design space to achieve comparable in vitro performance of two multi-unit dose dry powder inhalers (DPIs) —Flixotide® Accuhaler® (reference product) and MultiHaler® (test product). Flow field, pressure drop and particle trajectories within the test and reference DPI devices were modelled via computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Micronized fluticasone propionate (FP) was characterized to determine particle size distribution (PSD), specific surface area (SSA) and surface interfacial properties using cohesive-adhesive balance (CAB). CFD simulations suggested that the pressure drop and airflow velocity in the MultiHaler® were greater than Accuhaler®. Two modified test devices (MOD MH 1 and MOD MH 2) were manufactured with the introduction of <b>by-pass</b> <b>channels</b> in the airflow path, which achieved comparable specific resistance and airflow path between the test and reference devices. Assessment of reference product formulation in modified test devices suggested that MOD MH 2 achieved comparable in vitro performance to the reference product. CAB analysis suggested that adhesion of all FP batches to lactose was different, with batch D showing greatest and batch A least adhesion to lactose. Test DPI formulations were manufactured using four different batches of FP with milled or sieved lactose, and showed that batch A FP formulated with sieved lactose in MOD MH 2 device demonstrated the highest degree of similarity to the Accuhaler® in vitro deposition. Application of CFD modelling and material characterization of formulation raw materials enabled the modification of device and formulation critical material attributes to create an in vitro comparable device/formulation system to the reference product...|$|R
40|$|Free {{migration}} of fish {{is necessary to}} achieve healthy fish stocks. Several species, including salmon, sea trout, sturgeon and eel, migrate between the sea and rivers. These species are particularly threatened by barriers such as weirs, dams and sluices, built for water management, hydropower and land drainage. Water and nature managers in Europe have been improving the situation with fish passes and <b>by-pass</b> <b>channels</b> around barriers, to help fish on their journey. An essential aspect of working on fish passage issues is raising awareness and creating commitment within communities in the different river basins. By creating commitment on {{all levels of the}} communities and stakeholders measures can be carried out more efficiently and financial opportunity can be maximised. The Fish Migration Day is a new concept to achieve greater understanding and community involvement (including children and parents). The first Fish Migration Day was held on the 14 th of May 2011. The event was organized by the Living North Sea Project, which is funded by the European Union. On more than 25 locations in 7 countries in the North Sea Region interested children and parents could learn about a variety of topics, including: different species of fish, fish passage solutions, water and nature management issues, fisheries, research, aquatic insects and could play the Eel Game (www. elyeel. eu). At {{the end of the day}} 5000 persons had visited the event and it turned out to be a big success. The idea is to organize a follow up worldwide in 2013 / 2014.

40|$|Preferential flow {{of water}} through {{channels}} in the soil has been implicated {{as a vehicle for}} groundwater and surface water contamination in forested riparian wetland buffers. Water conducted through these <b>by-pass</b> <b>channels</b> can circumvent interaction with wetland biota, biomass, and soils, thereby reducing the buffering capacity of the riparian strips for adsorption and uptake of excess nutrient loads from neighboring agricultural fields and urbanized lands. Models of riparian function need to account for preferential flow to accurately estimate nutrient flux to stream channels, but there are currently no methods for determining the form and prevalence of these pathways outside of extensive destructive sampling. This research developed, tested, and validated a new application of non-invasive ground-penetrating radar technology (GPR) for mapping the three-dimensional structure of near-surface (0 - 1 m) lateral preferential flow channels. Manual and automated detection methodologies were created for analyzing GPR scan data to locate the channels in the subsurface. The accuracy of the methodologies was assessed in two field test plots with buried PVC pipes simulating the riparian channels. The manual methodology had a 0 % Type I error rate and 8 % Type II error rate; the automated version had a < 1 % Type I error rate and 29 % Type II error rate. An automated mapping algorithm was also created to reconstruct channel geometries from the scan data detections. The algorithm was shown to robustly track the connectivity of PVC pipe segments arranged in a branching structure hypothesized to exist in the riparian soils. These methods and algorithms were then applied at a riparian wetland study site at USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, MD. The predicted structure of preferential flow channels in the wetland was validated by transmission of tracer dye through the study site and ground truth generated from soil core samples (92 % accurate). These GPR tools will enable researchers to efficiently and effectively characterize lateral preferential flow without negatively impacting environmentally sensitive wetland areas. Scientists can now directly study these flow mechanisms to investigate the effects of by-pass pathways on nutrient fate in riparian buffers and the interactions of preferential flow with plant and animal systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background One of {{the most}} {{fascinating}} properties of the biotechnologically important organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae is its ability to perform simultaneous respiration and fermentation at high growth rate even under fully aerobic conditions. In the present work, this Crabtree effect called phenomenon was investigated in detail by comparative 13 C metabolic flux analysis of S. cerevisiae growing under purely oxidative, respiro-fermentative and predominantly fermentative conditions. Results The metabolic shift from oxidative to fermentative growth was accompanied by complex changes of carbon flux throughout the whole central metabolism. This involved a flux redirection from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) towards glycolysis, an increased flux through pyruvate carboxylase, the fermentative pathways and malic enzyme, a flux decrease through the TCA cycle, and a partial relocation of alanine biosynthesis from the mitochondrion to the cytosol. S. cerevisiae exhibited a by-pass of pyruvate dehydrogenase in all physiological regimes. During oxidative growth this by-pass was mainly provided via pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthase and transport of acetyl-CoA into the mitochondrion. During fermentative growth this route, however, was saturated due to limited enzyme capacity. Under these conditions the cells exhibited high carbon flux through a chain of reactions involving pyruvate carboxylase, the oxaloacetate transporter and malic enzyme. During purely oxidative growth the PPP alone was sufficient to completely supply NADPH for anabolism. During fermentation, it provided only 60 % of the required NADPH. Conclusion We conclude that, in order to overcome the limited capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, S. cerevisiae possesses different metabolic <b>by-passes</b> to <b>channel</b> carbon into the mitochondrion. This involves the conversion of cytosolic pyruvate either into acetyl CoA or oxaloacetate followed by intercompartmental transport of these metabolites. During oxidative growth mainly the NAD specific isoforms of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyze the corresponding reactions in S. cerevisiae, whereas NADPH supply under fermentative conditions involves significant contribution of sources other than the PPP such as e. g. NADPH specific acetaldehyde dehydrogenase or isocitrate dehydrogenase. </p...|$|R
40|$|The city of Naples (Italy) is {{well known}} for its hilly landscape, along with a {{peculiar}} geology characterized by volcanic soils (i. e. tuf and pyroclastic rocks). The development of the sewer system serving the urban area has been strongly constrained by these factors. In particular, several drop structures were realized in order to connect the modern urban drainage system (realized in during the last decades) to the early sewer mains realized {{at the beginning of the}} nineteenth century and serving the downtown districts located at the sea level. The purpose of these drop structures is twofold: (i) to convey the storm runoff toward the sea through the existing sewer system located at lower elevations, and (ii) to <b>by-pass</b> insufficient sewer <b>channels.</b> Most of the drop structures were realized according to the ‘vortex drop shaft’ scheme, mainly for drop heights larger than 10 meters, up to 80 meters. The proper operation of these structures is crucial to prevent flooding and guarantee the urban safety. The paper aims to describe the most crucial aspects of the hydraulic behavior of the vortex shafts along with some examples of malfunction of these structures.

40|$|ABSTRACT The plain screen has {{the common}} {{advantages}} of the open dam. Besides, they can avoid the damage made by direct impaction of the debris flow and improve the problem of insufficient sand-trapping capacity. We place <b>by-pass</b> beside main <b>channel</b> in the downstream so that the water and fine particles can flow through by-pass to downstream. Then, the coarse cobbles can move along the main channel to the predicted deposit places. With the coming of debris flow, water and slope are the key factors of moving power. For the debris flow moving along the plain screen device, this device will screen out water and leave coarse cobbles. Furthermore, the movement of this debris only depends on inertial force and gravitation. The gravitation is related to slopes. If we can control the I-beam angles and find the effects under different angles, we can {{solve the problem of}} blockade by coarse cobbles. There are four kinds of screen angles designed with the channel slope. Four angles of the screen devices are parallel to the slope of original channel bed, 50 % steeper than the original channel bed, buffered 50 ％ and 100 ％. By adjusting slopes of plain screen device, we can realize what influences will cause debris flow to stop or deposit under different slopes of device. 中文摘要 透水柵具有一般透過性壩的優點，此外，還可以避免土石流衝擊力造成的損壞及改善上游儲砂空間不足的問題。改良式平面柵在下游處增設分流河道，分離出之細顆粒土砂及水從分流河道引導至下游原河道或安全地區排放，分離之較大礫石則由主流河道運動至預計沉積處。 土石流發生時，水與坡度為其行進動力的重要因子。當其流經平面柵時大部分水被析出，留下土砂石，這些土石的前進僅靠慣性力與重力，其中重力的部分與坡度有關，若能控制栅棒角度找出土石流在不同角度過篩的影響，則能改善粗顆粒土砂阻塞栅棒的問題。試驗中的四種平面柵依照相對於渠床坡度改變量所設計，分別有與原渠床坡度平行、減緩上游 50 ％坡度、減緩上游 100 ％坡度呈水平及加陡 50 ％上游坡度四種過篩角度，藉調整平面柵篩分裝置之設置坡度，了解在不同的設置坡度下，對土石流流動的停止及沉積有何影響。第一章 緒論 1. 1 土石流的特性 1 1. 2 土石流防災措施 2 1. 3 研究動機 3 第二章 前人研究與文獻回顧 2. 1 土石流相關研究 5 2. 2 土石流防治 11 2. 3 透水柵相關研究 15 第三章 試驗材料與方法 3. 1 試驗材料 20 3. 2 試驗設備 23 3. 3 試驗設計與條件 28 3. 4 試驗步驟 31 3. 5 試驗流程 33 第四章 結果與討論 4. 1 試驗現象描述 34 4. 2 試驗結果分析 39 第五章 結論與建議 5. 1 結論 48 5. 2 建議 51 參考文獻 53 附表 5...|$|R
