Additionally, Senior Jonathan Turk handed St. Louis his number 8 jersey prior to the game, and he will wear the number 88 for the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} different DAG-based formulation of scheduling constraints is used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> {{evaluation and review}} technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of}} the first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E

Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a talk in 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys. In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{the auditor}} determines which federal {{programs}} to audit, the auditor performs a compliance audit that scrutinizes {{operations of the}} program—examining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. The auditor investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties.

The examination does not require observing every single document and every single process generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> nevertheless the auditor is required to perform enough procedures to form an opinion on whether the program (as a whole) complied with laws and regulations.|$|E
