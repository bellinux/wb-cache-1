40|$|Development and {{implementation}} of automated monitoring, control and optimization systems for mineral processing applications require accurate online mass flow measurements from the processes. The mass flow sensors used in mineral processing plants are designed to monitor the production volumes of the end products. <b>Belt</b> <b>scale</b> {{is the most common}} online bulk material mass flow sensor used in the mineral processing. The <b>belt</b> <b>scale</b> provides an accurate online mass flow measurement from the process. However, the high unit price of the sensor prevents the installation of multiple belt scales in a single mineral processing plant. In addition to the online mass flow measurements of the belt scales, offline mass flow measurements might be also carried out at the plants. Offline mass flow sensors include wheel loader scales and truck scales. The high unit price, low measurement frequency and variable measurement delays prevent the offline mass flow sensors to be used in automated process control. The main goals of this work are determined by the three research questions formulated for this work. The first goal is to analyse the correlations of four measurement signals of the online mass flow sensors against the reference mass flow measurement of the <b>belt</b> <b>scale.</b> The fitting of the measurement signals is performed by linear regression method. The analysis of the signals is performed by measures of fit methods, the root mean square RMSE and correlation analysis method R-squared. The second goal is to analyse the accuracies of three mass flow estimation models. The third goal is to perform comprehensive analysis of the features, benefits and restrictions of each online mass flow sensor. This analysis can be utilized, if the presented online mass flow sensors are implemented in a mineral processing plant. The online mass flow sensors used in this work are a power transducer, laser profilometer, ultrasonic sensor and strain gauge. In order to answer the research questions, an experimental measurement setup was designed and installed at the test plant. An aggregate production plant is used as an example of mineral processing application in this work. The presented online mass flow sensors can also be applied to other mineral processing applications handling solid materials on belt conveyors. The results of this work indicate that all of the measurement signals of the online mass flow sensors correlate well with the reference mass flow measurement of the <b>belt</b> <b>scale.</b> The mass flow estimation models of the power transducer and laser profilometer were proven accurate. The results indicate that the online mass flow measurements can be utilized more effectively in the process control and optimization of the mineral processing plants. However, a reference mass flow measurement is required for calibration of the presented online mass flow sensors.

Control systems for cone crusher settings are widely used for compensating for wear and protecting the machines from high pressure. However, these systems focus on the crusher and not the crushed products. By applying measurement devices on the process the crusher can be run optimally from the saleable products point of view (unlike most existing systems which only protect the machine) in each time. The measurement devices can be mass flow meters, e. g. conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>scales.</b> To analyze data from the process and convert them to a desired CSS value, an algorithm was developed. The developed algorithm is tested and evolved at a real crushing plant for aggregates. The algorithm was loaded into a computer which could communicate with the crusher control system, read data from three mass flow meters, and also interact with the operators. The computer was reachable over the Internet by the researchers at Chalmers and the algorithm was tuned and improved on-line. The result is an algorithm which was capable of providing CSS set-points to the automatic setting regulation system. The amount of saleable product from the crushing stage improved 3. 5 %, when not limited by the hydraulic pressure, compared to when a fixed closed side setting is used.

40|$|AbstractThe MINIS Balloon Campaign: Duskside Relativistic Electron PrecipitationbyJohn Glen SampleDoctor of Philosophy in PhysicsUniversity of California, BerkeleyProfessor Frances Hellman, ChairThe Earth's {{radiation}} belts are {{a dynamic}} population of highly-energetic (> MeV) electrons and ions {{trapped in the}} dipole geometry of the Earth's magnetic field. These particles can strongly influence atmospheric chemistry, satellite operations, human explorers, long distance communications and even the electrical grid. The belts are also the most accessible laboratory for study of the particle acceleration that we see taking place throughout the universe. This dissertation presents {{the results from the}} MINIS balloon campaign, a January 2005 effort to observe the loss of relativistic electrons from the belts through relativistic electron precipitation (REP). MINIS launched 6 balloon payloads equipped with X-ray spectrometers into high-altitude, high-latitude, long-duration flights. These flights took place during a dramatic series of solar activity that set off a - 99 Dst geomagnetic storm. During the storm sudden commencement phase, three payloads measured bremsstrahlung X-rays from electrons hitting the top of the atmosphere, making MINIS the first multi-point measurement of relativistic electron precipitation. The observations took place at dusk local times, consistent with other high energy precipitation observations from single point balloons. Measuring the scale size and motions of the precipitation region as well as its energy and intensity allow improved measurement of the average loss rate as well as more tightly constraining the instantaneous loss rate from the <b>belts.</b> <b>Scale</b> sizes and motions can also be better tied to the physical structures in the belts which lead to these particle losses. During the MINIS observed precipitation, the scale size was at least 0. 6 L (a unit of Earth radii when mapped to the magnetic equator) by 1 hour of magnetic local time, and expansion rates of the precipitation were well faster than the drift rate for ~MeV electrons. The MINIS balloons also served as a proof of concept for a much larger balloon campaign that began in January 2013 and will continue at least until February 2014. That campaign, BARREL, and estimates of what it will observe as well as a possible satellite mission to observe REP are also detailed here...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of soil properties often displays complex and multiscale patterns of variation. It results from multiple soil processes acting simultaneously but at different scales. Hence, characterizing {{the influence of a}} given controlling factor on the soil property is made more difficult by the variation due to other controlling factors. In this context, separating the variation of the soil properties by spatial scales could allow disentangling the combined effect of controlling factors and would provide a qualitative and quantitative characterization of controlling factors separately. In this paper, geostatistical tools have been used to separate the scales of variation of two soil properties (i. e. SOC and texture) coming from a legacy dataset in the Belgian Loess <b>Belt.</b> <b>Scale</b> components were predicted separately and the relationships between soil properties were analyzed at different scales. Results illustrated that the contents of a given soil property in different depth layers were typically more correlated when only the long range components were compared. Similarly, the link between SOC and texture components was also clearer for the long range components. This means that soil processes acting at local or landscape scale influence soil properties differently according to their nature or to the depth considered. Eliminating the variation at this scale allows to better characterize the relationships between depth layers and soil properties. The study gives insights for further spatial mapping of SOC by focusing on more appropriate variables at specific spatial scales. Furthermore, we raise the interest of spatial filtering for detecting inconsistencies inside composite datasets...|$|E

Teleseismic shear waves (SKS, SKKS, and PKS) are used to determine splitting parameters: the fast polarization direction φ and the delay time δt. Teleseismic shear wave splitting in the eastern Pyrenees displays homogeneous φ values trending N 100 °E and δt values in the range 1. 1 to 1. 5 s. A station located in the southern Massif Central, 100 km north of the range, is characterized by different splitting parameters (φ = N 70 °E, δt = 0. 7 s). In the western part of the belt, anisotropy parameters are similar across the whole belt (φ = N 110 °E and δt = 1. 3 to 1. 5 s). Most of the measured delay times, including those obtained in {{the central part of the}} range, are above the global average of the SKS splitting (around 1 s). At the <b>belt</b> <b>scale,</b> φ is generally poorly correlated with recent estimations of the absolute plate motion, which predicts a fast direction ranging between N 50 °E and N 80 °E. Instead, the orientation of φ (N 100 °E) is parallel to the trend of the Pyrenean belt but also to Hercynian preexisting structures. This parallelism supports an anisotropy primarily related to frozen or active lithospheric structures. We show that a signature related to the Pyrenean orogeny is likely for the stations located in the internal domains of the belt. By contrast, the anisotropy measured at the stations located on the external parts of the belt could reflect a pre-Pyrenean (Hercynian) deformation. We suggest that a late Hercynian strike-slip deformation is responsible for this frozen upper mantle anisotropy and that the Pyrenean tectonic fabric developped parallel to this preexisting fabric.

The system includes a major machine that adopts a belt transport mechanism as the guidance device, uses a <b>belt</b> <b>scale</b> consisting of belts and load cells to measure the weight of a chicken, and does not need the traditional preprocess of folding chicken wings in the measuring procedure. The LabView is used to integrate all kinds of instruments. RFID is first employed to read the serial number of a chicken wing, and then the weight data within the measuring range defined by a photoelectric switch are recorded. In a later stage of the system, a CMOS video camera is used to capture the images of chickens, and the stored images could be captured in an appropriate size to meet subsequent requirements. It is unnecessary for the recorded data to be transcribed manually, as the system features an automated output and is able to be linked to the information management system at a parent-stock native chicken farm. There is an error range of ± 5 % between the weight measured by this system and that measured manually. The whole process only needs a worker to run to accomplish the weight measurement work, and it takes approximately 25 seconds at a time to complete the operational process of weight measurement and image capture. After including the time spent grabbing a chicken and reading the wing number, approximately 90 chickens can be processed per hour. When the image processed by the system is converted into the area of the comb, the figure is 10 %- 50 % less than the area measured manually. 本研究為改善種雞的飼養管理，研製線上雞隻活體重量量測與影像分析系統。系統有一主體機台，採用皮帶運輸機構為引導裝置，以皮帶和荷重元構成之皮帶秤進行雞隻重量量測，量重程序不需傳統作業所需之折翅前置作業。利用LabView圖控化程式語言整合所需之各式儀器，先讀取雞隻TAG之翼號後，再記錄光電開關界定之量測範圍內之重量數據，系統後端利用CMOS攝影機擷取雞隻影像，儲存之影像能依後續之需求截取合適之圖像做處理。所紀錄資料亦無須人工謄寫轉錄，系統能自動產出並和種土雞場雞隻資訊管理系統做連結。本系統測得之重量與人工測量之重量誤差約在± 5 %之間，全程只需一人便能完成重量量測工作，重量量測和影像擷取一次作業程序約耗時 25 秒，算入抓取雞隻和讀取翼號時間，一小時約能處理 90 隻雞；以系統處理的影像換算雞冠面積，較人工量測之面積縮減約 10 %- 50 %。摘要		I ABSTRACT	II 目錄		III 圖目錄	VI 表目錄	X 第一章	前言	 1 1. 1 研究背景	 1 1. 2 研究目的	 2 第二章	文獻探討	 3 2. 1 台灣土雞	 3 2. 1. 1 土雞生長特性	 3 2. 1. 2 土雞行為	 4 2. 1. 3 土雞的育種	 5 2. 1. 4 雞隻重量與雞冠量測作業	 6 2. 2 荷重元(Load Cell) 	 7 2. 2. 1 Load Cell應用	 8 2. 2. 2 皮帶秤	 10 2. 3 機器視覺	 10 2. 3. 1 影像處理的運用	 11 2. 4 RFID之運用	 13 2. 4. 1 RFID之組成	 14 2. 5 種土雞場生產資料庫	 15 第三章	實驗設備與方法	 17 3. 1 系統架構	 17 3. 2 皮帶式輸送機構系統	 18 3. 2. 1 皮帶式輸送機構	 18 3. 2. 2 秤重載具	 19 3. 2. 3 遮蔽黑罩	 21 3. 3 重量檢測系統	 22 3. 3. 1 荷重元	 22 3. 3. 2 CSG 110 訊號放大器	 23 3. 4 資訊處理模組	 25 3. 4. 1 NI USB- 6210 訊號轉換擷取卡	 26 3. 4. 2 RFID模組	 27 3. 4. 3 光電開關	 29 3. 5 影像擷取系統	 30 3. 5. 1 CMOS數位攝影機	 30 3. 6 軟體規劃	 31 3. 7 實驗對象	 32 3. 8 實驗方法	 33 3. 8. 1 輸出電壓與重量關係之校正	 35 3. 8. 2 重量分佈分析實驗	 37 3. 9. 3 遮蔽黑罩對雞隻之行為影響實驗	 38 3. 9. 4 雞隻影像擷取分析實驗	 39 3. 9. 5 整合系統效能實驗	 43 第四章	結果與討論	 44 4. 1 輸出電壓與重量關係之校正實驗結果	 44 4. 2 重量分佈分析實驗結果	 45 4. 3 遮蔽黑罩對雞隻之行為影響實驗結果	 54 4. 4 雞隻影像擷取分析實驗結果	 56 4. 5 整合系統效能實驗結果	 60 第五章	結論與建議	 69 5. 1 結論	 69 5. 2 建議	 70 參考文獻	 7...|$|E

Pre-mid-Cretaceous salt deformation resulted in salt massifs, small allochthonous salt bodies, pseudo-clinoforms and turtle structures. During a significant period of sediment starvation between mid-Cretaceous and mid-Oligocene time, previously formed salt and related structures remained stable. Following the reactivation of salt structures from mid-Oligocene to early-Miocene, rapid sedimentation during middle Miocene {{resulted in the}} development of large diapiric salt walls and stocks fed from the pre-mid-Cretaceous salt massifs.

Three starting methods including direct starting mode, traditional Harrison method and soft starting are compared. The simulation results of virtual prototype show that direct starting method will lead to higher dynamic tension extreme value and larger fluctuation, dynamic tension is significantly reduced with the traditional Harrison method, and the average dynamic tension of soft starting consider the actual condition is dropped to minimum and the whole system is more stable...|$|R
40|$|Corals transplanted to Sentosa, {{an island}} {{south of the}} main island of Singapore, from a reef due for reclamation, were {{monitored}} and assessed one year after completion of a massive two-year transplantation exercise. This transplantation exercise was conducted by the Marine Conservation Group of the Nature Society (Singapore). Assessment of the 3 m x 3 m permanent quadrat showed that 24. 29 % of transplants remained healthy, while 57. 14 % were impacted or dying and the remaining 18. 57 % completely dead. The broad <b>scale</b> <b>belt</b> transect survey showed that 35. 27 % of the translocated corals were healthy, while 43. 04 % were impacted or dying and 21. 69 % completely dead. The low survival rate {{could be attributed to}} 2 main factors: improper securing techniques and unfavourable site conditions. The results also indicated that certain coral growthforms (mushroom, encrusting and massive) and genera (Fungia, Herpolitha, Favia, Platygyra, Favites, Goniopora and Turbinaria) were more suitable transplants than others...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCoseismic landsliding is an {{important}} contributor to the long-term erosion of mountain <b>belts.</b> The <b>scaling</b> between earthquake magnitude and the volume of eroded material {{has been known for}} decades. However, the resulting geomorphic consequences, such as divide migration or valley infilling, are still poorly understood. Indeed, the prediction of the location of co-seismic landslides sources and deposits is a challenging issue and algorithms accounting for triggering of landslides by ground shaking are needed. Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) has been shown to control at first order the spatial density of landslides. PGA can trigger landslides by two mechanisms: the direct effect of seismic acceleration on forces balance, and a transient decrease in hillslope strength parameters. To test the accuracy of modelling seismic waves effect by a cohesion drop, we use SLIPOS, an algorithm of bedrock landsliding based on a simple stability analysis (Culmann criteria) applied at local scale. The model is able to reproduce the landslide area-volume scaling relationship and the area-frequency distribution of natural landslides. Co-seismic landslide triggering is accounted for in SLIPOS by imposing a cohesion decrease. We calibrate the relationship between PGA and model cohesion via the landslides density. The spatial distribution of PGA is modeled using empirical relationships between earthquake source and PGA. We run the model on earthquake scenarios (Mw 6. 5 to 8) applied to the Alpine fault of New-Zealand to predict the volume of landslides associated with large magnitude earthquakes. We demonstrate that simulating the effect of ground acceleration on landsliding using a cohesion drop leads to a realistic scaling between the volume of sediments and the earthquake magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Transverse {{zones are}} {{important}} syn-kinematic components of thrust <b>belt</b> development. Various <b>scales</b> of data were utilized to develop three-dimensional geometric and kinematic {{models for the}} Bessemer transverse zone (BTZ) of the Alabama Alleghanian thrust belt. Regional analysis of the BTZ began with the examination of geologic maps (1 : 250, 000, 1 : 48, 000, and 1 : 24, 000 scales), seismic reflection profiles, well data, and previous stratigraphic research. All Paleozoic-age stratigraphic contacts, major thrust faults and associated folds, and various unnamed minor structures were compiled to create two strike-perpendicular, and five-strike parallel, cross sections transecting {{the extent of the}} BTZ at a scale of 1 : 100, 000. The balanced and viable cross sections were used to create palinspastic maps of the BTZ. The deformed cross sections and geologic maps, and the restored cross sections and palinspastic maps, model the post- and pre-kinematic geometry of the transverse zone, respectively. Additional geological fieldwork in the northwestern part of the BTZ permitted the construction of geologic maps (1 : 24, 000 scale) documenting cross-strike links (th...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{beneficial}} effects of using a far-infrared (FIR) belt on the management of patients with primary dysmenorrhea. This is the first study to determine the efficacy of somatothermal FIR using a parallel-arm randomized sham-controlled and double-blinded design with objective physical evidence and psychometric self-reports. Fifty-one Taiwanese women with primary dysmenorrhea were enrolled in the study. Results indicate that there was an increased abdominal temperature of 0. 6 °C and a 3. 27 % increase in abdominal blood flow in the FIR group (wearing FIR belt) compared to those in the control group (wearing sham <b>belt).</b> Verbal rating <b>scale</b> and numeric rating scale scores in the FIR group were both lower than those in the control group. Compared to the blank group (wearing no belt), the average dysmenorrhea pain duration of the FIR group was significantly reduced from 2. 5 to 1. 8 days, but there was no significant difference in the control group. These results demonstrate that the use of a belt made of far-infrared ceramic materials can reduce primary dysmenorrhea...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{observations}} of minor planets {{documented in the}} TRIAD computer file are used to classify 752 objects into the broad compositional types C, S, M, E, R, and U (unclassifiable) according to the prescriptions adopted by Bowell et al. (1978). Diameters are computed from the photometric magnitude using radiometric and/or polarimetric data where available, or else from albedos characteristic of the indicated type. An analysis of the observational selection effects leads to tabulation of {{the actual number of}} asteroids, as a function of type and diameter, in each of 15 orbital element zones. For the whole main belt the population is 75 % of type C, 15 % of type S, and 10 % of other types, with no belt-wide dependence of the mixing ratios on diameter. In some zones the logarithmic diameter-frequency relations are decidedly nonlinear. The relative frequency of S-type objects decreases smoothly outward through the main <b>belt,</b> with exponential <b>scale</b> length 0. 5 AU. The rarer types show a more chaotic, but generally flatter, distribution over distance. Characteristic type distributions, contrasting with the background population, are found for the Eos, Koronis, Nysa and Themis families...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{provides}} detailed geological modelling and finite difference realization {{results of}} a 2 D regional section from the Zagros fold-and-thrust <b>belt,</b> Iran. Different <b>scale</b> geological detail has {{been included in the}} model. The modelling approach is based on a hierarchical procedure and the model is made up of cells representing the geometry and properties (such as seismic P-wave velocity) of parts of the model. By using a hierarchical procedure for building the model, the time and space consistency of the geological model is preserved. The constructed model is 81 17 km and crosses several drilled and undrilled structures. The model geometry is controlled by surface, subsurface and seismic interpretation results along the model. The model building blocks were chosen based on the deformation history of the area and the modelling was carried out in two stages. First, a regional model was constructed including the major structural elements. At the second stage (fine tuning of the regional model), structural and stratigraphic details, such as onlap, truncations, pinch-outs and thickening/thinning of salt beds, were added to the regional model. The velocity and density models were extracted from well logs, check shots an...|$|R
40|$|CASTAway is {{a mission}} concept to explore our Solar System’s main {{asteroid}} belt. Asteroids and comets provide {{a window into}} the formation and evolution of our Solar System and the composition of these objects can be inferred from space-based remote sensing using spectroscopic techniques. Variations in composition across the asteroid populations provide a tracer for the dynamical evolution of the Solar System. The mission combines a long-range (point source) telescopic survey of over 10, 000 objects, targeted close encounters with 10 – 20 asteroids and serendipitous searches to constrain the distribution of smaller (e. g. 10 m) size objects into a single concept. With a carefully targeted trajectory that loops through the asteroid belt, CASTAway would provide a comprehensive survey of the main <b>belt</b> at multiple <b>scales.</b> The scientific payload comprises a 50 cm diameter telescope that includes an integrated low-resolution (R = 30 – 100) spectrometer and visible context imager, a thermal (e. g. 6 – 16 μm) imager for use during the flybys, and modified star tracker cameras to detect small (~ 10 m) asteroids. The CASTAway spacecraft and payload have high levels of technology readiness and are designed to fit within the programmatic and cost caps for a European Space Agency medium class mission, whilst delivering a significant increase in knowledge of our Solar System...|$|R

40|$|The Outokumpu steel belt {{sintering}} {{technology is}} used for manufacturing chromite pellets that are charged into smelting furnace for ferrochromium production. Hot air is blown through the moving bed of raw pellets. Direct temperature and flow measurements are difficult {{to do in the}} bed of a real <b>scale</b> <b>belt</b> sintering process. Therefore, a tested and reliable mathematical model would be a valuable help for optimising operational parameters of the process and designing new constructional improvements. The aim of this work is to present a mathematical model that calculates the gas flow and temperature distribution in the bed of pellets and the atmosphere. Computational fluid dynamics program FLUENT is used to calculate the gas flow, composition and temperature of the gas in the sintering bed during processing. Energy equation for the bed, containing the effects of evaporation of water and oxidation of carbon and iron oxide, will be added to the model to obtain the temperature of the pellets. The porous media model used for pressure drop calculations in the bed is shortly discussed. A comparison between CFD-calculations and experiments with a pilot scale batch-sintering reactor are also presented. The final model can be used as an engineering tool when developing the process and the equipment further. Different designs can be easily tested with the model and the effects of the changes to the flow pattern and temperature distribution can be studied...|$|R
