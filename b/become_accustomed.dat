5|$|In AD 39, {{relations}} between Caligula and the Roman Senate deteriorated. The subject of their disagreement is unknown. A number of factors, though, aggravated this feud. The Senate had <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to ruling without an emperor between {{the departure of}} Tiberius for Capri in AD 26 and Caligula's accession. Additionally, Tiberius's treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as Asinius Gallus.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism. The book {{asserts that the}} countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, {{such as those of}} self-denial, are ignored by American Christians because they have <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to exercising Christian privilege and are unwilling to give it up.|$|E
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The idea is that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E

5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using decimals, rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, for reducing {{the cost of living}} for the poor. One of his main objectives was for the general public to <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E
5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium.|$|E

5|$|Urban red foxes {{are most}} active at dusk and dawn, {{doing most of}} their hunting and {{scavenging}} at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, {{but they can be}} caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas {{as well as on the}} edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s Liverpool's form {{continued}} to deteriorate, and they avoided relegation in the 1933–34 season by only four points. Scott left the club {{at the end}} of what had been a poor season for the veteran goalkeeper. In ten matches from the start of 1934, Liverpool won only once with Scott in goal, and after a 9–2 defeat against Newcastle United, he was replaced by Arthur Riley. The change of goalkeepers brought an upturn in form, with a 6–2 victory over Birmingham City and a 4–1 win against Middlesbrough. Scott, who joined Belfast Celtic after 24 years at Liverpool, remains the club's longest-serving player. As they became used to finishing in {{the lower part of the}} league table, Liverpool began to lose their best players. Hodgson, who had scored 233 goals in 358 league games, was sold to Aston Villa in 1936 and the club struggled to replace him. They finished 19th in the season following his departure. Also in 1936, Patterson resigned as manager for health reasons, and resumed his role as the club's secretary. His replacement, Southampton manager George Kay, did not initially fare much better; Liverpool narrowly avoided relegation in the 1936–37 season, and finished in 11th place in each of the following two seasons. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Liverpool had <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to finishing midtable.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand Teton National Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E

5|$|In 1263 {{the dispute}} with the Scottish king over the Hebrides induced Haakon to {{undertake}} an expedition to the islands. Having learned in 1262 that Scottish nobles had raided the Hebrides and that Alexander III planned to conquer the islands, Haakon went on an expedition with his formidable leidang fleet of at least 120 ships in 1263, having <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to negotiating backed by an intimidating fleet. The fleet left Bergen in July, and reached Shetland and Orkney in August where {{they were joined by}} chieftains from the Hebrides and Man. Negotiations were started by Alexander following Norwegian landings on the Scottish mainland, but were purposely prolonged by the Scots. Having waited until September/October for weather that caused trouble for Haakon's fleet, a clash occurred between a smaller Norwegian force and a Scottish division at the Battle of Largs. Although inconclusive and of a limited impact, Haakon withdrew to Orkney for the winter. A delegation of Irish kings invited Haakon to help them rid Ireland of English settlers as High King of Ireland, but this was apparently rejected against Haakon's wish.|$|E
5|$|Rashad (T.I.) is a teen {{living in}} Atlanta, Georgia with his Uncle, George (Mykelti Williamson) {{and his little}} brother Ant (Evan Ross). He and his brother were raised by their uncle George since their parents {{died in a car}} accident, and they work with him as part of his {{custodial}} company. When not working or finishing his last semester of high school, Rashad {{spends most of his time}} with his friends Brooklyn (Albert Daniels), Teddy (Jason Weaver), and Esquire (Jackie Long). Rashad is a talented artist but does not see much of a future in that field as he has <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to working the family business. Esquire, Rashad's best friend, goes to a prep school on the opposite side of town from where they live, and is trying to attend an Ivy League college after senior year. However, he finds out that he will need a letter of recommendation from someone of high stature to better his chances of acceptance at the school he wants to attend.|$|E
25|$|Around 150 Conservative MPs {{lost their}} {{seats in the}} 1997 general election. Many of them {{struggled}} to find gainful employment and a new role in life for themselves.

25|$|Attachment {{to the old}} Canadian Red {{has persisted}} among many people, {{especially}} veterans.

25|$|Bread and Alley was {{my first}} {{experience}} in cinema and I must say a very difficult one.

25|$|The effects {{remained}} {{even after}} road users had <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to the feature, while other {{road safety measures}} (when studied at specific installations) often showed declining effectiveness over time. Cost-benefit analysis showed that even on relatively low-volume roads, the costs of applying the markings were quickly exceeded several-fold by the economic benefits of improved road safety (as counted by the reduction of crash rates weighted against the average social costs of a crash).|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{effectiveness}} of yorkers, they are notoriously difficult to bowl correctly and usually will be attempted {{only a handful of}} times during a sequence of several overs. Yorkers are best used to surprise a batsman who has <b>become</b> <b>accustomed</b> to hitting shorter-pitched balls and not with the bat speed necessary to defend against a yorker. As such, a yorker is frequently bowled quickly to give the batsman less time to react and position his bat.|$|E
