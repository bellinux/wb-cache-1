5|$|A {{battery of}} BM-13-16 {{launchers}} included four firing vehicles, two reload trucks and two technical support trucks, with each firing vehicle having {{a crew of}} six. Reloading was executed in 3–4 minutes, although the standard procedure was {{to switch to a}} new position some 10km away due to the ease with which the battery could <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the enemy. Three batteries were combined into a division (company), and three divisions into a separate mine-firing regiment of rocket artillery.|$|E
5|$|A revival can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the {{dedication}} of the first new monument in a century and a half, raised by the otherwise unknown king, K'awiil Yopaat, in 653. Continued contact with Copán is evident, as well as longer distance contacts, possibly with Caracol in Belize. At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis, including the building of the site's first ballcourt.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{locating}} local maxima and minima of a function from approximate measurement results {{is vital for}} many physical applications: In spectral analysis, chemical species <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> locating local maxima of the spectra.

5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> their color, {{the time of}} year when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|At {{his death}} he had {{achieved}} 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh {{on the list}} of the war's most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of his victims can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden's claims were made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five fell while flying the S.E.5a.|$|E
5|$|Maggots {{found on}} corpses are useful to {{forensic}} entomologists. Maggot species can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> their anatomical features and by matching their DNA. Maggots of {{different species of}} flies visit corpses and carcases at fairly well-defined times {{after the death of}} the victim, and so do their predators, such as beetles in the family Histeridae. Thus, {{the presence or absence of}} particular species provides evidence for the time since death, and sometimes other details such as the place of death, when species are confined to particular habitats such as woodland.|$|E

5|$|Many booklet stamps can <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> one non-{{perforated}} edge, {{though a}} few are perforated on all edges. On booklets up to 1977, the printing plate construction enabled both upright and inverted watermarks in equal quantities owing to a gutter dividing rows 6 and 7 in the sheets of 12 × 10 stamps. The gutter was used for stitching during assembly, requiring rows 4–6 and 10–12 to be turned through 180 degrees so those panes could be stitched on {{the left of the}} booklet.|$|E

5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E

5000|$|The Lake Abert sites {{represent}} {{at least}} 11,000 years of human occupation. [...] Archeologists have divided the occupation timeline into six periods. The oldest is the Initial Archaic period from 11,000 to 7,000 years ago. This period <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> the Great Basin stemmed projectile points {{found at the}} Initial Archaic sites. The second period is the Early Archaic which stretched from 7,000 to 4,000 years ago.

5|$|Several {{methods for}} {{identifying}} synthetic diamonds can be performed, {{depending on the}} method of production {{and the color of}} the diamond. CVD diamonds can usually <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> an orange fluorescence. D-J colored diamonds can be screened through the Swiss Gemmological Institute's Diamond Spotter. Stones in the D-Z color range can be examined through the DiamondSure UV/visible spectrometer, a tool developed by De Beers. Similarly, natural diamonds usually have minor imperfections and flaws, such as inclusions of foreign material, that are not seen in synthetic diamonds.|$|E

5|$|Taoist temples in {{southern}} China and Taiwan may often <b>be</b> <b>identified</b> <b>by</b> their roofs, which feature dragons and phoenixes made from multi-colored ceramic tiles. They also {{stand for the}} harmony of yin and yang (with the phoenix representing yin). A related symbol is the flaming pearl, which may be seen on such roofs between two dragons, {{as well as on}} the hairpin of a Celestial Master. In general though, Chinese Taoist architecture lacks universal features that distinguish it from other structures.|$|E
