This paper {{shows that}} rapidly formed {{emitters}} (≤ 6 min) in a <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>furnace</b> or 3 minutes in an RTP system, {{in conjunction with}} a screen-printed (SP) RTP Al-BSF and passivating oxide formed simultaneously in 2 minutes can produce high efficiency cells with no surface texturing, point contacts, or selective emitter. It is shown {{for the first time that}} an 80 Ω/ emitter and SP Al-BSF formed in a high throughput belt furnace can produce 19 % FZ cells, 18. 4 % MCZ cells and greater than 17 % CZ cells with photolithography (PL) contacts. Using PL contacts, we also achieved 19 % efficient cells on FZ, > 18 % on MCZ, and ~ 17 % boron-doped CZ by emitter and SP Al-BSF formation in less than 10 minutes in a single wafer RTP system. Finally, a manufacturable process with 45 Ω/ emitter and screen-printed (SP) Al-BSF and Ag contacts formed in the <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>furnace</b> gave 17 % efficient cells on FZ silicon. Compared to the photolithography cells, the SP cell gave ∼ 2 % lower efficiency along with a decrease in Jsc and fill factor (FF). This loss in performance is attributed to a combination of the poor blue response, higher series resistance and higher contact shading in the SP devices...|$|R
40|$|Rapid Thermal Firing (RTF) of mc-Si thick-film {{solar cells}} is {{frequently}} {{considered as a}} promising alternative to contact firing in <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Based on a fundamental process development yielding outstanding fill factors of up to 80. 2 % on mc-Si (Baysix) material, RTF and state-of-the-art <b>conveyor</b> <b>belt</b> firing (CBF) have been thoroughly compared resulting at least in an as high efficiency potential of RTF as for state-of-theart CBF. IQE analysis of 7 Îcm Cz-Si solar cells revealed a similar Al-BSF quality for both techniques. While RTF did not change the minority carrier lifetime of cast mc-Si materials significantly, EFG Si solar cells clearly benefit from the improved hydrogen passivation of defects during RTF resulting in a considerable Voc and Jsc enhancement of 4 mV and 0. 5 mA/cm 2, respectively.

High surface passivation quality can be maintained for SiNx antireflective layers after RTF. Fourier transformed infrared absorption measurements reveal a strong dependence of the surface passivation quality on the Si H bonding density.

50|$|A <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> uses a {{flexible}} metal belt to convey soil through the primary heating chamber. A one-inch-deep layer of soil is spread {{evenly over the}} belt. As the belt moves through the system, soil agitators lift the belt and turn the soil to enhance heat transfer and volatilization of organics. The <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> can heat soils to temperatures from 300 to 800 degrees F. At the higher temperature range, the <b>conveyor</b> <b>furnace</b> is more effective in treating some heavier petroleum hydrocarbons than are oil- or steam-heated thermal screws, asphalt plant aggregate dryers, and carbon steel rotary dryers.
