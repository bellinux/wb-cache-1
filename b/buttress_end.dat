40|$|From 2010 to 2015, MwRSF {{researchers}} {{developed the}} RESTORE barrier, {{which is a}} restorable MASH TL- 4 median barrier with a steel and concrete rail supported by elastomer posts and steel skids. The research effort reported herein describes the initial development of a transition from the RESTORE barrier to a rigid TL- 4 concrete buttress. The previously-developed RESTORE barrier LS-DYNA model was validated against three full-scale vehicle crash tests. Several design concepts were generated {{through a series of}} brainstorming efforts. The primary transition concept consisted of a pin and loop connection between the RESTORE barrier and rigid concrete buttress, which was designed and evaluated with LS-DYNA computer simulation. Vehicle and system behavior were investigated using MASH test designation nos. 4 - 20, 4 - 21, and 4 - 22. Six horizontal gusset plates and drop-down pin allowed for limited deflection and rotation at the transition joint, but provided shear continuity between the two systems. A rounded-edge cover plate mitigated vehicle snag on the transition joint hardware. Eleven impact points were evaluated with each vehicle model to determine critical impact points for use in a future full-scale crash testing program. All occupant risk measures and vehicle stability were within MASH limits. Further design modifications are recommended to limit stresses in the transition joint hardware and to reduce excessive occupant compartment deformation that occurred when the small car impacted the concrete <b>buttress</b> <b>end.</b> Advisor: Ronald K.

40|$|Examination of {{the living}} bathyal feather star, Atelecrinus, using light and {{scanning}} electron microscopy reveals a series of morphological features, some apparently unique within the Crinoidea, which forces a reassessment {{of the relationship of}} the genus to other living feather stars. In the cavernous centrodorsal cavity, interradial <b>buttresses</b> <b>end</b> with a shallow oral concavity or deep pit. Two adjacent axils each bear a large distolateral calcareous process of unknown function that resembles a shoe with a deeply ridged sole. These processes project into the visceral mass with their 2 ̆ 2 soles 2 ̆ 2 apposed-the only known case among living crinoids in which a skeletal feature appears asymmetrically on two of five rays. Articular facets of distal brachials bear one distally-projecting, distal muscular fossa that overlaps a recumbent muscular fossa on the succeeding ossicle. Apposed projecting and recumbent fossae alternate sides on successive ossicles. The arm terminates in a long filament that lacks pinnules. Finally, modified ambulacral lappets resembling sessile pedicellariae but unsupported by skeletal plates flank the ambulacral grooves along the middle and proximal arms. Two of the four genera in the Atelecrinidae, extant monotypic Sibogacrinus anomalus and Cretaceous Jaekelometra, are removed from the family and treated as incertae sedis. Unique cirrus sockets are found in Atelecrinus and Atopocrinus sibogae (the only other remaining atelecrinid); members of Atopocrinus share unique ray morphology with those of the Pentametrocrinidae, and uniquely modified distal brachials are shared by individuals of Atelecrinus and Pentametrocrinus varians. However, the relationship of Atelecrinus to other feather stars remains unclear. The genus may represent a highly derived, paedomorphic comatulid as suggested by its unmetamorphosed basal ring and lack of proximal pinnules, or a non-comatulid distinguished by its cirrus sockets, skeletal processes and pedicellaria-like features. Robust answers require fresh material suitable for ultrastructural and molecular analyses...|$|R

40|$|Mammalian DNA ligase III (LigIII) {{functions}} in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA metabolism. In the nucleus, LigIII has functional redundancy with DNA ligase I whereas LigIII {{is the only}} mitochondrial DNA ligase and {{is essential for the}} survival of cells de-pendent upon oxidative respiration. The unique LigIII zinc finger (ZnF) domain is not required for catalytic activity but senses DNA strand breaks and stimulates intermolecular ligation of two DNAs by an unknown mechanism. Consistent with this activity, LigIII acts in an alternative pathway of DNA double strand break repair that <b>buttresses</b> canonical non-homologous <b>end</b> joining (NHEJ) and is manifest in NHEJ-defective cancer cells, but how LigIII acts in joining inter-molecular DNA ends versus nick ligation is unclear. To investigate how LigIII efficiently joins two DNAs, we developed a real-time, fluorescence-based as-say of DNA bridging suitable for high-throughput screening. On a nicked duplex DNA substrate, the results reveal binding competition between the ZnF and the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding do-main, one of three domains constituting the LigIII cat-alytic core. In contrast, these domains collaborate and are essential for formation of a DNA-bridging in-termediate by adenylated LigIII that positions a pair of blunt-ended duplex DNAs for efficient and specific intermolecular ligation...|$|R

The exterior {{of the church is}} rather sophisticated in comparison with most comparable churches in Uppland, thanks to the more dynamic material used, i.e. brick rather than granite. It is decorated with blind arches and supported by <b>buttresses.</b> The western <b>end</b> of the church seems to have been built as a separate chapel from the start, perhaps as a family chapel for the commissioning family, or as a chapel to house the baptismal font. The interior of the church is richly decorated with frescos, the oldest of which are signed by the master Johannes Rosenrod in 1437. These frescos depict the life of Jesus and Mary, as well as the life of Saint Bridget. In addition, the frescos include a full-figure portrait of Bengt Jönsson Oxenstierna, kneeling in a suit of armour next to his coat of arms.

6000|$|... § XI. The form of {{the common}} {{buttress}} must be familiar to the eye of every reader, sloping if low, and thrown into successive steps {{if they are to}} be carried to any considerable height. There is much dignity in them when they are of essential service; but even in their best examples, their awkward angles are among the least manageable features of the Northern Gothic, and the whole organisation of its system was destroyed by their unnecessary and lavish application on a diminished scale; until the buttress became actually confused with the shaft, and we find strangely crystallised masses of diminutive buttress applied, for merely vertical support, in the northern tabernacle work; while in some recent copies of it the principle has been so far distorted that the tiny buttressings look as if they carried the superstructure on the points of their pinnacles, as in the Cranmer memorial at Oxford. Indeed, in most modern Gothic, the architects evidently consider buttresses as convenient breaks of blank surface, and general apologies for deadness of wall. They stand in the place of ideas, and I think are supposed also to have something of the odor of sanctity about them; otherwise, one hardly sees why a warehouse seventy feet high should have nothing of the kind, and a chapel, which one can just get into with one's hat off, should have a bunch of them at every corner; and worse than this, they are even thought ornamental when they can be of no possible use; and these stupid penthouse outlines are forced upon the eye in every species of decoration: in St. Margaret's Chapel, West Street, there are actually a couple of <b>buttresses</b> at the <b>end</b> of every pew.|$|R

40|$|Combined {{structural}} and tectonic analyses {{demonstrate that the}} NW Foothills of the Taiwan collision belt constitute mainly an asymmetric “primary arc” type fold-thrust belt. The arcuate belt developed as a basin-controlled salient in {{the portion of the}} foreland basin that was initially thicker, due to the presence of a precollisional depocenter (the Taihsi basin). Additional but limited <b>buttress</b> effects at <b>end</b> points related to interaction with foreland basement highs (Kuanyin and Peikang highs) may have also slightly enhanced curvature. The complex structural pattern results from the interaction between low-angle thrusting related to shallow decollement tectonics and oblique inversion of extensional structures of the margin on the southern edge of the Kuanyin basement high. The tectonic regimes and mechanisms revealed by the pattern of paleostress indicators such as striated outcrop-scale faults are combined with the orientation and geometry of offshore and onshore regional faults in order to accurately define the Quaternary kinematics of the propagating units. The kinematics of this curved range is mainly controlled by distributed transpressional wrenching along the southern edge of the Kuanyin high, leading {{to the development of a}} regional-scale oblique ramp, the Kuanyin transfer fault zone, which is conjugate of the NW trending Pakua transfer fault zone north of the Peikang basement high. The divergence between the N 120 ° regional transport direction and the maximum compressive trend that evolved from N 120 ° to N 150 ° (and even to N–S) in the northern part of the arc effectively supports distributed wrench deformation along its northern limb during the Pleistocene. The geometry and kinematics of the western Taiwan Foothills therefore appear to be highly influenced by both the preorogenic structural pattern of the irregularly shaped Chinese passive margin and the obliquity of its Plio-Quaternary collision with the Philippine Sea plate...|$|R
50|$|A {{characteristic}} of Gothic church architecture is its height, both absolute and {{in proportion to}} its width, the verticality suggesting an aspiration to Heaven. A section of {{the main body of}} a Gothic church usually shows the nave as considerably taller than it is wide. In England the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at Cologne Cathedral with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at 48 m. The pointed arch, itself a suggestion of height, is appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.Verticality is emphasised on the exterior in a major way by the towers and spires, a {{characteristic of}} Gothic churches both great and small varying from church to church, and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called attached shafts which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated. The roofline, gable <b>ends,</b> <b>buttresses</b> {{and other parts of the}} building are often terminated by small pinnacles, Milan Cathedral being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration. In Italy, the tower, if present, is almost always detached from the building, as at Florence Cathedral, and is often from an earlier structure. In France and Spain, two towers on the front is the norm. In England, Germany and Scandinavia this is often the arrangement, but an English cathedral may also be surmounted by an enormous tower at the crossing. Smaller churches usually have just one tower, but this may also be the case at larger buildings, such as Salisbury Cathedral or Ulm Minster in Ulm, Germany, completed in 1890 and possessing the tallest spire in the world, slightly exceeding that of Lincoln Cathedral, the tallest spire that was actually completed during the medieval period, at 160 m.|$|R
5000|$|The first Denison Bridge was a three span {{laminated}} bow-string arch British type bridge commenced in January 1855 {{and completed}} the following year. The first bridge only lasted 11 {{years after it}} was destroyed by floods in 1867.The following article of the time provides great detail of the construction and the features of the first Denison Bridge:The bridge is built of wood, strengthened in parts by iron rods; it has five arches, so to speak, built upon the suspension principle. The arches at either end are small, having a span of about fifty feet, while, the remaining space is divided between the other three arches, the centre one being apparently somewhat larger than the two others. There are two distinct lines of roadway, separated by the middle support of the bridge: one for carriages passing eastward, and another for those passing in an opposite direction. No separate provision has yet been made for foot passengers, but I believe it is contemplated to add that accommodation at a future time. The roadway is formed of wood, not otherwise covered than with a coating of preparation to resist the action of the weather, mixed with some rough material to give foothold to the horses passing over. The total length of the bridge is about, I should say, 400 feet. The whole building is well defended by strong side rails and balustrades, as well on the outer sides as on the inner line. The three are uniform. The whole of the upper part, above the roadway, is painted of a light colour, and has a very airy appearance. That below the road and under water is covered with tar, &a., and remains of its natural colour, relieving, very much, the appearance of the upper works of the bridge, and giving it a light appearance when viewed from the banks of the river. Returning to the upper works. On a <b>buttress,</b> at either <b>end</b> of the bridge, is raised a lamp, the light from which will serve to show the divisions of the track at night. The approaches to the bridge, on either side, have been well defended, and led up to, by strong fencing-not the primitive split-post and rail bush stuff, but good, legitimate, strong post and rail, well painted. A very good arrangement has been contrived to prevent collision. It consists merely in an application of those [...] "rules of the road" [...] which are practically on the road so little attended to.|$|R
