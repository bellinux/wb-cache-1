5|$|Although Lochry {{knew that}} he was in hostile territory, he landed his little {{flotilla}} after two days of nonstop travel because he needed to feed his men and horses. After landing, the Americans cooked fresh <b>buffalo</b> <b>meat</b> for breakfast and cut grass for their horses, apparently not taking proper security precautions. Concealed in the nearby woods, Brant repositioned his men and then opened fire, taking the Americans completely by surprise. Some Americans fought until their ammunition ran out, although others apparently did not have their weapons ready when the attack began. Some of the Americans attempted to escape by boat, but Brant had anticipated this and had positioned men in canoes to cut off any retreat. Seeing that he was hopelessly trapped, Lochry called for his men to surrender.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, physico-chemical and {{functional}} properties of buffalo head meat; heart <b>meat</b> and <b>buffalo</b> skeletal <b>meat</b> were estimated and compared. Moisture content of <b>buffalo</b> heart <b>meat</b> (78. 42 %) and head meat (76. 94 %) was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than <b>buffalo</b> skeletal <b>meat</b> (75. 85 %). <b>Buffalo</b> heart <b>meat</b> had significantly lower protein content (15. 49 %) than head meat (19. 25 %) and skeletal meat (19. 84 %). Fat and ash content of <b>buffalo</b> skeletal <b>meat,</b> head meat and heart meat {{did not differ}} significantly among themselves. pH of <b>buffalo</b> head <b>meat</b> (6. 41) was significantly higher than skeletal meat (5. 85) and heart meat (5. 80). Salt extractable protein of head meat (12. 02 %) was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher than skeletal meat (8. 25 %) and heart meat (8. 52 %). Heart meat had significantly (p< 0. 05) lower water holding capacity than skeletal and head meat. Shear force value and emulsifying capacity of heart meat were significantly (p< 0. 05) lower than skeletal and head meat.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{performed}} to measure and compare the levels of steroid hormones [estrone (E 1), 17 β-estradiol (E 2), and estriol (E 3) ] and their conjugated metabolites in cow's and river <b>buffalo's</b> <b>meat</b> in two distinct follicular and luteal phases. Moreover, the possible effect of a heating process on steroid hormone concentration was also investigated. The collected meat (biceps femoris muscle) samples were subjected to liquid extraction, enzymatical deconjugation, and C 18 solid-phase extraction. Estrogens were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a fluorescence detector. In the follicular phase the levels of steroid hormones (E 1 and E 2) in either tested species were higher than the luteal phase. Moreover, in the present study, E 1 concentration (free and deconjugated value, 16. 2  ±  1. 1  ng/L) {{was found to be}} the highest phenolic estrogen in beef, while the dominant estrogen in muscle of river buffalo was E 2 (free and deconjucated value, 23. 3  ±  1. 3  ng/L). The study revealed that animal species influenced the concentration of hormones (E 1 and E 2) in the samples. The heating process did not significantly change (p >  0. 05) the levels of estrogens. The further findings of the present study showed that E 3 (deconjugated form) was only detected in the <b>buffalo's</b> <b>meat</b> (15. 8  ±  1. 9  ng/L). These data suggest that although meat is one of the valuable nutrient sources for humans, there are, however, increasing concerns about the safety of meat due to the excessive presence of steroid hormones...|$|R

40|$|<b>Buffalo</b> lean <b>meat</b> {{was used}} to {{evaluate}} the effects of pH of the salt soluti 1 on (5. 0, 5. 5, 6. 0, 6. 5 and 7. 0), dilution volume (4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 X sample weight), blending time (30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 sec) and post mortem ageing period (0, 5, 10 and 15 days) on the yield of Salt Soluble Proteins (SSP). Maximum yield of SSP was obtained at pH 6. 0. SSP yield increased with increase of dilution volume and blending time.

40|$|<b>Buffalo’s</b> <b>meat</b> is an {{alternative}} commodity to meet the national meat requirement despite its low contribution (1. 93 %) compared to cattle’s meat (22 %). Compared to other livestock, buffalo has some benefit characteristics, such as higher ability to utilize fibrous feed, higher metabolism capacity, etc. Agriculture crop residues are feed resources which are abundant and very potential to be used the whole year. Buffalloes can utilize the fibrous residues as roughages and agro industrial by products to meet their nutrient requirement for protein, energy and minerals.

40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence of Shiga toxin (Stx) –producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in different types of food samples and to compare their genetic relatedness with STEC strains previously isolated from animal sources in Bangladesh. We investigated a total of 213 food samples, including 90 raw meat samples collected from retail butcher shops, 20 raw milk samples from domestic cattle, and 103 fresh juice samples from street vendors in Dhaka city. We found that more than 68 % (n= 62) of the raw meat samples were positive for the stx gene(s); 34 % (n= 21) of <b>buffalo</b> <b>meats</b> and 66 % (n= 41) of beef. Approximately 10 % (n= 2) of the raw milk and 8 % (n= 8) of the fresh juice samples were positive for stx. We isolated STEC O 157 from seven meat samples (7. 8 %), of which two were from <b>buffalo</b> <b>meats</b> and five from beef; and no other STEC serotypes could be isolated. We could not isolate STEC from any of the stx-positive raw milk and juice samples. The STEC O 157 isolates from raw meats were positive for the stx 2, eae, katP, etpD, and enterohemorrhagic E. coli hly virulence genes, and they belonged to three different phage types: 8 (14. 3 %), 31 (42. 8 %), and 32 (42. 8 %). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing revealed six distinct patterns among seven isolates of STEC O 157, suggesting a heterogeneous clonal diversity. Of the six PFGE patterns, one was identical and the other two were = 90 % related to PFGE patterns of STEC O 157 strains previously isolated from animal feces, indicating that raw meats are readily contaminated with fecal materials. This study represents the first survey of STEC in the food chain in Bangladesh...|$|R
50|$|Buffalo have {{exceptional}} {{muscular development}} and thus they are considerably heavy, with some weighing {{more than a}} tonne. The main agricultural use of buffalo is to obtain milk.

25|$|The main {{food source}} for the Crow was the American bison which was hunted {{in a variety of}} ways. Before the use of horses the bison were hunted on foot and {{required}} hunters to stalk close to the bison, often with a wolf-pelt disguise, then pursue the animals quickly on foot before killing them with arrows or lances. The horse allowed the Crow to hunt bison more easily as well as hunt more at one time. Riders would panic the herd into a stampede and shoot the targeted animals with arrows or bullets from horseback or lance them through the heart. In addition to bison the Crow also hunted bighorn sheep, mountain goats, deer, elk, bear, and other game. <b>Buffalo</b> <b>meat</b> was often roasted or boiled in a stew with prairie turnips. The rump, tongue, liver, heart, and kidneys all were considered delicacies. Dried bison meat was ground with fat and berries to make pemmican. In addition to meat, wild edibles were gathered and eaten such as elderberries, wild turnip, and Saskatoon berries.|$|E
25|$|The Binou sect uses totems: common {{ones for}} the entire village and {{individual}} ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even {{if this is a}} crocodile, as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has done something wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat <b>buffalo</b> <b>meat,</b> allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch clouds and make it rain.|$|E
