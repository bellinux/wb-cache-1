5|$|Since the 18th century, {{scholars}} have occasionally put forth that Jesus {{was a political}} national messiah, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} Fourth Military Gate {{stands between}} towers 59 and 60, {{and is currently}} walled up. Recently, {{it has been suggested}} that this gate is actually the Gate of St. Romanus, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> is uncertain.|$|E

50|$|Eilema intermixta is a moth of {{the family}} Arctiidae. It was {{described}} by Kühne in 2007. It is found in Kenya. the species formerly known as Katha intermixta in India and Sri Lanka {{are known to be}} <b>the</b> same species, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidences</b> are unclear.|$|R

5|$|During {{his time}} in Sussex Wilfrid was {{reconciled}} with Archbishop Theodore; the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury. Wilfrid {{may have been involved}} in founding monasteries near Bath as well as in other parts of Sussex, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subsequent}} studies put aspirin's effectiveness as a heart drug on firmer ground, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> was not incontrovertible. However, in the mid-1980s, {{with the}} relatively new technique of meta-analysis, statistician Richard Peto convinced the U.S. FDA {{and much of}} the medical community that the aspirin studies, in aggregate, showed aspirin's effectiveness with relative certainty. By the end of the 1980s, aspirin was widely used as a preventive drug for heart attacks and had regained its former position as the top-selling analgesic in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{discover}} evidence of a secret government experimentation with alien DNA, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> and everyone who has seen it are quickly targeted for elimination.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's rear guard on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E
5|$|Henry had a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. Henry had a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> to support this theory is limited.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> is not very strong.|$|E

5|$|Neville was a royal {{clerk to}} King John {{in the spring}} of 1207, and in December of that year was at Marlborough Castle on royal business. Earlier {{references}} to a Ralph Neville who in 1207 delivered items to Hugh de Neville, or the Ralph Neville who was the same Hugh de Neville's chaplain, may be to the future bishop, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> is inconclusive. Hugh de Neville and Neville subsequently worked together, and corresponded on both business and personal affairs. Both men claimed the other as a kinsman.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd {{century was}} the age in which the {{initiative}} for persecution shifted from the masses to the Imperial office. In the 1st and 2nd centuries, persecutions were carried out {{under the authority of}} local government officials. Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) and Maximin (r. 235–38) are alleged to have issued general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for their acts is obscure and contested. There is no evidence that Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status. Pogroms against the Christians in Alexandria took place while Philip was still emperor. There is no evidence that Philip punished, participated in or assisted the pogrom.|$|E
5|$|While Mary Celeste {{prepared}} to sail, another brigantine, the Canadian , lay in nearby Hoboken, New Jersey, awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via Gibraltar. Her captain, David Morehouse, {{and his first}} mate Oliver Deveau, were Nova Scotians, both highly experienced and respected seamen. As captains with common interests, {{it is likely that}} Morehouse and Briggs knew each other, if only casually. Some accounts assert that they were close friends who, on the evening before Mary Celestes departure, dined together, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> for this is limited to a recollection by Morehouse's widow, 50 years after the event. Dei Gratia departed for Gibraltar on November 15, eight days after Mary Celeste, following the same general route.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} literature over the naming of Russula brevipes. Some early 20th-century American mycologists {{referred to it as}} Russula delica, although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Fries with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. Fries's concept of R.delica included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named Russula delica. Robert Shaffer summarized the taxonomic conundrum in 1964: Russula delica is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> indicates that R.delica sensu Fries (1838) is not R.delica sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not R.delica sensu Kühner and Romagnesi (1953)…It is best to use R.brevipes for the North American collections which most authors but not Kühner and Romagnesi (1953), call R.delica. The name, R.brevipes, is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed.|$|E
