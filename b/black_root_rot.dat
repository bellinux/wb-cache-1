Four bacterial diseases have been identified and their causal agents characterized: CBB, angular leaf spot, bacterial stem rot, and bacterial stem gall. Two mycoplasmal problems, witches` broom and antholysis, have been identified. The most important viral diseases are CAMV, common mosaic, Colombian mosaic, leaf vein mosaic, and frog skin. Approx. 25 fungal species have been registered as cassava pathogens; these can be grouped depending if they affect the leaf area, the stem, or the roots. Brown leaf spot, blight leaf spot, white leaf spot, concentric-ring leaf spot, cassava ash, and rust are in the 1 st group. Among those affecting the stem are superelongation, anthracnose, <b>black</b> stem and <b>root</b> <b>rot,</b> and stem rots caused by Fusarium.

50|$|Many {{soft fruit}} berries require {{a period of}} {{temperatures}} between 0 °C and 10 °C for breaking dormancy. In general, strawberries require 200-300 hours, blueberries 650-850 hours, blackberries 700 hours, raspberries 800-1700 hours, currants and gooseberries 800-1500 hours, and cranberries 2000 hours. However, too low a temperature will kill the crops: blueberries do not tolerate temperatures below -29 °C, raspberries, depending on variety, may tolerate as low as -31 °C, and blackberries are injured below -20 °C. Spring frosts are, however, much more damaging to berry crops than low winter temperatures. Sites with moderate slopes (3-5%), facing north or east, in the northern hemisphere, near large bodies of water, which regulate spring temperature, are considered ideal in preventing spring frost injury to the new leaves and flowers. All berry crops have shallow root systems. Many land-grant university extension offices suggest that strawberries should not be planted {{more than five years}} on the same site, due to the danger of <b>black</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> (though many other illnesses go by the same name), which is controlled in major commercial production by annual methyl bromide fumigation. Besides the number of years in production, soil compaction, the frequency of fumigation, and herbicide usages increase the appearance of <b>black</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot</b> in strawberries. Raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and many other berries are susceptible to verticillium wilt. Blueberries and cranberries grow poorly if the clay or silt content of the soil is more than 20%, while most other berries tolerate a wide range of soil types. For most berry crops, the ideal soil is well drained sandy loam, with a pH of 6.2-6.8 and a moderate to high organic content; however, blueberries have an ideal pH of 4.2-4.8 and can be grown on muck soils, while blueberries and cranberries prefer poorer soils with lower cation exchange, lower calcium, and lower levels of phosphorus.|$|E
50|$|Thielaviopsis basicola is a plant-pathogenic fungus in the Ascomycota phylum. It is a soil-borne fungus {{that causes}} <b>black</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> It {{has a wide}} host range {{consisting}} of gerbera, kalanchoe, pansy, petunia, poinsettia, primula, snapdragon, sweet pea, verbena, and viola. After T. basicola infects the host some of the symptoms consist of “stunting of foliage and root systems, blackened area on roots, yellowing of leaves between the veins or along the margins, and branch dieback. The yellowing of leaves means the plant cannot do photosynthesis and the blackened tissue means it is dead. And some of the signs include dark brown, multi-celled spores form in the infected roots. The individual cells appear to snap apart. Light colored spores are formed in a long tapering cell and extruded in chains”. If the hypocotyl along with the roots become infected {{it can lead to}} “black, rough, longitudinal cracks.”.|$|E
50|$|The {{first and}} {{foremost}} strategy for controlling T. basicola {{at the first sign}} of disease should be cultural control including- “maintaining a soil pH below 5.6, removing and destroying all diseased plants, using soil-less media, sterilizing equipment, keeping work areas clean, and controlling fungus gnats and shore flies. Fungus gnats and shore flies can be vectors; therefore, controlling these pests can lead to minimizing the spread of the fungus”. In addition, “crop rotation is recommended for management of <b>black</b> <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> Soil fumigants, such as chloropicrin, can be helpful for controlling seedbed and sterol inhibitors”. Furthermore, “to avoid contamination of plants and potting media, greenhouse floors and walkways should be lightly misted with water to cut down on airborne dust transmission of T. basicola during cleaning operations”. At the end of the “growing season, doing a thorough clean-up of the greenhouse can be beneficial because it reduces the possibility of the fungus surviving as a resistant chlamydospores on the soil floor and in wooden benches".|$|E

Ten resistant varieties were identified from 26 introductions which were known to be resistant to <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> in Rwanda. Farmers preferred MLB- 49 - 89 a because of its early maturity, SCAM 80 -CM/ 5 and RWR 532 because of their high yield and seed type, and the late maturing RWR 719 as it was seen as a replacement for a previously popular cultivar which succumbed to <b>root</b> <b>rots.</b> Crop tolerance to <b>root</b> <b>rots</b> was greatly improved by improving soil fertility through application of diammonium phosphate or certain organic manures, and less so by sowing on ridges. Application of several rapidly decomposing green manures, including Tithonia diversifolia which was abundantly available in field borders, resulted in improved crop tolerance to <b>root</b> <b>rot.</b> Peer-reviewe...|$|R
