25|$|A Wells Fargo agent, Ashby, {{enters and}} announces {{that he is}} chasing the bandit Ramerrez and his gang of Mexicans. Rance toasts Minnie, the woman who owns the saloon, as his future wife, which makes Sonora jealous. The two men begin to fight. Rance draws his {{revolver}} <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> a shot rings out and Minnie stands next to the bar with a rifle in her hands ("Hello, Minnie!"). She gives the miners a reading lesson from the Bible ("Dove eravamo?").|$|E
25|$|Uninformed {{about the}} {{situation}} in the field, the First Army command did not realise that the attack of the main Ottoman forces had occurred, as those forces were expected on Ovče Pole. Assuming that the Ottoman units north of Kumanovo were merely forward detachments, it ordered the troops to continue their advance towards south, as previously planned. After midnight, it received a report from Danube Division I which stated that the division was attacked by the strong enemy forces and suffered heavy casualties, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{it was too late for}} any change of orders.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf {{arrived in}} time to help order the defences of Minas Tirith. His {{presence}} was resented by Denethor, the Steward of Gondor; but after Denethor's son Faramir was gravely wounded in battle, Denethor sank into despair and madness. Together with Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth, Gandalf led the defenders during the siege of the city. When the forces of Mordor finally broke the main gate, Gandalf alone on Shadowfax confronted the Witch-king of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgûl. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> the Rohirrim arrived, compelling the Witch-king to withdraw and engage them. Gandalf would have ridden to their aid, but he too was suddenly required elsewhere—to save Faramir from Denethor, who sought in desperation to burn himself and his son on a funeral pyre in Rath Dínen.|$|E
6000|$|Not a doubt {{but that}} he would have added more, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> a woman's shrill voice drowned his utterance. [...] "Silence, Giuffre!" [...] she admonished him fearfully. [...] "Silence, on your life!" ...|$|R

2500|$|To {{continue}} to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo's quest, Aragorn led {{the armies of}} the West to the gates of Mordor, where Sauron attacked with overwhelming force. [...] <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> the Ring was destroyed, and Sauron and his forces were vanquished.|$|E
2500|$|Silveira {{opened their}} second match taking Sakuraba's back, which the Japanese wrestler {{answered}} {{by attempting to}} apply a Kimura lock. After freeing his arm, Silveira capitalized on another Kimura attempt by Saku to try to twist it into an armbar from his guard, only for the Japanese to escape to his knees. Silveira then tried his own Kimura, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> Sakuraba reversed {{it in the same}} way and locked the armbar, making the Brazilian submit. Afterwards, Sakuraba famously stated, [...] "In fact, professional wrestling is strong". With the victory Sakuraba remains one of the last UFC tournament champions to date.|$|E
2500|$|While Aurelio {{and his son}} sleep, Eleanore watches over them. [...] Aware of the {{impending}} siege, she prays for some brief comfort: (Breve riposo a lui concde il sonno / [...] "May sleep grant a short rest"). [...] Waking suddenly from a bad dream, Aurelio is startled and he describes it, telling that his son was captured and killed by English soldiers before his eyes. (Duet: first Aurelio: Io l'udia chiarmarmi a nome / [...] "In his sobs and terror...", then Eleonora: Rio presagio!...amato figlio / [...] "An evil omen!...my beloved son"; then together). [...] A bell rings, appearing to summoning Aurelio to the fight, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> just <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{somebody}} knocked <b>at</b> {{the front}} door, and Moppet {{jumped into the}} flour barrel in a fright.|$|R
60|$|She {{waved the}} subject of Selingman on one side, <b>but</b> almost <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> he stood once more before them. He held an evening paper in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ten minutes more!' she thought: 'Oh, why doesn't he go?' <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> very <b>moment</b> he got up, and {{instantly}} her heart {{went out to}} him again.|$|R
2500|$|Mucien leads Éponine to Sabinus's palace. He {{promises}} to save Sabinus' life if she divorces Sabinus and marries him instead. Éponine refuses and Mucien orders his soldiers {{to search the}} palace, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> the building bursts into flames. Believing that Sabinus has been killed, Éponine collapses. The Genius of Gaul is seen in a flying chariot pouring [...] "a rain of fire" [...] onto the palace; soon nothing {{is left of the}} building but an altar with an urn on top. Éponine awakes and reads the inscription on the urn: it is a message from Sabinus claiming that these are his ashes. She curses Mucien.|$|E
2500|$|At last, {{after several}} days of uncertainty, Rufina Roca de Monzón gave them shelter in {{the second floor of}} her home, # 29 Judío Place in Guatemala City, but a spy learned about it. [...] On May 20, 1907, at 3 a.m. the house was {{surrounded}} by a platoon of soldiers. The troop broke down the door and tried to reach the second floor, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> gunfight began. By 6 a.m. the conspirators were out of ammo and exhausted and decided to kill themselves before becoming prisoners of the regime. The Diario de Centro América, then a semi-official newspaper owned by Estrada Cabrera, went as far as to publish the conspirators autopsy details.|$|E
2500|$|She only {{spent four}} years with the French, before forming part of Vice-Admiral Villeneuve's fleet at Cadiz, under her captain, Charles-Eusebe l'Hôpitalier-Villemadrin. On 21 October 1805 she sailed out with the {{combined}} Franco-Spanish fleets {{to engage in the}} Battle of Trafalgar. During the battle she formed part of the rear of the line, astern of Aigle and ahead of Argonaute. She was fired upon by , and after an exchange of fire, lost her main topmast and had her guns silenced. She began to drift away, while Colossus opened fire on Bahama. Swiftsures crew regained control, and returned to fire on Colossus, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> Edward Codrington's [...] came through the smoke, slipped under Swiftsure′s stern and discharged several devastating broadsides. Swiftsure had her mainmast, taffrail and wheel shot away, and most of the guns on the main gun-deck were dismounted. Villemadrin attempted to fight on, but eventually struck, having suffered 68 dead and 123 wounded during the battle.|$|E

60|$|March {{certainly}} {{looked as}} if he was; <b>but,</b> being <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> alone, no one replied to his question or shared his enjoyment. After another pause he resumed his audible meditations.|$|R
60|$|They {{strained}} and the houseboat came loose, <b>but</b> alas! <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> both sweeps {{slipped and}} {{slowly but surely}} the Dora swung into her former position and became jammed tighter than before.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> a loud {{knocking}} {{was heard}} at the hall door.|$|E
60|$|We were {{promising}} a great deal, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> we felt very grateful.|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> just <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> {{her eyes}} were sad, {{and her face was}} troubled. Her husband, looking up suddenly, saw it, and {{throwing}} down his paper, walked across the room to her side.|$|R
60|$|<b>But,</b> Chut! <b>At</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> I {{would have}} made the rings round the 'ole British Army. Yes, and also the Corps Diplomatique. For I am {{inspired}}. Love 'as inspired me. I am conqueror.|$|R
60|$|They {{found the}} spot where the Chinaman had escaped from the wagon, <b>but</b> even <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> they heard the sound of a horse's hoofs and saw a flying figure in the distance.|$|R

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> very <b>moment</b> {{the door}} opened, and Mrs. St John Deloraine entered, magnificently {{comfortable}} in furs, and bringing a fresh air of hospitality and content with existence into the room.|$|R
60|$|Teddy fancied {{he heard}} a muffled cry of agony; <b>but</b> just <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> he could think only of saving his own life, {{and there was no}} time to so much as glance around.|$|R

60|$|He {{failed to}} observe that Snip {{was no longer in}} the room; <b>but</b> just <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> his shrill barking was heard in an {{adjoining}} apartment, and Seth knew the dog had gone to find his little playmate.|$|R
