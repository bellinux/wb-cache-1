25|$|Although Bush {{expressed}} {{appreciation for}} the Supreme Court's ruling upholding the selection of college applicants for purposes of diversity, his Administration filed briefs against it. <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> he opposes government sanctioned and enforced quotas and racial preferences, but that {{the private and public}} sector should be encouraged to reach out to accomplished minorities to increase employment diversity.|$|E
500|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that he {{believes}} {{that global warming is}} real and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserted there is a [...] "debate over whether it's man-made or naturally caused". The Bush Administration's stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities. Critics have alleged that the administration misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warming.|$|E
2500|$|US President Barack Obama {{said that}} the {{agreement}} {{would need to be}} built on in the future and that [...] "We've come a long way but we have much further to go." [...] Gregg Easterbrook noted that Obama's speech was exactly what George H W <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> after the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. However, there had been no progress in regulating greenhouse gases since 1992.|$|R

5000|$|Responding to American {{political}} criticisms in the 10 October 2006 {{issue of}} Time magazine, Chávez insisted to Tim Padgett {{that he was}} not attacking Bush, but counterattacking -- claiming that <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> much worse things about him, and that [...] "Bush has been attacking the world, and not just with words--with bombs". He argued that he was reacting to what he perceived to be the [...] "threat of a U.S. empire that uses the U.N. to justify its aggression against half the world." [...] and that he wanted to [...] "wake up U.S. and global public opinion" ...|$|R

It was released on VHS in the UK in 1994 and also received a small number of cinema screenings around the world. In recent interviews, <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that she considers it a failure, and stated in 2001: [...] "I'm very pleased with four minutes of it, but I'm very disappointed with the rest." [...] In a 2005 interview, she described the film as [...] "A load of bollocks." ...|$|E
500|$|Federal {{funding for}} medical {{research}} involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment by Congress and {{the signature of}} President Bill Clinton. <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing [...] "lines" [...] of stem cells, but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power {{for the first time}} in his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1991, Graham said in {{reference}} to the Persian Gulf War, [...] "As ... President <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said,</b> it is not the people of Iraq we are at war with. It is {{some of the people in}} that regime. Pray for peace in the Middle East, a just peace." [...] Graham had earlier said that [...] "there come times when we have to fight for peace." [...] He went on to say that out of the war in the Gulf may [...] "come a new peace and, as suggested by the President, a new world order." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{the network}} {{has been criticized for}} its {{tendency}} to support the Republican Party and its interests, David Frum, former speechwriter for George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>has</b> also <b>said,</b> [...] "Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we're discovering we work for Fox." ...|$|R

5000|$|The new National Space Policy rejects Arms control {{agreements}} that might limit U.S. flexibility {{in space and}} asserts a right to deny access to space to anyone [...] "hostile to U.S. interest." [...] The George W. <b>Bush</b> Administration <b>had</b> <b>said</b> the policy revisions are not a prelude to introducing weapons systems into Earth orbit, and that the policy is not about developing or deploying weapons in space.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> {{that the}} U.S. is [...] "duty-bound {{to provide support}} ... to deal with taking Assad out and taking ISIS out." [...] Bush has not {{explained}} how Assad should be removed.|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, George W. Bush showed dissatisfaction when he {{was asked}} if he was in denial about the {{situation}} in Iraq (the most <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> about the situation was that the increase in attacks was [...] "unsettling"). Bush replied [...] "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him [...] "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference {{to the fact that it}} was a hot day, that [...] "next time you should cover your bald head". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied [...] "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded [...] "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a [...] "fatal error" [...] on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.|$|R
5000|$|George Bush {{supports}} {{nuclear power}} and expanded domestic drilling. Bush pledged {{to work toward}} reduced reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. He lifted a ban on offshore drilling in 2008, and said at the time, [...] "This means {{that the only thing}} standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress." [...] <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in June 2008, [...] "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production." ...|$|R

50|$|In 1999, Bush co-founded Ignite! Learning, an {{educational}} software corporation. <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> he started Austin-based Ignite!

5000|$|Schmidt {{made the}} Iraq War {{an issue in}} the race. She {{declared}} on WCET-TV's Forum that [...] "9/11 was a wakeup call. We lost our innocence" [...] and praised the Bush foreign policy. [...] "The foundation of democracy that has been planted in Afghanistan and Iraq", she <b>said,</b> <b>has</b> inspired reforms in Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, and elsewhere. Schmidt always appeared in public with a button in her lapel containing a photograph of Matt Maupin, the only prisoner of war of the Iraq campaign. Hackett did not mince words about Iraq or President Bush. He told The New York Times Bush was [...] "a chicken hawk" [...] for pursuing the war after having avoided military service in the Vietnam War. The Times also quoted him as saying Bush was [...] "the greatest threat to America." [...] Hackett in the West Union debate contrasted what President <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in the 2000 presidential debates to current events. [...] "Guess what folks? We're nation-building!" ...|$|R
500|$|In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed {{his pledge}} {{to work toward}} diminished {{reliance}} on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because {{there was still a}} federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, [...] "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress."

5000|$|Former {{governor}} Jeb <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> of {{opponents of}} the standards that while [...] "criticisms and conspiracy theories are easy attention grabbers", he instead wanted to hear their {{solutions to the problems}} in American education.

50|$|Retired Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, {{chief of}} staff to General Colin Powell in the Persian Gulf War and while Powell was Secretary of State in the <b>Bush</b> Administration), <b>has</b> <b>said</b> of Yoo and other {{administration}} figures responsible for these decisions:Haynes, Feith, Yoo, Bybee, Gonzales and—at the apex—Addington, should never travel outside the US, except perhaps to Saudi Arabia and Israel. They broke the law; they violated their professional ethical code. In the future, some government may build the case necessary to prosecute them in a foreign court, or in an international court.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary reviews however {{were more}} favourable, with the American {{magazine}} Trouser Press rating it well, {{in particular the}} songs [...] "Symphony in Blue", [...] "In the Warm Room" [...] and [...] "Dont Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake". AllMusic said that the album lacked substance, while acknowledging that Bush was capable of much better work. In a Guardian poll of Bushs best albums, Lionheart placed lowly with just 2% of the vote. While <b>Bush</b> herself <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that she was unhappy with the finished album, she has mentioned satisfaction with the track [...] "Wow".|$|R
2500|$|The {{album was}} favourably {{received}} by music critics at the time, {{save for a}} curiously critical review in Record Mirror, which appears to criticise the album (and Bush herself), while complimenting a number of tracks. Based largely on this album, Bush was voted [...] "Best female artist of 1980" [...] in polls taken in Melody Maker, Capital Radio, Sounds and the Sunday Telegraph. <b>Bush</b> herself <b>has</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was her}} favourite album to date. More recently, AllMusic gave the album a favourable review, complimenting the three singles most highly but said that Bush would improve on the formula on later albums.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> {{that global}} warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem, but he asserts there is a [...] "debate over whether it's manmade or {{naturally}} caused". He announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the United Nations, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, [...] "this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride." ...|$|E

5000|$|It was {{not until}} February 2008 that Qahtani was first charged before a {{military}} commission, and the prosecution dropped the charges in May of that year.

She said that Qahtani's [...] "treatment met the legal definition of torture.... The techniques they used were all authorized, but {{the manner in which they}} applied them was overly aggressive". As convening authority of the military commissions, Crawford was responsible for overseeing the Guantanamo military commissions. Her statement was the first time any top official of the <b>Bush</b> administration <b>had</b> <b>said</b> there was torture of detainees at Guantanamo.|$|R
5000|$|Huckabee <b>has</b> {{criticized the}} <b>Bush</b> {{administration}} for [...] "only proceeding down one track with Iran: armed conflict".

[...] Huckabee is willing to consider using military force against Iran. He wrote: [...] "The <b>Bush</b> administration <b>has</b> properly <b>said</b> that it will not take the military option for dealing with Iran off the table. Neither will I." ...|$|R
