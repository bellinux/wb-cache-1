40|$|Design-to-time {{real-time}} scheduling is {{an alternative}} to the many flexible computation approaches that are based on anytime algorithms. It <b>builds</b> <b>schedules</b> at runtime that dynamically combine solutions to subproblems, taking advantage of the time available to achieve the best results it can. In this paper we look in detail at a few issues related to design-to-time, including where the approximations we rely on come from, how uncertainty affects the scheduling process and the interface between the scheduler and its invoker. Introduction An alternative to the standard flexible computation approach of having individual algorithms that produce better results as they are given additional runtime, is the design-to-time real-time scheduling [Garvey, 1996; Garvey et al., 1993; Garvey and Lesser, 1993] approach that <b>builds</b> <b>schedules</b> at runtime that dynamically combine solution methods for different parts of the overall problem, attempting to maximize the quality of the solution generated.

40|$|The {{assembly}} protocols for a semiconductor {{capital equipment}} machine were analyzed for potential lead time reduction. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine the minimum assembly lead time for the machine based on the constraints of design, space, and labor availability. An assembly requires the completion of a set of procedures that each contains assembly tasks. Precedence relationships between tasks indicate for each procedure what other tasks must be completed before it can start. Each procedure was assumed to have constant resource requirements throughout its duration. The Critical Path Method (CPM) was used to identify 13 procedures on the critical path, based on design and space constraints. A preliminary <b>build</b> <b>schedule</b> was developed that prioritized critical path procedures. A trial of this <b>build</b> <b>schedule</b> achieved an assembly lead time of 39 hours, resulting in a 70 % reduction from the current average of 5. 5 days. This trial was also accomplished with 76 % of the average labor hours for assembly. A production <b>build</b> <b>schedule</b> with a lead time of 43 hours was developed based on the trial results. This schedule allows for production rates of up to 5 machines per week to be achieved with the current shift structure of the company, without the incurrence of overtime. A critical path drag analysis identified critical procedures with the highest potential for lead time reduction. The highest drag of a critical path item was 260 minutes, accounting for 10 % of the assembly lead time. by Blake William Clark Sedore. Thesis: M.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a new system}} that solves the problem of finding suitable class schedule using strongly-typed heuristic search technique. The system is called Automated Timetabling Solver (ATTSolver). The system uses Stochastic Context-Free Grammar rules to <b>build</b> <b>schedule</b> and make use of influence maps to assign the fittest slot (place & time) for each lecture in the timetable. This system is very useful in cases {{of the need to}} find valid, diverse, suitable and on-the-fly timetable which takes into account the soft constraints that has been imposed by the user of the system. The performance of the proposed system is compared with the aSc system for the number of tested schedules and the execution time. The results show that the number of tested schedules in the proposed system is always less than that in aSc system. Moreover, the execution time of the proposed system is much better than aSc system in all cases of the sequential runs...|$|E
40|$|The Solar Decathlon is a {{biennial}} Department of Energy (DOE) collegiate {{contest to}} “promote and speed to market” solar powered, residential homes (Grose, 2009). It {{is a student}} competition wherein twenty universities are selected to design, build, and showcase residential structures that would ultimately be relocated to a competition campus in West Potomac Park in Washington D. C. to be viewed {{by the general public}} and judged by representatives of the DOE. The challenge is “design, build, and operate solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive” (DOE). The project structures are homes that are designed and built to conform to the parameters set forth by the DOE in an effort to showcase the use of solar power as a practical means of residential line voltage power supply. The projects are then judged according to how well they performed within those parameters. The challenges involved in the design and construction of a “net- zero” house, that is a house that produces at least as much electricity as it consumes, were formidable. Equally formidable were the technical/logistical issues inherent in designing and constructing a building that could be disassembled and transported. Finally, reconstructing a residential dwelling, complete in all respects, in the allotted time period of seven days created educational opportunities that mirror conditions the construction manager will face in his or her professional life. Multidiscipline work groups analyzed the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, building controls, and photovoltaic performance requirements. These systems not only had to be integrated within each other, but they also had to work within a tight construction budget and <b>build</b> <b>schedule.</b> Those requirements are challenging enough on a normal construction project. Added to the complexity is that the INhome had to be built on the Purdue campus and then shipped to the competition site in Washington D. C. This paper highlights the process and strategies that Team Purdue utilized to design, build, operate, move, and successfully compete in the Solar Decathlon 2011 with a net zero home...|$|E

Bidlines are monthly schedules that, again, satisfy all airline rules, contract agreements and government regulations. The schedules are built and optimized following a set of recipes.

This approach has been largely replaced by PBS as the latter takes the crew preferences into account before rostering starts. However it is still employed by some North American airlines.|$|R

This question is of considerable practical importance, as a major obstacle to the use of schedules in practice is their brittleness when activities cannot be executed as planned. Scheduling can be defined as the assignment of start and end times to a set of activities (or tasks) subject to a number of constraints. Constraints are typically recognized in either time constraints and/or resource constraints. Task synchronization in the production chain of a factory, management of space missions, and transportation scheduling to support crisis management, are only but a few representative examples.

This thesis studies the feasibility of a task scheduler for a parallel operating system. After analyzing several task scheduling algorithms, the highest level first algorithm was chosen. This algorithm has been empirically found to <b>build</b> <b>schedules</b> whose scheduling times are within 90 % of optimal schedules 95 % of the time. The highest level first algorithm was then modifies to handle the processor architecture on the Texas A&M University's MasPar parallel computer. These modifications included lowering communication costs by scheduling related tasks onto the same processor and assuming that processors may be dynamically allocated during task scheduling. Comparisons are made between serial and parallel versions of the task scheduler. The parallel version was faster at labeling tasks in the task graph, but the parallel version could not place the tasks onto processors in parallel. Nevertheless, the highest level first scheduling algorithm was acceptable for use in parallel operating systems...|$|R

Computational experiments based on 52 weeks of live data are used to evaluate three different decoders with varying levels of intelligence, and four well-known crossover operators.

The results reveal that the proposed algorithm is able to find high quality solutions and is both faster and more flexible than a recently published Tabu Search approach...|$|R
