40|$|Reflecting their {{important}} role in freshwater (FW) osmoregulation, plasma levels of prolactins (PRL 188 and PRL 177) in the euryhaline tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, are always higher in fish acclimated to FW than in those in seawater (SW). Repeated <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> (5 % of estimated blood volume at 0, 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 76, and 120 h) from the tilapia acclimated to FW resulted in a marked increase in plasma levels of PRLs. The increase seemed to be correlated with a decrease in plasma osmolality, but the increased PRL levels were more marked than the levels expected from the change in plasma osmolality alone. Repeated <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the fish in SW, on the other hand, did not cause any change in plasma PRL levels, although {{a significant increase in}} plasma GH accompanied an increase in plasma osmolality. <b>Blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> resulted in a significant reduction in hematocrit values regardless of the environmental osmolality, suggesting hemodilution. The reduction in plasma osmolality after <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in FW and the increased osmolality in SW suggest that the blood volume is restored at least in part by drinking environmental water. In a separate experiment, a single <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> (20 % of total blood) stimulated drinking in the fish regardless of whether they were held in FW, 30 % SW, or SW. Plasma levels of both PRLs were also elevated following a single <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in the fish acclimated to FW and 30 % SW, but not in the fish in SW. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system after <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and dipsogenic action of angiotensin II (ANG II) is well established in fish. Intraperitoneal injection of ANG II (0. 1 and 1. 0 µg/g) into the fish in FW significantly increased plasma levels of the tilapia PRLs after 1 h. ANG II at concentrations of 10 - 1000 nM was also effective in stimulating PRL secretion in vitro. There was no effect of ANG II on GH release. These results suggest that the marked increase in PRL concentration after <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the fish in FW is due to a facilitative interaction between ANG II and a reduced plasma osmolality...|$|E

METHODS: Seven newborn lambs under general anesthesia were connected to the TPUD monitor (COstatus) after insertion of arterial and central venous catheters. A Gore-Tex(R) shunt, inserted between the descending aorta and left pulmonary artery, was intermittently opened and closed while cardiac output was varied by <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawals.</b> Flow probes were placed around the main pulmonary artery (Qufp) and the descending aorta proximal (Qpre) and distal (Qpost) to the shunt insertion.

Shunts were detected by TPUD with a positive predictive value of 86 %, a negative predictive value of 100 %, a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 83 %. The Bland-Altman analysis comparing Qp/Qs(tpud) and Qp/Qs(ufp) showed an overall mean bias (SD) of 0. 1 (0. 3), limits of agreement (LOA) of +/- 0. 6 and a percentage error of 34. 8 %.

40|$|Background: Serial blood draws for the {{assessment}} of a trauma patient’s hemoglobin (sHgb) and hematocrit (sHct) is standard practice. In the event of multiple casualties this process can be time consuming and lead to the inefficient use of valuable resources. A device that would allow for continuous real-time, non-invasive monitoring of hemoglobin and tissue perfusion would not only improve the utilization of scarce and valuable resources but would also improve triage efforts.

40|$|Background: Totally implantable {{vascular}} access devices (TIVAD) {{are considered}} {{safe and reliable}} for the administration of intravenous therapies, including chemotherapy and blood sampling. They provide direct vascular access through a simple percutaneous puncture. However, {{in order to avoid}} paravenous injection, it is mandatory to check for <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> before administering medication: this simple procedure confirms both the system’s patency, correct needle position in the chamber and the catheter tip’s intravascular location. This study’s objective was to evaluate the incidence of partial and total <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> impairment in TIVADs directly after accessing the port system. Material and Methods: From November 2003 to March 2004, nurses from 20 hospitals in Flanders (Belgium) agreed {{to take part in a}} prospective cohort study and collect data on TIVAD access procedures in cancer patients. In case of <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> problems or device occlusion, they recorded all actions needed for diagnosing the cause of the problem and restoring patency. In each hospital, TIVAD maintenance and solutions for troubleshooting were performed according to individual institutional protocols. Results: The data included 8685 accesses in 2853 patients. The incidence of <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> occlusion and total occlusion were 11. 11 % and 0. 24 % respectively. Overall incidence varied between hospitals from 3. 05 % to 28. 37 %. Nurses restored full device patency in 53. 25 % of cases, mostly by changing patients’ position or intrathoracic pressure, additional flushing and repositioning of the Huber needle in the port septum. In 83. 51 % of persistent occlusions, no further investigation into the cause of the functional impairment was undertaken. Thirty-one events of occlusion (3. 14 %) were treated by thrombolytics or device replacement. Altogether, blood aspiration was regained in 55. 17 %. Conclusions: Withdrawal and total occlusion problems occurred in 11. 35 % of TIVAD access and were resolved by nurses’ interventions in 53. 25 % of cases. The incidence expressed in function of the number of punctures reflects accurately the impact of this problem in daily practice. The differences between hospitals revealed that prevention of occlusion and established protocols for maintenance or troubleshooting solutions are important factors to maintain optimal TIVAD patency and deserves further analyses. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{yet little}} is known about the effect of delayed {{separation}} of whole blood stored at room temperature on the stability of the kidney function markers creatinine and cystatin C. Methods: We used plasma samples of 45 patients with a wide range of creatinine and cystatin C concentration. Samples were sent by post as whole blood, and differences in creatinine and cystatin C concentrations when measured (by enzymatic assay and PETIA, respectively) in plasma separated shortly after <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> or in plasma obtained after delayed separation at 24, 48 and 72 h. Intra- and inter-assay variability was assessed and total change limit was calculated to assess analyte stability. Results: Total change limit was 3. 3 % for creatinine and 3. 9 % for cystatin C. In whole blood creatinine and cystatin C remained stable up to 48 h. Delayed separation of whole blood did not induce more variability in measured concentrations of both analytes. Glomerular filtration rate estimated with the CKD-EPI equations showed less than 3 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) difference when using creatinine or cystatin C concentration measured in plasma separated up to 48 h after <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal</b> compared to plasma separated shortly after <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> The new CKD-EPI equation that uses creatinine as well as cystatin C to estimate GFR showed even at 72 h less than 3 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2) difference. Conclusions: Creatinine and cystatin C remain stable in whole blood stored at room temperature up to 48 h before separation, and changes in these analytes during this time period do not affect variability and eGFR.

Correlations between changes in COufp and changes in hemodynamic volumes (ACVI 0. 83; CBVI 0. 84 and TEDVI 0. 78 respectively) were (slightly) better than between changes in COufp and changes in heart rate (0. 44) and central venous pressure (0. 7). Changes in hemodynamic volumes using TPUD were as expected under different conditions. Hemodynamic volumetry using TPUD might be a promising technique that has the potential to improve the assessment and interpretation of the hemodynamic status in critically ill newborns and children...|$|R
40|$|The {{classical}} {{indicators of}} left ventricular (LV) performances have been derived from pressure-volume (PV) and stroke work-volume plots obtained during various loading or pharmacological interventions. More recently, the preload-adjusted maximal change in pressure over time (PAdP/dtmax), derived from single beat PV analysis, {{has been shown}} to reflect the LV systolic performance accurately in varying conditions of inotropy and afterload. The objective {{of this study was to}} address whether PAdP/dtmax is a valid indicator of LV function in the setting of large preload variations, compared with the classical dP/dtmax-end-diastolic volume (EDV) and stroke work-EDV (preload recruitable stroke work) relationships. Nine anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated rats were instrumented with a ventricular conductance catheter. Stepwise preload reduction was achieved by repeated <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawals</b> (up to a total of 5 ml). Steady-state and dynamic PV loops were recorded during brief occlusion of the inferior vena cava, and LV function parameters were derived from these recordings. Our results demonstrate that PAdP/dtmax behaved in a similar manner to preload recruitable stroke work, reflecting well-maintained LV contractility during controlled haemorrhage until mean arterial pressure decreased below 40 mmHg. In contrast, dP/dtmax-EDV increased significantly and exhibited a curvilinear response that was associated with a large inter- and intra-animal variability. In a model of acute preload reduction, PAdP/dtmax was found to be the best indicator of systolic LV function. Given its simplicity, this real-time index derived from single beat analysis should be tested further in clinical settings...|$|R
40|$|Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) is {{involved}} in blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in active multiple sclerosis (MS), while MMP- 2 seems {{to be associated with}} the chronic progressive phase of the disease. Recombinant interferon beta- 1 a (rIFNbeta- 1 a) is effective in restoring the BBB. We studied the relationships between serum MMP- 9, MMP- 2, TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 and different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of disease activity in MS patients during treatment with rIFNbeta- 1 a. Twenty-one relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients underwent longitudinally simultaneous <b>blood</b> <b>withdrawals</b> and MRI (before and after standard dose (SD) and triple dose (TD) of gadolinium (Gd)) examinations before and during 48 weeks of rIFNbeta- 1 a (Rebif 22 mcg three times a week) treatment. Serum MMP- 9, MMP- 2, TIMP- 1 and TIMP- 2 were measured, MMP- 9 to TIMP- 1 and MMP- 2 to TIMP- 2 ratios were calculated and the numbers of Gd-SD, Gd-TD, new-Gd-SD, new-Gd-TD and new-T 2 lesions counted. Serum MMP- 9 /TIMP- 1 ratio (P < 0. 0001), as well as the numbers of 'active' lesions (P ranging from 0. 0004 to 0. 005) decreased during treatment Moreover, serum MMP- 9 /TIMP- 1 ratio proved to be a good positive predictor (estimate = 0. 85; P < 0. 05) of the numbers of MRI Gd-TD active lesions. These data confirm that serum MMP- 9 /TMIP- 1 ratio may be viewed as a reliable marker and may be predictive of MRI activity in RR MS...|$|R
