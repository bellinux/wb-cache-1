25|$|Colliery pond {{was created}} when the National Coal Board {{constructed}} a concrete road to facilitate tipping. The road is concealed beneath {{the grass and}} acts as a dam. Water plants include water forget-me-not, <b>bogbean</b> and purple loosestrife. Large numbers of creatures are attracted to the pond, such as toads, moorhens, smooth newts, swan mussels plus varieties of damselfly and dragonfly.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the floods}} are less {{frequent}} the hardwoods themselves are absent, {{giving way to}} open country. The country is thus a prairie and, sometimes, this prairie finishes by transforming into bog. The vegetation of the prairies is characterized by calamagrostides blanchâtres, by purple moor grass, <b>bogbean,</b> yellow loosestrife, swamp cinquefoil, lesser spearwort, common marsh-bedstraw, kingcup, purple loosestrife and violettes, the last being an endangered species in the country. In the bogs, vegetation is poor, with mainly bog myrtle, bog-rosemary, common cottongrass and species of Carex. The soil is often covered in peat mosses and other mosses.|$|E

25|$|The pools {{provide a}} habitat {{for a wide}} range of {{emergent}} plants, of which the rarest is bog St John's-wort (Hypericum elodes), previously believed to have died out in Cheshire. The locally rare floating club rush (Eleogiton fluitans) has been recorded at the site. Other wetland species observed here include <b>bogbean</b> (Menyanthes trifoliata), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua), lesser celandine (Ranunculus ficaria), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle vulgaris), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre), marsh violet (Viola palustris), reedmace (Typha), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and wavy bittercress (Cardamine flexuosa).|$|E
25|$|Although High Scawdel stands east of {{the main}} summit, the high ground takes a great loop to the south around the head of Newlands Beck. It then drives north to the {{depression}} at Wilson's Bield (1,655ft) before climbing to the summit of High Spy. The rest of the North Western Fells bear no tarns worthy of the name, but Dale Head has two. On the northern slope near the source of Newlands Beck is Dalehead Tarn, while the smaller Launchy Tarn lies {{near the top of}} High Scawdel. Dalehead Tarn is a shallow pool providing a popular stopping place for walkers. Its varied flora include water horsetail, sedge and <b>bogbean.</b> Launchy Tarn is smaller and may have been formed by overgrazing and erosion of the underlying peat.|$|E

The fall of the leaf had brought with it rheumatism, ague, an many miseries. Cunning old leech-wives treated the French lady with tonics, mugwort, and <b>bogbean,</b> and good wine enow, But, like David of old, she got no heat; and before Yule-tide came, she had prayed herself safely out of this world, and into the world to come.

5000|$|The band {{is named}} after the Marcy Open grade school in Minneapolis, which is the {{alternative}} school John Wozniak attended. He chose the name because many of his songs were inspired by his childhood. Marcy Playground emerged in the late 1990s. Influences include David Bowie, Paul Simon, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, Nirvana, Wham! and the Beatles. The influences are quite clear on Marcy Playground's self-titled album, with songs like Shadow Of Seattle and Saint Joe On The School Bus. Frontman John Wozniak's first effort, Zog <b>BogBean</b> - From the Marcy Playground, was self-produced, recorded in his bedroom studio with some help from his then-girlfriend Sherry Fraser and her brother Scott in the early nineties. A limited run of CDs were self-released by Wozniak. [...] "Our Generation" [...] and [...] "Dog and His Master", two songs found on Wozniak's Zog <b>BogBean</b> project, would appear on later Marcy Playground albums. As of April 2009, Zog <b>BogBean</b> is available for download at Marcy Playground's official site {{as well as other}} outlets such as iTunes.|$|E

50|$|Black Tern Bog State Natural Area is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area {{featuring}} 20 acres (8 ha) of quaking sphagnum bog surrounding {{two small}} seepage lakes {{situated in a}} pitted outwash plain. The bog is rich in plant species, such as sundews, pitcher plant, <b>bogbean,</b> and bog rosemary, as well as three species of bog orchids: swamp pink, grass pink, and rose pogonia. The state-endangered bog rush (Juncus stygius) also grows here. Birds known to nest here include black tern, American bittern, killdeer, and mallards.|$|E
5000|$|Aside from {{influences}} such as Neil Young, Paul Simon, and Van Morrison, a major early {{influence in}} Woz's life was {{his high school}} girlfriend from tenth grade until his freshmen year in college, Sherry Fraser, now of the band Two Ton Boa. She collaborated with Wozniak on Zog <b>Bogbean,</b> and on the song [...] "Ancient Walls of Flowers" [...] from Marcy Playground's self-titled album. The song [...] "Sherry Fraser" [...] was written about her. They were known for being good friends throughout high school and would make movies or write together.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{perimeter}} of the island is a carr woodland - in part a quaking bog floating on the pond - supporting birch (Betula sp.) with a carpet of bog mosses including Sphagnum palustre and Sphagnum recurvum. On this are found cotton-grasses such as Eriophorum angustifolium and E. vaginatum, with marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris) and <b>bogbean</b> (Menyanthes trifoliata). The distinct stable central areas of the island supports Scot’s pine (Pinus sylvestris) and a ground flora of ling (Calluna vulgaris) and cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix).

50|$|Tamarack stands cast light {{shade and}} so {{usually have a}} dense {{undergrowth}} of shrubs and herbs.

Low shrubs include bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bog-rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), leather leaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), and small cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos).
