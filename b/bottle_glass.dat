5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing is {{important}} to the local community of Msambweni and is the primary source of income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002â€“2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make <b>bottle</b> <b>glass.</b> Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E
25|$|Abraham's Old Town or Pilaklikaha is a {{multicomponent}} site in Sumter County. The site {{includes a}} ceramic period occupation (Pasco and Sand-Tempered Plain) {{and possibly a}} preceramic component. The site's significance is its identification as Pilaklikaha, a town inhabited by Black Seminole Indians during the early 19th century. The collection includes lithics, ceramics (both European and Seminole), glass beads, trade pipe fragments, <b>bottle</b> <b>glass,</b> brick, cut nails and other metal fragments recovered during excavations from 1998-2001.|$|E

The central tailings dump associated with the mines along the Golden Gate reef, also now covers much of the former Golden Gate Township. Evidence of township habitation {{is located at the}} southern end of the Golden Gate Consols mine site. No extant structures survive but the remains of dwellings are found throughout the re-growth savannah woodland. These include earth floors, some stone footings, vertical sections of corrugated iron walls (possibly 'rat walls') set into the ground, and associated scatters of broken <b>bottle</b> <b>glass,</b> bricks, stove remains, sheet iron, tins and domestic ceramics. There are also some minor surface workings in and around the township site. There are further signs of habitation on the southern side of railway, connecting with the Golden Gate Cemetery.|$|E

500|$|The {{coal mines}} {{attracted}} glass manufacturer John Robert Lucas, who in 1788 established the Nailsea Glassworks {{that became the}} fourth-largest {{of its kind in}} the United Kingdom, mostly producing low-grade <b>bottle</b> <b>glass.</b> The works closed down in 1873, but [...] "Nailsea" [...] glass (mostly made by glass workers at the end of their shift in Nailsea and at other glass works) is still sought after by collectors around the world. The site of the glass works has been covered by a Tesco supermarket car park, leaving it relatively accessible for future archaeological digs. Other parts of the site have been cleared and filled with sand to ensure that the remains of the old glass works are preserved.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>bottles</b> and <b>glass</b> jars {{are in many}} {{households}} {{around the}} world. The first <b>glass</b> <b>bottles</b> were produced in south east Asia around 100 BCE, and in the Roman Empire around 1 AD.

The invention of the automatic <b>glass</b> <b>bottle</b> blowing machine in 1880 industrialized the process of making bottles.|$|R
60|$|The future {{traveller}} {{need not}} {{add to the}} fee of the authorized and numbered guide who took possession of us {{as soon as we}} got out of our basket and led us unresisting to a waiting bullock sled. He invited himself into it, and gave himself the best of characters in the autobiography into which he wove his scanty instruction concerning the objects we passed. A bullock sled is not of such blithe progress as a toboggan, but it is very comfortable, and it is of an Oriental and litter-like dignity, with its calico cushions and curtains. One could not well use it in New York, but it serves every purpose of a cab in Funchal, where we noted a peculiar feature of local commerce which I hesitate to specify, since it cast apparent discredit upon woman. It was, as I have noted, Sunday; but every shop where things pleasing or even useful to women were sold was wide open, and somewhat flaringly invited the custom of our fellow-passengers of that sex; but there was not a shop where such things as men's collars were for sale, or anything pleasing or useful to man, but was closed and locked fast. I must except from this sweeping statement the cafes, but these should not count, for women as well as men frequented them, as we ascertained by going to a very bowery one on the quay and ordering a bottle of the best and dryest Madeira. We wished perhaps to prove that it was really not bad for gout, or perhaps that it was no better than the Madeira you get in New York for the same price. Even with the help of friends, of the sex which could have been freely buying native laces, hats, fans, photographs, parasols, and tailor-made dresses, we could not finish that <b>bottle.</b> <b>Glass</b> after glass we bestowed on our smiling guide, with no final effect upon the bottle and none upon him, except to make him follow us to the tender and take an after-fee for showing us a way which we could not have missed blindfold. It was rather strange, but not stranger than the behavior of the captain of the tender, who, when he had collected our tickets, invited a free-will offering for collecting them, and mostly got it.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bottle,</b> <b>Glass,</b> Fork (otherwise {{known as}} Bouteille, Verre, et Fourchette) is a {{painting}} by Pablo Picasso (1881-1973). It was painted {{in the spring of}} 1912, {{at the height of the}} development of analytic Cubism. [...] <b>Bottle,</b> <b>Glass,</b> Fork is one of the best representations of the point in Picasso's career when his Cubist painting reached almost full abstraction. The analytic phase of Cubism was an original art movement developed by Picasso and his contemporary Georges Braque (1882-1963) and lasted from 1908-1912. [...] Like <b>Bottle,</b> <b>Glass,</b> Fork, the paintings of this movement are characterized by little use of color, and a complex, elegant composition of small, fragmented, tightly interwoven planes within an all-over composition of broader planes. While the figures in <b>Bottle,</b> <b>Glass,</b> Fork can be difficult to discern, the objects do emerge after careful study of the painting.|$|E

50|$|In 1927, {{increasing}} automation {{and sharp}} competition {{led to a}} majority share of the Jenaer Glaswerk Schott & Gen, which was finally acquired in 1929. The manufacturing of sheet glass in Zwiesel was abandoned in 1931 in favour of <b>bottle</b> <b>glass</b> production. At that time the plant employed about 450 persons in Zwiesel. During the 1930s glass production stagnated. Due to the scarcity of raw materials in World War II, <b>bottle</b> <b>glass</b> production was stopped altogether on 22 April 1944 and only war-important optical glass was produced.|$|E

50|$|Calvert Extra is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} Cocktail Whiskey because of its neutral spirit content. It is made from 70% grain neutral spirits and 30% straight whiskey.
