40|$|The spatial-wavenumber {{filtering}} {{technique is}} an effective approach to distinguish the propagating direction and wave mode of Lamb wave in spatial-wavenumber domain. Therefore, it has been gradually studied for damage evaluation in recent years. But for on-line impact monitoring in practical application, the main problem is how to realize the spatial-wavenumber filtering of impact signal when the wavenumber of high spatial resolution cannot be measured or the accurate wavenumber curve cannot be modeled. In this paper, a new model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter based impact imaging method is proposed. In this method, a 2 D cross-shaped array constructed by two linear piezoelectric (PZT) sensor arrays is used to acquire impact signal on-line. The continuous complex Shannon wavelet transform is adopted to extract the frequency narrowband signals from the frequency wideband impact response signals of the PZT sensors. A model-independent spatial-wavenumber filter is designed based on the spatial-wavenumber filtering technique. Based on the designed filter, a wavenumber searching and best match mechanism is proposed to implement the spatial-wavenumber filtering of the frequency narrowband signals without modeling, {{which can be used}} to obtain a wavenumber-time image of the impact relative to a linear PZT sensor array. By using the two wavenumber-time images of the 2 D cross-shaped array, the impact direction can be estimated without <b>blind</b> <b>angle.</b> The impact distance relative to the 2 D cross-shaped array can be calculated by using the difference of time-of-flight between the frequency narrowband signals of two different central frequencies and the corresponding group velocities.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods are frequently used for the analysis of heat transfer through DSF. However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding few key parameters, such as modelling strategies and the solar heat transmitted to the indoor space {{as a function of the}} <b>blind</b> tilt <b>angles</b> and positioning within the façade channel. In this paper we have investigated four modelling strategies and the influence of <b>blind</b> tilt <b>angle</b> and their proximity to the façade walls. The DSF system used in this investigation is equipped with venetian blinds and facades that absorb and reflect the incident solar radiation and transfer the direct solar heat gain into the building. A finite volume discretization method with the SIMPLE solution algorithm of the velocity-pressure coupling involving the low-turbulence k-ε model is used. A ray-traced solar model is coupled with long wave radiation model to solve the complete solar and radiation fields along with convection and conduction fields. On the modelling strategies, three dimensional domains were cast over three computational zones; external zone with solar radiation entering the outer skin of glass; buoyancy-driven air cavity zone with convection and transmitted solar radiation; and an internal zone. Also investigated is the thermal behaviour of the DSF due to the <b>blind</b> tilt <b>angles</b> (30 °, 45 °, 60 °, and 75 °) and its position from the facade walls (104 mm, 195 mm, 287 mm and 379 mm).

The heat gain due to direct solar radiation and convection through the facades to the internal space are presented. Comparative analysis of the four modelling strategies shows little variation of the results. The implication is a reduction in complexity and cost of modelling, since the additional effort requires in the CFD modelling is not justified by a significant improvement of the results. The variations of the <b>blinds</b> tilt <b>angles</b> as well as its proximity to façade walls significantly influences the convective flow within the façade cavity and the heat gains to the indoor space...|$|R

But for on-line damage monitoring of composite structure by using spatial-wavenumber filter, the problem is how to realize the spatial-wavenumber filtering of Lamb wave when the wavenumber response cannot be measured or modeled. This paper proposes a scanning spatial-wavenumber filter and piezoelectric sensor (referred to as PZT) 2 -D cruciform array based on-line damage imaging method of composite structure. In this method, a 2 -D cruciform array constructed by two linear PZT arrays is placed on composite structure permanently to acquire Lamb wave damage scattering signal on-line. For one linear PZT array, a scanning spatial-wavenumber filter which does not rely on any modeled or measured wavenumber response is designed to filter the damage scattering signal at a designed wavenumber bandwidth to give out a wavenumber-time image. Based on the image, the wavenumber of the damage scattering signal projecting at the array can be obtained. The same process can be also applied to the other linear PZT array to get the wavenumber projecting at that array direction. By combining with the two projection wavenumbers, the damage can be localized without <b>blind</b> <b>angle.</b> The method is validated on an aircraft composite oil tank of variable thickness. The validation results show that the damage direction estimation error is less than 2 ° and the damage distance estimation error is around 20  mm in the monitoring area of nearly 600  mm ×  300  mm.

40|$|Agent-based {{models have}} shown that local {{interactions}} between identical agents can, through self-organizational processes, give rise to patterns at a group level that resemble those in animal groups, such as mocking birds or schooling and milling fish. Flocking or schooling is achieved in most models by surrounding the individuals with behavioral (response) zones which induce the individual to avoid agents that are close-by, align with those at mid-range and are attracted to others that are further away. Previous models {{have shown that}} circular (2 D) and spherical (3 D) behavioral zones give rise to elongated schools. There are, however, physiological indications that circular or spherical behavioral zones do not accurately reflect the sensory capabilities of real fish. In addition, the width-height ratios of schools brought about by spherical behavioral zones do not suficiently resemble empirical measurements of real fish schools. The present study investigates the effects on school shape and structure of differently shaped behavioral zones in a model of schooling fish. It {{was found that the}} school shape in general adopts the shape of the behavioral zone and is additionally influenced by group size and density of the schools. School structure is expressed in terms of the position of the nearest neighbors with respect to the individuals. For stronger attraction the positions of the nearest neighbors are mainly determined by the individuals' <b>blind</b> <b>angle,</b> whereas for weaker attraction the nearest neighbors are most often found at position where the behavioral zones are smallest. Furthermore, this study explains how these spatial structures emerge through measurements of the direction and magnitude of the repulsion and attraction forces experienced by the individuals. This study is the first to show schools with realistic school structures, i. e. angles towards positions of the nearest neighbors, and school shapes that resemble empirical data in all three dimensions. The schools which most resemble those of real fish result from behavioral zones which extend less in the vertical direction. This might indicate that fish respond more to, or can more easily perceive, conspecifics swimming on the movement plane. ...|$|E

There are a few solutions to this problem that involve the use of image sensors for avoiding collisions [15], but these methods are not always effective at <b>blind</b> <b>angles.</b> As previously mentioned, the end-effector of a whole-body tactile sensing system is composed of a soft material, except for the force sensor.

It is unknown whether a system with a soft material can provide good performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a whole-body tactile sensing system using a force sensor with soft material in contact areas. Since an error produced by a deformation of the material is the main issue, this paper presents a method of compensating for soft material deformation.

The 2 D modelling work investigates the coupled convective, conductive and radiative heat transfer through the DSF system.

It is thought that discrepancies in the results are caused by the simplification of the CFD model resulting in less turbulence mixing within the facade cavity.

Kerry later wrestled against Mark Calaway, who {{was known}} as The Punisher at that time, while Embry {{was involved in a}} <b>blinding</b> <b>angle</b> (similar to the angle used with Chris Adams nearly four years before) involving a white bottle (which may have been Freebird Hair Cream) which Travis used against Embry to blind him. In fact, Billy Travis became the Sportatorium's biggest heel wrestler who would often sing a line of various songs during ringside interviews, heckle the crowd, and on several occasions smash a wooden guitar over the head of several wrestlers. One notable such incident occurred in October 1989 when he cold-cocked Percy Pringle with a guitar during an interview, then claimed that the guitar was given to him by Mick Jagger. During one incident, Travis spanked Toni Adams {{in the center of the}} ring at the Sportatorium, with Chris handcuffed on the ring rope; and in another infamous incident, Travis cold-cocked Adams with a coke bottle over his head, prompting announcer Marc Lowrance to announce that Adams may be dead. Chris only received a minor cut on his scalp and returned to wrestle the following day, even disguising himself as another wrestler to gain revenge against Travis.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In {{last few}} decades medical science has seen {{resurgence}} of minimally invasive surgery by development of endoscopes with adequate illumination, magnification and image quality. Although operating microscope made a significant advance in ear surgery {{but it has a}} drawback of unobservable <b>blind</b> <b>angles</b> in cavities of middle ear. Objective To demonstrate the effectiveness otoendoscope along with operating microscope in tympanomastoid surgeries. Materials and methods In this prospective study conducted between January 2012 to January 2014, a total of 67 ears with chronic otitis media of mucosal and/or squamosal disease were operated. Twenty eight were operated using canal wall up (CWU) technique, 26 underwent canal wall down (CWD) surgery, 13 cases had tympanoplasty with endoscopic disease clearance. Intraoperative Otoendoscopic evaluation for disease clearance was done in all cases. Results Out of 28 CWU mastoidectomy, 21 cases had disease medial to incus & aditus, that was cleared completely with otoendoscopic assistance. Rest Seven cases had disease limited to attic & they underwent also had otoendoscopic disease clearance. Twenty six patients underwent CWD procedure with intraoperative otoendoscopic evaluation & clearance of residual disease. Thirteen cases undergoing tympanoplasty, which harboured disease in the middle ear also underwent cleared endoscopic clearance. We followed up all patients for at least 6 months and no recurrence has been detected. Conclusion Otoendoscope provides a panoramic view of middle ear cavity and endoscopic ear surgery preserves much of normal anatomy as possible by minimizing unnecessary dissection of bone & soft tissue. In addition there is more chances of ossicular preservation without jeopardizing disease clearance, hence it should be added to surgical armamentarium for better disease clearance and superior surgical outcome...|$|R
2500|$|Though the <b>blind</b> Sandman <b>angle</b> was {{his first}} [...] "major" [...] feud in ECW, his later, years-long feud against Raven that started in January 1995 is arguably his most memorable. The two were portrayed as {{childhood}} friends who had been competing in different ways their entire lives. Raven's entrance into ECW had him accompanied by Beulah McGillicutty, an overweight girl from their kayfabe childhood who {{had a crush on}} Dreamer and was now a Penthouse Pet. Dreamer and Raven (and Raven's Nest) feuded for two years with Dreamer never getting a win over Raven until Raven's last match in ECW, a Loser Leaves Town match at Wrestlepalooza 1997. During the course of the feud, Beulah had left Raven and was Tommy's valet.|$|R
