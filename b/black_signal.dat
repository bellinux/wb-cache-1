50|$|Iris hermona (Golan Iris) is {{a species}} in the genus Iris, it {{is also in the}} {{subgenus}} of Iris, and in the Oncocyclus section. It is a rhizomatous perennial, from the pastures and meadows of the Golan Heights in Israel and Syria. It has linear, upright leaves, tall slender stem holding a bi-coloured flower, having a pale lilac, cream-yellow, light tan, or white background, which is then covered in purple brown, or purple, or purple-pink veining, spots or speckling. It has a round purple-brown or almost <b>black</b> <b>signal</b> patch, and a sparse purple brown or almost black beard. It is rarely cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, as it needs very dry conditions during the summer.|$|E

50|$|Like other irises, it has 2 {{pairs of}} petals, 3 sepals (outer petals), {{known as the}} 'falls' and 3 inner petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The darker veined, scallop shell shaped, falls are deflexed (bending over to an almost flat position), and up to 6 - 8 cm long. {{in the center of}} the falls, is a velvet-like, dark, brown to purple, or <b>black</b> <b>signal</b> patch. Also, in the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are brown to purple. Also over the falls, the iris has a deflexed style {{branches}} that almost covers the signal spot. The almost vertical, and larger standards, are creamy, or white, with pale, or thin violet veins.

50|$|Like other irises, it has 2 {{pairs of}} petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), {{known as the}} 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are oblong, or pointed, and {{lanceolate}} shaped, and can be 4 - 7 cm long, and 2.5 cm wide. They have a single dark purple, dark purple-brown, or <b>black</b> <b>signal</b> patch in {{the centre of the}} falls. In the middle of the falls, it also has a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which are yellow tipped with brown, dark brown, black. or dark purple. The upright standards are obovate to oblanceolate, up to 5 - 8 cm long and up to 4 cm wide. They can have a slight beard on the claw (the part of the petal closest to the stem). But both falls and standards can be variable (in the wild), in shade, and also the position of the falls can vary, between horizontal and reflexed. It has style branch that is short, and chocolate brown coloured. It has yellow, brown-purple, or brown anthers, and dirty yellow pollen. The perianth tube can be to 4 - 7 cm long.|$|E
5000|$|A Frame Synchronizer {{is used in}} television/video {{production}} to synchronize the timing of a video source signal to coincide with a central timing reference (usually a color <b>black</b> <b>signal</b> aka [...] "black burst" [...] that is distributed throughout a facility). The synchronizer accomplishes this by (first digitizing in an analog scenario and) writing the incoming digital video into a frame buffer memory using {{the timing of the}} sync information contained in that video signal. Simultaneously the digital video is being read back out of the buffer by an independent timing system that is [...] "genlocked" [...] to the house timing reference. As a result, the timing or alignment of the video frame can be adjusted so that the start of the upper left corner scan line of the image occurs simultaneously on all video equipment in the work flow. This is an absolute requirement for both analog and digital systems in order to perform video effects or glitch-free source switching. Note that frame synchronization can only be performed within a given television line standard. A synchronizer will not convert an NTSC signal to a PAL signal or vice versa; it takes a Video Standards Converter to do that.|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{analytical}} methods enabling {{the determination of}} diverse targets are essential {{in a number of}} research areas, from clinical diagnostics to feed and food quality and safety. Herein, the development of a quantitative immunochromatographic assay for the detection of the synthetic phytoregulator forchlorfenuron (CPPU) is described. The competitive lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) was based on the immobilization onto a nitrocellulose membrane of an ovalbumin–CPPU conjugate (test line) and on the use of an immunodetection ligand consisting of carbon nanoparticles labeled with an anti-CPPU monoclonal antibody through interaction with a secondary antibody. The presence of CPPU in horticultural samples was visually interpreted by the decrease in the <b>black</b> <b>signal</b> intensity of the test line, according to the competitive character of the format. The quantitative determination of the analyte was easily performed by a two-step procedure consisting of flatbed scanning of the strips followed by computer-based image analysis of the pixel gray volumes of the test lines. Under optimized conditions, the immunochromatographic test afforded a limit of quantification in buffer of 89 ng/L. The accuracy of the strip test was assessed by the analysis of fruit samples with incurred residues, and the obtained results were compared with those derived from two reference methods, ELISA and HPLC. The LOQ of the CPPU-specific LFIA in kiwifruits and grapes was established at 33. 4 µg/kg. The excellent analytical performance of the developed strip test demonstrates the potential of immunochromatographic assays for the quantitative monitoring of small organic molecules in complex matrices...|$|E

40|$|LI SILVER ™ is a convenient, light-insensitive silver {{enhancement}} {{system for}} use with NANOGOLD ® reagents, which {{may be used for}} EM or light microscopy or to visualize NANOGOLD ® on blots. LI SILVER consists of 125 mL ready-to-use enhancer and 125 mL ready-to-use initiator; the reagent is formed by combining equal volumes of these solutions. The mixture is usable only for a defined time period, as given below, and should therefore be prepared immediately before use. LI SILVER is nucleated quickly by NANOGOLD ® particles, resulting in the precipitation of metallic silver and the formation of a dark brown to <b>black</b> <b>signal.</b> The system has markedly delayed self-nucleation resulting in high contrast and very low background and non-specific staining. Silver enhancement is time-dependent: for the first time period the reaction is highly specific for gold particles. NANOGOLD™ particles will nucleate the deposition of dense silver particles which will enlarge rapidly in this period. The rate of growth of these particles will decline with time as their surface area increases. The enhancement time is the time required to obtain an adequate amplification of the NANOGOLD ® signal without background staining. After a certain time beyond the enhancement time, silver may be precipitated spontaneously by self-nucleation, producing background signal. This time period varies with temperature. At 16 °C the developer solution is stable (no self-nucleation occurs) for at least 45 minutes; at 20 °C, the solution is stable for at least 40 minutes, and at 24 °C for at least 35 minutes. After this time, background staining may be observed. For applications where a very high degree of enhancement is to be combined with low background staining, enhancement may be repeated with a fresh portion of the enhancement mixture: development will continue but self-nucleation will be very low sinc...|$|E

The system consists of 15 ml initiator, 15 ml moderator, and 15 ml activator; the reagent is formed by combining equal volumes of the moderator, initiator, and then the activator solutions.
