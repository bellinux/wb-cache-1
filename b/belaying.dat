5|$|Despite limited {{information}} about its service routes and construction, the Nathan F. Cobb {{was the subject}} of two separate New York Times articles during its short career. One article reported the wreck the day after it occurred, the other article came from 20 June 1892 and chronicled a disturbance between mates. The Cobb was still in tow only three miles outside Mobile Bay, beginning its route from Mobile, Alabama to New York, when mate Henry Shaffer jumped over board to avoid a beating. Another mate, J. Trott had already used a <b>belaying</b> pin to half kill another seaman on the schooner and Shaffer was fearful for his life. Shaffer began swimming towards a nearby light house and was picked up nearly five miles from where he jumped over board. The captain of the towboat reported that Captain Cookson of the Cobb, mentioned incidentally they had lost a crewman. Both Cookson and Trott already had pending charges against them for cruelty and marooning of sailors, stemming from an incident in May 1891 at Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|A mass fall {{occurred}} as the climbers began the traverse. George Bell slipped {{and fell on}} a patch of hard ice, pulling off his rope-mate Tony Streather. As they fell their rope became tangled with those connecting Houston, Bates, Gilkey and Molenaar, pulling all these climbers off as well. Finally the strain came onto Pete Schoening, who had been <b>belaying</b> Gilkey and Molenaar. Quickly wrapping the rope around his shoulders and ice axe, Schoening held all six climbers, some of whom had by that point fallen over 100m. Had he not done so, the entire team, apart from Craig who was unroped, would have fallen around 2000m to the Godwin-Austen Glacier.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "seconding," [...] or <b>belaying</b> a climber {{from the top}} of a route, {{bringing}} them up to walk off or continue on to next pitch. A similarly safe system of climbing a route, except the belayer has set the anchors {{at the top of the}} climb (normally after leading a route) to belay the climber either indirectly (belayer is part of the system and can be vulnerable when exposed to unexpected directions of pull and loading of the rope) or directly (belayer is not part of the system and <b>belaying</b> is done directly from the anchors using either an Italian / Munter Hitch or adapted use of a belay device), up the route from the top. If bolts have been clipped or traditional gear placements have been made, it is the job of the climber to collect and clean the route.|$|E
50|$|In this {{climbing}} technique, either running <b>belays</b> or fixed <b>belays</b> are used. A running <b>belay</b> on ice {{is similar}} to a running <b>belay</b> on rock as well as snow. The leader of the climb puts protection and clips the rope through it. The next climber puts away the protection. There should be at least two points of protection between the leader and the next climber. Fixed <b>belays,</b> on the other hand, require a belayer, <b>belay</b> anchor, and points of protection. A <b>belay</b> anchor is attached to a cliff in supporting a <b>belay</b> or toprope. In using either a running- or fixed <b>belay,</b> it is necessary that you have enough knowledge on boot/ice-screw <b>belay</b> techniques.|$|R
50|$|Passive <b>belay</b> devices {{rely on the}} belayer's brake {{hand and}} a {{carabiner}} to lock off the rope. Sticht plates and the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) line of <b>belay</b> devices by Black Diamond Equipment are examples of passive <b>belay</b> devices. If a <b>belay</b> device is lost or damaged, a Munter hitch on a carabiner {{can be used as}} an improvised passive <b>belay</b> device.|$|R

2500|$|... "Gordon {{had it in}} {{his mind}} {{to set the record}} with this voyage around the Horn and was driving his new crew hard, and soon had a mutiny with [...] "all hands refusing duty." [...] <b>Belaying</b> pins and hand spikes were soon flying, and the Memnon was forced to put into Montevideo, where Gordon {{discharged}} the troublemakers. He took on a new crew before proceeding on the Memnon's [...] record breaking voyage of 123 sailing days from Sandy Hook, arriving in San Francisco Bay on August 28, 1849." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Davis {{started working}} on Freerider (5.12d), a 38-pitch climb on El Capitan. Her aim was to free climb the route. In {{order to be able}} to achieve this in one climb, she had to know the route through and through, so she practiced it extensively. Two to three times a week, she would hike 10 miles to the summit, rope solo [...] to the lower parts of the route and climb up alone. Potter belayed her, during her actual attempt in April 2004. After a grueling four-day climb, she became the first woman to free climb the route. In May, with Heinz Zak <b>belaying</b> her, she became the second woman, after Lynn Hill, to free climb El Capitan in a day.|$|E
2500|$|Commonly {{known as}} [...] "Top Roping": <b>belaying</b> a climber {{from the ground}} or {{the base of the}} route. A belay system {{resembling}} a pulley in which an anchor has been created {{at the top of a}} climb, through which the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground (position before starting the climb). The rope is [...] "taken-in", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so in the event of a fall, the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the weight of the climber compared to that of the belayer, among other things.|$|E
5000|$|Munter hitch is {{commonly}} used to <b>belay</b> without a <b>belay</b> device ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>belay</b> system {{incorporating}} the Munter Hitch {{is the same}} as any other <b>belay</b> system, which incorporates a belayer to tend the rope and an anchor, which secures the <b>belay</b> system and belayer.|$|R
50|$|If {{the leader}} falls, the belayer must arrest the rope {{to stop the}} fall. To achieve this the rope is run through a <b>belay</b> device {{attached}} to the belayer's harness. The <b>belay</b> device runs the rope {{through a series of}} sharp curves that, when operated properly, greatly increases friction and stops the rope from running. Some of the more popular types of <b>belay</b> devices are the ATC <b>Belay</b> Device, the Figure 8 and various auto-locking <b>belay</b> devices such as the Petzl Gri-Gri.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{answered}} Larry, {{and ran off}} to get a pair of handcuffs while Tom Grandon stationed himself beside Ostag Semmel, <b>belaying</b> pin in hand.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he {{advanced}} upon me. I {{saw that he}} had a large wooden <b>belaying</b> pin in his hand, and I retreated as far as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] was the reply, {{and then}} all of the [...] "boys {{procured}} <b>belaying</b> pins or whatever was handy, with which to ward off a possible attack.|$|E

50|$|The Australian <b>belay</b> {{is used on}} {{many high}} ropes courses for {{supporting}} participants on vertical, as opposed to traversing, elements. The Australian <b>belay</b> allows untrained participants {{to engage in the}} safety and support of their fellow participants on an element, and allows a single facilitator to oversee an element with multiple individuals participating. The Australian <b>belay</b> does not use a traditional <b>belay</b> device, but rather ties two or more people into loops on the working end of the rope as a <b>belay</b> team, who walk backward as the participant ascends the element, taking up slack as they go. Additional participants can be tied into the loops or left free to help hold clipped in members of the <b>belay</b> team in place. The Australian <b>belay</b> requires a clear runway back from the element almost double the height of the element in order to allow the <b>belay</b> team to support climbers {{all the way to the}} top.|$|R
50|$|A Reverso {{can be used}} to <b>belay</b> the leader, one or two seconds, or as a {{descender}} during rappelling. It {{can also}} be used in self-braking mode, to <b>belay</b> one or two seconds, if attached directly to the <b>belay.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Very well, Kanaka,” {{says the}} boatswain. “I will try; {{but if you}} are having your fun out of me, I will take my fun out of you with a <b>belaying</b> pin.” ...|$|E
60|$|A {{moment later}} a heavy <b>belaying</b> pin {{fell on the}} head, and it disappeared. Then {{there was a loud}} {{explosion}} as an arquebus was fired, the bullet crashing through the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I go," [...] {{answered}} Semmel, with a toss of his head, and he slouched {{toward the}} stern. His manner was so aggressive that Larry {{picked up a}} <b>belaying</b> pin before following him.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{traditional}} <b>belay</b> is the Body <b>Belay</b> or the Hip <b>Belay,</b> where the rope is {{wrapped around the}} body to provide enough friction to catch a climber. This is often used in Alpine climbing where efficiency is important.|$|R
50|$|A running <b>belay</b> anchor {{is used as}} a {{safeguard}} in {{the event}} of a fall while lead climbing. The leader and follower climb simultaneously with protection placed in between. When the two climbers advance using a running <b>belay,</b> the <b>belay</b> is almost as secure as using a <b>belay</b> device and anchors because if the leader falls, all the slack is already out of the rope and the follower acts as a counterweight to catch the fall. A running <b>belay</b> {{is used as a}} faster alternative to pitch climbing when the risk, consequences, and likelihood of a leader fall are deemed to be acceptable.|$|R
50|$|Multi-pitch {{climbing}} is {{the ascent}} of climbing routes {{with one or}} more stops at a <b>belay</b> station. Each section of actual climbing between stops at the <b>belay</b> stations is called a pitch. The leader ascends the pitch, placing gear and stopping to anchor themselves to the <b>belay</b> station.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I sees somethin' movin' on the wather," [...] exclaimed Mrs Lynch, who, {{during the}} occurrences just described, had {{held on to}} a <b>belaying</b> pin with the {{tenacity}} and strength of an octopus.|$|E
60|$|And {{the mate}} cursed him, and swore that Kanaka was for no {{use in the}} world, and if he got started after him with a <b>belaying</b> pin, {{it would be a}} cold day for Keola.|$|E
60|$|One watch was below, {{the men of}} {{the other}} were for the most part {{gathered}} aft, and lashed to <b>belaying</b> pins. Fairclough was standing near the wheel. With some difficulty, Harry made his way to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on! avast! <b>belay!</b> I'm thinkin'!" [...] said Sam. The boy {{accordingly}} held on, avasted, and <b>belayed</b> {{until his}} companion {{had thought it}} out.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{invention}} of <b>belay</b> devices, belayers could add friction to the rope by wrapping it around their body; friction between rope and the belayer's body was used to arrest a fall. This {{is known as a}} body <b>belay,</b> a hip <b>belay,</b> or a waist <b>belay</b> and is still sometimes used when climbing quickly over easier ground. On vertical rock it is no longer used as it is less reliable and more apt to injure the belayer stopping a long fall.|$|R
50|$|A <b>belay</b> {{device is}} a piece of {{climbing}} equipment that improves <b>belay</b> safety for the climber by allowing the belayer to manage his or her duties with minimal physical effort. <b>Belay</b> devices are designed to allow a weak person to easily arrest a climber's fall with maximum control, while avoiding twisting, heating or severely bending the rope.|$|R
60|$|The old man settled {{it that he}} and Jerry should arm {{themselves}} with <b>belaying</b> pins, and the two muskets he brought back from Benedict, together with our old fowling-piece, was distributed among the rest of us.|$|E
60|$|The two men {{had their}} hands tied behind them, {{but it was an}} easy matter for Larry to {{liberate}} them. Then each provided himself with a <b>belaying</b> pin, and all three of the party stole to the deck.|$|E
60|$|He got no further, {{for raising}} his <b>belaying</b> pin, Vincent brought {{it down on}} the mutineer's head. Groot had been the one to lame the boatswain's back and the latter had not {{forgotten}} it. Over went the fellow and sank down as if dead.|$|E
50|$|Climbers {{now almost}} {{exclusively}} use a <b>belay</b> device to achieve controllable rope friction. Before {{the invention of}} these devices, climbers used other <b>belay</b> methods, which are still useful in emergencies.|$|R
50|$|The name <b>Belay</b> is {{also part}} of Ethiopian history, <b>Belay</b> Zelleke was born in 1896 in the Wollo {{province}} of Ethiopia to a mother of Wollo Borena and to a father of Gojam Berenta origins. In 1935 Italy invaded Ethiopia. Like the many patriotic Ethiopians, <b>Belay</b> Zeleke felt the need to defend his country and led an insurgency movement against the occupation in Gojam.|$|R
5000|$|The Ethiopian Yellow Pages (የኢትዮጵያ የሎው ፔጅስ) is {{published}} in Alexandria, Virginia, and {{the headquarters of}} the publication is in Shaw, Washington, D.C. It has over 1,000 pages of content. As of 2011 Yeshimebeth T. [...] "Mama Tutu" [...] <b>Belay</b> is the publisher and her husband Yehunie <b>Belay</b> assists her.
