5|$|Andros {{appears in}} several episodes of The Witch of Blackbird Pond, where his {{conflict}} with the Connecticut colonists forms the <b>background</b> <b>to</b> the protagonist's more personal problems. It is believed that Andros Island in the Bahamas was named for him. Early proprietors of the Bahamas included members of his first wife's family, the Cravens.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable <b>background</b> <b>to</b> compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Modern {{period of}} Swiss history, the growing {{authoritarianism}} of the patriciate families {{combined with a}} financial crisis {{in the wake of}} the Thirty Years' War led to the Swiss peasant war of 1653. In the <b>background</b> <b>to</b> this struggle, the conflict between Catholic and Protestant cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the First War of Villmergen, in 1656, and the Toggenburg War (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.|$|E

5|$|Fleming also {{travelled}} to Los Angeles with Cuneo, {{visiting the}} Los Angeles Police Intelligence headquarters, where they met Captain James Hamilton, who provided Fleming {{with information on}} the Mafia organisation in the US. From Los Angeles Fleming travelled to Las Vegas, where he stayed at the Sands Hotel; he interviewed the hotel owner, Jack Entratter, where he learnt the <b>background</b> <b>to</b> the security systems and methods of cheating that he used in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Fleming had a long-held {{interest}} in pirates, from the novels he {{read as a}} child, through to films such as Captain Blood (1935) with Errol Flynn, which he enjoyed watching. From his Goldeneye home on Jamaica's northern shore, Fleming had visited Port Royal on {{the south of the}} island, which was once the home port of Sir Henry Morgan, all of which stimulated Fleming's interest. For the <b>background</b> <b>to</b> Mr Big's treasure island, Fleming appropriated the details of Cabritta Island in Port Maria Bay, which was the true location of Morgan's hoard.|$|E
5|$|Higson {{stated that}} he was {{instructed}} by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond, except the original Fleming version. As the <b>background</b> <b>to</b> Bond's childhood, Higson used Bond's obituary in You Only Live Twice {{as well as his}} own and Fleming's childhoods. In forming the early Bond character, Higson created the origins of some of Bond's character traits, including his love of cars and fine wine.|$|E

5|$|In Britain, the women's {{movement}} was {{allied with the}} Labour party. In the U.S., Betty Friedan emerged from a radical <b>background</b> <b>to</b> take leadership. Radical Women is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active. During the Spanish Civil War, Dolores Ibárruri (La Pasionaria) led the Communist Party of Spain. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting {{on the front and}} clashed with the anarcha-feminist Mujeres Libres.|$|E
5|$|In {{towns and}} central country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion {{made possible by}} sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But {{the main reason for}} the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a <b>background</b> <b>to</b> details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.|$|E
5|$|It's a touching, believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} class {{can take advantage of}} another, even in the guise of patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor <b>background</b> <b>to</b> the stately rituals and autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E

The soundtrack is a combination of Latin jazz, New Orleans jazz and blues, which serve as <b>background</b> <b>to</b> the storyline as it moves through Miami, New Orleans and Austin, respectively. The film's music was chosen by music supervisor Mathieu Schreyer, while the incidental music was scored by Lyle Workman.|$|E
5|$|Power had {{suffered}} from clinical depression since childhood and confided her fugitive status to her therapist Linda Carroll. She developed {{the desire to}} stop living her life under her assumed name and, through therapy that included participation in the mock trial of a soldier charged with killing civilians during the Vietnam War, she began to prepare for her surrender to the authorities. This included her decision to marry Duncan in 1992 and reveal her <b>background</b> <b>to</b> her friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the flag was {{completed}} in two months by a committee headed by Toh. He initially wanted the flag's entire <b>background</b> <b>to</b> be red, but the Cabinet decided against this, as red {{was regarded as a}} rallying point for communism. According to an account given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese population wanted five stars, which were modeled off the flag of the People's Republic of China and the Muslim population wanted a crescent moon. Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.|$|E
