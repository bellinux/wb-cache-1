40|$|SummaryThe DNA {{repair enzyme}} {{endonuclease}} V (EndoV) recognizes and cleaves DNA at deaminated adenine lesions (hypoxanthine). In addition, EndoV cleaves DNA containing various helical distortions such as loops, hairpins, and flaps. To understand the molecular basis of EndoV’s {{ability to recognize}} and incise DNA structures with helical distortions, we solved the crystal structure of Thermotoga maritima EndoV in complex with DNA containing a one-nucleotide loop. The structure shows that a strand-separating wedge is crucial for DNA loop recognition, with DNA strands separated precisely at the helical distortion. The additional nucleotide forming the loop rests {{on the surface of}} the wedge, while the normal adenine opposite the loop is flipped into a base recognition pocket. Our data show a different principle for DNA loop recognition and cleavage by EndoV, in which a coordinated action of a DNA-intercalating wedge and a <b>base</b> <b>pocket</b> accommodating a flipped normal base facilitate strand incision...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{biochemical}} and structural {{characterization of the}} purine-specific ribonucleoside hydrolase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsIAG-NH). SsIAG-NH is a homodimer of 70 kDa specific for adenosine, guanosine and inosine. SsIAG-NH is highly thermophilic and is characterized by extreme thermodynamic stability (Tm, 107 °C), kinetic stability and remarkable resistance to guanidinium chloride-induced unfolding. A disulfide bond that, {{on the basis of}} SDS-PAGE is positioned intersubunits, {{plays an important role in}} thermal stability. SsIAG-NH shares 43 % sequence identity with the homologous pyrimidine-specific nucleoside hydrolase from S. solfataricus (SsCU-NH). The comparative sequence alignment of SsIAG-NH, SsCU-NH, purine non-specific nucleoside hydrolase from Crithidia fasciculata and purine-specific nucleoside hydrolase from Trypanosoma vivax shows that, only few changes in the <b>base</b> <b>pocket</b> are responsible for different substrate specificity of two S. solfataricus enzymes. The structure of SsIAG-NH predicted by homology modeling allows us to infer the role of specific residues in substrate specificity and thermostability...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe synthesis, spectroscopic and {{structural}} characterization, electrochemical properties and theoretical studies {{of a series}} of eight robust neutral Nickel(II) and Copper(II) complexes (4 - 11) supported by unsymmetrically-substituted N 2 O 2 -tetradentate Schiff base ligands are reported. The M(salophen) -type compounds are substituted by either a pair of donor (anisyl, ferrocenyl, methoxy) or acceptor (fluoro, nitro) groups, forming D-pi-D and A-pi-A systems, respectively. The compounds were prepared in good yields by condensation of the free amino group of the desired ONN-tridentate half-unit with the appropriate substituted salicylaldehyde in the presence of hydrated Nickel(II) or Copper(II) acetate salts. They were characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV-vis, and for diamagnetic species by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and cyclic voltammetry. The crystal structures of one Ni(II) (4) and four Cu(II) complexes (5, 7, 9 and 11) revealed a four-coordinate square-planar environment for the nickel and copper metal ions, with two nitrogen and two oxygen atoms as donors. In 4, 5, 7 and 9, the crystallization solvent interacts through hydrogen bonding with the phenolato oxygen atoms of the Schiff <b>base</b> <b>pocket,</b> while 11 packs as centrosymmetric dimers with an apical CuAO short contact interaction (2. 63 angstrom). the cyclovoltammograms of the nickel complexes present an irreversible monoelectronic Ni(II) /Ni(I) reduction wave while those of their copper counterparts exhibit a reversible or quasi-reversible one-electron Cu(II) /Cu(I) redox process. The electronic structures of the eight complexes were analyzed by DFT and TD-DFT calculations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{have studied}} the superconducting state of 2 H−NbSe 2 by {{scanning}} tunneling spectroscopy along two different crystal orientations, the c and the a/b axes. Along the c axis a large gap is dominant in the spectra, while a smaller gap is measured along the a/b axis. We show that these spectra are accurately described by the McMillan model where the small gap is induced through the coupling to the band associated with the large gap. In order to assign the small and large gaps to specific parts of the 2 H−NbSe 2 Fermi surface, the electronic structure was studied using first-principles calculations. While we cannot exclude the possibility of intrinsic anisotropy of the gaps, we propose that the large gap opens in the Fermi surface cylinders located around the corner K points while the sheets located around Γ {{are associated with the}} small gap. An additional component of the Fermi surface, a selenium <b>based</b> <b>pocket,</b> plays an essential role in the tunneling process. The role of the charge density wave occurring in this material is also discussed. Finally, we are able to give a coherent description of the observed characteristics of the tunneling spectra of 2 H−NbSe 2 as well as the differences with 2 H−NbS 2 where no charge density wave state is present. Further experimental work, such as high-resolution ARPES, would be very useful to confirm our interpretation. The approach and modeling developed here could also be relevant for other compounds of the dichalcogenide family...|$|R

50|$|Inspired by enzymes {{with deep}} active site pocket, List and {{coworkers}} designed and constructed {{a set of}} confined Bronsted acids with an extremely sterically demanding chiral <b>pocket</b> <b>based</b> on a C2-symmetric bis(binapthyl) imidodiphosphoric acid.

40|$|The EcoRV DNA-(adenine-N 6) -methyltransferase (M. EcoRV) {{specifically}} modifies {{the first}} adenine residue within GATATC sequences. During catalysis, the enzyme flips its target base {{out of the}} DNA helix and binds it into a target <b>base</b> binding <b>pocket</b> which is formed in part by Lys 16 and Tyr 196. A cytosine residue is accepted by wild-type M. EcoRV as a substrate at a 31 -fold reduced efficiency {{with respect to the}} kcat/KM values if it is located in a CT mismatch substrate (GCTATC/GATATC). Cytosine residues positioned in a CG base pair (GCTATC/GATAGC) are modified at much more reduced rates, because flipping out the target base is much more difficult in this case. We intended to change the target base specificity of M. EcoRV from adenine-N 6 to cytosine-N 4. To this end we generated, purified and characterized 15 variants of the enzyme, containing single, double and triple amino acid exchanges following different design approaches. One concept was {{to reduce the size of}} the target <b>base</b> binding <b>pocket</b> by site-directed mutagenesis. The K 16 R variant showed an altered specificity, with a 22 -fold preference for cytosine as the target base in a mismatch substrate. This corresponds to a 680 -fold change in specificity, which was accompanied by only a small loss in catalytic activity with the cytosine substrate. The K 16 R/Y 196 W variant no longer methylated adenine residues at all and its activity towards cytosine was reduced only 17 -fold. Therefore, we have changed the target base specificity of M. EcoRV from adenine to cytosine by rational protein design. Because there are no natural paragons for the variants described here, a change of the target base specificity of a DNA interacting enzyme was possible by rational de novo design of its active site...|$|R
