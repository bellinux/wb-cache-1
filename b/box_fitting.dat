40|$|Detection of {{vehicles}} in crowded 3 -D urban scenes is a challenging problem in many computer vision related research fields, such as robot perception, autonomous driving, self-localization, and mapping. In this paper {{we present a}} model-based approach to solve the recognition problem from 3 -D range data. In particular, we aim to detect and recognize vehicles from continuously streamed LIDAR point cloud sequences of a rotating multi-beam laser scanner. The end-to-end pipeline of our framework working on the raw streams of 3 -D urban laser data consists of three steps 1) producing distinct groups of points which represent different urban objects 2) extracting reliable 3 -D shape descriptors specifically designed for vehicles, considering the need for fast processing speed 3) executing binary classification on the extracted descriptors in order to perform vehicle detection. The extraction of our efficient shape descriptors provides a significant speedup with and increased detection accuracy compared to a PCA based 3 -D bounding <b>box</b> <b>fitting</b> method used as baseline...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the {{necessary}} methods {{to perform a}} transit search for extrasolar planets. We apply these methods to search for planets {{in one of the}} fields of the LAIWO project: the Cygnus-Lyra field (Laiwo VI). We describe the problems that systematic effects can introduce for precise relative photometry at the millimagnitude level (~ 3 mmag). Ways to minimize and quantify this correlated noise are also described. We test the weaknesses and strenghts of two transit detection algorithms (TDA) namely the <b>Box</b> <b>fitting</b> algorithm (BLS) and the TRUFAS algorithm using archive data from the OGLE project and simulations of {{the first year of the}} Pan-Planets survey. These projects are similar in terms of telescope size and field of view to the LAIWO survey. We have found that the main limitations of the BLS algorithm are the transit depth and correlated noise (Red Noise). The TRUFAS detection efficiency correlates with the number of points in transit and the number of transits present in the light curve, and, its detection efficiency is low (less than ~ 50 %) for these type of ground-based observations. Finally, we create from the LAIWO data light curves which are suitable to detect planets among the stars brighter than R = 16. 5 mag. We have found 31 eclipsing binaries and 18 light curves that have transits consistent with a planet. Of these detections, 3 eclipsing binaries and 8 planet candidates were independently found by the KEPLER survey. Of the 10 newly discovered transiting planets, 3 are promising to justify follow-up confirmation studies, which are always necessary to probe the planetary nature of a transiting companion...|$|E
40|$|Urban reconstruction, with an {{emphasis}} on man-made structure modeling, is an active research area with broad impact on several potential applications. Urban reconstruction combines photogrammetry, remote sensing, computer vision, and computer graphics. Even though there is a huge volume of work that has been done, many problems still remain unsolved. Automation {{is one of the key}} focus areas in this research. In this work, a fast, completely automated method to create 3 D watertight building models from airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds is presented. The developed method analyzes the scene content and produces multi-layer rooftops, with complex rigorous boundaries and vertical walls, that connect rooftops to the ground. The graph cuts algorithm is used to separate vegetative elements from the rest of the scene content, which is based on the local analysis about the properties of the local implicit surface patch. The ground terrain and building rooftop footprints are then extracted, utilizing the developed strategy, a two-step hierarchical Euclidean clustering. The method presented here adopts a 2 ̆ 2 divide-and-conquer 2 ̆ 2 scheme. Once the building footprints are segmented from the terrain and vegetative areas, the whole scene is divided into individual pendent processing units which represent potential points on the rooftop. For each individual building region, significant features on the rooftop are further detected using a specifically designed region-growing algorithm with surface smoothness constraints. The principal orientation of each building rooftop feature is calculated using a minimum bounding <b>box</b> <b>fitting</b> technique, and is used to guide the refinement of shapes and boundaries of the rooftop parts. Boundaries for all of these features are refined for the purpose of producing strict description. Once the description of the rooftops is achieved, polygonal mesh models are generated by creating surface patches with outlines defined by detected vertices to produce triangulated mesh models. These triangulated mesh models are suitable for many applications, such as 3 D mapping, urban planning and augmented reality...|$|E

40|$|Hypothermia is {{a medical}} {{condition}} in which the human body’s core temperature is 35 °C or lower, well below the nominal temperature of around 37 °C. Accidental/unintentional hypothermia is generally divided into mild, moderate and severe. Severe hypothermia patients are re-warmed using active internal/external methods. There is a market for portable non-electric based warming blanket in pre-hospital treatment but such product is not currently available. In this project, feasibility of glucose oxidase (GOX) based reaction is examined for use in an active warming blanket. GOX was chosen because the enzyme and its substrates are readily available, relatively cheap, safe and have relatively long shelf-life; essential for subsequent commercialization. In addition, GOX from Aspergillus niger is a well characterised glycoprotein, its catalyzed reaction: the oxidation of D-glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6) to D-gluconolactone (C 6 H 10 O 6) and hydrogen peroxide, releases {{significant amount of energy}} (200 kJ mol- 1) which is necessary for the application examined here. GOX is Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) and is the basis of many industrial applications. In depth study was conducted to understand the various fundamental properties which govern the glucose oxidase catalyzed enzymatic reaction. The result shows that there were two pH optimums as well as increasing temperature optimum at decreasing pH. Thermostability of GOX increases from pH 3. 8 to 7. 5 {{as well as in the}} presence of sodium chloride and/or glucose. Stabilization due to dissolved sodium chloride and glucose are cumulative because they act via different mechanism and was demonstrated with fluorescence emission. Upon drying, GOX activity decreases 60 % immediately and gradually decreases further over longer time. Unexpectedly, additions of thermo-stabilizers do not increase the stability of dried GOX but actually accelerates its rate of degradation over time. These findings are important factors to consider when the proposed warming blanket utilizing GOX is ready for commercial use. To examine the heat transfer characteristics and performance of GOX reaction, a simple experimental model was built. The model consists of a reaction chamber where the reaction mixture is pumped into a prototype blanket insulated by polystyrene <b>box.</b> <b>Fitting</b> the experimental data into a hypothetical naked human model covered only with the prototype blanket, shows that the warming blanket concept utilizing the GOX heat generation reaction is feasible only if the reaction rate and/or scale of reaction is increased several times...|$|E

40|$|A linear-scaling {{implementation}} of Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham self-consistent field SCF theories is presented and illustrated with applications to molecules consisting {{of more than}} 1000 atoms. The diagonalization bottleneck of traditional SCF methods is avoided by carrying out a minimization of the Roothaan-Hall RH energy function and solving the Newton equations using the preconditioned conjugate-gradient PCG method. For rapid PCG convergence, the Löwdin orthogonal atomic orbital basis is used. The resulting linear-scaling trust-region Roothaan-Hall LS-TRRH method works {{by the introduction of}} a level-shift parameter in the RH Newton equations. A great advantage of the LS-TRRH method is that the optimal level shift can be determined at no extra cost, ensuring fast and robust convergence of both the SCF iterations and the level-shifted Newton equations. For density averaging, the authors use the trust-region density-subspace minimization TRDSM method, which, unlike the traditional direct inversion in the iterative subspace DIIS scheme, is firmly based on the principle of energy minimization. When combined with a linear-scaling evaluation of the Fock/Kohn-Sham matrix including a <b>boxed</b> <b>fitting</b> of the electron density, LS-TRRH and TRDSM methods constitute the linear-scaling trust-region SCF LS-TRSCF method. The LS-TRSCF method compares favorably with the traditional SCF/ DIIS scheme, converging smoothly and reliably in cases where the latter method fails.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} study involving riding school horses and 2 nonedible items, a Jolly Ball and a rope, {{was carried out}} to explore the long-term (2 weeks) interest of horses in these items. Twelve horses were observed in their stalls during 3 observation periods per observation day (10 AM- 11 AM; 11 AM- 12 PM; 6 PM- 7 PM) using the scan sampling method. Each object was presented to each horse for 2 weeks and observations were carried out on Saturday and Sunday after introduction (weekend 1), after 1 week (weekend 2), and after 2 weeks (weekend 3). Both items were hung up on the front wall of the stall. Items were presented to the horses in a rotation system so that each horse was exposed to each condition (ball, rope, control). Item-related behavior occurred to a limited extent, possibly due {{to the presence of}} sufficient hay quantities. The available bedding material also influenced the use of the items, as horses showed more item-related behavior when bedding material was unclean. The fact that both items were hung may also have played a role. Both objects were equally interesting but the ball maintained the horse's interest over a longer period. In the presence of the rope, however, no item-related behavior was seen {{at the end of the}} second week. There was no effect observed on general activities or on abnormal behavior. This finding might be due to the patterns of abnormal oral behavior (licking and manipulating <b>box</b> <b>fittings)</b> that the horses exhibited and the fact that the objects did not address the underlying causes of this behavior. When horses are appropriately reared, nonedible items are not useful as enrichment. In this study, balls seemed to maintain interest over a longer period.

40|$|As an {{outgrowth}} of series of projects focused on mobility of unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), an omnidirectional (ODV), multi-robot, autonomous mobile parking security system has been developed. The system has two types of robots: the low-profile Omni-Directional Inspection System (ODIS), {{which can be used}} for under-vehicle inspections, and the mid-sized T 4 robot, which serves as a “marsupial mothership ” for the ODIS vehicles and performs coarse resolution inspection. A key task for the T 4 robot is license plate recognition (LPR). For a successful LPR task without compromising the recognition rate, the robot must be able to identify the bumper locations of vehicles in the parking area and then precisely position the LPR camera relative to the bumper. This paper describes a 2 D-laser scanner based approach to bumper identification and laser servoing for the T 4 robot. The system uses a gimbal-mounted scanning laser. As the T 4 robot travels down a row of parking stalls, data is collected from the laser every 100 ms. For each parking stall in the range of the laser during the scan, the data is matched to a “bumper box ” corresponding to where a car bumper is expected, resulting in a point cloud of data corresponding to a vehicle bumper for each stall. Next, recursive line-fitting algorithms are used to determine a line for the data in each stall’s “bumper <b>box.</b> ” The <b>fitting</b> technique uses Hough based transforms, which are robust against segmentation problems and fast enough for real-time line fitting. Once a bumper line is fitted with an acceptable confidence, the bumper location is passed to the T 4 motion controller, which moves to position the LPR camera properly relative to the bumper.

40|$|The class Polyplacophora {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{primitive}} groups of mollusks. Chitons are unique in having eight shells called plates surrounded by a cartilaginous girdle. It is thought that the eight shells of chitons evolved from fused spicules such as those found in the tunic of Aplacophorans. While all species of chiton today have eight shells, the ancestral condition was probably seven. Evidence for this comes from the fact that the earliest known chiton fossils appear to have only seven “plates ” and because the tail plate in chitons develops embryologically much later than the first seven. Intertidal chitons tend to remain under rocks during the daytime but become active at night. This is especially true for those species that occur in warmer climes. Amazingly, chitons have “eyes ” on the tops of their shells. Some chitons have as many as 11, 000 tiny little light receptors! It is possible that they use these to tell day from night. It is also likely that they are used in a fashion similar to the eyes of sea stars for detecting shadows passing over them so that they can clamp tightly to the substrate. Most chitons are able to cling tightly to rocks. This bond is so tight that a chiton’s shells may break before letting go. When collecting chitons, a thin, dull knife is usually slipped quickly between the chiton and the substrate. The blade is inserted under the posterior end of the chiton where the chiton often lifts the edge of its girdle. Another defense chitons use is the ability to roll into a tight ball when dislodged. It is best quickly to place a collected chiton inside of a <b>box</b> with tight <b>fitting</b> sponges or tie the chiton to a flat board before the chiton can roll.
