5|$|Capodacqua of La Repubblica {{believed}} that the route favored a rider that could defend well {{and put in a}} good time during the uphill time trial. La Stampa writer Gianni Ranieri felt the two non-uphill time trials would favor Gianni Bugno, while the up-hill time trial could be a place where Claudio Chiappucci could gain time on the field. Pedro Delgado believed the race to <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> than the Tour de France that same year. The Cima Coppi – the highest point in altitude the race reached – was scheduled to be the Passo dello Stelvio, but the pass was scrapped from the race and the Passo Pordoi – the next highest mountain – became the new Cima Coppi.|$|E

His first major race {{of the year was}} the Tirreno–Adriatico, where he won the race's final stage which was an {{individual}} time trial. Cancellara came to the Milan–San Remo with the hopes of winning the race a second time. He positioned himself in an eight-man breakaway that made {{it all the way to}} the finish. As the group approached the finish line, Cancellara was bested in the sprint for the line by Australian Matthew Goss and Cancellara crossed the line in second.|$|E

There was also a discussion that the gang had about the show Wings while swimming in the beer tank. Quagmire admits {{that he is the}} most knowledgeable about the show because he is a pilot and the show focuses on two pilots. When Peter goes to look at his secret stash of pornography, the intro from Get Smart is referenced. Stewie asks Brian if Jillian has an alibi, and Brian says no. [...] Stewie starts singing the song [...] "U.G.L.Y.", understanding that Jillian does not have an alibi. Brian sets up a cutaway when he says that breaking up with Jillian will <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> than the reviews for Our American Cousin. The ensuing gag shows the actors looking for mention of their play following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
500|$|WALL-E won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature and was {{nominated}} for Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing at the 81st Academy Awards, which it lost to Slumdog Millionaire (Original Score, Original Song, Sound Mixing), The Dark Knight (Sound Editing), and Milk (Original Screenplay). Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination, {{but it was not}} nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted WALL-E to the Best Animated Feature category. Peter Travers commented that [...] "If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E." [...] Only three animated films, 1991's Beauty and the Beast and Pixar's next two films, 2009's Up and 2010's Toy Story 3, have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. A reflective Stanton stated he was not disappointed the film was restricted to the Best Animated Film nomination because he was overwhelmed by the film's positive reception, and eventually [...] "The line [...] is just getting so blurry that I think with each proceeding year, it's going to <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> and tougher to say what's an animated movie and what's not an animated movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2000, Anthony DeCurtis {{praised the}} song for its musical {{demonstration}} of [...] "the sweet satisfactions of faith". On a triple album where [...] "nearly every song is excellent", AllMusic picks [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] {{as one of}} five standout tracks (or AMG track picks), with Richie Unterberger writing of its autumnal theme: [...] "It's the kind of song that fits the mood in November, when the trees are getting stripped bare of their leaves, the days are getting shorter and colder, {{and you have to}} resign yourself to knowing it's going to <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> and tougher in those regards for months, also knowing that those hardships will pass away come springtime." [...] In his book on Harrison, subtitled A Spiritual Biography, Gary Tillery refers to the song as [...] "magisterial" [...] and a [...] "majestic title track" [...] that [...] "leaves even the shallowest listener contemplative". Michael Gallucci of Ultimate Classic Rock places [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] third on his list of Harrison's best solo songs (behind the two hit singles from All Things Must Pass, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] and [...] "What Is Life"), and comments: [...] "The album's title track takes on more poignancy after Harrison's death , but it's always been great." [...] Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham similarly describes the song as [...] "a heart-rending piece of significant prescience which seems to take on more poignancy with every passing year".|$|E

Allegations that the party was overly left wing were also allegedly unfounded, as according to the report: [...] "Many of our most 'left wing' polices were the most popular. Polls showed a wish, from voters, for us to <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> on big business, and policies that were unpopular with many senior business people, such as the energy price freeze and the Mansion Tax, were popular with voters." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} dark flesh {{color is}} due to the presence of anthocyanins, a family of antioxidant pigments common to many flowers and fruit, but uncommon in citrus fruits. Chrysanthemin (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside) is the main compound found in red oranges. The flesh develops its characteristic maroon color when the fruit develops with low temperatures during the night. [...] Sometimes, dark coloring is seen on the exterior of the rind, as well, depending on the variety of blood orange. The skin can <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> and harder to peel than that of other oranges. Blood oranges have a unique flavor profile compared to other oranges, being distinctly raspberry-like in addition to the usual citrus notes.|$|E
2500|$|Originally Croatia {{had been}} {{aiming for a}} 2007 {{accession}} date, which would have broken Slovakia's record of 2.5 years of negotiations to complete the process. However, negotiations turned out to <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> than expected. On 5 November 2008, the European Commission's annual progress report on Croatia's candidacy was published. Olli Rehn stated that the country should aim to complete accession negotiations {{by the end of}} 2009, with membership following by 2011 at the latest. In 2009 it was also reported that Iceland may be fast-tracked into the European Union, and Rehn said that [...] "the EU prefers two countries joining at the same time rather than individually. If Iceland applies shortly and the negotiations are rapid, Croatia and Iceland could join the EU in parallel". The last non-acquis hurdle to membership, the maritime border dispute with Slovenia, was overcome in November 2009.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2009 Mandelson {{was widely}} {{reported}} to have ordered [...] "technical measures" [...] such as internet disconnection {{to be included in}} the draft of the Digital Economy Act 2010 after a [...] "big lobbying operation", even though the Digital Britain report had rejected this type of punishment. The Independent reported that according to their Whitehall sources, Mandelson was persuaded that tough laws were needed to reduce online copyright infringement following an intensive lobbying campaign by influential people in the music and film industry. The paper also reported that this included a meeting with DreamWorks co-founder David Geffen at the Rothschild family villa on the Greek island of Corfu. Mandelson's spokesperson claimed that there had been no discussion of internet piracy during the Corfu dinner and suggested that the decision to reverse Lord Carter's findings had been taken in late July before the trip. The Times reported after the Corfu meeting that an unnamed Whitehall source had confirmed that before this trip, Mandelson had shown little personal interest in the Digital Britain agenda, which has been ongoing for several years. According to the source of The Times, Mandelson returned from holiday and effectively issued an edict that the regulation needed to <b>be</b> <b>tougher.</b>|$|E

60|$|It is {{for this}} reason that a laborer is so {{fiercely}} hostile to another laborer who offers to work for less pay or longer hours. To hold his place, (which is to live), he must offset this offer by another equally liberal, which is equivalent to giving away somewhat from the food and shelter he enjoys. To sell his day's work for $2, instead of $2.50, means that he, his wife, and his children will not have so good a roof over their heads, so warm clothes on their backs, so substantial food in their stomachs.
