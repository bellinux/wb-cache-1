At standstill, the rotor current is the same frequency as the stator current, and tends to travel at the outermost parts of the cage rotor bars (by skin effect). The different <b>bar</b> <b>shapes</b> can give usefully different speed-torque characteristics as well as some control over the inrush current at startup.|$|R

5000|$|... "Granola bars" [...] {{have become}} popular as a snack, {{similar to the}} {{traditional}} flapjack (oat bar) or muesli bar familiar in the Commonwealth countries. Granola bars consist of granola mixed with honey or other sweetened syrup, pressed and baked into a <b>bar</b> <b>shape,</b> resulting {{in the production of}} a more convenient snack. Granola bars are always individually packaged in a sealed pouch, even when a box of multiple bars is purchased. This enables people to place the packaged bar in a purse, backpack or other bag for consumption at a later point. The product is most popular in the United States and Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the United Kingdom, parts of southern Europe, Brazil, Israel, South Africa and Japan. Recently, granola has begun to expand its market into India and other southeast Asian countries. A wide variety of flavours is available, ranging from fruit and nuts to chocolate and marshmallows. Some granola bars are coated in chocolate or vanilla yogurt topping.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the bar is}} {{initially}} inserted into the jig, the middle roller is manually lowered and forced against the bar with a screw arrangement. This causes the bar to undergo both plastic and elastic deformation. The portion of the bar between the rollers will take on {{the shape of a}} cubic polynomial, which approximates a circular arc. [...] The rollers are then rotated moving the bar along with them. For each new position, the portion of the bar between the rollers takes on the shape of a cubic modified by the end conditions imposed by the adjacent sections of the bar. When either end of the bar is reached, the force applied to the center roller is incrementally increased, the roller rotation is reversed and as the rolling process proceeds, the <b>bar</b> <b>shape</b> becomes a better approximation to a circular arc, gradually, for the number of passes required to bring the arc of the bar to the desired radius.|$|E

40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the distribution of}} bar shapes in spiral galaxies, we have analysed 113 H-band and 89 B-band galaxy images from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. Parameters measuring <b>bar</b> <b>shape</b> and position along the Hubble sequence were obtained in each waveband. Evidence was found for a bimodality {{in the distribution of}} <b>bar</b> <b>shape,</b> implying that barred and unbarred galaxies are not just the extrema of a single distribution, and that any evolution between these two states must occur on a rapid timescale. Objective bar shapes measured in the H-band were found to be more closely related to visual classifications than B-band bar strengths, as the B-band images are somewhat compromised by localised star formation, especially in later-type systems. Galaxies were found to be more centrally concentrated in the infrared. Later type galaxies showed greater asymmetry in the optical than the infrared, presumably again due to localised star formation, but on average the bar strengths in the two bands were found to be the same.

Several models for explanation of the observed transverse resistances and breaking of reciprocity theorem are discussed. One of the most promising explanation is based on the idea of time-reversal symmetry violation...|$|E
40|$|A rapidly rotating, {{axisymmetric}} star can be dynamically unstable to an m= 2 "bar" {{mode that}} transforms the star from a disk shape to an elongated bar. The fate {{of such a}} bar-shaped star is uncertain. Some previous numerical studies indicate that the bar is short lived, lasting {{for only a few}} bar-rotation periods, while other studies suggest that the bar is relatively long lived. This paper contains the results of a numerical simulation of a rapidly rotating gamma= 5 / 3 fluid star. The simulation shows that the <b>bar</b> <b>shape</b> is long lived: once the bar is established, the star retains this shape for more than 10 bar-rotation periods, {{through the end of the}} simulation. The results are consistent with the conjecture that a star will retain its <b>bar</b> <b>shape</b> indefinitely on a dynamical time scale, as long as its rotation rate exceeds the threshold for secular bar instability. The results are described in terms of a low density neutron star, but can be scaled to represent, for example, a burned-out stellar core that is prevented from complete collapse by centrifugal forces. Estimates for the gravitational-wave signal indicate that a dynamically unstable neutron star in our galaxy can be detected easily by the first generation of ground based gravitational-wave detectors. The signal for an unstable neutron star in the Virgo cluster might be seen by the planned advanced detectors. The Newtonian/quadrupole approximation is used throughout this work.

50|$|Based {{upon how}} they are {{manufactured}} gold bars are categorised as having been cast or minted with both differing in their appearance and price. Cast bars are created in a similar method to that of ingots whereby molten gold is poured into a <b>bar</b> <b>shaped</b> mold and left to solidify. This process often leads to malformed bars with uneven surfaces which although imperfect makes each bar unique and easier to identify. Cast bars are also cheaper compared those that are minted because they are quicker to produce and require less handling.|$|R
