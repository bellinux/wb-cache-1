5|$|<b>Bonds</b> <b>is</b> {{the lone}} {{member of the}} 500–500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen at least 500 bases (514). He {{is also one of}} only four {{baseball}} players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season; the other members are José Canseco, Alex Rodriguez, and Alfonso Soriano.|$|E
5|$|Several of Bonds's {{family and}} {{extended}} {{family members have}} been involved in athletics as either a career or a notable pastime. Bonds has a younger brother, Bobby, Jr., who was also a professional baseball player. His paternal aunt, Rosie <b>Bonds,</b> <b>is</b> a former American record holder in the 80 meter hurdles, and competed in the 1964 Olympics. In addition, he is a distant cousin of Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson.|$|E
5|$|As enzymes {{have evolved}} to bind their {{substrates}} tightly, and most reversible inhibitors bind in the active site of enzymes, it is unsurprising {{that some of these}} inhibitors are strikingly similar in structure to the substrates of their targets. An example of these substrate mimics are the protease inhibitors, a very successful class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV. The structure of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor based on a peptide and containing three peptide <b>bonds,</b> <b>is</b> shown on the right. As this drug resembles the protein that is the substrate of the HIV protease, it competes with this substrate in the enzyme's active site.|$|E
25|$|High-yield <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> <b>bonds</b> that <b>are</b> rated below {{investment}} grade by the credit rating agencies. As these <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> riskier than {{investment grade}} bonds, investors expect {{to earn a}} higher yield. These <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> also called junk bonds.|$|R
5000|$|After winning {{independence}} from Spain in 1826, Peru was financially strapped. Over the decades financial problems worsened, and Peru needed money. In 1865 then 1866, <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> issued that were retired with new bonds in 1869. More <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> issued in 1870 but the 1869 <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> not addressed. New <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> again issued in 1872 and again previous <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> not addressed.|$|R
25|$|Where {{the market}} price of <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> less than its face value (par value), the <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> selling at a discount. Conversely, if {{the market price}} of <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> greater than its face value, the <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> selling at a premium. For this and other {{relationships}} between price and yield, see below.|$|R
5|$|The {{proposed}} {{bond issue}} went ahead in July 2006. Arsenal issued £210million worth of 13.5-year bonds with a spread of 52 basis points over government bonds and £50million of 7.1-year bonds with a spread of 22 basis points over LIBOR. It {{was the first}} publicly marketed, asset-backed bond issue by a European football club. The effective interest rate on these <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> 5.14% and 5.97%, respectively, and are due to be paid back over a 25-year period; the move to bonds has reduced the club's annual debt service cost to approximately £20million a year. In September 2010, Arsenal announced that the Highbury Square development – {{one of the main}} sources of income to reduce the stadium debt – was now debt free and making revenue.|$|E
5|$|Wayne Gretzky won {{the award}} a record nine times during his career, eight consecutively. He {{has been named}} MVP more times than any other player {{in the history of}} the other three North American major {{professional}} leagues (Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association, and National Football League). Barry <b>Bonds</b> <b>is</b> second, having won the MVP award seven times in the MLB. Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers teammate Mark Messier are the only players to win the Hart Trophy with more than one team.|$|E
5|$|Billy <b>Bonds</b> <b>is</b> {{the only}} manager to have managed both clubs. He {{was in charge}} of West Ham from February 1990 to August 1994, {{managing}} the club for 227 games as the team yo-yoed between the First and Second divisions. He guided them to two promotions and one relegation. He resigned in August 1994. He was appointed as Millwall manager in May 1997 by chairman Theo Paphitis— an unpopular decision with many Lions fans due to his West Ham allegiance. Bonds, from south London, had several family members who were Millwall fans; a fact which meant some supporters felt he should be given a chance. After a good start, the team narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 18th in the Second Division. Bonds was sacked in May 1998, having been in charge of the side for only 53 games.|$|E
25|$|High-yield <b>bonds</b> (junk <b>bonds)</b> <b>are</b> <b>bonds</b> that <b>are</b> rated below {{investment}} grade by the credit rating agencies. As these <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> riskier than {{investment grade}} bonds, investors expect {{to earn a}} higher yield.|$|R
50|$|A quadruple <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} {{chemical}} bond between two atoms involving eight electrons. This <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> {{an extension of the}} more familiar types double bonds and triple bonds. Stable quadruple <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> most common among the transition metals {{in the middle of the}} d-block, such as rhenium, tungsten, molybdenum and chromium. Typically the ligands that support quadruple <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> π-donors, not π-acceptors.|$|R
50|$|The C-O <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> {{strongly}} polarized towards oxygen (electronegativity of C vs O, 2.55 vs 3.44). Bond lengths for paraffinic C-O <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> in {{the range}} of 143 pm - less than those of C-N or C-C bonds. Shortened single <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> found with carboxylic acids (136 pm) due to partial double bond character and elongated <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> found in epoxides (147 pm). The C-O <b>bond</b> strength <b>is</b> also larger than C-N or C-C. For example, <b>bond</b> strengths <b>are</b> /mol (at 298 K) in methanol, /mol in methylamine, and /mol in ethane.|$|R
5|$|Thallium is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At {{the bottom of}} the periodic table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.|$|E
25|$|From the issuer's perspective, the {{key benefit}} of raising money by selling {{convertible}} <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> a reduced cash interest payment. The advantage for companies of issuing convertible <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> that, if the bonds are converted to stocks, companies' debt vanishes. However, {{in exchange for}} the benefit of reduced interest payments, the value of shareholder's equity is reduced due to the stock dilution expected when bondholders convert their bonds into new shares.|$|E
25|$|The {{rigidity}} of cumulenes {{arises from}} the fact that the internal carbon atoms carry two double bonds. Their sp hybridisation results in two π bonds, one to each neighbor, which are perpendicular to each other. This bonding reinforces a linear geometry of the carbon chain. If the number of consecutive double <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> odd, there is cis–trans isomerism as for alkenes. Cumulenes with non-equivalent substituents on each end exhibit isomerism. If the number of consecutive double <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> even, there is axial chirality as for allenes.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{since both}} double <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> {{separated}} by a single C-C bond, the double <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> conjugated.|$|R
50|$|The {{quality of}} the issue refers to the {{probability}} that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. This will depend {{on a wide range of}} factors.High-yield <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> <b>bonds</b> that <b>are</b> rated below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. As these <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> also called junk bonds.|$|R
50|$|Two atoms can <b>be</b> <b>bonded</b> {{by sharing}} {{more than one}} pair of electrons. The common <b>bonds</b> to carbon <b>are</b> single, double and triple <b>bonds.</b> Single <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> most common and are {{represented}} by a single, solid line between two atoms in a skeletal formula. Double <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> denoted by two parallel lines, and triple <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> shown by three parallel lines.|$|R
25|$|The U.S. Treasury {{statistics}} indicate that, {{at the end}} of 2006, non-US {{citizens and}} institutions held 44% of federal debt held by the public. , China, holding $1.26trillion in treasury <b>bonds,</b> <b>is</b> the largest foreign financier of the U.S. public debt.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between yield and {{term to maturity}} (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> called a yield curve. The yield curve is a graph plotting this relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} on corporate bonds and government <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> usually payable twice yearly. The amount of interest paid (each six months) is the disclosed interest rate divided by two and {{multiplied by the}} principal. The yearly compounded rate {{is higher than the}} disclosed rate.|$|E
50|$|Double <b>bonds</b> {{involving}} carbon <b>are</b> {{stronger than}} single <b>bonds</b> and <b>are</b> also shorter. The <b>bond</b> order <b>is</b> two. Double <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> also electron-rich, {{which makes them}} reactive.|$|R
40|$|The world's {{first known}} {{inflation}}-indexed <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> {{issued by the}} Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1780 during the Revolutionary War. These <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> invented to deal with severe wartime inflation and with angry discontent among soldiers in the U. S. Army with the decline in purchasing power of their pay. Although the <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> successful, the concept of indexed <b>bonds</b> <b>was</b> abandoned after the immediate extreme inflationary environment passed, and largely forgotten until the twentieth century. In 1780, the <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> viewed as at best only an irregular expedient, {{since there was no}} formulated economic theory to justify indexation. ...|$|R
25|$|Atomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have {{specific}} directional properties leading to {{different types of}} covalent bonds. Sigma (σ) <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> the strongest covalent <b>bonds</b> and <b>are</b> due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A single <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> usually a σ bond. Pi (π) <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A double bond between two given atoms consists of one σ and one π bond, and a triple <b>bond</b> <b>is</b> one σ and two π bonds.|$|R
25|$|Virtually all {{central banks}} set an {{interest}} rate target, and conduct open market operations to ensure base interest rates remain at that target level. According to MMT the issuing of government <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> best understood as an operation to offset government spending rather than a requirement to finance it.|$|E
25|$|In a cyclic {{molecule}} {{with three}} alternating double bonds, cyclohexatriene, the bond {{length of the}} single bond would be 1.54Å {{and that of the}} double bond would be 1.34Å. However, in a molecule of benzene, the length of each of the <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> 1.40Å, between these two lengths.|$|E
25|$|The spatial {{arrangement}} of the <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to that of}} the four sp3 orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47° between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.|$|E
25|$|Molecules with odd-electron <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> usually highly reactive. These {{types of}} <b>bond</b> <b>are</b> only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>was</b> born on December 19, 1970, in New York City, New York. <b>Bond</b> <b>was</b> {{raised by}} her mother, Mary Burroughs.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{two kinds}} of course in this family of <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> called a {{stretching}} course, and this typically comprises nothing but stretchers at the face from quoin to quoin. The other kind of course is the heading course, and this usually consists of headers, with two queen closers—one by the quoin header at either end—to generate the bond.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that water}} is {{required}} for normal peptide bond cleavage of the iminolactone intermediate. In formic acid, cleavage of Met-Ser and Met-Thr <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> enhanced with increased water concentration because these conditions favor the addition of water across the imine rather than reaction of the side chain hydroxyl with the imine. Lowered pH tends to increase cleavage rates by inhibiting methionine side chain oxidation.|$|E
25|$|The three C–H σ {{bonds of}} the methyl group(s) {{attached}} to the carbocation can undergo the stabilization interaction but {{only one of them}} can be aligned perfectly with the empty p-orbital, depending on the conformation of the carbon–carbon bond. Donation from the two misaligned C–H <b>bonds</b> <b>is</b> weaker. The more adjacent methyl groups there are, the larger hyperconjugation stabilization is because of the increased number of adjacent C–H bonds.|$|E
50|$|A Premium <b>Bond</b> <b>is</b> {{a lottery}} <b>bond</b> {{issued by the}} United Kingdom {{government}}'s National Savings and Investments agency. The <b>bonds</b> <b>are</b> entered in a regular prize draw and the government promises to buy them back, on request, for their original price. The <b>bonds</b> <b>were</b> introduced by Harold Macmillan in 1956.|$|R
