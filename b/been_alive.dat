5|$|In spring 1243, an {{uprising}} ousted Vladislav; Stefan Uroš I, his third brother, {{was put on}} the throne.

If he had <b>been</b> <b>alive,</b> Asen might have prevented the coup.|$|E

5|$|Initially, experts {{determined}} the manuscript was genuine, as the date Horse picked matched {{the time period}} Horne had <b>been</b> <b>alive</b> and active, and the manuscript's topics matched the poet's interests. Horse had written the manuscript without knowing any of these details. After his hoax was discovered, Horse held onto the text for the next decade, until he played Myst and 7th Guest and decided the point-and-click adventure genre was a good match for his conspiracy theory-inspired ideas. He later {{said that while the}} story of Myst did not interest him, the game's artwork and the sense of immersion inspired him to immediately begin working on Drowned God in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Barre {{was one of}} {{the main}} royal justices between 1194 and 1199. He also served as a lawyer for the new Bishop of Ely, Eustace, who was elected in August 1197. But Barre had {{incurred}} the hostility of the king's younger brother Prince John, and when John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, Barre ceased to be employed as a royal justice, instead returning to Ely and business in his clerical office. His last sure mention in the historical record is on 9 August 1202, when he was serving as a judge-delegate for Pope Innocent III, but he may have <b>been</b> <b>alive</b> as late as 1213, as he was part of a papal panel deciding a case that can only be securely dated to between 1198 and 1213. Barre maintained his friendship with Stephen of Tournai, who corresponded with him later in their lives.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still <b>been</b> <b>alive.</b> The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E

5|$|The only direct written {{mention of}} Gediminas' sister is a legend {{describing}} {{the murder of}} two Franciscan friars who came to Vilnius to spread Christianity. This legend was first presented in Chronica XXIV Generalium, a chronicle written before 1369. The events probably took place around 1340, and some eyewitnesses could still have <b>been</b> <b>alive</b> when the chronicle was written. According to the legend Friar Ulrich's preaching angered townspeople. He and his companion, Martin, were seized and brought before Gediminas, who ordered the friars killed. Ulrich was tortured and his body tossed into a river. Martin's body was rescued by Gediminas' sister, an Orthodox nun. She buried Martin at the monastery where she lived. The legend was possibly {{as the basis for}} the legend of 14 Franciscan martyrs of Vilnius, first recorded in the Bychowiec Chronicle.|$|E

25|$|Though {{some critics}} have argued against the series being shown in this format, {{programme}} makers and commentators defended their decision by saying that Dickens's writings were long, complex, very popular stories told over {{a series of small}} installments, just like a soap-opera and claiming that if he had <b>been</b> <b>alive</b> in 2005 he would have been writing for big signature dramas. Bleak House was indeed originally published in monthly installments, with cliffhangers used to maintain the continuing interest of the readership.|$|E

25|$|During or {{immediately}} after the August 23 Coup which toppled Antonescu, Murgescu involved himself with left-wing political circles, including the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). Following the country's change of orientation, Lt-Col. Murgescu was arrested. He was initially sentenced to death, and some authors {{believe that he was}} executed. However, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with hard labor on June 1, 1945. Passing through the notorious Aiud prison, he may have still <b>been</b> <b>alive</b> during the mid 1950s. As a display of his loyalty to the new regime, Costin volunteered for war against the Nazis, fought in Northern Transylvania, and was badly wounded.|$|E
25|$|In Aliens, {{the adult}} creatures {{have a more}} {{textured}} head rather than a smooth carapace.

The smooth design of the carapace would be used again in Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, although made narrower with a longer muzzle and more prominent chin. This design would be kept in Alien versus Predator, and abandoned in Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in favor of the ribbed design.|$|E
