25|$|Another common {{procedure}} is the modified <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> study during which barium-impregnated liquids and solids are ingested by the patient. A radiologist records and, with a speech pathologist, interprets the resulting images to diagnose oral and pharyngeal swallowing dysfunction.

25|$|The {{interpretation}} of standard <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> examinations for assessing dysphagia is operator and interpreter dependent. It has poor sensitivity for subtle abnormalities but is more sensitive in detecting esophageal webs and rings than gastroscopy. The best initial evaluation of suspected oropharyngeal dysphagia is a barium study. <b>Barium</b> <b>swallow</b> studies remain the main investigation of dysphagia. Barium studies may detect pharyngeal tumors {{that are difficult}} to visualize endoscopically.|$|E

25|$|Diseases {{affecting}} the large intestine may cause blood {{to be passed}} with stool, may cause constipation, or may result in abdominal pain or a fever. Tests that specifically examine {{the function of the}} large intestine include <b>barium</b> <b>swallows,</b> abdominal x-rays, and colonoscopy.|$|R
25|$|Various {{types of}} barium X-ray {{examinations}} {{are used to}} examine {{different parts of the}} gastrointestinal tract. These include <b>barium</b> <b>swallow,</b> barium meal, barium follow-through, and barium enema. The <b>barium</b> <b>swallow,</b> barium meal, and barium follow-through are together also called an upper gastrointestinal series (or study), whereas the barium enema is called a lower gastrointestinal series (or study). In upper gastrointestinal series examinations, the barium sulfate is mixed with water and swallowed orally, whereas in the lower gastrointestinal series (barium enema), the barium contrast agent is administered as an enema through a small tube inserted into the rectum.|$|E
25|$|Diseases of {{the small}} {{intestine}} may present with symptoms such as diarrhoea, malnutrition, fatigue and weight loss. Investigations pursued may include blood tests to monitor nutrition, such as iron levels, folate and calcium, endoscopy and biopsy of the duodenum, and <b>barium</b> <b>swallow.</b> Treatments may include renutrition, and antibiotics for infections.|$|E
25|$|Although an {{occlusive}} tumor may be suspected on a <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> or barium meal, {{the diagnosis}} is best made with an examination using an endoscope. This involves the passing of a flexible tube with a light and camera down the esophagus and examining the wall, and is called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies taken of suspicious lesions are then examined histologically for signs of malignancy.|$|E
25|$|Oesophageal {{disease may}} result in a sore throat, {{throwing}} up blood, difficulty swallowing or vomiting. Chronic or congenital diseases might be investigated using <b>barium</b> <b>swallows,</b> endoscopy and biopsy, whereas acute diseases such as reflux may be investigated and diagnosed based on symptoms and a medical history alone.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} important manometric metrics for the analysis of pharyngeal and upper esophageal sphincter (UES) function and to investigate the effect of viscosity and other confounding factors on manometric results. Methods Manometric studies were performed on 26 asymptomatic volunteers (12 men and 14 women; age, 19 - 81 years). The mano-metric protocol included 5 water swallows (5 mL), 5 <b>barium</b> <b>swallows</b> (5 mL) and 5 yogurt swallows (5 mL). Evaluation of high-resolution manometry parameters including basal pressure of the UES, mesopharyngeal contractile integral (mesophar-yngeal CI, mmHg ‧ cm ‧ sec), CI of the hypopharynx and UES (hypopharyngeal CI), relaxation interval of UES, median intrabolus pressure and nadir pressure at UES was performed using MATLAB. Results Mesopharyngeal CIs for <b>barium</b> and yogurt <b>swallows</b> were significantly lower than those for water swallows (both P < 0. 05). Hypopharyngeal CIs for water swallows were significantly lower than those for <b>barium</b> <b>swallows</b> (P = 0. 004), and median bolus pressure at UES for <b>barium</b> <b>swallows</b> was significantly higher than that for water and yogurt swallows (both P < 0. 05). Furthermore, hypopharyngeal CI and median intrabolus pressure at UES were significantly related to age for 3 swallows (all P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 05, respectively). A significant negative correlation was also noted between nadir pressure at UES and age for water and yogurt swallows (all P < 0. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of {{oesophageal}} peristaltic activity as viewed at <b>barium</b> <b>swallows,</b> in an effort to see whether this is helpful in assessing the type and degree of oesophageal lesions associated with hiatus hernia.

25|$|Other {{investigations}} {{may include}} esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). <b>Barium</b> <b>swallow</b> X-rays {{should not be}} used for diagnosis. Esophageal manometry is not recommended for use in diagnosis, being recommended only prior to surgery. Ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring may be useful in those who do not improve after PPIs and is not needed in those in whom Barrett's esophagus is seen. Investigation for H. pylori is not usually needed.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy is an imaging {{technique}} commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} internal structures of a patient {{through the use of}} a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image intensifier and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> (to examine for esophageal disorders).|$|E
25|$|An upper {{gastrointestinal}} series, {{also called}} an upper gastrointestinal study or contrast radiography {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract, {{is a series of}} radiographs used to examine the gastrointestinal tract for abnormalities. A contrast medium, usually a radiocontrast agent such as barium sulfate mixed with water, is ingested or instilled into the gastrointestinal tract, and X-rays are used to create radiographs of the regions of interest. The barium enhances the visibility of the relevant parts of the gastrointestinal tract by coating the inside wall of the tract and appearing white on the film. This in combination with other plain radiographs allows for the imaging of parts of the upper gastrointestinal tract such as the pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine such that the inside wall lining, size, shape, contour, and patency are visible to the examiner. With fluoroscopy, it is also possible to visualize the functional movement of examined organs such as swallowing, peristalsis, or sphincter closure. Depending on the organs to be examined, barium radiographs can be classified into <b>barium</b> <b>swallow,</b> barium meal, barium follow-through, and enteroclysis (small bowel enema). To further enhance the quality of images, air or gas is sometimes introduced into the gastrointestinal tract in addition to barium, and this procedure is called double-contrast imaging. In this case the gas {{is referred to as the}} negative contrast medium. Traditionally the images produced with barium contrast are made with plain-film radiography, but computed tomography is also used in combination with barium contrast, in which case the procedure is called CT enterography.|$|E
40|$|A {{congenital}} pulmonary malformation, such as pulmonary sequestration or congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, {{should be}} suspected in infants with recurrent lower respiratory symptoms or unifocal infiltrations. The possibility of congenital pulmonary malformation associated with additional abnormalities, such as diaphragmatic hernia, is relatively high {{and can lead}} to misdiagnosis. We report a case of a 6 -month-old girl who presented with relapsing respiratory infection and hematemesis. Computerized axial tomography scan and <b>barium</b> <b>swallowing</b> study were performed, revealing a suspected intralobar pulmonary sequestration associated with sliding gastric hernia. Since the patient’s condition was complicated by sliding hernia, pneumonia and pleural effusion, a surgical procedure instead of cardiac catheterization with coil embolization was performed. During surgery, the absence of a sliding gastric hernia but a diaphragmatic eventration was noted. Only a partial portion of the left-side diaphragm was relaxing, making the <b>barium</b> <b>swallowing</b> study difficult to interpret. This case serves as a reminder that if pulmonary sequestration is suspected, a full work-up with a complete set of imaging studies should be ordered for the possible detection of associated gastrointestinal, respiratory and thoracic abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Twenty eight {{patients}} with pharyngeal pouches were treated at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, between 1975 and 1985. Nineteen {{of these patients}} had the pouch excised and 9 patients had the pouch inverted. Preoperative and postoperative cine <b>barium</b> <b>swallows</b> were obtained on all patients. The results show pouch inversion {{to be an effective}} method of treatment with a low recurrence rate, and fewer complications compared with pouch excision. Inversion of a pharyngeal pouch with a cricopharyngeal myotomy is therefore recommended as a safe, satisfactory treatment...|$|R
40|$|The {{tongue is}} {{important}} for orofacial movements, including swallowing. Although numerous {{studies have focused on}} tongue pressure against the pal-ate, its physiological role has not been fully evaluated.

Fifteen healthy young subjects participated. Tongue pres-sure measured using a sensor sheet with five channels, electromyographic EMG, and VF was recorded synchronously during 4 -ml <b>barium</b> <b>swallowing.</b> Swallowing behavior in VF images with and without the sensor sheet was compared. Furthermore, the temporal relationship between events measured from tongue pressure, EMG, and VF was evaluated. Swallowing behavior on VF images was not affected by placement of the sensor sheet.

2500|$|In {{patients}} who have dysphagia, testing may first be done to exclude an anatomical cause of dysphagia, such as distortion of the anatomy of the esophagus. [...] This usually includes visualization of the esophagus with an endoscope, and can also include <b>barium</b> <b>swallow</b> X-rays of the esophagus. Endoscopy is typically normal in patients with nutcracker esophagus; however, abnormalities associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, which associates with nutcracker esophagus, may be seen. <b>Barium</b> <b>swallow</b> in nutcracker esophagus is also typically normal, but may provide a definitive diagnosis if contrast is given in tablet or granule form. Studies on endoscopic ultrasound show slight trends toward thickening of the muscularis propria of the esophagus in nutcracker esophagus, {{but this is not}} useful in making the diagnosis.|$|E
40|$|Esophagography in 12 {{patients}} {{showed a}} characteristic oval-to oblong-shaped barium collection {{surrounded by a}} thin radiolucent margin. The collection closely resembled an intraluminal diverticulum. Twelve patients demonstrated these findings, 6 on single-contrast and 6 on double-contrast examinations. These findings were not reproducible on repeat <b>barium</b> <b>swallows,</b> and endoscopy failed to demonstrate an intraluminal diverticulum. Nine of the patients underwent esophagectomy and esophageal substitution. Pathologic examination of the gross specimen did not reveal evidence of intraluminal diverticula.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{was performed on}} 42 consecutive patients to examine the value of radiography {{in the management of}} complaints of fishbone ingestion. All patients underwent an oral examination followed by radiographic examination with plain films, <b>barium</b> <b>swallows,</b> <b>barium</b> and water <b>swallows,</b> and an endoscopic examination. All radiographs were reviewed by two unbiased, experienced radiologists. Of the 7 cases with fishbone found at endoscopic examination, only two (29 %) bones were seen by the primary radiologist and 5 (71 %) by the reviewing radiologists. Except for one case in which all three radiologists detected a fishbone that passed during the examination, and thereby was not found on endoscopy, no fishbones were found at the radiographic examination that were not seen on the endoscopic examination. Thus, radiography added no valuable information but only delayed the endoscopic examination with ensuing removal of the foreign body, which had to be performed regardless of the outcome of the radiographic examination. Therefore, we suggest that patients with a short history of complaints of fishbone ingestion, ie, 48 hours or less, should first be evaluated with oral and endoscopic examination...|$|R

Reprinted by {{permission}} of SAGE PublicationsObjective: Post-laryngectomy surgery, pharyngeal weakness and pharyngoesophageal junction (PEJ) restriction are the underlying candidate mechanisms of dysphagia. We aimed to determine, in laryngectomees whether: 1) hypopharyngeal propulsion is reduced and/or PEJ resistance is increased; 2) endoscopic dilatation improves dysphagia; and 3) if so, whether symptomatic improvement correlate with reduction in resistance to flow across the PEJ.

40|$|Introduction: Degenerative {{changes of}} the {{cervical}} spine are more common in elderly, but anterior cervical osteophytes that cause problems in swallowing are rare. The {{most common cause of}} this problem is DISH disease (diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis). Trauma is also suggested as a potential cause in osteophyte formation. Case Report: We report a rare case of anterior cervical osteophyte with problems in swallowing that was caused by cervical spine trauma in a car accident 4 years ago, treated with a cervical collar. Dysphagia was the initial symptom of the disease. <b>Barium</b> <b>swallowing</b> showed a large cervical osteophyte at the C 3 -C 4 level with compression effect on the esophagus. X-ray, CT scan and MRI of the cervical spine confirmed the osteophyte and its correlation with the esophagus. Endoscopic study of esophagus and stomach also ruled out other disorders. Surgical osteophytectomy was performed. Conclusion: Up to now, only two cases of post-traumatic anterior cervical osteophyte have been cited in the literature.
