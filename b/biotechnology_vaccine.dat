40|$|The {{development}} of vaccines {{for the prevention}} of AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and other diseases requires both public and private investment. Private investment, however, has been far lower than might have been hoped, given the massive human toll of these diseases, particularly in the poorest countries. With a view to understanding this situation and exploring potential solutions, the World Bank AIDS Vaccine Task Force commissioned a study on the perspectives of the <b>biotechnology,</b> <b>vaccine,</b> and pharmaceutical industries regarding investment in research and development work on an AIDS vaccine. It was found that different obstacles to the {{development of}} an AIDS vaccine arose during the product development cycle. During the earlier phases, before obtaining proof of product, the principal barriers were scientific. The lack of consensus on which approach was likely to be effective increased uncertainty and the risks associated with investing in expensive clinical trials. The later phases, which involved adapting, testing, and scaling up production for different populations, were most influenced by market considerations. In order to raise the levels of private research and development in an AIDS vaccine there will probably have to be a combination of push strategies, which reduce the cost and scientific risk of investment, and pull strategies, which guarantee a market...|$|E

This approach was efficient in 5 different pathogenic enterobacterial species.

30|$|The {{advancing}} {{field of}} biomedical science {{has increased the}} practical and theoretical understanding of pathogen biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, immunology, and <b>biotechnology.</b> Therefore, <b>vaccine</b> development has progressed from trial and error- based empirical vaccine studies towards more rational and reductionist approaches (Van Regenmortel 2004). Nevertheless, these approaches have had limited success in developing effective vaccines against emerging diseases like Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and re-emerging diseases like tuberculosis (TB) and malaria. This {{may be due to}} a number of factors, such as rapid clearance from the body, poor recognition by the immune system, and failure to adequately stimulate appropriate immune cells (Edelman 2002; Edelman and Tacket 1990). Therefore, while appropriate and safe Ag discovery has been the main target of vaccinology, in recent years the development of adjuvants (a term derived from the Latin ‘to help’) that increase the immunogenicity of the Ags is also gaining equal importance. Adjuvants are used in vaccines to reduce the dose of vaccines, to induce the particular protective response (CD 4 vs CD 8 and Th 1 vs Th 2) and to enhance a broad immune response, suggesting adjuvants are essential to vaccine design and development. Therefore, designing a potent adjuvant is key to vaccine development.|$|R

40|$|Tobacco {{dependence}} is {{an addiction}} characterised by compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior and intensive craving {{in the absence}} of tobacco. Nicotine is the major addictive component of tobacco and acts on the reward system in the brain. Together with strong conditional reinforcements, unaided smoking cessation attempts are notoriously unsuccessful and even the most recently introduced pharmacotherapy, varenicline, only achieves a 23 % continuous abstinence rate after 1 year. Vaccination against nicotine represents a promising novel concept for treating nicotine addiction. Antibodies against nicotine inhibit the passage of nicotine to brain and thus inhibit its addiction-reinforcing activities. There are three nicotine vaccines that are in clinical development. The first proof-of-concept study in smoking cessation with the <b>vaccine</b> NicQb (Cytos <b>Biotechnology),</b> a nicotine <b>vaccine</b> based on virus-like particles, demonstrated that continuous abstinence rates can be significantly increased by vaccination; however, as expected from the mode of action, a sufficient antibody level had to be achieved.

40|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} viruses of rabbits include: Myxoma virus (MV), the poxvirus that causes Myxomatosis, the calicivirus (genus Lagovirus) of Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHDV), and Lapine Rotavirus (LRV), which is an enteric agent. There are some other viral agents in rabbits (parvovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, calicivirus (genus Vesivirus), enterovirus-like, reovirus, herpesvirus and coronavirus) but both their occurrence and their pathological value are negligible. Myxomatosis was firstly introduced in Europe more than 50 years ago and still represents a current and real problem. Recent studies have been focused to determine the role and function of the over 100 genes of MV encoding structural and essential proteins; in particular the immunomodulatory MV (im-MV) proteins (virokines and viroreceptors, immune modulators and anti-apoptotic factor), involved in contrasting the host immune system response towards the MV infection. One of the main tools to control myxomatosis in endemic areas is use of the live attenuated vaccines {{that are able to}} induce traceable humoral immunity for a variable time even if the protection of rabbits from the infection is not fully guarantee. Therefore, thanks also to the knowledge on the im-MV proteins, a new family of <b>biotechnology</b> deleted <b>vaccines</b> will soon be produced and made available in a few years.

40|$|Blood {{in healthy}} organisms {{is seen as}} a ‘sterile’ environment: it lacks proliferating microbes. Dormant or not-immediately-culturable forms are not absent, however, as {{intracellular}} dormancy is well established. We highlight here that a great many pathogens can survive in blood and inside erythrocytes. ‘Non-culturability’, reflected by discrepancies between plate counts and total counts, is commonplace in environmental microbiology. It is overcome by improved culturing methods, and we asked how common this would be in blood. A number of recent, sequence-based and ultramicroscopic studies have uncovered an authentic blood microbiome in a number of non-communicable diseases. The chief origin of these microbes is the gut microbiome (especially when it shifts composition to a pathogenic state, known as ‘dysbiosis’). Another source is microbes translocated from the oral cavity. ‘Dysbiosis’ is also used to describe translocation of cells into blood or other tissues. To avoid ambiguity, we here use the term ‘atopobiosis’ for microbes that appear in places other than their normal location. Atopobiosis may contribute to the dynamics of a variety of inflammatory diseases. Overall, it seems that many more chronic, non-communicable, inflammatory diseases may have a microbial component than are presently considered, and may be treatable using bactericidal antibiotics or <b>vaccines.</b> <b>Biotechnology</b> and Biological Sciences Research Council (grant BB/L 025752 / 1) as well as the National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa.

SAG 1 is the main surface antigen of the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii and a promising candidate to produce an anti-T. gondii vaccine. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the expression of SAG 1 using chloroplast transformation technology in tobacco plants. In order to improve expression in transplastomic plants, we also expressed the 90 -kDa heat shock protein of Leishmania infantum (LiHsp 83) as a carrier for the SAG 1 antigen. SAG 1 protein accumulation in transplastomic plants was approximately 0. 1 - 0. 2 μg per gram of fresh weight (FW). Fusion of SAG 1 to LiHsp 83 significantly increased the level of SAG 1 accumulation in tobacco chloroplasts (by up to 500 -fold). We also evaluated the functionality of the chLiHsp 83 -SAG 1. Three human seropositive samples reacted with SAG 1 expressed in transplastomic chLiHsp 83 -SAG 1 plants. Oral immunization with chLiHsp 83 -SAG 1 elicited a significant reduction of the cyst burden that correlated with an increase of SAG 1 -specific antibodies. We propose the fusion of foreign proteins to LiHsp 83 as a novel strategy to increase the expression level of the recombinant proteins using chloroplast transformation technology, thus addressing one of the current challenges for this approach in antigen protein production. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Uma das estratégias mais promissoras para a biotecnologia de vacinas é o desenvolvimento de linhagens precisamente atenuadas, e que possam ser usadas como carregadoras de antígenos heterólogos. Mutantes de Salmonella Typhimurium têm sido extensivamente utilizados com essa fmalidade. A flagelina, monômero constituinte do filamento flagelar, vem sendo empregada como carregadora de antígenos heterólogos, inseridos na região central, hipervariável (região IV). Inserções nessa região são freqüentemente funcionais, e levam à exposição do epitopo na superfície do filamento. O presente trabalho explora o potencial de outras regiões da molécula para a inserção de epitopos. Nós inserimos a mesma seqüência usada anteriomente (epitopo da proteína M de S. pyogenes, Tipo 5) em regiões com diferentes níveis de homologia (III e VI), e em região totalmente conservada (VIII). Também foram feitas inserções duplas em regiões que se mostraram toleráveis (III e IV; IV e VI). Todas as proteínas híbridas foram sintetizadas pela Salmonella, como demonstrado em imunoblots, usando anticorpo contra a flagelina e contra o peptídeo. Todas as regiões, exceto a VIII, aceitaram a inserção sem perda de motilidade, apesar de, em alguns casos, ela ter sido extremamente reduzida. A imunogenicidade foi avaliada pela imunização de camundongos com bactérias vivas, inativadas ou, quando possível, flagelina purificada. Os resultados foram similares aos descritos na {{literatura}} para inserções envolvendo a região IV, obtendo-se um elevado título de anticorpos contra flagelina. Um baixo nível de anticorpo contra o peptídeo também foi detectado para todas as novas linhagens testadas. Nossos resultados com imunização de bactérias vivas sugerem uma resposta levemente melhor ao peptídeo quando duas cópias estão presentes, mas os dados não são conclusivos. One of {{the most}} promising strategies for the <b>biotechnology</b> of <b>vaccines</b> is the development of precisely attenuated strains, which could be used as carriers of heterologous antigens. Mutants of Salmonella Typhimurium have been extensively explored to this effect, since the infection ofmice by S. Typhimurium mimics the infection of humans by S. Typhi, and the genetics of the species is extremely well known, making it easy the obtention of defined mutants with reduced pathogenicity. Mutants with auxotrofy in genes of the aromatic pathway are particularly attractive, since they need PABA and DHB to grow, and these compounds are unavailable in mammalian tissues. Flagellin, the monomer which constitutes the flagellar filament, {{has been used as a}} carrier for heterologous epitopes, inserted in a central, hypervariable region (region IV). Insertions in this region are often functional, and lead to exposition of the epitope at the filamentś surface. The present work explored the potential of the other regions ofthe molecule for the insertion of epitopes. We inserted the same reporter sequence (MS epitope from S. pyogenes M protein) in regions with different levels of homology (III and VI), and totally conserved (VIII). We also made double insertions in regions shown to be permissive (III and IV; IV and VI). All hybrid proteins were synthesized by Salmonella, as demonstrated by immunoblots using antibody against flagellin and against the synthetic peptide. All regions, except the highly conserved region VIII, accepted the insertions without loss of motility, albeit, in some cases, motility was seriously reduced. Immunogenicity of the hydrids was evaluated by immunization with live bacteria, killed bacteria, and purified flagellin (when possible). Results obtained with the new constructs were similar to the ones published for insertions involving region IV, in the sense that antibody titers to the carrier protein were very high. A low level of antibody to the inserted peptide was also detected in all groups of animals. Our results with live immunization suggest a slightly better response to the peptide when two copies are present, but the data are not conclusive...|$|R
