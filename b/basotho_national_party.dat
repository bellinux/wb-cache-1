50|$|General {{elections}} {{were held in}} Lesotho between 27 and 29 March 1993, the first full elections since the ruling <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> annulled {{the results of the}} 1970 elections, which they had lost to the Basutoland Congress Party. Of the 736,930 registered voters, 532,678 cast valid votes.|$|E
50|$|In January 1970, {{the ruling}} <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP) lost the first post-independence general elections, with 23 seats to the Basutoland Congress Party's 36. Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan refused to cede {{power to the}} Basotho Congress Party (BCP), {{declared}} himself Tona Kholo (Sesotho translation of prime minister), and imprisoned the BCP leadership.|$|E

50|$|North Korea {{was also}} {{involved}} in several armed insurgency movements in Angola, Rhodesia and in the Seychelles, and provided support to the African National Congress and South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). In 1984, 3,000 North Korean military advisers were dispatched to Angola, and later were reportedly engaged in combat operations with the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA). Around {{the same time there}} were some North Koreans in Lesotho involved in training for the Youth League of the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party's</b> Vincent Makhele faction, but they were expelled due to pressure from South Africa in early 1986.|$|R
50|$|The two Christian {{denominations}} have historic {{links to}} two {{major political parties}} in Lesotho. The Evangelicals have been aligned with the Basotho Congress Party, while the Roman Catholic Church has supported the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> Party.The Pronuncio from Pretoria represents the Holy See in the Lesotho government.|$|R
50|$|After a 1955 {{request by}} the Basutoland Council to legislate its {{internal}} affairs, in 1959 {{a new constitution}} gave Basutoland its first elected legislature. This was followed in April 1965 with general legislative elections with universal adult suffrage in which the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP) won 31 and the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) won 25 of the 65 seats contested.|$|E
50|$|The Catholic Church {{helped found}} the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP) in 1959 and {{sponsored}} it in the independence elections in 1966. Most members of the BNP are practicing Catholics. The BNP ruled the country from independence in 1966 until 1985 when it was overthrown in a military coup. The then-opposition Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) historically has been aligned with the Protestant Lesotho Evangelical Church.|$|E
50|$|After the 2012 election, Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili's Democratic Congress {{failed to}} attain a majority; and thus a {{coalition}} government was formed among the three opposition parties: All Basotho Convention (ABC), Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BCP). The government was led by ABC's Tom Thabane, {{who served as the}} new Prime Minister; whilst the leader of LCD, Mothetjoa Metsing was appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the bilateral relationship with Lesotho, some 50 <b>Basotho</b> <b>nationals</b> have been educated in Soviet and Russian universities. Some of these graduates are employed in senior positions in the government of Lesotho, the most prominent of whom is Monyane Moleleki, the Basotho foreign minister, who graduated from Moscow State University. Since 1996, the Russian government provides to Lesotho, scholarships for three Basotho citizens to obtain basic higher education, and one scholarship for a Basotho citizen to study in graduate school.|$|R

50|$|Lekhanya {{then became}} {{leader of the}} <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP), an {{opposition}} party, replacing Retselisitsoe Sekhonyana, which {{had only a few}} seats in the parliament and, according to Lekhanya, was the victim of fraud in several elections. Lekhanya was elected as Party Leader of the BNP at its Conference in March 1999, and he was re-elected as Party Leader at the BNP Conference held on March 31 - April 1, 2001.|$|E
50|$|Mosalemane is a {{constituency}} in Lesotho with 14,001 registered voters. The constituency was won in 1965 by <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP) member J K Rampeta. In 1970 it was won also by BNP {{even though the}} 1970 elections were marred by violence. In 1993 Lijane Selikane won the election as member of the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP). He further won it in 1998 and 2002 under a new party Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD).|$|E
50|$|A new flag, {{designed}} by Sergeant Retšelisitsoe Matete, was adopted on January 20, 1987, following {{a military coup}} which ousted the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> after 20 years in power. A light brown traditional Basotho shield along with an assegai (lance) and knobkierrie (club) replaced the Basotho hat as the primary emblem. The colour scheme and pattern changed as well, with a triangular white field standing for peace. The bottom diagonal contained a blue strip for rain and a green triangle for prosperity.|$|E

50|$|In 2005, Motsamai {{nominated}} Bereng Sekhonyana {{to represent}} Lesotho at a SADC parliamentary reform conference in Botswana. Justin Lekhanya (the {{leader of the}} <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party)</b> objected to her decision, and subsequently organised a series of protests at the National Assembly buildings. The assembly's privileges committee subsequently found that Lekhanya and four other BNP members had threatened and intimidated Motsamai, and recommended that they be suspended from parliament without pay {{for up to five}} months. Sekhonyana was assassinated two days after that finding was handed down.|$|E
50|$|After clashes and bomb {{explosions in}} May 1979, the {{situation}} once again became tense between the BCP and the ruling <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party.</b> After cabinet minister Chief Lepatoa Mou was assassinated by insurgents, the Police Mobile Unit (PMU) began retaliatory attacks, assaulting and killing civilians in Butha-Buthe District. By {{the end of}} 1979 more than 600 people had fled to South Africa. These political refugees claimed at least fifty suspected supporters of the insurgents {{had been killed by}} the government. 1980 saw many political arrests, including of at least four professors of the National University of Lesotho.|$|E
5000|$|On 30 May, ABC's Thabane {{told the}} BBC {{that he had}} formed a {{coalition}} {{to give him a}} majority in parliament. His coalition included the LCD, <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> Popular Front for Democracy and the Marematlou Freedom Party. He also said that the government's priorities would be [...] "poverty, lack of jobs, lack of school opportunities, absence of schools at the right places, lack of proper infrastructure, particularly health services. We have gone way below what we were a few years ago, and that's inexplicable. We put {{power in the hands of}} the wrong people and we are taking it away from them." ...|$|E

Simpson stood for selection as the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> candidate for Tamaki in 2004. He was married to Desley Simpson, but they split up in 2004 or 2005. Scott Simpson stood for the <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> presidency in 2009 but lost out to Peter Goodfellow; his former wife has lived with Goodfellow since September 2008.|$|R

50|$|The Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) won the {{majority}} in parliament in the 23 May 1998 general elections, leaving the once-dominant <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP) and Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) far behind in total votes. Although international observers {{as well as a}} regional commission declared the elections to have reflected the will of the people, many members of the opposition have accused the LCD of electoral fraud. The 1998 elections were the third multiparty elections in Lesotho's history. The LCD, BNP, and BCP remain the principal rival political organizations in Lesotho. Distinctions and differences in political orientation between the major parties have blurred in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|The ABC said on 6 June that it {{planned to}} form a {{government}} in coalition with the Alliance of Democrats, the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> and the Reformed Congress of Lesotho. A government statement on 8 June said that Mosisili had submitted his resignation to King Letsie but would continue in a caretaker capacity. However, on 9 June, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing, leader of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy, said that [...] "there {{is no need for}} the removal of the existing government in office" [...] and argued for the formation of [...] "a government of national unity" [...] for the sake of national stability.|$|E
50|$|Before the 2012 general election, {{the ruling}} Lesotho Congress for Democracy {{suffered}} a split because of Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili's refusal to cede power. Mosisili then founded a new party called the Ntsu Democratic Congress, {{in reference to}} the founder of the LCD, Ntsu Mokhehle. LCD Secretary-General Mothetjoa Metsing then moved to lead the LCD. Tom Thabane leads another faction that broke away in 2006, the All Basotho Convention. The LCD's Metsing said that he would not take part in a national unity government. In like measure the ABC ruled out working with the LCD. Yet after the election, the two parties, along with the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party,</b> were part of a coalition government.|$|E

50|$|Jonathan {{converted}} to Catholicism and in 1959 founded the Canadian Catholic missionary-backed Basutoland National Party (BNP), renamed <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> at independence. In the 1960 election, barely {{a year after}} its formation, Leabua's party came fourth but in the election where women were disfranchised. In the pre-independence elections of April 1965, the BNP won 31 parliamentary seats {{out of a total}} of 60 and thus became a legitimate government that eventually took Basotho to independence in October 1966, despite protests from opposition BCP and MFP who now wanted independence postponed. Chief Leabua did lose his seat and had to stand for election in a safe seat later. He took office as Prime Minister on 7 July 1965.|$|E
50|$|The NIP {{was founded}} by Anthony Manyeli as a split from the <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party.</b> It {{performed}} poorly in the 1993 and 1998 parliamentary elections, but in the election for the National Assembly held on 25 May 2002, the party won 5.5% of popular votes and five out of 120 seats. The party had previously never won any seats, and its success in winning five seats through proportional representation in the 2002 election was attributed to voter confusion about party symbols: its symbol being that of the dove and {{the symbol of the}} ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) being that of the eagle. NIP party leader Manyeli, expressing surprise at the results, said that this explanation was {{the only way he could}} account for them.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent to}} which the British exerted direct control over Basutoland waxed and waned until Basutoland's {{independence}} in 1966, when it became the Kingdom of Lesotho. However, when the ruling <b>Basotho</b> <b>National</b> <b>Party</b> (BNP) lost the first post-independence general elections to the Basotho Congress Party (BCP), Leabua Jonathan refused to cede and declared himself Tona Kholo (Sesotho translation of prime minister). The BCP began an insurrection that culminated in a January 1986 military coup forced the BNP out of office. Power was transferred to King Moshoeshoe II, until then a ceremonial monarch, but forced into exile when he lost favour with the military the following year. His son was installed as King Letsie III. Conditions remained tumultuous, including an August 1994 self-coup by Letsie III, until 1998 when the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) came to power in elections which were deemed fair by international observers. Despite protests from opposition parties, the country has remained relatively stable since.|$|E
