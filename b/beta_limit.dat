Shafranov and Yurchenko first published on the issue in 1971 in a general discussion of tokamak design, but it was the work by Wesson and Sykes in 1983 and Francis Troyon in 1984 that developed these concepts fully.

50|$|Ideal MHD instabilities {{driven by}} current or {{pressure}} gradients representthe ultimate operational limit for most configurations. The long-wavelength kink mode and short-wavelengthballooning mode limits are generally well understood and can in principle be avoided.Intermediate-wavelength modes (n ~ 5 - 10 modes encountered in tokamak edge plasmas, forexample) are less well understood {{due to the}} computationally intensive nature of the stabilitycalculations. The extensive <b>beta</b> <b>limit</b> database for tokamaks is consistent with ideal MHD stability limits, yielding agreement to within about 10% in beta for cases where the internal profiles of theplasma are accurately measured. This good agreement provides confidence in ideal stabilitycalculations for other configurations and {{in the design of}} prototype fusion reactors.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lower}} overall fields, an RFP reactor might not need superconducting magnets. This is a large {{advantage}} over tokamaks since superconducting magnets are delicate and expensive and so must be shielded from the Neutron rich fusion environment. RFPs are susceptible to surface instabilities and so require a close fitting shell. Some experiments (such as the Madison Symmetric Torus) use their close fitting shell as a magnetic coil by driving current through the shell itself. This is attractive from a reactor standpoint since a solid copper shell (for example) would be fairly robust against high energy neutrons, compared with superconducting magnets. There is also no established <b>beta</b> <b>limit</b> for RFPs. There exists a possibility that a reversed field pinch could achieve ignition solely with ohmic power (by driving current through the plasma and generating heat from electrical resistance, rather than through electron cyclotron resonance heating), which would be much simpler than tokamak designs, though {{it could not be}} operated in steady state.|$|E
50|$|The most {{fundamental}} and critical stability issue for magnetic fusion {{is simply that}} MHD instabilities often limit performance at high beta. In most cases the important instabilities are long wavelength, global modes, because {{of their ability to}} cause severe degradation of energy confinement or termination of the plasma. Some important examples that are common to many magnetic configurations are ideal kink modes, resistive wall modes, and neoclassical tearing modes. A possible consequence of violating stability boundaries is a disruption, a sudden loss of thermal energy often followed by termination of the discharge. The key issue thus includes understanding the nature of the <b>beta</b> <b>limit</b> in the various configurations, including the associated thermal and magnetic stresses, and finding ways to avoid the limits or mitigate the consequences. A wide range of approaches to preventing such instabilities is under investigation, including optimization of the configuration of the plasma and its confinement device, control of the internal structure of the plasma, and active control of the MHD instabilities.|$|E

These configurations are drift-optimized tokamak-stellarator hybrids with a high shear tokamak-like rotational transform profile primarily from a self-consistent bootstrap current. The role of the modular coils {{is to reduce the}} bootstrap current to only 1 / 3 - 1 / 5 of that in an equivalent tokamak. Self-consistent bootstrap current profiles {{have been obtained}} for plasma pressures in the range 2 % < < 23 %. These configurations have strong magnetic wells and consequently high interchange stability <b>beta</b> <b>limits</b> up to = 23 %. Because of the reduced bootstrap current, these configurations are stable to low-n ideal MHD kink modes with no wall stabilization for values of (~ 11 %) significantly larger than in an equivalent advanced tokamak. The combination of high <b>beta</b> <b>limits</b> and low bootstrap current in this hybrid device yields a Troyon factor (~ 19) that is much larger than that for advanced tokamaks. The |B| spectrum exhibits approximately poloidally symmetry which results in good neoclassical confinement.

50|$|The second (and {{perhaps more}} scientifically important) {{goal of the}} EBW {{experiment}} is to drive electric current in aprescribed place within the plasma. The main plasma current distributes itself naturally, and the plasma tends to concentrate currentinto the center, leaving less current near the edge. This can lead to instability of the plasma. It has been shown (boththeoretically and by experiments in the Madison Symmetric Torus) that driving current in the edge makes the plasma more stable to fluctuations in the magnetic field, resulting in better confinement of the hot plasma and leading to much higher temperature. Using the EBW to drive thisstabilizing current {{would be a very}} important scientific result. The ability to deposit very specifically the auxiliary currentgives us the opportunity to optimize our current drive schemes. The heating is also very localized, allowing us to study how hot (at least locally) the plasma can become within this magnetic confinement scheme — in plasma physics terms, this is called finding the <b>beta</b> <b>limit.</b> This is an unanswered question for the RFP and will give insight on whether or not this type of machine could be scaled up to a cost effective, efficient fusion reactor.|$|E

Broken symmetry, i. e., deviations from axisymmetry, in the stellarator magnetic field geometry causes localization of the ballooning mode eigenfunction, and gives rise to new types of nonsymmetric eigenvalue isosurfaces in both the stable and unstable spectrum. For eigenvalues far above the marginal point, isosurfaces are topologically spherical, indicative of strong ''quantum chaos.

40|$|Passing alpha {{particles}} in a Helias reactor (major radius 22 m, plasma radius 1. 8 m, magnetic field 5 T) are well confined if only Coulomb collisions perturb the particle orbits and neoclassical diffusion {{is the only}} transport process. In a turbulent plasma close to the <b>beta</b> <b>limit</b> particle orbits can become chaotic and enhanced losses of these particles may arise thus diminishing the alpha particle heating rate. The paper describes the guiding center orbits of passing {{particles in}} the magnetic field of the Helias reactor, where islands of the magnetic surfaces occur at the boundary. Drift surfaces also exhibit these islands, however, resonance surfaces with islands in drift surfaces can also exist inside the plasma. Numerically the rotational transform of the drift orbits has been computed verifying this feature. Using a mapping technique, the long term behaviour of the drift orbits is analysed {{taking into account the}} variation of energy due to plasma oscillations. This leads to two coupled area-preserving maps, which describe enhanced radial transport of particles satisfying the resonance condition. In phase space the anomalous transport occurs along the resonance lines of the Arnold web. The energy of the particles can vary in a chaotic manner if the amplitude of the oscillations is large enough. In model calculations it is shown that resonant alpha particles can be rapidly lost by Arnold diffusion If this loss of alpha particles only occurs at the <b>beta</b> <b>limit,</b> it may help to stabilize the operation point against thermal instability by reducing the heating power. If drift waves contribute to alpha particles losses way below the <b>beta</b> <b>limit,</b> the Arnold diffusion, this anomalous loss is threatening the ignition in the Helias reactor. (orig.)
