5|$|<b>Barges</b> {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These <b>barges</b> could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills were typically installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. <b>Barges</b> were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice <b>barges</b> in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the <b>barges,</b> sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the <b>barges</b> left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These <b>barges</b> managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which was between the two <b>barges</b> and the warship. The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E
5|$|Traffic increased, {{as shown}} by the number of boats {{belonging}} to residents of Arundel. There were 13 in 1801, which had increased to 15 by 1803, with a total tonnage of 266. A timber merchant called John Boxold owned <b>barges</b> in 1815 and 1832, while in 1820, a company began running regular freight services to London, using three <b>barges</b> based near the town quay. By 1823 they had ten <b>barges,</b> which had reduced to seven by 1830, and <b>barges</b> ran twice-weekly to Chichester, London, Midhurst, and Petworth. The company was variously called Seward and Co., The Arundel Barge Co., and several other names.|$|E

50|$|Here, three {{tracks are}} {{provided}} for loading the <b>barge.</b> On the <b>barge</b> the three tracks are spread to allow clearance for the freight cars. The slip consists of pilings and guide boards to accurately position the <b>barge</b> {{relative to the}} apron. Once the <b>barge</b> is located properly, links are lowered from the apron to engage hooks on the <b>barge,</b> locking the linkspan and <b>barge</b> together.|$|R

5|$|Around 2 pm, the British <b>barges</b> {{carrying}} artillery floated {{down the}} La Chute River, and, contrary to plan, came down a channel between {{an island in}} the La Chute and the shore. This brought them within range of the French left and some of the fort's guns. Fire from cannons on the fort's southwest bastion's sank two of the <b>barges,</b> spurring the remaining vessels to retreat.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for <b>Barges</b> Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of <b>barges,</b> which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel <b>barges.</b>|$|E
5|$|In April 1798, Muskein {{was ordered}} to prepare a {{squadron}} of his <b>barges</b> for {{an attack on the}} Saint Marcouf Islands. The operation was intended simultaneously to eradicate the British garrison and restore French control of the raiding base, test the effectiveness of the <b>barges</b> in a military amphibious operation, and focus British naval attention on the English Channel and away from Bonaparte's preparations at Toulon for the invasion of Egypt. On 7April 1978, Muskein sailed from Le Havre with 33 <b>barges</b> under the command of General Point, but on 8April he found his passage blocked by the British frigates HMS Diamond under Captain Sir Richard Strachan and HMS Hydra under Captain Sir Francis Laforey. At 16:00the frigates cornered the <b>barges</b> in the mouth of the River Orne and opened fire, but Diamond grounded soon afterwards and although the frigate was brought off after darkness, neither side was able to inflict serious damage.|$|E

5|$|The {{crews of}} the American {{merchant}} vessels possessed only small arms, but their escort, Experiment, {{was a much}} more powerful vessel. Commanded by William Maley, the 135-ton Experiment was armed with 12 six-pounder guns and had a complement of 70 men. In comparison, Rigaud's initial attack force consisted of eleven <b>barges</b> crewed by 40 to 50 men each in the smaller ones, and 60 or 70 in the larger vessels. These <b>barges</b> were primarily propelled by oars, with 26 per vessel. The Haitian craft were each equipped {{with a mix of}} swivel guns and four-pounder cannon, with most vessels armed with two or three guns as well as small arms. In addition to the vessels that set out to attack the convoy, there were more <b>barges</b> and men nearby that the Haitians could call upon if reinforcements were needed. In total some 37 <b>barges</b> and 1500 men were at Rigaud's immediate disposal, though the Americans did not know this during the attack. Individually the Haitian <b>barges</b> presented only a small threat to the convoy, but when attacking en masse they could easily overwhelm and capture the American ships if they managed to board them.|$|E
5|$|An {{application}} to Parliament for a jetty {{in the following}} year was unsuccessful, but in 1860 the Upsall, Normanby & Ormesby Railway received permission for a line with access to the river, the S claim of exclusive rights to the foreshore having been rejected. The jetty was also opposed by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners and they moored <b>barges</b> along the foreshore to obstruct construction. In {{what became known as the}} Battle of the Tees, a fight broke out when a steam tug sent by the Commissioners interrupted men moving the <b>barges.</b> The <b>barges</b> were successfully moved, but a more serious fight developed the following night when three of the Commissioners' steam tugs arrived. The police then kept watch on the works until they were finished.|$|E
5|$|At 8:30am on 24 August, Milne Bay GHQ was alerted by an RAAF Hudson bomber near Kitava Island, off the Trobriand Islands, and coastwatchers that a Japanese convoy was {{approaching}} the Milne Bay area. – escorting the transport SS Tasman– left the Milne Bay area and sailed for Port Moresby after {{learning of the}} invasion force. Reports of the second Japanese convoy, consisting of seven <b>barges,</b> which had sailed from Buna carrying the force that would land at Taupota were also received at this time. In response to this sighting, after the initially poor weather had cleared, 12 RAAF Kittyhawks were scrambled at midday. The <b>barges</b> were spotted beached near Goodenough Island where the 350 troops of the 5th Sasebo SNLF, led by Commander Tsukioka, had gone ashore to rest. The Australian pilots then proceeded to strafe the <b>barges</b> and, {{over the course of}} two hours, destroyed them all and stranded their former occupants.|$|E

5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables were in place the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall <b>barges.</b> The <b>barges</b> were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1798, Muskein {{concentrated}} over 50 of the landing <b>barges</b> in Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue and on 6May launched {{an attack on the}} Îles Saint-Marcouf while a combination of wind and tide prevented the blockade squadron from intervening. The fortified islands were too well-defended however and over 900French soldiers died in the ensuing battle before the French abandoned the attack. The French subsequently dispersed the remaining landing <b>barges</b> to various ports on the Normandy coast. In response the Royal Navy increased its patrols in the region with the intention of intercepting the convoys and destroying the <b>barges.</b> French movements along the coast were not solely confined to landing barges: on 29 May 1798 two warships, the 20 or 24-gun Confiante under captain de vaisseau Etienne Pévrieu, and the 20-gun Vésuve under lieutenant de vaisseau Jean-Baptiste-Louis Lecolier, sailed from Le Havre, travelling westwards across the Baie de la Seine to Cherbourg, accompanied by a small, armed cutter.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>barge</b> to {{be weighed}} {{was brought into}} a {{supporting}} cradle connected by levers to a weighing mechanism. The water was then drained and the scale balance adjusted to determine the <b>barge</b> gross weight. Subtracting the tare weight ({{the weight of the}} <b>barge</b> when empty) would give the cargo weight. Originally weighlocks measured the weight of the <b>barge,</b> initially by measuring the displacement of water from the lock by collecting the liquid in a separate measuring chamber after the <b>barge</b> had entered. [...] This method also requires that the unladen weight of the <b>barge</b> be known.|$|R

Of these, a small group was transported by <b>barges</b> from Giurgiu, {{on their way to}} the Austrian-ruled Svinița, near the Danube port of Orschowa. The revolutionary artist Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti, both of whom had been allowed to go free and had {{subsequently}} followed the <b>barges</b> on shore, pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of Svinița to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee.

5|$|In 1961, the British Transport Commission, {{together}} with the British Iron and Steel Federation and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce considered plans to upgrade the navigation to handle 250-tonne <b>barges,</b> and work started on new wharfs and warehouses at Rotherham. Control of the navigation passed on again in 1963, this time to the British Waterways Board, who submitted a proposal to the government for a £2.5million upgrade, covering the stretch from Bramwith to Rotherham. This would have involved the construction of ten new locks, each , to replace the existing 12 locks. The new main line would then {{have been the same}} size as the Aire and Calder Navigation, although some of the bridges would have had less clearance. In 1972, a further proposal for a £2million scheme to upgrade the waterway to handle 700-tonne <b>barges</b> up to Mexborough, and 400-tonne <b>barges</b> from there to Rotherham was submitted to the Department of the Environment.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the {{historic}} {{status of the}} <b>barges</b> was {{a concern for the}} Port Authority of Bridgeport Harbor, as the sunken ships interfered with a billion-dollar redevelopment project. Over the years, the <b>barges</b> had deteriorated so that a salvage operation would likely result in them breaking apart. No action had been taken by 2003, but a report noted that prior to any activity of the Berkshire No. 7, the Federal Transit Administration and/or the City of Bridgeport should document the barge with photos and a technical description. Specifics regarding the documentation based on the activity would be archived at the State Historic Preservation Office and the Mystic Seaport Museum.|$|E
5|$|On 25 October 1960, {{in thick}} fog {{and a strong}} tide, two <b>barges</b> (named the Arkendale H and Wastdale H) which had {{overshot}} Sharpness Dock, collided {{with one of the}} columns of the bridge after being carried upstream. Two bridge spans collapsed into the river. As they fell, parts of the structure hit the <b>barges</b> causing the fuel oil and petroleum they were carrying to catch fire. Five people died in the incident.|$|E
5|$|Other notable actions {{included}} {{strikes on}} convoys by No. 42 Squadron RAF. On 10 October it attacked heavily defended convoys off Cherbourg, Dieppe and Le Havre. A 2,500 ton German transport was sunk and one enemy fighter was destroyed, but the squadron lost 66 {{percent of its}} aircraft that embarked on the mission. No. 217 took part in attacks on Luftwaffe airfields in France, and Nos. 224, 269 and 42 Squadrons made attacks on Norwegian rail targets late in the year. Anti-barge operations were also carried out. These ships were to transport German Army units to Britain. On 13 September, they carried out another large raid on the Channel ports, sinking 80 large <b>barges</b> in the port of Ostend. Some 84 <b>barges</b> were sunk in Dunkirk after another raid on 17 September and by 19 September, almost 200 <b>barges</b> had been sunk.|$|E
