5|$|The Moon {{is visible}} {{for two weeks}} every 27.3 days at the North and South Pole. The Moon's light is used by {{zooplankton}} in the Arctic {{when the sun is}} <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> for months on end.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> for the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Fata Morgana, {{a type of}} mirage, may be {{responsible}} for some flying saucers sightings, by displaying objects located <b>below</b> <b>the</b> astronomical <b>horizon</b> hovering in <b>the</b> sky, and magnifying and distorting them.|$|R
50|$|Fata Morgana {{is a type}} of mirage {{responsible}} for some UFO sightings, by making objects located <b>below</b> <b>the</b> astronomical <b>horizon</b> appear to be hovering in the sky. It also magnifies images and makes them look unrecognizable.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{synchronous}} {{rotation of}} the Moon about the Earth, Earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface. Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon, other than at selected places near the Moon's limb, where libration carries the Earth slightly above and <b>below</b> <b>the</b> lunar <b>horizon.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Kepler's {{calculations}} {{indicated that}} the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent, he was not fully confident of his prediction, and advised that European astronomers {{should be prepared to}} observe the event. Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but, as predicted, the Sun was <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> during the transit. According to modern calculations, observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean {{should have been able to}} view the last stage of the transit, but no such observations were recorded. Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and, as the next full transit was not expected for another 121years, Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas.|$|E
5|$|Andromeda {{is one of}} the 48 constellations {{listed by}} the 2nd-century Greco-Roman {{astronomer}} Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40° south latitude; for observers farther south it lies <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> It {{is one of the}} largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. This is over 1,400 times the size of the full moon, 55% of the size of the largest constellation, Hydra, and over 10 times the size of the smallest constellation, Crux.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or stellar system) to the Sun as of 2014. Its proximity makes {{it one of the}} most studied stars of its spectral type. Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus, about 3° east of the slightly brighter star Delta Eridani. With a declination of −9.46°, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth's surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of latitude 80°N is it permanently hidden <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> The apparent magnitude of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by light pollution.|$|E
50|$|When {{a rainbow}} appears above {{a body of}} water, two {{complementary}} mirror bows may be seen <b>below</b> and above <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> originating from different light paths. Their names are slightly different.|$|R
6000|$|Lu-don paled. [...] "It is sacrilege," [...] he cried; [...] "for countless ages {{have the}} priests of the Great God offered each night a {{life to the}} spirit of Jad-ben-Otho as it {{returned}} <b>below</b> <b>the</b> western <b>horizon</b> to its master, and never has the Great God given sign that he was displeased." ...|$|R
50|$|Some stars, {{when viewed}} from a {{particular}} latitude on Earth, do not rise or set. These are circumpolar stars, which are either always in the sky or never. For example, the North Star is not visible in Australia and the Southern Cross is not seen in Europe, because they always stay <b>below</b> <b>the</b> respective <b>horizons.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as light pollution or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to light pollution.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{may be seen}} by {{observers}} at a latitude of 50° to 65°. They seldom {{occur at}} lower latitudes (although there have been sightings {{as far south as}} Paris, Utah, Italy, Turkey and Spain), and closer to the poles it does not get dark enough for the clouds to become visible. They occur during summer, from mid-May to mid-August in the northern hemisphere and between mid-November and mid-February in the southern hemisphere. They are very faint and tenuous, and may be observed only in twilight around sunrise and sunset when the clouds of the lower atmosphere are in shadow, but the noctilucent cloud is illuminated by the Sun. They are best seen when the Sun is between 6° and 16° <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> Although noctilucent clouds occur in both hemispheres, they have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but fewer than 100 times in the southern. Southern hemisphere noctilucent clouds are fainter and occur less frequently; additionally the southern hemisphere has a lower population and less land area from which to make observations.|$|E
5|$|The first EC-137 {{made its}} maiden flight on 9 February 1972, with the fly-off {{between the two}} radars taking place during March–July that year. Favorable test results led to the {{selection}} of Westinghouse's radar for the production aircraft. Hughes's radar was initially {{thought to be a}} certain winner, simply because much of its design was also going into the new F-15 Eagle's radar program. The Westinghouse radar used a pipelined fast fourier transform (FFT) to digitally resolve 128 Doppler frequencies, while Hughes's radars used analog filters based on the design for the F-15 fighter. Westinghouse's engineering team won this competition by using a programmable 18-bit computer whose software could be modified before each mission. This computer was the AN/AYK-8 design from the B-57G program, and designated AYK-8-EP1 for its much expanded memory. This radar also multiplexed a beyond-the-horizon (BTH) pulse mode that could complement the pulse-Doppler radar mode. This proved to be beneficial especially when the BTH mode is used to detect ships at sea when the radar beam is directed <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fata Morgana mirages may {{continue}} to trick some observers and are still sometimes mistaken for otherworldly objects such as UFOs.A Fata Morgana can display an object that is located <b>below</b> <b>the</b> astronomical <b>horizon</b> as an apparent object hovering in the sky. A Fata Morgana can also magnify such an object vertically and make it look absolutely unrecognizable.|$|R
40|$|A {{stationary}} {{solution of}} the Dirac equation in the metric of a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole has been found. Only one stationary regular state outside the black hole event horizon and only one stationary regular state <b>below</b> <b>the</b> Cauchy <b>horizon</b> are shown to exist. The normalization integral of the wave functions diverges on both <b>horizons</b> if <b>the</b> black hole is non-extremal. This means that the solution found can be only the asymptotic limit of a nonstationary solution. In contrast, {{in the case of}} an extremal black hole, the normalization integral is finite and the stationary regular solution is physically self-consistent. The existence of quantum levels <b>below</b> <b>the</b> Cauchy <b>horizon</b> can affect <b>the</b> final stage of Hawking black hole evaporation and opens up the fundamental possibility of investigating the internal structure of black holes using quantum tunneling between external and internal states.

25|$|The stars within Crux {{were known}} to the Ancient Greeks, where Ptolemy {{regarded}} {{them as part of}} the constellation Centaurus. They were entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC. However, the precession of the equinoxes gradually lowered <b>the</b> stars <b>below</b> <b>the</b> European <b>horizon,</b> and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes. By AD 400, most of the stars in the constellation we now call Crux never rose above <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> for Athenians.|$|R
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> for close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{inclination}} of the moon's orbit, {{the moon is}} above the horizon at the North and South Pole for almost two weeks every month, even though the sun is <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> for six months at a time. The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is quite close to the sidereal period, or 27.3 days. When the sun is the furthest <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> (winter solstice), the moon will be full when it is at its highest point.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy {{wrote on}} the {{atmospheric}} refraction {{of light in the}} context of astronomical observations. In 1021, Alhazen showed that atmospheric refraction is also responsible for twilight; he estimated that twilight begins when the sun is 19 degrees <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> and also used a geometric determination based on this to estimate the maximum possible height of the Earth's atmosphere as 52,000 passim (about 49 miles, or 79km).|$|E
50|$|Contrary to IRAS, no science {{data was}} {{recorded}} on-board ISO for later transmission to the ground.

5000|$|In modern cockpits, the {{localizer}} {{is seen as}} {{a colored}} dot (usually {{in the shape of a}} diamond) at the bottom of <b>the</b> artificial <b>horizon</b> gauge. It does not appear during cruise, but comes up during the descent and approach to the selected runway, provided that the navigation radio is set to the ILS frequency of that specific runway. If the transmitted localizer beam, which usually, but not always, is directed in the heading of the runway extension. (exceptions exist, for instance, in Innsbruck, Austria and in Macao, China)If the aircraft is located on this line, the localizer dot will appear in the middle of the scale. But if the aircraft is located a little left of the beam, the marker will appear to the right on the localizer gauge scale in cockpit. The pilot then knows he or she must adjust the heading towards the dot. In older cockpits, <b>the</b> localizer scale <b>below</b> <b>the</b> artificial <b>horizon</b> is rather short. But in older style cockpit instrumentation, the localizer also appears as an arrow in <b>the</b> gyro compass <b>below</b> <b>the</b> artificial <b>horizon.</b> <b>The</b> top and bottom of this arrow [...] "is one unit", which shows current heading. But the middle part of this arrow is moving independently of the aircraft's heading. The middle of that arrow could be described as being [...] "stand alone", and moves to the left if the aircraft is located to the right of localizer beam and to the right if the aircraft is located to the left of the localizer beam. When the arrow is [...] "united" [...] to a straight line, then the aircraft is following the localizer beam.

25|$|A {{circumpolar}} star is a star, as viewed from a given latitude on Earth, that never sets <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> {{due to its}} apparent proximity {{to one of the}} celestial poles. Circumpolar stars are therefore visible from said location toward the nearest pole for the entire night on every night of the year (and would be continuously visible throughout the day too, were they not overwhelmed by the Sun's glare).|$|E
25|$|The {{radar beam}} would follow a linear path in vacuum, {{but it really}} follows a {{somewhat}} curved path in the atmosphere because of the variation of the refractive index of air, that is called the radar horizon. Even when the beam is emitted parallel to the ground, it will rise above it as the Earth curvature sinks <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> Furthermore, the signal is attenuated by the medium it crosses, and the beam disperses.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy {{argued that}} the Earth was a sphere {{in the center of}} the universe, from the simple {{observation}} that half the stars were above the horizon and half were <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> at any time (stars on rotating stellar sphere), and the assumption that the stars were all at some modest distance from the center of the universe. If the Earth was substantially displaced from the center, this division into visible and invisible stars would not be equal.|$|E
50|$|Sandstone {{deposits}} {{are contained}} within medium to coarse-grained sandstones deposited in a continental fluvial or marginal marine sedimentary environment. Impermeable shale or mudstone units are interbedded in the sedimentary sequence and often occur immediately above and <b>below</b> <b>the</b> mineralised <b>horizon.</b> Uranium is mobile under oxidising conditions and precipitates under reducing conditions, {{and thus the}} presence of a reducing environment is essential for the formation of uranium deposits in sandstone.|$|R
50|$|The {{lower limit}} should {{relate to the}} depth of rooting to be {{expected}} for perennial plants assuming that soil moisture conditions and soil chemistry are not limiting. In some soils the lower limit of the solum can be set only arbitrarily {{and needs to be}} defined in relation to the particular soil. For example, horizons of carbonate accumulation are easily visualized as part of the solum in many soils in arid and semiarid environments. To conceive of hardened carbonate accumulations extending for 5 meters or more <b>below</b> <b>the</b> B <b>horizon</b> as part of the solum is more difficult. Gleyed soil material begins in some soils a few centimeters <b>below</b> <b>the</b> surface and continues practically unchanged to a depth of many meters. Gleying immediately <b>below</b> <b>the</b> A <b>horizon</b> is likely {{to be related to the}} processes of soil formation in the modern soil. At great depth, gleying is likely to be relict or related to processes that are more geological than pedological. Much the same kind of problem exists in some deeply weathered soils in which the deepest material penetrated by roots is very similar to the weathered material at much greater depth.|$|R

25|$|The term {{circumpolar}} constellation is {{used for}} any constellation that, from a particular latitude on Earth, never sets <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b> From the North Pole or South Pole, all constellations south or north of the celestial equator are circumpolar constellations. Depending on the definition, equatorial constellations may include those that lie entirely between declinations 45° north and 45° south, or those that pass through the declination range of the ecliptic or zodiac ranging between 23½° north, the celestial equator, and 23½° south.|$|E
25|$|Tools are {{provided}} {{by a number of}} websites such as Heavens-Above (see Live viewing below) as well as smartphone applications that use the known orbital data and the observer's longitude and latitude to predict when the ISS will be visible (weather permitting), where the station will appear to rise to the observer, the altitude above the horizon it will reach and the duration of the pass before the station disappears to the observer either by setting <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> or entering into Earth's shadow.|$|E
