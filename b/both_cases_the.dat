5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, hyporeflexia, chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
5|$|Al-Baqi cemetery, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} two most {{important}} Islamic graveyards located in Medina, Saudi Arabia, was demolished in 1806 and, following reconstruction in the mid-19th century, was destroyed again in 1925 or 1926. An alliance of the House of Saud, and the followers of the Wahhabi movement known as the Emirate of Diriyah, carried out the first demolition. The Sultanate of Nejd, also ruled by the House of Saud and followers of Wahhabism, carried out the second. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> actors were motivated by the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, which prohibits the building of monuments on graves.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
5|$|Both {{cases were}} {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appealsthen the highest court in Kentuckyin 1823. In the case of Blair, the debt relief {{position}} was argued by George M. Bibb, while the anti-relief position was represented by Robert Wickliffe. In Lapsley, Wickliffe joined George Robertson and Ben Hardin to represent the anti-relief position, while the relief position was argued by John Rowan and William T. Barry. Chief Justice John Boyle wrote the majority opinion in Blair on October 8, 1823, and Associate Justice William Owsley issued the court's opinion in Lapsley three days later. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> anti-relief position was upheld.|$|E

In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> removed contestants were unreplaced. Fiji and San Juan del Sur proceeded with an uneven gender balance.

5|$|It {{has already}} proven {{difficult}} {{to be recognized as}} having standing when a fix is not used for a controversial appointment. The courts have dismissed suits contesting the appointments of Justice Hugo Black (Ex parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633 (1937)) and Judge Abner Mikva (McClure v. Carter, 454 U.S. 1025 (1981)). Black and Mikva were members of Congress (Black of the Senate, Mikva of the House of Representatives) prior to appointment were appointed without a Saxbe fix. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> courts held that the plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the appointment. Other than these cases, most attempts to gain standing have been considered frivolous lawsuits brought by fringe groups.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln had {{not been}} asked or {{informed}} about either Vallandigham's arrest or {{the closure of the}} Chicago Times. He remembered the section of General Order No. 38 which declared that offenders would be banished to enemy lines and finally decided {{that it was a good}} idea; so Vallandigham was freed from jail and sent to Confederate hands. Meanwhile, Lincoln ordered the Chicago Times to be reopened and announced that Burnside had exceeded his authority in <b>both</b> <b>cases.</b> <b>The</b> President then issued a warning that generals were not to arrest civilians or close down newspapers again without the White House's permission.|$|E

5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a hierarchy of being, and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E
5|$|Some Anglo-Saxon kings {{are known}} to have been killed by their {{households}} or in open warfare against rivals, but overall the record is very sparse. The evidence as regards the deposition of kings is equally limited. Only two eighth-century depositions offer any context, those of Æthelwald Moll in Northumbria and Sigeberht of Wessex. In <b>both</b> <b>cases</b> <b>the</b> decision is presented as that of some form of council.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 series allowed {{each team}} {{to make use}} of a 19-man active roster. Exceptions were made in two cases that allowed teams' active rosters to expand to 21players, both times for the same reason. Two games during the season had to be {{postponed}} because of poor weather. Both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season; make-up games were scheduled {{at the start of the}} return series between the teams, and this resulted in two four-game series. In <b>both</b> <b>cases,</b> <b>the</b> teams had a 19-man roster for the make-up game, and an expanded 21-man roster for the originally scheduled series.|$|E
