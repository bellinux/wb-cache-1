40|$|The main {{option pricing}} bounds in the {{literature}} were originally obtained through various disparate methods. I show that those bounds {{can be derived from}} a single analytical framework. The key to this synthesis lies in the use of a general expression {{for the price of a}} call option depending on the corresponding <b>put</b> option's <b>discount</b> factor. Although the <b>put's</b> <b>discount</b> factor is unknown, it can be bounded from below. I use this lower bound on the <b>put's</b> <b>discount</b> factor to derive traditional lower bounds for call prices. In addition, I extend the literature by finding a new tighter lower bound. 2003 The Southern Finance Association and the Southwestern Finance Association. ...|$|R

Therefore, judges tend to overly weigh advice from advisors that is similar to their own viewpoint regardless of what sort of expertise an advisor appears to have. Conversely, if the advice given is very dissimilar to the judge’s initial opinions, that advice will be discounted much more than should be justified given the advisor’s level of expertise.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} index of spatial uncertainty is defined, which measures {{the degree of}} diversity faced by potential movers in a destination choice set. As a result of variations in attractiveness and distance, destinations are considered to exert varying degrees of spatial dominance on origins and to compete on that basis {{for the attention of}} would-be movers. It is hypothesized that at origins where dominances are more uniform, there is 'less to choose' among destinations and it is more difficult to predict accurately spatial interaction (and vice versa). The <b>basic</b> concept <b>put</b> forth is that spatial uncertainty and the spatial interaction-model performance are related to the relative location of origins with respect to destinations.
