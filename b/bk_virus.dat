25|$|Infection with viral {{pathogens}} can induce anti-dsDNA antibodies transiently. Human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19 and <b>BK</b> <b>virus</b> {{are known}} to induce these antibodies.|$|E
25|$|The <b>BK</b> <b>virus</b> rarely causes disease but is {{typically}} associated with patients {{who have had a}} kidney transplant; many people who are infected with this virus are asymptomatic.

40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} region of human polyoma virus JC DNA between 0. 5 and 0. 7 map units from a unique EcoRI cleavage site was determined and {{compared with those of}} the corresponding regions of another human polyoma <b>virus,</b> <b>BK,</b> and simian <b>virus</b> 40 DNAs. Within this region consisting of 945 base pairs, we located the origin of DNA replication near 0. 7 map units, the entire coding region for small T antigen, and the splice junctions for large-T-antigen mRNA. The deduced amino acid sequences for small T antigen and the part of large T antigen markedly resembled those of polyoma <b>virus</b> <b>BK</b> and simian <b>virus</b> 40. The results strongly suggest that polyoma virus JC has the same organization of early genome as polyoma <b>virus</b> <b>BK</b> and simian <b>virus</b> 40 on the physical map, with the EcoRI site as a reference point...|$|R
40|$|Classic human polyomaviruses (JC and <b>BK</b> <b>viruses)</b> become {{pathogenic}} when reactivating from latency. For {{the rare}} skin disease trichodysplasia spinulosa, {{we show that}} manifestations of the causative polyomavirus (TSPyV) occur during primary infection of the immunosuppressed host. High TSPyV loads in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, sometimes coinciding with cerebral lesions and neuroendocrine symptoms, marked the acute phase of trichodysplasia spinulosa, whereas initiation and maturation of TSPyV seroresponses occurred in the convalescent phase. TSPyV genomes lacked the rearrangements typical for reactivating polyomaviruses. These findings demonstrate the clinical importance of primary infection with this rapidly expanding group of human viruses and explain the rarity of some novel polyomavirus-associated diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of cleavage sites and their related sequences have been analyzed for 54 restriction endonucleases in the genome of human mitochondrial DNA; in three papova <b>viruses,</b> <b>BK,</b> simian <b>virus</b> 40, and polyoma; and in three bacteriophages, phi X 174, fd, and G 4. The {{results show that}} the cleavage sites and related sequences for most of the restriction enzymes tested are distributed nonrandomly. These results (i) constitute prima facie evidence for the action of natural selection, either direct or indirect on the restriction sites, and (ii) suggest that estimates of phylogenetic relationship, based on a phenetic approach using restriction enzyme data, will be biased...|$|R
25|$|Infections {{due to the}} {{immunosuppressant}} drugs used {{in people}} with kidney transplants most commonly occur in mucocutaneous areas (41%), the urinary tract (17%) and the respiratory tract (14%). The most common infective agents are bacterial (46%), viral (41%), fungal (13%), and protozoan (1%). Of the viral illnesses, the most common agents are human cytomegalovirus (31.5%), herpes simplex (23.4%), and herpes zoster (23.4%). <b>BK</b> <b>virus</b> is now being increasingly recognised. Infection {{is the cause of}} death in about one third of people with renal transplants, and pneumonias account for 50% of the patient deaths from infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of human DHODH by teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, occurs at levels (approximately 600 nM) that are achieved during treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Teriflunomide also inhibits several tyrosine kinases. Teriflunomide prevents {{the expansion of}} activated and autoimmune lymphocytes by interfering with their cell cycle progression while nonlymphoid cells are able to use another pathway to make their ribonucleotides by use of salvage pyrimidine pathway, which makes them less dependent on de novo synthesis. Teriflunomide also has antiviral effects against numerous viruses including CMV, HSV1 and the <b>BK</b> <b>virus,</b> which it achieves by inhibiting viral replication by interfering with nucleocapsid tegumentation and hence virion assembly.|$|E

40|$|We provide in {{this chapter}} an {{overview}} of the basic steps to reconstruct evolutionary relationships through standard phylogeny estimation approaches as well as network approaches for sequences more closely related. We discuss the importance of sequence alignment, selecting models of evolution, and confidence assessment in phylogenetic inference. We also introduce the reader to a variety of software packages used for such studies. Finally, we demonstrate these approaches throughout using a data set of 33 whole genomes of polyomaviruses. A robust phylogeny of these genomes is estimated and phylogenetic relationships among the polyomaviruses determined using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Furthermore, population samples of SV 40 are used to demonstrate the utility of network approaches for closely related sequences. The phylogenetic analysis suggested a close relationship among the <b>BK</b> <b>viruses,</b> JC viruses, and SV 40 with a more distant association with mouse polyomavirus, monkey polymavirus (LPV) and then avian polyomavirus (BFDV) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{understand}} the unusual cytogenetic damage earlier encountered in the Yanomama Indians, plasma samples from 425 Amerindians representing 14 tribes have been tested for hemagglutination inhibition antibodies to the human JC polyoma virus and from 369 Amerinds from 13 tribes for hemagglutination inhibition antibodies to the human <b>BK</b> polyoma <b>virus.</b> There is for both viruses highly significant heterogeneity between tribes for the prevalence of serum antibody titers ≥ 1 / 40, the pattern of infection suggesting that these two viruses only relatively recently have been introduced into some of these tribes. Some of these samples, from populations with no known exposure to the simian polyoma virus SV 40, also were tested for antibodies to this virus by using an immunospot assay. In contrast {{to the findings of}} Brown et al. (Brown, P., Tsai, T. & Gajdusek, D. C. (1975) Am. J. Epidemiol. 102, 331 – 340), none of the samples was found to possess antibodies to SV 40. In addition, no significant titers to SV 40 were found in a sample of 97 Japanese adults, many of whom had been found to exhibit elevated titers to the JC and <b>BK</b> <b>viruses.</b> This study thus suggests that these human sera contain significant antibody titers to the human polyoma <b>viruses</b> JC and <b>BK</b> but do not appear to contain either cross-reactive antibodies to SV 40 or primary antibodies resulting from SV 40 infection...|$|R
40|$|Human polyomaviruses JC and BK {{belongs to}} the group of small non-enveloped DNA viruses, and are {{widespread}} in the human population. After usually asymptomatic primary infection subsequently persist throughout life in the body in a state of persistence. Thus, this thesis aims to summarize present knowledge concerning the involvement of immune mechanisms involved in immune surveillance against persistent JC and <b>BK</b> <b>viruses.</b> The published findings show that the immune surveillance against human polyomaviruses is a very complex process where an important factor is the involvement and cooperation of non-specific and specific immune defense. Long-term immune surveillance against persistent viruses is mainly mediated by specific T lymphocytes. If this immune surveillance disrupted, it can lead to reactivation of the virus. The change in cytokine environment and the genetic makeup of an individual are another important factors in cases of reactivation. The two human polyomaviruses were developed mechanisms that allow them seemed to partially escape immune surveillance. It also raises the question whether this immune escape contribute to induce tumorigenesis...|$|R

2500|$|It is {{not known}} how this virus is transmitted. It is known, however, that the virus is spread from person to person, and not from an animal source. It has been {{suggested}} that this virus may be transmitted through respiratory fluids or urine, since infected individuals periodically excrete virus in the urine. [...] A survey of 400 healthy blood donors was reported as showing that 82% were positive for IgG against <b>BK</b> <b>virus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{that leaves}} {{the body of a}} healthy person is close to being sterile and {{requires}} much less treatment for pathogen removal than feces or fecal sludge. However, a contamination of urine with fecal pathogens is possible if the UDDT is not used correctly, i.e. when some fecal matter finds its way into the urine compartment. Also, for a few specific diseases, the relevant pathogens may be found in the urine; for example: Leptospira interrogans, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Schistosoma haematobium, <b>BK</b> <b>virus</b> or Simian virus. The Ebola virus may also be found in urine from an infected person. The exact survival time of this particular virus in human urine outside of the human body is unclear but probably [...] "up to several days" [...] like with other body fluids at room temperature.|$|E
40|$|Perez-Losada et al. [1] {{analyzed}} 72 complete genomes {{corresponding to}} nine mammalian (67 strains) and 2 avian (5 strains) polyomavirus species using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of phylogenetic inference. Because some data of 2 genomes {{in their work}} are now not available in GenBank, in this work, we analyze the phylogenetic relationship of the remaining 70 complete genomes corresponding to nine mammalian (65 strains) and two avian (5 strains) polyomavirus species using a dynamical language model approach developed by our group (Yu et al., [26]). This distance method does not require sequence alignment for deriving species phylogeny based on overall similarities of the complete genomes. Our best tree separates the bird polyomaviruses (avian polyomaviruses and goose hemorrhagic polymaviruses) from the mammalian polyomaviruses, which supports the idea of splitting the genus into two subgenera. Such a split {{is consistent with the}} different viral life strategies of each group. In the mammalian polyomavirus subgenera, mouse polyomaviruses (MPV), simian viruses 40 (SV 40), <b>BK</b> <b>viruses</b> (BKV) and JC viruses (JCV) are grouped as different branches as expected.

40|$|Therapeutic drug {{monitoring}} (TDM) of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) {{has been investigated}} using multiple linear regression (MLR) and bayesian pharmacokinetics (BAY) independently. We hypothesize that performing TDM using simultaneous MLR and BAY for guidance in MMF dose selection will decrease acute rejection and risk of toxicity. Twenty-nine renal transplant (RT) patients were prospectively enrolled into a study of CellCept® (MMF, Roche), having their mycophenolic acid (MPA) levels monitored and dose adjusted to achieve target area under the curve (AUC) level of 45 mg. hr/L (range 40 – 50 mg. hr/L). This cohort is compared to 28 control patients prescribed standard of care, fixed dose MMF. MPA monitoring {{is associated with a}} non-significant decrease rate of acute rejection (AR) by 3 months. Increased rates of <b>BK</b> polyoma <b>virus</b> (<b>BK)</b> infection were observed by 3 months. The high frequency of MMF dose decreases on day 30 and 60 is consistent with literature that MPA AUC increases with time...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{develop a}} {{sensitive}} and specific {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) based system for detecting genomic variation in JC virus. To apply this system to formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded brain tissue from patients with and without progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML). METHODS: A pair of primers (JC 1 and JC 2) were designed to be complementary to the early and late regions of JC and BK polyomaviruses, respectively. A third primer (JC 3), internal to JC 1 and JC 2, {{was designed to be}} specific for JC virus. The specificity of JC 3 was investigated by amplifying plasmids with <b>BK</b> or JC <b>virus</b> genomes. Sensitivity was estimated by titration of a plasmid containing JC virus genome. Seven brains from patients with PML (PMLB) and 30 from patients without PML (non-PMLB) were amplified using JC 1 and JC 2, followed by JC 1 and JC 3. Amplification of the beta globin gene was used as an amplification control. RESULTS: Amplification with JC 1 and JC 2 was common for JC and <b>BK</b> <b>viruses,</b> but with JC 1 and JC 3 it was specific for JC virus. The sensitivity of the system was 25 copies of JC plasmid per 10 microliters of digested tissue. Five out of seven PMLB and 28 of the 30 non-PMLB amplified for beta globin, but only the PMLB gave a signal with polyoma primers. Hypervariation of the length of the regulatory region of the JC isolates in the PML tissues was consistent with the presence of multiple strains of JC. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in the regulatory region of JC virus can be specifically and sensitively detected from routinely processed, paraffin wax embedded brain tissue. Variation in the regulatory region is common in PML derived JC strains, but JC virus was not detectable in non-PMLB tissue...|$|R
40|$|The {{hemagglutination}} inhibition antibody titers {{against the}} JC and <b>BK</b> polyoma <b>viruses</b> (JCV and BKV, respectively) are significantly elevated in individuals exhibiting "rogue" cells among their cultured lymphocytes. However, the elevation {{is so much}} greater with respect to JCV that the BKV elevation could readily be explained by cross reactivity to the capsid protein of these two closely related viruses. The JCV exhibits high sequence homology with the simian papovavirus, simian virus 40 (SV 40), and inoculation of human fetal brain cells with JCV produces polyploidy and chromosomal damage {{very similar to that}} produced by SV 40. We suggest, by analogy with the effects of SV 40, that these changes are due to the action of the viral large tumor antigen, a pluripotent DNA binding protein that acts in both transcription and replication. The implications of these findings for oncogenesis are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Opportunistic viral infections cause {{increased}} {{morbidity and}} mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, especially {{those who are not}} on antiretroviral treatment. Early diagnosis of these opportunistic viruses will be able {{to reduce the risk of}} disease progression with appropriate intervention. Materials and Methods: Multiplex PCR was attempted to detect the opportunistic herpes viruses (HSV- 1, HSV- 2, VZV, EBV, and CMV), adenovirus and polyoma <b>viruses</b> (JC and <b>BK)</b> in three cocktails of PCR reactions. Subsequently, all the viruses detected were quantitated by testing using monoplex real time PCR. Whole blood samples collected between 2006 and 2007 from 68 treatment na&# 959;ve HIV- 1 infected and 30 normal healthy individuals were tested for these eight viruses. Among the 68 HIV - 1 infected individuals 35 had CD 4 &#x 002 B; T cell count less than or equal to 200 while the other 33 had greater than 200 CD 4 &#x 002 B; T cells. Results: Among the 68 HIV- 1 infected individuals, 49 (72 &#x 0025;) were positive for EBV, 5 (7 &#x 0025;) samples were positive for CMV. All the five CMV positive individuals had CD 4 &#x 002 B; T cell count of less than or equal to 200 cells/&#x 00 B 5;L. The mean EBV load among the individuals with a CD 4 &#x 002 B; T cells of less than or equal to 200 cells/&#x 00 B 5;L was 3. 88 log 10 while among those with greater than 200 CD 4 &#x 002 B; T cells it was 3. 75 log 10. The mean CMV load was 6. 98 log 10. Three samples were positive for both CMV &#x 0026; EBV. None of the samples was positive for HSV- 1, HSV- 2, VZV, Adenovirus, JC and <b>BK</b> <b>viruses.</b> Conclusions: In our study, multiplex PCR based detection system was found useful in detecting opportunistic viruses in HIV infected individuals. Though EBV is the most prevalent opportunistic viral infection among HIV infected individuals, there was no significant association between EBV load, CD 4 &#x 002 B; T cell counts and HIV- 1 virus load. CMV was seen in HIV infected individuals with low CD 4 &#x 002 B; T cell counts (less than 200 cells/&# 956;L) ...|$|R

BKPyV is a human polyomavirus, which encodes two viral oncogenes, the large T antigen (Tag) and small t antigen (tag). 2, 3 Transformation of animal and human cells by BKPyV is operated by these two oncoproteins. Tag binds and abolishes the functions of the tumour suppressor p 53 and pRB family proteins, whereas tag interacts with the phosphatase PP 2 A, which activates the Wnt pathway.

40|$|WU polyomavirus was {{detected}} in nasopharyngeal aspirates in 2 (2. 5 %) of 79 children with respiratory infections (both infected with respiratory syncytial virus) and in 5 (6. 4 %) of 78 asymptomatic children {{during the same}} winter season in Canada. The strains were closely related to Australian and American viruses based on analysis of large T antigen (TAg) and VP 2 genes. The pathogenic role of WU virus is still uncertain. Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses that have an icosahedral capsid containing a small, circular, doublestranded DNA genome (1). These viruses {{have been identified in}} a variety of mammals and birds worldwide, and the most studied polyomavirus species infecting animals are the mouse polyomavirus (2) and the simian vacuolating (SV 40) virus (3). In 1971, 2 human polyomavirus species named <b>BK</b> and JC <b>viruses,</b> respectively, were first isolated from the urine of a kidney allograft recipient with chronic pyelonephritis and advanced renal failure (4) and from the brain of a patient with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (5). Recently, 2 new human polyomavirus members were described. The KI virus was identified in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) and feces from patients with respiratory tract infections in Sweden (6). Also, Gaynor and colleagues (7) reported the detection and molecular characterization of the WU virus in clinical respiratory samples from patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). Although the pathogenesis of <b>BK</b> and JC <b>viruses</b> has been clearly established, the role of the KI and WU viruses as respiratory pathogens has yet to be demonstrated. In this article, we report on the molecular detection and characterization of WU viruses in NPA from hospitalized children with or without respiratory tract infections...|$|R
40|$|The N-terminal 70 residue "J-domain" of the Escherichia coli DnaJ {{molecular}} chaperone is the defining and highly conserved feature {{of a large}} protein family. Based upon limited, yet significant, amino acid sequence homology to the J-domain, the DNA encoding the T/t common exon of the simian virus 40 (SV 40), JC, or <b>BK</b> polyoma <b>virus</b> T antigen oncoproteins was used to construct J-domain replacement chimeras of the E. coli DnaJ chaperone. The virally encoded J-domains successfully substituted for the bacterial counterpart in vivo as shown by (i) complementation for viability at low and high temperature of a hypersensitive bacterial reporter strain, and (ii) the restoration of bacteriophage lambda plaque forming ability in the same strain. The amino acid change, H 42 Q, in the SV 40 T/t and the JC virus T/t exon, which is positionally equivalent to the canonical dnaJ 259 H 33 Q mutation within the E. coli J-domain, entirely abolished complementing activity. These results strongly suggest that the heretofore functionally undefined viral T/t common exon represents a bona fide J-domain that preserves critical features of the characteristic domain fold essential for J-domain interaction with the ATPase domain of the Hsp 70 family.
