40|$|We apply an {{analytic}} Markov Chain Monte Carlo {{model to}} a sample of 18 AGN-driven biconical outflows that we identified from a sample of active galaxies with double-peaked narrow emission lines at z < 0. 1 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that 8 / 18 are best described as asymmetric <b>bicones,</b> 8 / 18 are nested <b>bicones,</b> and 2 / 18 are symmetric <b>bicones.</b> From the geometry and kinematics of the models, we find that these moderate-luminosity AGN outflows are large and energetic. The biconical outflows axes are randomly oriented with respect to the photometric major axis of the galaxy, implying a randomly oriented and clumpier torus to collimate the outflow, but the torus also allows some radiation to escape equatorially. We find that 16 / 18 (89 %) outflows are energetic enough to drive a two-staged feedback process in their host galaxies. All of these outflows geometrically intersect the photometric major axis of the galaxy, and 23 % of outflow host galaxies are significantly redder or have significantly lower specific star formation rates when compared to a matched sample of active galaxies.

40|$|The {{kinematics}} and morphology of {{the broad}} emission line region (BELR) of quasars {{are the subject of}} significant debate. The two leading methods for constraining BELR properties are microlensing and reverberation mapping. Here we combine these two methods with a study of the microlensing behaviour of the BELR in Q 2237 + 0305, as a change in continuum emission (a "flare") passes through it. Beginning with some generic models of the BELR - sphere, <b>bicones,</b> disk - we slice in velocity and time to produce brightness profiles of the BELR over the duration of the flare. These are numerically microlensed to determine whether microlensing of reverberation mapping provides new information about the properties of BELRs. We describe our method and show images of the models as they are flaring, and the unlensed and lensed spectra that are produced. Qualitative results and a discussion of the spectra are given in this paper, highlighting some effects that could be observed. Our conclusion is that the influence of microlensing, while not strong, can produce significant observable effects that will help in differentiating the properties of BELRs.

40|$|Using The Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph HST's STIS, {{observations}} of the OIII emission from the narrow-line region (NLR) of NGC 4151 were obtained and radial velocities determined. Five orbits of HST time were used to obtain spectra at five parallel slit configurations, at a position angle of 58 degrees, with spatial resolution 0. 2 arcseconds across and 0. 1 arcseconds along each slit. A spectral resolving power of ~ 9, 000 with the G 430 M grating gave velocity measurements accurate to ~ 34 km/s. A kinematic model was generated to match the radial velocities, for comparison to previous kinematic models of biconical radial outflow developed for low-dispersion spectra at two slit positions. The new high-resolution spectra permit the measurement of accurate velocity dispersions for each radial-velocity component. The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) reaches a maximum of 1000 km/s near the nucleus, and generally decreases with increasing distance to about 100 km/s in the extended narrow-line region (ENLR), starting at about 6 arcseconds from the nucleus. In addition to the bright emission knots, which generally fit our model, there are faint high velocity clouds which do not fit the biconical outflow pattern of our kinematic model. These faint clouds occur at the turnover points of the outflowing bright clouds. We suggest possible scenarios that could explain these rogue clouds: (1) backflow resulting from shocks and (2) outflow outside of the <b>bicones,</b> although the latter {{does not explain how}} the knots are ionized and accelerated. A comparison of our observations with a high-resolution radio map shows that {{there is no evidence that}} the kinematics of the NLR clouds are affected by the radio lobes that comprise the inner jet.

40|$|The Juno {{mission to}} Jupiter {{requires}} an antenna with a torus-shaped antenna pattern with approximately 6 dBic gain and circular polarization over the Deep Space Network (DSN) 7 -GHz transmit frequency and the 8 -GHz receive frequency. Given the large distances that accumulate en-route to Jupiter {{and the limited}} power afforded by the solar-powered vehicle, this toroidal low-gain antenna requires as much gain as possible while maintaining a beam width that could facilitate a +/- 10 deg edge of coverage. The natural antenna that produces a toroidal antenna pattern is the dipole, but the limited approx. = 2. 2 dB peak gain would be insufficient. Here a shaped variation of the standard <b>bicone</b> antenna is proposed that could achieve the required gains and bandwidths while maintaining a size that was not excessive. The final geometry that was settled on consisted of a corrugated, shaped <b>bicone,</b> which is fed by a WR 112 waveguide-to-coaxial- waveguide transition. This toroidal low-gain antenna (TLGA) geometry produced the requisite gain, moderate sidelobes, and the torus-shaped antenna pattern while maintaining a very good match over the entire required frequency range. Its "horn" geometry is also low-loss and capable of handling higher powers with large margins against multipactor breakdown. The final requirement for the antenna was to link with the DSN with circular polarization. A four-layer meander-line array polarizer was implemented; an approach that was fairly well suited to the TLGA geometry. The principal development of this work was to adapt the standard linear <b>bicone</b> such that its aperture could be increased {{in order to increase}} the available gain of the antenna. As one increases the aperture of a standard <b>bicone,</b> the phase variation across the aperture begins to increase, so the larger the aperture becomes, the greater the phase variation. In order to maximize the gain from any aperture antenna, the phase should be kept as uniform as possible. Thus, as the standard <b>bicone</b> fs aperture increases, the gain increase becomes less until one reaches a point of diminishing returns. In order to overcome this problem, a shaped aperture is used. Rather than the standard linear <b>bicone,</b> a parabolic <b>bicone</b> was found {{to reduce the amount of}} phase variation as the aperture increases. In fact, the phase variation is half of the standard linear <b>bicone,</b> which leads to higher gain with smaller aperture sizes. The antenna pattern radiated from this parabolic-shaped <b>bicone</b> antenna has fairly high side lobes. The Juno project requested that these sidelobes be minimized. This was accomplished by adding corrugations to the parabolic shape. This corrugated-shaped <b>bicone</b> antenna had reasonably low sidelobes, and the appropriate gain and beamwidth to meet project requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of microlensing in the {{profiles of the}} emission lines generated in a biconical geometry is discussed. Microlensing amplification in this anisotropic model is {{not directly related to}} the bicone’s intrinsic size but depends on the orientation of the <b>bicone</b> axis and on the cone aperture. The orientation of the projected <b>bicone</b> with respect to the shear of the magnification pattern can induce very interesting effects, like the quasi-periodic enhancements of the red/blue part of the emission line profile or the lack of correlation between the broad line region (BLR) and continuum light curves of QSOs. The emission line profiles of a BLR moving in a high caustic concentration exhibit sharp features that are well defined in wavelength. These features (spikes) correspond to the scanning of the kinematics of the BLR by the caustic clusters. The biconical model can qualitatively reproduce with a transversal (with respect to the shear) movement of the BLR, the recurrent blue-wing enhancement detected in the emission line profile of the A image of the quasar lensed system SDSS J 1004 + 4112. The probability of observing this repetitive event is almost a 2 % for a fraction of matter in stars of a 5 %. This result would make plausible the detection of the spectral variability in SDSS J 1004 + 4112 under the hypothesis of microlensing of a <b>bicone...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} model {{is used to}} investigate the radiating and receiving properties of plamr <b>bicone</b> arrays for use as ultrawideband, time-delay scanned antennas. The approach employs a hybrid of the finite element method with periodic boundary conditions to compute the electric fields in a unit cell of the assumed-inl%ite array. It is observed that the input impedance of the structure at broadside scan is very near that of 607 r Ohms predicted for a self-complementary array. It is shown that the useful bandwidth of the planar <b>bicone</b> array is restricted to those frequencies for {{which there are no}} visible grating lobes. At broadside scan (or incidence) the upper frequency limit is that at which the elements are spaced one wavelength apart. This paper discusses the {{numerical model}}ing approach, and computed results with two different feed region geometries. 1...|$|E
40|$|Various inlet-engine {{combinations}} {{have been}} studied to find a preferred inlet concept for integration with an advanced technology Mach 2. 2 cruise vehicle having a cruise lift-to-drag ratio of 9. 6. For {{the purposes of this}} study, the range capability for a fixed takeoff gross weight was used to assess the various inlet-engine combinations. Inlet concept selection studies are described which indicated that an axisymmetric, mixed compression inlet was preferred. This study considered four inlet and three engine cycle combinations where the engine airflow was tailored to the inlet airflow delivery capability. Detailed design studies of two mixed compression inlet types are discussed. These were a translating centerbody inlet and a collapsing centerbody <b>bicone</b> inlet. The aerodynamic and mechanical design of each inlet is described. These inlets were also matched to different engine cycles tailored to the inlet airflow capability. The range increments favored the <b>bicone</b> inlet concept primarily because of lighter weight, reduced bleed air, and greater transonic airflow/thrust capability...|$|E
