5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E

25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the wheel rim. Squeezing the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} {{to place}} the front <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> on the left in right-side-driving countries, and vice versa, because the hand on the side nearer {{the centre of the}} road is more commonly used for hand signals, and the rear brake can not pitch the bicyclist forward.|$|E
25|$|Many {{hydraulic}} {{disc brakes}} have a self-adjusting mechanism {{so as the}} brake pad wears, the pistons keep {{the distance from the}} pad to the disc consistent to maintain the same <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> throw. Some hydraulic brakes, especially older ones, and most mechanical discs have manual controls to adjust the pad-to-rotor gap. Several adjustments are often required during the life of the pads.|$|E

50|$|STI ("Shimano Total Integration") - The {{marketing}} terminology for {{the integration}} of shifting into the <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> for road bikes, enabling the rider to shift without taking the hands off the <b>brake</b> <b>levers.</b> This {{made it possible to}} shift during uphill passages that require getting out of the saddle, and added general convenience for the rider. Although first generation of STI was unable to downshift multiple cogs which wasn't a problem in downtube shifters.|$|R

25|$|Freewheeling {{unicycle}}, a unicycle {{in which}} the hub has a freewheel mechanism, allowing the rider, to coast or move forward without pedaling, as a common bicycle does. These unicycles almost always have brakes because they cannot stop the way traditional unicycles do. The <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> is generally mounted {{in the bottom of}} the saddle. These unicycles also cannot go backwards.|$|E
25|$|This type of brake pre-dates the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull {{cantilever}} {{design with}} an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a cable {{stop on the}} frame or fork to terminate the cable housing, and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes. The cable from the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> pulls upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{advantage of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> must be matched to the brake it is connected to {{in order for the}} rider to have sufficient leverage and travel to actuate the brake. Using mismatched brakes and levers could result in too much {{mechanical advantage}} and hence not enough travel to properly actuate the brake (v-brakes with conventional levers) or too little mechanical advantage, requiring a very strong pull to apply the brakes hard (v-brake levers with other types of brake).|$|E

25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|E
500|$|Launched in 2006 after GM's 2003 {{abandonment}} {{of their last}} European rear-drive sedan, the Opel Omega, the VE is the first Commodore model designed entirely in Australia, {{as opposed to being}} based on an adapted Opel-sourced platform. Given this and high public expectations of quality, the budget in developing the car reportedly exceeded [...] Underpinned by the new Holden developed GM Zeta platform, the VE features more sophisticated independent suspension all round and near-even 50:50 weight distribution, leading to improved handling. Engines and transmissions are largely carried over from the previous VZ model. However, a new six-speed GM 6L80-E automatic transmission was introduced for V8 variants, replacing the old four-speed automatic now relegated to base models. The design of this new model included innovative features to help minimise export costs, such as a symmetrical centre console that houses a flush-fitting hand <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> to facilitate its conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the Commodore is again badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Omega, along with its new export market in the United States as the Pontiac G8 (discontinued as of 2010 along with the Pontiac brand).|$|E
500|$|Simpson's injury did {{not stop}} the press from naming him a {{favourite}} for the Tour de France. He was subdued in the race until stage twelve, when he forced a breakaway with Altig (Molteni), finishing second. Simpson again {{finished second in the}} next stage, jumping clear of the peloton in a three-rider group in the final kilometres. After the stage he was eighteenth overall, over seven minutes down. Simpson moved up to 16th after finishing 5th in stage 14b– a short time trial. As the race reached the Alps, he decided to make his move. During stage sixteen he attacked on the descent of the first of three cols, the Croix de Fer. He crashed but continued, attacking again. Simpson was joined by 's Julio Jiménez on the climb of the Télégraphe to the Galibier. Simpson was caught by a chase group descending the Galibier before he crashed again, knocked off his bike by a press motorcycle. The crash required five stitches in his arm. The next day he struggled to hold the handlebars and could not use the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> with his injured arm, forcing him to abandon. His answer to journalists asking about his future was, [...] "I don't know. I'm heartbroken. My season is ruined." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adapters are {{available}} to allow the use of one type of lever with an otherwise incompatible type of rim <b>brake.</b> Some <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> have adjustable leverage {{that can be made}} to work with either type of brake. Others vary their mechanical advantage as the lever moves to move the pad quickly at first, then provide more leverage once it contact the brake surface. Hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> move a piston in a fluid reservoir. [...] The mechanical advantage of the lever depends on the brake system design.|$|R
50|$|Steering the {{two front}} wheels was {{accomplished}} via two independent tillers {{which would have}} made simultaneous steering {{and control of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> difficult for a single individual.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{road drop}} {{handlebars}} (including track, cyclocross and touring bars) use a 23.8 mm grip/lever diameter, which is matched only to road bike type shifters or <b>brake</b> <b>levers.</b> This diameter {{is usually not}} important for grips since these bars most often are wrapped in tape. An exception are one-piece track grips, which are sized to fit the 23.8 mm bar diameter (and, therefore, would not fit a mountain bike handlebar). Cyclocross <b>brake</b> <b>levers</b> are sized to fit drop style bars, and would also not fit a mountain bike handlebar.|$|R
2500|$|Bicycles with drop {{handlebars}} {{may have}} more than one <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> for each brake to facilitate braking from multiple hand positions. [...] Levers that allow the rider to work the brakes from the tops of the bars, introduced in the '70s, are called extension levers, safety levers [...] or, for their reputation for being unable to actuate the full range of travel of the main <b>brake</b> <b>lever,</b> suicide levers. Modern top-mounted brake levers, called interrupt brake levers, use an entirely different method of actuation and are considered safer.|$|E

2500|$|... "Single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes" [...] {{consist of}} two curved arms that cross at a pivot above {{the wheel and}} hold the brake pads on {{opposite}} sides of the rim. [...] These arms have extensions on one side, one attached to the cable, the other to the cable housing. [...] When the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> is squeezed, the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim.|$|E
2500|$|The {{handlebars}} {{turn the}} fork {{and the front}} wheel via the stem, which rotates within the headset. Three styles of handlebar are common. Upright handlebars, the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. Drop handlebars [...] "drop" [...] as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic [...] "crouched" [...] position, {{as well as more}} upright positions in which the hands grip the <b>brake</b> <b>lever</b> mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The Kari-Keen Coupe and the Swanson Coupe {{featured}} the characteristic Swanson cantilever wing design. The Swanson planes also shared a similar seating configuration; the two-passengers were seated beside each other. Model W-15 featured detachable passenger-side controls {{which could be}} mounted or removed depending on whether a student pilot was present. This design feature made the plane suitable for use in flight schools. The cabin windshield was made using safety glass and the door window panes were retractable. The plane had two variants: Standard and Deluxe. Both variants had dual flight controls, low pressure tires and mohair interior. Both models featured dual engine throttle controls: the main throttle control and a secondary throttle control button installed on the <b>brake</b> <b>lever.</b> The Deluxe came with an electric starter and more elaborate instrumentation. The prices were $4,450 for the Standard model and [...] $4,985 for the Deluxe.|$|E
