5|$|Despite its name, the 6th Airborne Division {{was one of}} {{only two}} {{airborne}} divisions raised by the British Army during the Second World War. Before being deployed to Palestine, the division had served only in Europe. It had participated in the Normandy landings in June 1944 and later the Battle of the <b>Bulge</b> <b>in</b> December. After the Rhine crossing in March 1945, it spent six weeks advancing across Germany to the Baltic Sea.|$|E

5|$|In August 1944, it was {{the first}} Allied unit to enter Belgium when it was {{deployed}} to the Ardennes and Limburg. The small team, mounted in armed Jeeps, managed to kill more than 300 German soldiers and destroy over 100 vehicles during the mission. Later, the unit fought in the Netherlands and also served as a reconnaissance unit in the Ardennes during the Battle of the <b>Bulge</b> <b>in</b> the winter of 1944.|$|E

An autopsy by Scully finds sand in his lungs, indicating the existence of a silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{database}} of our two-dimensional bulge–disk decompositions for 14, 233 galaxies drawn from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR 12 {{in order to}} examine the properties of <b>bulges</b> residing <b>in</b> the local universe (0. 005 < z < 0. 05). We performed decompositions in the g and r bands by utilizing the galfit software. The bulge colors and bulge-to-total ratios are found {{to be sensitive to the}} details in the decomposition technique, and hence we hereby provide full details of our method. The g − r colors of bulges derived are almost constantly red regardless of bulge size, except for the <b>bulges</b> <b>in</b> the low bulge-to-total ratio galaxies (B/T r lesssim 0. 3). Bulges exhibit similar scaling relations to those followed by elliptical galaxies, but the <b>bulges</b> <b>in</b> galaxies with lower bulge-to-total ratios clearly show a gradually larger departure in slope from the elliptical galaxy sequence. The scatters around the scaling relations are also larger for the <b>bulges</b> <b>in</b> galaxies with lower bulge-to-total ratios. Both the departure in slopes and larger scatters likely originate from the presence of young stars. The <b>bulges</b> <b>in</b> galaxies with low bulge-to-total ratios show signs of a frosting of young stars so substantial that their luminosity-weighted Balmer-line ages are as small as 1 Gyr in some cases. While bulges seem largely similar in optical properties to elliptical galaxies, they do show clear and systematic departures as a function of bulge-to-total ratio. The stellar properties and perhaps associated formation processes of bulges seem much more diverse than those of elliptical galaxies...|$|R
5|$|Model {{first came}} to Hitler's {{attention}} before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942. His tenacious style of fighting and dedication to the Nazi cause won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him {{one of his best}} field commanders and repeatedly tasked him with retrieving desperate situations. However, their relationship had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at the Battle of the <b>Bulge.</b> <b>In</b> April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather than be captured and stand trial for war crimes.|$|E

The regiment had performed so well in repulsing the North Koreans that Kean nominated it for a Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of moon systems {{is driven by}} tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal <b>bulge</b> <b>in</b> the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving {{in the same direction}} as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the r{{evolution of}} the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.|$|E

The rapid offensive action and speed that Patton called for in the speech became actions which brought the Third Army wide acclaim in the campaign.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May, Paulus, {{on orders}} from Bock, began a general {{offensive}} {{from the area}} of Merefa {{in the north of}} the <b>bulge</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to encircle the remaining Soviet forces in the Izium salient. Only then did Stalin authorize Zhukov to stop the offensive and fend off German flanking forces. However, it was already too late. Quickly, the Germans achieved considerable success against Soviet defensive positions. The 20 May saw more of the same, with the German forces closing in from the rear. More German divisions were committed to the battle that day, shattering several Soviet counterparts, allowing the Germans to press forward. The Luftwaffe also intensified operations over the Donets River to prevent Soviet forces escaping. Ju 87s from StG 77 destroyed five of the main bridges and damaged four more while Ju 88 bombers from Kampfgeschwader 3 (KG 3) inflicted heavy losses on retreating motorised and armoured columns.|$|E
5|$|The 87th Division {{was moving}} into Germany when Von Rundstedt {{launched}} his offensive in the Ardennes. The Division {{was placed in}} reserve from 24 December until 28 December, before engaging in the Battle of the <b>Bulge</b> <b>in</b> Belgium on 29 December. In a fluctuating battle, it captured Moircy on 30 December and Remagne on 31 December. On 2 January 1945, it took Germont, on 10 January Tillet, and reached the Ourthe by 13 January. On 15 January 1945, the Division moved to Luxembourg to relieve the 4th Infantry Division along the Sauer and seized Wasserbillig on 23 January. The 87th moved to the vicinity of St. Vith on 28 January, then attacked and captured Schlierbach, Selz, and Hogden {{by the end of}} the month. After the fall of Neuendorf on 9 February, the Division went on the defensive until the 26 February, when Ormont and Hallschlag were taken in night attacks. The 87th crossed the Kyll River on 6 March, took Dollendorf on 8 March, and after a brief rest, returned to combat on 13 March 1945, crossing the Moselle on 16 March and clearing Koblenz, on 18–19 March. The Division crossed the Rhine on 25–26 March and despite strong opposition, consolidated its bridgehead, and secured Grossenlinden and Langgöns. On 7 April, it jumped off in an attack which carried it through Thuringia into Saxony. Plauen fell on 17 April, and the Division took up defensive positions on 20 April, about 4miles from the Czech border. On 6 May 1945, it took Falkenstein and maintained its positions until VE-day.|$|E

25|$|In {{support of}} the 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions, the 741st, along with a company of the 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was {{instrumental}} in helping hold the northern shoulder of the <b>Bulge</b> <b>in</b> vicious fighting in and around Rocherath-Krinkelt during the German Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the <b>Bulge)</b> <b>in</b> December 1944. By now battle-seasoned veterans, tankers from the battalion resisted repeated numerous hard-pressed attacks by spearheading elements of the SS-heavy Sixth Panzer Army from 16–19 December. Facing superior German Panther and Tiger tanks (among others) supported by infantry, the battalion fought many small unit engagements, deftly stalking the German tanks in twos and threes until they could destroy or immobilize them with shots from the flanks or rear. On 19 December, elements of the battalion were the rear guard of an orderly withdrawal from Rocherath-Krinkelt to positions behind Wirtzfeld {{to the west and}} northwest.|$|E
