5|$|Generally, {{firearms}} possession {{is not a}} politicized {{issue that}} would <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> during Czech elections.

The DLA <b>am</b> <b>Debate</b> <b>was</b> initiated by the Editor of DLA publications, Mr. Ajay Agarwal, in 2008. The first edition, which saw participation from nine schools, was a clean sweep by St.Peters College with both its speakers winning.

5|$|For {{many years}} Harris {{claimed to have}} been the first woman science-fiction writer in the United States. While this can <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> (since Gertrude Barrows Bennett, writing under the {{pseudonym}} Francis Stevens, published science fiction stories as early as 1917), Harris is recognized as the first woman to publish stories in science fiction magazines under her own name.|$|E
5|$|The most {{luminous}} supernova {{ever recorded}} is ASASSN-15lh. It was first detected in June 2015 and peaked at , which is twice the bolometric luminosity {{of any other}} known supernova. However, {{the nature of this}} supernova continues to <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> and several alternative explanations have been suggested. e.g. the tidal disruption of a star by a black hole.|$|E
5|$|This {{thesis of}} a {{maritime}} foundation was {{contrary to the}} general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly {{of at least one}} cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were overestimated, for example) but have been treated as plausible as late as Mann's summary of the literature in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{had spoken}} out against lynching in his April 1921 speech before Congress and {{supported}} Congressman Leonidas Dyer's federal anti-lynching bill, which passed the House of Representatives in January 1922. When {{it reached the}} Senate floor in November 1922, it was filibustered by Southern Democrats, and Lodge withdrew it so as to allow the ship subsidy bill Harding favored to <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> (it was likewise filibustered). Blacks blamed Harding for the Dyer bill's defeat; Harding biographer Robert K. Murray noted that it was hastened to its end by Harding's desire to have the ship subsidy bill considered.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{comprised}} six sessions {{including a}} lecture on law, a humorous presentation, and multiple discussions {{about the role of}} women in society. Stanton and the Quaker women presented two prepared documents, the Declaration of Sentiments and an accompanying list of resolutions, to <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> and modified before being put forward for signatures. A heated debate sprang up regarding women's right to vote, with many – including Mott – urging the removal of this concept, but Frederick Douglass, who was the convention's sole African American attendee, argued eloquently for its inclusion, and the suffrage resolution was retained. Exactly 100 of approximately 300 attendees signed the document, mostly women.|$|E

5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a controversial figure after his death; Lysias vigorously denounced him while prosecuting {{several of his}} former political allies, but others defended his actions. Modern historical assessments have shifted over time; in the 19th century, Theramenes's part in the coup of 411 BC and his use of Arginusae were widely condemned, but newly discovered ancient texts and 20th-century scholarship supported more positive assessments. Some historians have found in Theramenes a selfish opportunist, others a principled moderate. The details of his actions, his motivations, and his character continue to <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> down to the present day.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, {{following}} {{the revelation that}} the News of the World had paid private investigators to hack into the phones of Milly Dowler, {{as well as the}} families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called for News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks to resign, urged David Cameron to establish a public, judge-led inquiry into the scandal, and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in BSkyB. He also called for the Press Complaints Commission to be abolished – a call later echoed by Cameron and Nick Clegg – and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson to be his director of communications. Cameron later took the unusual step of saying that the government would back Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to <b>be</b> <b>debated,</b> News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.|$|E
5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to <b>be</b> <b>debated</b> by historians today, claimed {{this was a}} violation of the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void. He allowed his troops to sack the town and destroy the church, acts that he had promised to prevent in the oral surrender agreement. He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in some circles (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to <b>be</b> <b>debated.</b> According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual self-expression for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E
