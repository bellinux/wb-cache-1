25|$|At {{this moment}} most prisons in Tonga still abide {{with the old}} laissez-faire attitude. Usually having no fences, no iron bars and so forth, that makes it very easy for the inmates to escape. This system may be {{required}} to change, adapting for the influx of foreign born/raised criminals who may treat such a system with contempt, alternatively a minimum/maximum security prison system may need to be developed placing escapists or repeat offenders into closed prisons, but for the moment the jailors can trust on the goodwill of the inmates. Some are glad to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison,</b> not to be bothered by demanding family members. There is no social stigma on being in prison (although that may change now too), but then of course it also does not serve as a deterrent against crimes.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the gangland storyline was revisited, with a {{chain of}} bad fortune for Garrigan {{ultimately}} leading to his downfall. First, he was wounded in a drive-by shooting, which was an assassination attempt on his life by the Ukrainian gang in retaliation for killing Alex. Subsequently, a sting operation by undercover Garda Rory Goff found drugs that Lorcan was piggybacking on one of Garrigan's booze runs. Garrigan was furious that Lorcan had implicated him in drug-dealing and he ordered Lorcan to kill Rory. As Rory and Lorcan confronted each other, Lorcan fired the first shot, but Rory struck back with another, wounding them both in the process. Rory survived, but Lorcan's days were numbered. Lorcan made a deathbed confession to the Gardaí before he died in hospital. Garrigan was arrested and was never seen again, but he is assumed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison.</b> Tim Carney's domineering marriage with Olga was also featured. Racism was shown when the Udenze family were targeted by racists Pete Flanngan and Morgan Dalton.|$|E

500|$|Premiering {{directly}} {{after the}} BET Awards 2016 telecast on June 26, 2016, the video features the women's struggles with love {{as they all}} pursue {{the attention of a}} prison guard. Directed by Derek Blanks, it was inspired by the American comedy-drama series Orange Is the New Black, and shows the guard [...] "playing them all". According to a press release from RCA, Fantasia [...] "portrays multiple characters in a compelling plot twist" [...] in the video. Eeshé White of The Boombox summarized the video as: [...] "Fantasia appears to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison,</b> and is battling with herself." [...] The visual includes a scene in which all of the characters fight one another. It received positive reviews from media outlets. Breezy called the video [...] "intriguing", while Gerren Keith Gaynor described it as a [...] "creative take" [...] on the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} of Mysterion is never revealed in [...] "The Coon". After the episode aired, the question [...] "Who is Mysterion?" [...] became a frequently asked {{question at the}} FAQ for the official South Park website, South Park Studios. The answer posted at that site was that [...] "there is no answer", and that only Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know. Parker said {{it was one of}} the most common questions he was asked about the show, along with the {{identity of}} Cartman's father, which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode [...] "201". Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion's identity, as they never chose a specific character to be him. In the original ending of the episode, after Mysterion is arrested, Kyle is shown to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> and it is believed he is the superhero. However, the real Mysterion visits him, and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime. As a thank you, Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face, but like in the actual episode, the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats. The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion. The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray sets. The superhero characters from [...] "The Coon" [...] returned in the fourteenth season episodes [...] "", [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] and [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends", in which Mysterion is revealed.|$|E

Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University in Montreal and a former war crimes prosecutor, says although he may not go to trial, [...] "He will effectively <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> within the Sudan itself...Al-Bashir now {{is not going to be}} able to leave the Sudan without facing arrest." [...] The Prosecutor warned that authorities could arrest the President if he enters international airspace. The Sudanese government has announced that the Presidential plane would be accompanied by jet fighters. However, the Arab League announced solidarity with al-Bashir. Since the warrant, he has visited Qatar and Egypt. The African Union also condemned the charges.|$|E
2500|$|Bout {{was convicted}} {{by a jury}} at a court in Manhattan on 2 November 2011. On 5 April 2012, {{he was sentenced to}} 25 years in prison (the minimum sentence) for conspiring to sell weapons to a U.S.-designated foreign {{terrorist}} group. District Judge Shira Scheindlin ruled that the minimum sentence was appropriate because [...] "there was no evidence that Bout would have committed the crimes for which he was convicted {{had it not been for}} the sting operation". Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement denouncing Bout's sentence as [...] "a political order". During the trial, Bout's lawyers also implied that he was a political prisoner. Bout's wife Alla said shortly afterwards that the judge conducted the trial in a proper way. Viktor Bout pointed out that if the same standards were applied to everyone, all American gun shop owners—"who are sending arms and ending up killing Americans"—would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Court again {{considered}} {{whether a}} minimum prison sentence perceived as lengthy would be {{cruel and unusual}} in the case R. v. Latimer. [...] Latimer, who had murdered his disabled daughter, argued the 10 years that he would definitely serve (he could <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> for longer if denied parole) was so long as to be cruel and unusual. [...] The basis of this argument was that the murder was committed {{as a type of}} mercy killing. [...] The Court in this case decided the sentence was not unconstitutional, noting the crime [...] "resulted in the most serious of all possible consequences, namely, the death of the victim." [...] While Latimer had been convicted of second as opposed to first-degree murder, the Court added that [...] "second degree murder is an offence accompanied by an extremely high degree of criminal culpability." [...] In this section 12 case, the principle of mens rea was considered vital.|$|E

2500|$|Douglas Tinker, a 30-year veteran attorney, was {{assigned}} to defend Saldívar. Tinker was {{called one of the}} best criminal defense lawyers in the state of Texas, and was estimated by Richard Haynes, also a Texas criminal defense attorney, to be worth $50 million. His wife, fearful that they would suffer from community retribution, asked Tinker not to take the case. [...] Arnold Garcia, a former district prosecutor, was chosen by Tinker as his co-counsel. The judge honored Tinker's request for a private investigator. The court date was originally set for August 17, but, for unknown reasons, was pushed back two months to October 9. On May 18, Tinker and Valdez argued about the possibility of reducing Saldívar's bond to $10,000. Tinker argued that she should not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>prison</b> since she had not yet been found guilty of murder and deserved to be out on bail. Valdez argued that Saldívar was a flight risk, with contacts in Mexico, and, were she to be released from prison, it was unlikely she would be seen again. [...] Saldívar's parents, siblings, and former co-workers argued that she had no financial resources to make bond, and that she was incapable of the actions of which she was accused. Valdez called Rivera to the stand. He claimed that Saldívar had developed several foreign contacts as a result of working for Selena. Rivera also brought up the ongoing investigation of the embezzlement claims, stating that Saldívar might have access to funds that the investigation had not yet uncovered. Westergren denied the bond reduction, and Saldívar was returned to jail.|$|E
