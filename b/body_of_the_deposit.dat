60|$|Terai {{is a name}} loosely {{applied to}} a tract of country at the very foot of the Himalaya: it is Persian, and signifies damp. Politically, the Terai {{generally}} belongs to the hill-states beyond it; geographically, it should appertain to the plains of India; and geologically, it {{is a sort of}} neutral country, being composed neither of the alluvium of the plains, nor of the rocks of the hills, {{but for the most part}} of alternating beds of sand, gravel, and boulders brought from the mountains. Botanically it is readily defined as the region of forest-trees; amongst which the Sal, the most valuable of Indian timber, is conspicuous in most parts, though not now in Sikkim, where it has been destroyed. The Terai soil is generally light, dry, and gravelly (such as the Sal always prefers), and varies in breadth, from ten miles, along the Sikkim frontier, to thirty and more on the Nepalese. In the latter country it is called the Morung, and supplies Sal and Sissoo timber for the Calcutta market, the logs being floated down the Konki and Cosi rivers to the Ganges. The gravel-beds extend uninterruptedly upon the plains for fully twenty miles south of the Sikkim mountains, the gravel becoming smaller as the distance increases, and large blocks of stone not being found beyond a few miles from the rocks of the Himalaya itself, even in the beds of rivers, however large and rapid. Throughout its breadth this formation is conspicuously cut into flat-topped terraces, flanking the spurs of the mountains, at elevations varying from 250 to nearly 1000 feet above the sea. These terraces are of various breadth and length, the smallest lying uppermost, and the broadest flanking the rivers below. The isolated hills beyond are also flat-topped and terraced. This deposit contains no fossils; and its general appearance and mineral constituents are the only evidence of its origin, which is no doubt due to a retiring ocean that washed the base of the Sikkim Himalaya, received the contents of its rivers, and, wearing away its bluff spurs, spread a talus upwards of 1000 feet thick along its shores. It is not at first sight evident whether the terracing is due to periodic retirements of the ocean, or to the levelling effects of rivers that have cut channels through the deposit. In many places, especially along the banks of the great streams, the gravel is smaller, obscurely interstratified with sand, and the flattened pebbles over-lap rudely, in a manner characteristic of the effects of running water; but such is not the case with the main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deposit,</b> which is unstratified, and much coarser.|$|E
30|$|The MOLA {{instrument}} {{aboard the}} Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) has measured {{the elevation of}} the Martian topography based on the return times of laser pulses. We used MOLA data based on the JMARS platform provided by NASA. A correct use of MOLA is critical for the present work, where the elevations are directly used for velocity estimations. We first verified that the MOLA measurements in the Melas-Coprates areas examined here were sufficiently dense. For the estimates of the maximum elevation reached by the landslide front, we have chosen points close to measured elevations. To determine the landslide thickness, we drew sections through lines of good MOLA data points measured intercepting transversally the main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deposit.</b>|$|E
40|$|Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} geophysical imaging technique {{that is now}} widely used to visualise subsurface geological structure, groundwater and lithological variations. It is being increasingly used in environmental and engineering site investigations, but despite its suitability and potential benefits, ERT {{has yet to be}} routinely applied by the minerals industry to sand and gravel deposit assessment and quarry planning. The principal advantages of ERT for this application are that it is a cost-effective non-invasive method, which can provide 2 D or 3 D spatial models of the subsurface throughout the full region of interest. This complements intrusive sampling methods, which typically provide information only at discrete locations. Provided that suitable resistivity contrasts are present, ERT has the potential to reveal mineral and overburden thickness and quality variations within the <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deposit.</b> Here we present a number of case studies from the UK illustrating the use of 2 D and 3 D ERT for sand and gravel deposit investigation in a variety of geological settings. We use these case studies to evaluate the performance of ERT, and to illustrate good practice in the application of ERT to deposit investigation. We propose an integrated approach to site investigation and quarry planning incorporating both conventional intrusive methods and ERT...|$|E

40|$|The Chaos Jumbles is a {{rockfall}} avalanche deposit {{that was}} emplaced by three separate events ~ 300 years ago. Deposits from each event are distinguishable on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> morphology, size variation of large dacitic surface clasts, and by <b>the</b> color <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> matrix and entrained dacitic blocks. Steep lateral and distal deposit margins and surface {{features such as}} folds and apparent strike-slip faults indicate that each rockfall avalanche had a finite yield strength and was being actively deformed and sheared throughout <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving <b>deposit,</b> rather than strictly along a basal surface. Kinematic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>deposits</b> indicates that each had a very low apparent coefficient of friction and was emplaced at velocities of up to ~ 100 m/s. These data suggest that each rockfall avalanche can be modeled as a pseudoplastic material undergoing flow parallel compression above a frictionless base. This model allows calculation of deposit volumes ranging from ~ 1. 2 to 1. 7 x 108 m 3 and also suggests that a future rockfall avalanche from the same location would have a more restricted runout than the previous events...|$|R

Locally native silver, copper-sulphides (chalcosite, digenite, bornite and covellite) and cuprite replace native copper. The ore bodies are controlled by faulting and occur as strata- bound, but are locally enriched in nuggets in tuffs and fissured zones in basalts. Ag, Pd, Rh and Au can also be economically important. The major copper ores were deposited together with prehnite-pumpellyite paragenesis, originated in the succession: pumpellyite  prehnite (ąnative copper)  laumontite (or wairakite) (ąnative copper). The ore bodies were formed during cooling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mineral-forming hydrothermal system at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vendian volcanic activity. <b>The</b> syngenetic intergrowths <b>of</b> native copper with prehnite, precipitated after pumpellyite, and homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions in later wairakite (210  335 °C) indicate that <b>the</b> major deposition <b>of</b> native copper took place at 200  400 °C.

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} {{and effects of}} phreatic eruptions is crucial to <b>the</b> hazard assessment <b>of</b> volcanic and geothermal areas. These eruptions may occur associated with magmatic phases or as isolated events, with the most recent examples being those of Te Maari (Togariro, New Zealand) in 2012 and of Ontake volcano (Japan) in 2014. The active caldera in <b>the</b> northern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Island <b>of</b> Vulcano (southern Italy) hosts in its center <b>the</b> cone <b>of</b> La Fossa. During its activity, la Fossa experienced various phreatic eruptions (e. g. in 1444 and in 1727 AD), with the most important event which occurred during the 13 th century AD (Breccia di Commenda eruption, BdC). We present a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BdC eruption through <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stratigraphic characterization with sedimentological data, which allowed for <b>the</b> reconstruction <b>of</b> both eruption timing and eruptive mechanisms. The BdC event occurred in contemporaneous with <b>the</b> eruption <b>of</b> Rocche Rosse (1230 ± 20 AD) from <b>the</b> neighbouring Island <b>of</b> Lipari, 12 km north of la Fossa; white, rhyolitic ash layers are in fact ubiquitously interfingered with <b>the</b> BdC <b>deposits.</b> <b>The</b> study <b>of</b> about 170 tephra logs revealed that the eruption occurred in three main phases. The opening, north-westerly-dispersed fallout (Phase 1) emplaced grey, altered lithic ash bearing accretionary lapilli. The eruption waxed (Phase 2) with several explosions, producing an asymmetric shower of ballistic blocks and <b>the</b> emplacement <b>of</b> narrowly-dispersed, lithic-rich, stratified pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits, followed by a radially distributed, topographically-controlled, coarse-grained PDC which represent <b>the</b> main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breccia <b>deposit.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> eruption waned with <b>the</b> generation <b>of</b> accretionary lapilli-bearing ash fall deposits (Phase 3). Single PDC units range in volume from 2. 1 X 104 m 3 to 2. 7 X 105 m 3, with a total dispersal of ~ 4. 5 km 2. Sedimentological analyses revealed that the eruption occurred with little or null involvement of fresh magma and that <b>the</b> breccia <b>deposit</b> was mostly composed by lava fragments. This latter observation suggests that the crater area prior to eruption was almost filled by lavas, which possibly helped in gas pressure build up.

30|$|The {{air-borne}} survey (Sasaki et al. 2016) {{indicates a}} syn-eruptive lahar, which occurred {{adjacent to the}} Jigokudani vents and travelled about 5  km downstream. The lahar trigger was initiated by (1) expelled mud slurries from vents combining to form a lahar (Sasaki et al. 2016) and/or by (2) a pyroclastic density current travelling down to <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Akagawa River and transforming into a lahar. Despite <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lahar derived from a pyroclastic density current, Sasaki et al. (2016) concluded that relatively long runout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muddy lahar required it to originate directly from the vents. <b>The</b> detailed description <b>of</b> two post-eruptive lahar <b>deposits</b> by <b>the</b> present study reveals that <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syn-eruptive lahar was limited and smaller than that discussed in Sasaki et al. (2016). Their ground survey was carried out for 10  months (i.e., long after the April ROS-triggered lahar event) after the eruption. They observed and took samples of what they considered as <b>the</b> syn-eruptive lahar <b>deposits</b> from Sites A, B, C, and D (Sasaki et al. 2016). These localities, which are situated near to Loc. 1192, S 114, 1227, and 1232 - 2 in the present study, respectively, were already impacted by the October and April lahars. The Site D is even outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syn-eruptive lahar according to the air-borne survey. The 1.2 [*]×[*] 105 m 3 volume proposed for <b>the</b> syn-eruptive lahar <b>deposits</b> is overestimated by <b>the</b> representative <b>deposit</b> thickness <b>of</b> 1  m (Sasaki et al. 2016), because the thickness represents that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> October lahar <b>deposits.</b> <b>The</b> syn-eruptive mud slurry {{had to be very}} thin, on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> oblique aerial photographs taken immediately after the eruption (Figure  3 e in Sasaki et al. 2016). A field photograph (Figure  5 b in Sasaki et al. 2016) taken during ground survey by the Forestry Agency on October 2, 2014, just before the October 5 lahar confirmed thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syn-eruptive <b>deposits</b> to be less than 10 – 15  cm, and volume is reassessed as[*]<[*] 1.2 – 1.5 [*]×[*] 104 m 3. Other photographs (Figure  5 a, d–h in Sasaki et al. 2016) taken during <b>the</b> survey <b>of</b> 10  months after the eruption show only top surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deposits,</b> i.e., <b>the</b> overbank facies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> October lahar <b>deposits.</b> This means that these photographs do not indicate <b>the</b> syn-eruptive lahar <b>deposits,</b> which should be appeared in <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depositional sequences. Thus, they described the October rain-triggered lahar and its <b>deposits</b> as <b>the</b> syn-eruptive ones. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syn-eruptive mud slurry deposits were probably buried and/or degraded by post-eruptive lahars and fluvial reworking. The possible implication for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> syn-eruptive lahar is thin and fine-grained deposits described here as a sole layer and/or ash cloud <b>deposits</b> underlying <b>the</b> main <b>body</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> October lahar <b>deposits</b> in <b>the</b> upstream area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Akagawa River (Loc. S 119, 1192, and 1191).

50|$|For thirty {{million years}} {{following}} <b>the</b> deposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Morrison Formation sediments in Montana were being eroded rather than deposited. Seawater was still present in Montana, now extending as an embayment {{down from the}} Arctic Circle. Rivers were still flowing into the local sea, but the local dinosaur fauna was very different. Carnivores living here included Deinonychus and Microvenator. Herbivores included Sauropelta and Tenontosaurus. Around this time flowering plants would make their first appearance in the state. During <b>the</b> middle part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous Montana was partially covered by the Western Interior Seaway. Significant volcanic eruptions occurred in Montana during <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Interior Seaway. This sea was home to cephalopods, clams, and plesiosaurs. <b>The</b> sediments <b>deposited</b> by this sea compose {{what is now called}} the Colorado Group. No dinosaur fossils are known to have been preserved in the Colorado group in Montana, but outside the state occasional discoveries have been made. Southwestern Montana was dry land, but none of those deposits have yielded dinosaur fossils yet. 85 million years ago the Western Interior Seaway withdrew slightly leaving western Montana as a coastal plain. Dinosaurs were present but rarely left fossilized remains. The sea was home to animals such as cephalopods, gastropods, mosasaurs, pelecypods, and plesiosaurs.During <b>the</b> Campanian Stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Cretaceous the coastal plain bordering the Western Interior Seaway was lined with rivers and dotted with a few lakes. These <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> water <b>deposited</b> <b>the</b> sediments that later became the Two Medicine Formation. Nearby volcanoes were erupting, depositing ash that would later become bentonite. The climate was semiarid. <b>The</b> flora <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coastal plain included conifer forests, deciduous trees, and ferns. A diverse array of dinosaurs lived in Montana at this time. Duckbilled hadrosaurs were common inhabitants of Montana's Campanian coastal plains. Maiasaura is one example. Montana has an especially good fossil record of ceratopsid dinosaurs. Examples of contemporary local ceratopsians include Einiosaurus. The theropods Daspletosaurus and Troodon were also present. Both Maiasaura and Troodon are known to have formed nesting colonies in the area. Late Cretaceous fossil dinosaur footprints are surprisingly rare in Montana compared to other western states with contemporary deposits. This might be due to the local ancient environments not being well suited for track preservation or merely because scientists have not yet looked in the right places.Early in the Maastrichtian the Western Interior Seaway expanded its boundaries somewhat. It was home to cephalopods, clams, crustaceans, fishes, gastropods, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs. Later in the Maastrichtian stage, volcanic activity was still ongoing in the Elkhorn region and the Western Interior Seaway began to withdraw. This regression would end up resulting in both halves of North America reuniting. As the seaway withdrew the area closest to the Rocky Mountains became an expanding desert. Eastern Montana was hot and humid, by contrast, as the coastal plain was also expanding as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marine regression. By the late Maastrichtian stage large rivers flowed across <b>the</b> eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, <b>depositing</b> <b>the</b> sediments that would one day become the Hell Creek Formation. At the time, Montana was home to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most famous dinosaurs; creatures including Edmontosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Triceratops, and Tyrannosaurus.|$|R

The Valerianovka arc is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Transuralian zone that forms the eastern most boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uralide collisional zone. The Uralides, a 2500 km long, north-south trending mountain belt that extends northwards from <b>the</b> steppes <b>of</b> northern Kazakhstan to the Arctic Ocean were formed as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Laurussia and Siberia-Kazakh plates during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian period. Geochronological work completed during {{this study has shown}} that intrusive rocks within the Transuralian zone were formed along tow sub-parallel north-south trending volcanic arcs; the first with ages from 370 to 350 Ma near to the current surface expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Troitsk fault and the second approximately 100 km East with ages from 340 to 310 Ma within <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zone. Late sulphide mineralisation at <b>the</b> Sarbai <b>deposit</b> has a measured Re-Os age of 336. 2 ± 1. 3 Ma, within <b>the</b> estimatde range <b>of</b> intrusive age for the spatially associated Sarbai-Sokolov intrusive series.

Younger granitic plutons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dzhabyk-Karagandski intrusive series and the Pridorogny granitic dykes that clearly cross cut mineralisation have measured U -Pb SHRIMP ages of between 300 Ma and 280 Ma that correspond to an igneous event that affected all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Southern Urals. <b>The</b> magnetite <b>bodies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> iron skarn <b>deposits</b> replace limestone and tuffs, and are either distal or locally proximal to <b>the</b> contacts <b>of</b> gabbro-diorite-granodoirite intrusive complexes. Four main stages of alteration and mineralisation can be recognised at these deposits, namely: (l-) pre-ore; (2) the main magnetite forming; (3) late sulphide and (4) post- ore phases. The pre-ore stage is characterised by high temperature, metamorphic/metasomatic calc- and alurnino-silicates. The main magnetite ore phase formed when hot, sulphur poor, acidic-, iron and silica- and aluminium-rich fluids were structurally focused to dissolve and replace the dominantly limestone hosts. This was accompanied by a skarn assemblage gangue of epidote, calcic-pyroxenes, calcic-garnet and calcic-amphiboles, minor sulphide minerals and high field strength element (HFSE) -bearing accessory minerals such as titanite and apatite. The magnetite-skarn mineralisation was followed by a late sulphide phase, when comparatively cooler fluids, produced distinctive and extensive alteration assemblages of sod-rich scapolite, albite, chlorite and K-feldspar, accompanied by chalcopyrite, pyrite and minor sphalerite and galena. The post-ore phase, is characterised by cross-cutting barren veins composed of calcite, lesser albite, K feldspar, and minor quartz, and by widespread alteration comprising scapolite, albite and silica, which surrounds <b>the</b> <b>deposit,</b> and extends for several kilometers into the host rock. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geological and mineralogical features of these deposits closely resemble those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iron Oxide-Copper-Gold (IOCG) deposits and provinces around the world though it is here proposed that these be classified as iron skarn deposits. Stable isotope (C, 0, S) studies carried out on a range of sulphides, carbonates and silicates, support an igneous, or igneous rock-equilibrated source for the mineralising fluids. Carbon and oxygen isotope data from gangue carbonates suggest that carbonate is derived from <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> igneous derived or igneous equilibrated fluids with host limestones. It is proposed that <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magmatic fluid is <b>the</b> diorites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sarbai-Sokolov intrusive series which underwent considerable fractionation and degassing after they were emplaced. This study aims to establish the link between <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> giant magnetite skarns and <b>the</b> tectonic history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uralides.
