5|$|Breuer {{attended}} the Paralympics in London, {{but as a}} wheelchair basketball player {{rather than as a}} fencer. She was introduced to the sport by a friend, and spotted by a national trainer. Breuer played for Sabines Ulm, where she was the only woman on a mixed gender side. She is classified as a 1.5 point player, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} constitutional activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by the General Assembly for very specific purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has {{been sent to the}} voters for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> could vote beginning in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Lady Dudley {{discussed}} her proposal with King George V, {{and then}} with the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, and the British Army's Director General Army Medical Services, Sir Arthur Sloggett, who authorised the hospital. The hospital was formally offered to the British government by the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Sir George Reid on 15 August 1914. Volunteers responded to advertisements that Lady Dudley placed in English newspapers on 17 August 1914. Women doctors were not accepted, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> nurses were welcomed.|$|E

5000|$|But I {{want you}} {{to realize that the}} head of every man is Christ, {{and the head of the}} woman is man, and the head of Christ is God. Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head. <b>But</b> every <b>woman</b> who prays or prophesies with her head {{uncovered}} dishonors her head—it is the same as having her head shaved. For if a woman does not cover her head, she might as well have her hair cut off; but if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, then she should cover her head. A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; <b>but</b> <b>woman</b> is the glory of man. For man did not come from <b>woman,</b> <b>but</b> <b>woman</b> from man; neither was man created for <b>woman,</b> <b>but</b> <b>woman</b> for man.|$|R

5|$|Respectable Athenian women {{remained}} {{separate from}} unrelated men and Athenian citizens considered it degrading for citizen-women to work, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> (free and unfree) are attested as {{working in a}} number of capacities. Women engaged in occupations which were an extension of household jobs, such as textile work and washing, and those unrelated to household tasks: cobblers, gilders, net-weavers, potters, and grooms.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared {{just as soon as}} they came. Most stampeders were men <b>but</b> <b>women</b> also travelled to the region, typically as the wife of a prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced in many regions. In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E

5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man {{calling himself}} Count Alessandro di Cagliostro opened the first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba). On admission, the women {{were told that they}} were now Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|Once in the Klondike, {{very few}} women—less than one percent—actually worked as miners. Many {{were married to}} miners; however, their lives as {{partners}} on the gold fields were still hard and often lonely. They had extensive domestic duties, including thawing ice and snow for water, breaking up frozen food, chopping wood and collecting wild foods. In Dawson and other towns, some women took in laundry to make money. This was a physically demanding job, but could be relatively easily combined with child care duties. Others took jobs in the service industry, for example as waitresses or seamstresses, which could pay well, but were often punctuated by periods of unemployment. Both men and women opened roadhouses, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> {{were considered to be}} better at running them. A few women worked in the packing trade, carrying goods on their backs, or became domestic servants.|$|E
5|$|Within the Celtic spiritual sphere {{there is}} {{considerable}} variation. The 4th and early 3rd century BC burials in Wrocław and Ślęża region are skeletal. Sometimes {{a man and a}} woman were buried together, suggesting the known Celtic practice of killing the wife during her husband's funeral, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> were usually buried separately, with their jewelry. Some of the dead were given meat and a knife for cutting it. From the 3rd century on the bodies were cremated, which was also the case in all of the Lesser Poland burials. There in Iwanowice the graves of Celtic warriors (3rd century BC) contain a very rich assortment of weapons and decorations.|$|E

25|$|Divorce became {{legal in}} Brazil in 1977, {{with the law}} {{permitting}} each person only one divorce in a lifetime and only after a three -year legal or five-year de facto separation.

25|$|The role {{of women}} in ancient warfare {{differed}} from culture to culture. Warfare throughout written history mainly has been portrayed in modern times as a matter for men, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> also have played a role. Until very recently, little mention of these exploits was included in retellings of history in most countries, aside from the Amazons.|$|E
25|$|Conservatives {{reject the}} {{assertion}} that different laws prescribed {{for men and women}} imply that men are more valuable than women. Ali ibn Musa Al-reza reasoned {{that at the time of}} marriage a man has to pay something to his prospective bride, and that men are responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses <b>but</b> <b>women</b> have no such responsibility.|$|E
25|$|PTSD is {{believed}} to be caused by the experience {{of a wide range of}} traumatic events and, in particular if the trauma is extreme, can occur in persons with no predisposing conditions. Most people will experience at least one traumatizing event in their lifetime. Men are more likely to experience a traumatic event, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> are more likely to experience the kind of high-impact traumatic event that can lead to PTSD, such as interpersonal violence and sexual assault.|$|E

25|$|In October 1800 {{there were}} food riots in Calton. In 1816 a soup kitchen was {{established}} in Calton {{which led to a}} riot that again had to be put down by troops. By the 1830s the Calton handloom weavers were among the most destitute of the skilled working class. Not just men <b>but</b> <b>women</b> and children worked the looms in their struggle to survive. During the frequent depressions of that period many were forced to pawn their bedding and clothes to avoid starvation.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have begun}} to analyze the agency of women in {{overseas}} missions. At first, missionary societies officially enrolled only men, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> increasingly insisted on playing a variety of roles. Single women typically worked as educators. Wives assisted their missionary husbands in most of his roles. Advocates stopped short of calling {{for the end of}} specified gender roles, but they stressed the interconnectedness of the public and private spheres and spoke out against perceptions of women as weak and house-bound.|$|E
25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} earning wages or a salary {{are part of a}} modern phenomenon, one that developed {{at the same time as}} the growth of paid employment for men, <b>but</b> <b>women</b> have been challenged by inequality in {{the workforce}}. Until modern times, legal and cultural practices, combined with the inertia of longstanding religious and educational conventions, restricted women's entry and participation {{in the workforce}}. Economic dependency upon men, and consequently the poor socio-economic status of women, have had the same impact, particularly as occupations have become professionalized over the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
