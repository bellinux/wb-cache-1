5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel's second son Qedar. Though the tribal name is Arabic, it was first transcribed in Assyrian (8th century BCE) and Aramaic (6th century BCE), as the Arabic alphabet had not yet <b>been</b> <b>developed.</b> <b>In</b> the Mareshah onomasticon, the Qedarites are listed as an ethnic group whose name in Aramaic transliteration is QDRYN.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} culinary and medical {{advances}} have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Oldham. There are claims that Oldham was {{the birthplace of}} the first chip shop. The sometimes disputed claim of trade in deep-fried chipped potatoes {{is said to have been}} started around 1858–60 from an outlet owned by a John Lees, on what is the present site of Oldham's Tommyfield Market. In 1900 Oldham had the highest concentration of chip shops in the country, one for every 400 people. Rag Pudding is a savoury dish said to be native to Oldham. Yates Wine Lodge was founded in Oldham by Peter and Simon Yates in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Although the B-52A was {{the first}} {{production}} variant, these aircraft were used only in testing. The first operational version was the B-52B that had <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> parallel with the prototypes since 1951. First flying in December 1954, B-52B, AF Serial Number 52-8711, entered operational service with 93rd Heavy Bombardment Wing (93rd BW) at Castle Air Force Base, California, on 29 June 1955. The wing became operational on 12 March 1956. The training for B-52 crews consisted of five weeks of ground school and four weeks of flying, accumulating 35 to 50 hours in the air. The new B-52Bs replaced operational B-36s on a one-to-one basis.|$|E
5|$|Hepatitis C {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people infected, the disease becomes chronic, and they remain {{infectious}} {{for the rest of}} their lives unless they are treated. There is an effective treatment that uses the nucleoside analogue drug ribavirin combined with interferon. Treatments for chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by a similar strategy using lamivudine and other anti-viral drugs have <b>been</b> <b>developed.</b> <b>In</b> both diseases, the drugs stop the virus from reproducing and the interferon kills any remaining infected cells.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the medieval settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy VI is set {{in what is now}} known as a steampunk environment. The structure of society parallels that of {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game, and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution. Railroads and steamships are in use, and a coal mining operation is run in the northern town of Narshe. Additionally, several examples of modern engineering and weaponry (such as a chainsaw and drill) have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the Kingdom of Figaro. However, communication systems have not reached significant levels of development, with letters sent by way of carrier pigeon serving as the most common means of long-distance communication.|$|E
5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a {{predominantly}} white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound {{derived from the}} St. Hubert Hound which had <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds {{to give them an}} extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling a xenon/oxygen mixture {{activates}} {{production of}} the transcription factor HIF-1-alpha, which may lead to increased production of erythropoietin. The latter hormone is known to increase red blood cell production and athletic performance. Reportedly, doping with xenon inhalation {{has been used in}} Russia since 2004 and perhaps earlier. On August 31, 2014, the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) added xenon (and argon) to the list of prohibited substances and methods, although no reliable doping tests for these gases have yet <b>been</b> <b>developed.</b> <b>In</b> addition, effects of xenon on erythropoietin production in humans have not been demonstrated, so far.|$|E

40|$|Jakarta Bay and its {{neighbouring}} {{waters of}} Seribu Islands are categorized as fullly exploited water areas which theirs coastal areas accomodate multifunction services. Therefore, it needs precautionary approach to manage fisheries activity in that locations. The objectives {{of this study}} are to determine optimum allocation of fishing gears and fisheries development areas based on potential fishing gears in Jakarta Bay. The methods used in this study are Linear Goal Programming (LGP) and Locations Quotient (LQ). The result revealed that the potential fishing gears to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>were</b> pelagic danish seine, drift gillnet, boat lift net, set bottom long line, portable trap and muroami which have the optimum allocation for each fishing gear; 7 units, 98 units, 23 units, 18 units, 8547 units, and 798 units. The potential fishing gears for pelagic danish seine could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan and North Seribu Island Districts; drift gillnet could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Cilincing District; boat lift net could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan District; set bottom long line could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan District; portable trap could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Cilincing and South Seribu Island Districts while muroami could <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Penjaringan and South Seribu Island Districts...|$|R
5|$|Lexical {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language. In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers {{were found to have}} 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers are more likely to use variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E
5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be stacked up and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E

5|$|The V-2 rocket was one {{of several}} {{innovative}} long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational SRBM – that had <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that a barrage of rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.|$|E
5|$|The book {{introduced}} {{a number of}} new ideas in the field of human geography and social organization models, that had <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the western world during the 18th century. Among the sources that the authors used to compose Geographia Neoteriki, were the Géographie Moderne by Nicolle de La Croix, the Géographie Ancienne, and the Géographie Moderne, which were part of the Encyclopédie Méthodique by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke. Additionally, the authors had personally examined the areas described in the work. This element served both as the work's primary organizing mode as well as the basis for their historical approach.|$|E
5|$|The {{centimetre}} gram second {{system of}} units (CGS) was the first coherent metric system, having <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the 1860s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson. In 1874, this system was formally promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS). The system's characteristics are that density is expressed in , force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs. Thermal energy was defined in calories, one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 15.5°C to 16.5°C. The meeting also proposed two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties – the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of units.|$|E

5|$|Sonic Team {{developed}} {{the game in}} the United States, unlike their previous titles which had <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> Japan. The concept for the game originated during the development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in 1992, but actual development did not begin until after the release of Sonic & Knuckles in late 1994. The programming of the game began in April 1995 and total development spanned a period of six months. The development team consisted of staff who worked on previous Sonic the Hedgehog titles: Yuji Naka (the former head of AM8) was selected to act as lead programmer and producer, while Naoto Ohshima and Takashi Iizuka undertook the roles of director and lead designer, respectively. According to Naka, the initial development team consisted of seven people at the start of production, and gradually grew to 20 people once more programmers started to arrive.|$|E
