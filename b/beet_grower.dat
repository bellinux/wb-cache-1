50|$|Brunswick {{was founded}} in 1879. A large share of the early {{settlers}} being natives of Germany caused the name Brunswick to be selected. According to another source, a local <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> named the town after Brunswick, Germany, which was also a center of beet production.|$|E
50|$|In 1838 the Kleinwanzleben Zuckerfabrik (Kleinwanzleben Sugar Refinery) {{was founded}} as a stock company. In 1856 the {{majority}} of its shares were acquired by the sugar <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> and farmer Matthias Christian Rabbethge, one of the pioneers of the German sugar industry. In the same year he and his then future son-in-law Julius Giesecke founded a general commercial partnership (OHG). In 1885 the Rabbethge & Giesecke OHG became a joint stock company (Aktiengesellschaft) under the name Zuckerfabrik Klein Wanzleben formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke Aktiengesellschaft (AG). In 1937 it was changed into Rabbethge & Giesecke AG because the Reichsnährstand did not want any anonymous investors in the agriculture and forestry sector. After the Second World War the company was relocated to the Lower Saxonian city of Einbeck which has been its headquarters since then. In 1946 a rescue company was established under the name Rabbethge & Giesecke Saatzucht GmbH. The foundation of this rescue company was necessary in order to continue the Western activities of the original joint stock company, which was still based in Klein Wanzleben. In 1951 the two companies were merged and took the title Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke AG. In 1975 it was changed into KWS Kleinwanzlebener Saatzucht formerly Rabbethge & Giesecke and then finally reduced to KWS SAAT AG in 1999.The first international branch of KWS was established in 1900 in the Ukrainian town Vinnytsia to meet the demand of sugar beet farmers in Russia. In 1920 the company began to expand its business into corn, fodder beet and potato breeding. Following the relocation to Einbeck, KWS focused on the breeding of sugar beet, corn, rapeseed, sunflower, cereals and potatoes. In the years directly after the war, the company became an important supplier to the West German sugar beet industry. Since 1963 it has established subsidiaries in Europe, North and South America, Asia and North Africa.|$|E

30|$|Collective {{negotiations}} {{in the sugar}} sector. The quota system for sugar applies {{until the end of}} the 2016 / 2017 marketing year (Article 124 CMO Regulation). There will no longer be a guaranteed sugar beet price as from that date. The question arises whether growers will be able to continue to collectively negotiate prices with producers after the end of the quota regime, as is the current practice. Unlike in the milk, arable crops, olive oil and beef sectors, there is no explicit collective negotiation provision for sugar <b>beet</b> <b>growers</b> in the CMO. However, the rules for the sugar sector do provide for the collective negotiation of inter-professional agreements between associations of <b>beet</b> <b>growers</b> and sugar manufacturers (so-called agreements within the trade). The legislation has been recently integrated with a Delegated Act 7 opening the possibility to introduce a value sharing formula, including market bonuses and loses, being discussed between <b>beet</b> <b>growers</b> and manufacturers during the negotiation process.|$|R

40|$|Through Monte Carlo {{simulation}} techniques, {{all possible}} scenarios are analyzed {{of the impact}} of the potential adoption of genetically modified herbicide tolerant sugar beets on the economics of Belgian sugar beet growers. The most likely gain for the average Belgian sugar <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> amounts to 125 /ha. Assuming an adoption rate of 75 %, this transates into a total benefit foregone of 9 million for Belgian agriculture in the agricultural season 1998 - 1999. Three quarters of this benefit are absorbed by the farmers, while one quarter, i. e. 3 million, is extracted by the gene developers and seed suppliers. This refutes the argument of a seed industry extracting all benefits from biotechnology innovations. Production Economics, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|E
40|$|The sugar-beet {{nematode}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious of the beet pests. It appears to have been imported with some shipments of beet seed many years ago. It has been found widely scattered in four of the western sugar-beet States and probably exists in other States where beets have been grown for several years. The sugar-beet nematode is the cause of a great deal of loss to the <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> through reduction of his tonnage, and of a corresponding amount of loss to the sugar producer through reduction of the output of sugar. This bulletin treats of the nature and distribution of the sugar-beet nematode, indicates the most probable means by which this pest is spread, and suggests preventive measures and practical means of control.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{relates to}} a teaching exercise {{developed for the}} training of agronomy graduates at the AgroParisTech (France). Its aim {{is to show that}} agronomic knowledge (1) is useful to help us understand the ecological processes at the origin of a disaster, (2) must be related to other knowledge to be really effective in a context of action. The exercise is based on a role-playing game which leads the students to acquire by themselves most of the knowledge needed. The game context is the control of muddy flows in Normandy. The scenario is rather simple. A muddy flow occurs, in Normandy, at the outlet of a small catchment area composed of two villages: Hautville (upstream), and Basville (downstream). The damage occurs in Basville where some individual dwellings and a sugar refinery suffered severely from the muddy flow. A crisis meeting is organized. The students, divided into groups, are asked {{to play the role of}} the various participants attending the meeting, including the two mayors, the farmers, the sugar refinery manager and agricultural advisors. They are given specific details and a specific aim for the character they have to play. During the simulated meeting the teachers listen to the exchanges. At the end of the simulation they comment on the technical value of the arguments. Using the initial scenario and the specific details given to each group, the students have to understand that the muddy flow has two major origins. A sugar <b>beet</b> <b>grower</b> in Hautville is responsible for the runoff. A dairy farmer in Basville allowed the erosion of his soil by the concentrated runoff initiated in Hautville because he ploughed a previously permanent meadow. But the disaster is also due to the unsuitability of the damaged buildings downstream. The students are thus brought to propose some agronomic innovations via the collaboration between the different stakeholders attending the meeting. The students generally take a keen interest in this exercise. As a result, they and how the spatial organisation of the cultivation methods may interfere with these phenomena (reducing or increasing them). The students also learn about the roles of the various decision makers involved in the problems and their necessary coordination for the improvement of the environment...|$|E

50|$|Its origins {{date from}} 1903 when Charles Boettcher founded the Great Western Sugar Company {{and opened a}} sugar beet plant in Loveland, Colorado and another in Greeley, Colorado. When the Utah Sugar Company {{approached}} Great Western Sugar Company in 1902, the companies agreed to allow Utah Sugar to expand into Idaho, provided Utah Sugar didn't expand into Colorado. This was likely on behalf of Henry Osborne Havemeyer, whose American Sugar Refining Company owned 50% of both companies. The Loveland plant closed in 1977, when the company was purchased by the sugar firm Tate & Lyle, at which time the name was changed to the Western Sugar Company.

A Department of Justice meeting on July 19 showed that while the company was selling sugar for 23 to 28 cents per pound, it only cost 9 cents per pound to produce.
