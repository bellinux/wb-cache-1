5|$|Atherton, {{the third}} largest retail centre in the Wigan Borough, has a small {{pedestrian}} shopping centre. Most shops front onto Market Street and date from late Victorian times, the majority operated by small independent retailers, {{although there is a}} supermarket that brings customers into the town centre. Older, low cost, mostly terraced housing, surrounds the centre of town. Bolts and fastenings are still manufactured in Atherton <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> Bullough, one of a few remaining bolt and nut manufacturers in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{designation}} of SR78, a road known as the Brawley-Westmorland-Julian-Oceanside Highway (connecting Oceanside, Escondido, Ramona, Julian, Westmorland, and Brawley) existed during the early twentieth century. This road roughly followed the current routing of SR78 from Escondido {{to the east of}} Brawley, although it traveled along a different routing from Westmorland into Brawley. No road connected Brawley with Glamis in 1919; it was necessary to travel north through Calipatria to reach Blythe. East of the Sand Hills, there was a road from Glamis passing <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> Well into Palo Verde, which roughly follows the routing of SR78.|$|E

5|$|Boletus subluridellus is {{classified}} in the section Luridi of the genus Boletus. Section Luridi is characterized by boletes that immediately turn blue with cutting or bruising, narrow pores that are usually red, and the occasional presence of toxins in the fruit bodies. According to the scheme proposed <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> and Thiers, {{the form of the}} dermatocystidia (cystidia on the cap cuticle) is important to species delimitation in section Luridi. In a 1993 study, however, Roland Treu found no major consistent microscopic differences between B.subluridellus, B.rufocinnamomeus, and B.roseobadius.|$|E
5|$|Brodie's theories—laid {{out in the}} book—of Smith fathering {{children}} through polygamist relationships {{have been among the}} catalysts for professional genetic genealogy studies.

5|$|In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen {{recorded}} Smith playing acoustic {{songs for}} the short film Lucky Three: An Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, which was another Kill Rock Stars release. Either/Or came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass guitar, drums, keyboards, and electric guitars, all played <b>by</b> <b>Smith.</b> The album title {{was derived from the}} two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, whose works generally deal with themes such as existential despair, angst, death, and God.|$|E

In October 2011, however, discussions over Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50 million salary demanded <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.|$|E
5|$|The Latin {{specific}} name pennanti {{is named for}} Thomas Pennant, who described the fisher in 1771. Buffon had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a pekan. Pennant examined the same specimen but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as Schreber, who named it Mustela canadensis, and Boddaert, who named it Mustela melanorhyncha. The fisher was eventually placed in the genus Martes <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The Otis {{elevators}} are {{spanned by}} a series of neo-deco light bands extending wall to wall. The lobby extends completely through the block, with a giant entrance hall at Monroe Street and a 16-story full-height atrium in the link between the AT and USG towers (also designed <b>by</b> <b>Smith)</b> as both towers share a common appearance. The building boasts two public lobbies and a mezzanine-level lobby. The lobbies are among the most lavish in Chicago, and they are all decorated with patterned marble floors and walls, bronze, gold-leaf oak trim, and stylized lighting fixtures.|$|E

5|$|The {{level was}} {{designed}} by Jordan Thomas and Randy Smith, with a soundscape composed by Eric Brosius. Using theories of interactive horror design developed <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> in 2000, the team sought to create the scariest level ever to appear in a game. They took influence from works such as House of Leaves, Session 9 and the Silent Hill series, and they studied mental asylums and reportedly haunted buildings for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around radio personality Emma Silver, played by Doherty, as she attempts {{to pay off}} her recently deceased grandfather's debts by entering a pumpkin growing contest. As the movie progresses, a romance develops {{between her and her}} new neighbor Seth Cullen, portrayed <b>by</b> <b>Smith.</b> She must choose if she wants to stay in her rural hometown or accept a promising job opportunity in New York City. Mettler's brother's experiences participating in pumpkin growing contests was the inspiration for the film's narrative. It was filmed and produced {{over the course of a}} few days in October 2009.|$|E

5|$|Vanderbilt's {{first two}} touchdowns came early. After the kickoff went to Kentucky and the Wildcats' Saunders {{returned}} {{the ball to}} the 30-yard line, a punt was kicked to the Commodores; after a good return but little gain, the ball was punted back to Kentucky. Lavin fumbled on the return, and the ball was recovered by Neely on the 10-yard line. On third down, Frank Godchaux ran around the end for a touchdown; Rupert Smith scored the second and third touchdowns for the Commodores. After an exchange of punts, Vanderbilt began a drive on Kentucky's 32-yard line. Neely passed 22 yards to Pink Wade, with short runs <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> and Bomar followed <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> running around right end for a touchdown; Kentucky's Server kicked the ball into the end zone for a touchback. Alf Sharpe was ejected from the game for fighting, and the Commodores were penalized half the distance to the goal. Neely punted the ball to Lavin, who returned the ball five yards. On the next play, Lavin ran around the edge for 19 yards; three plays later, fullback Birkett Pribble carried the ball in for the score.|$|E
5|$|White {{probably}} {{collected the}} type material of B.spinulosa in 1792. The following year, the species was formally described <b>by</b> <b>Smith</b> in his A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland. It was thus the seventh Banksia species collected, {{and the fifth}} described. Smith gave it the specific epithet spinulosa, a Latin term meaning having minute spines, probably {{in reference to the}} leaf tips. Thus the species' full name is Banksia spinulosa Sm.|$|E
