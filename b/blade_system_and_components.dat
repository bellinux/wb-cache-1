500|$|Because {{titanium}} alloys have {{high tensile strength}} to density ratio, high corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance, and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts, fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), <b>and</b> hydraulic <b>systems.</b> In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{was one of the}} first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In engine applications, titanium is used for rotors, compressor <b>blades,</b> hydraulic <b>system</b> <b>components,</b> <b>and</b> nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.|$|R

The contractor and diffuser arrangement is used to accelerate the air-flow across the turbine's <b>blade</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> has been optimised using computational fluid dynamics. The results obtained from wind tunnel experiments show a 43 % increase in power output for the same incident wind speed if the contractor and diffuser arrangement is used. These results confirm data predicted through computational fluid dynamics. It is illustrated that CFD offers a virtual wind tunnel for aerodynamic optimization...|$|R
