25|$|The first {{recorded}} {{use of the}} phrase <b>book</b> <b>plate</b> was in 1791 by John Ireland in Hogarth Illustrated. Bookplates of that period offer very distinctive characteristics. In the simplicity of their heraldic arrangements they recall those of the previous age; but their physiognomy is totally different. In the first place, they invariably display the tincture lines and dots, after the method originally devised {{in the middle of}} the century by Petra Sancta, the author of Tesserae Gentilitiae, which by this time had become adopted throughout Europe. In the second, the mantling assumes a much more elaborate appearance—one that irresistibly recalls that of the periwig of the period surrounding the face of the shield. This style was undoubtedly imported from France, but it assumed a character of its own in England.|$|E

50|$|The {{founding}} Ethiopic {{collections in}} the British Library—74 manuscripts—came from the Church Mission Society and the materials {{that had been}} assembled by Karl Wilhelm Isenberg and Johann Ludwig Krapf, missionaries and linguists who travelled to the country between 1839 and 1842. However, some of the collection has an earlier provenance, for example, Extracts from the Chronicle of Axum, written on paper in about 1810 with the <b>book</b> <b>plate</b> of George Annesley, 2nd Earl of Mountnorris. In 1847 the Trustees of the British Museum published a catalogue of the Ethiopian manuscripts that were then under their care.

25|$|After {{employment}} {{with the}} Archbishop, Salvator entered {{the service of}} the king of Denmark, Christian IV from 1601 to 1606.

50|$|Although his {{reputation}} will live almost exclusively {{as that of}} a poet, Tabley was a man of many studious tastes. He was at one time an authority on numismatics (he was a first cousin of the numismatist John, Count de Salis-Soglio), he wrote two novels, published A Guide to the Study of <b>Book</b> <b>Plates</b> (1880), and the fruit of his careful researches in botany was printed posthumously in his elaborate Flora of Cheshire (1899).|$|R
5000|$|It {{is clear}} that the {{original}} engraving is the French version, published in 1784 signed [...] "de Loraine del./Chevillet sculp." [...] The English <b>book</b> <b>plate</b> was obviously engraved after it. Chevillet is a well-known engraver; [...] "de Loraine" [...] is no doubt a misspelling of de Lorraine, and probably refers either to August de Lorraine or his son Jean-Baptiste de Lorraine (born 1737), both active (but obscure) engravers in Paris in the 1770s. It is possible that de Lorraine made his drawing (which Chevillet engraved) from yet another image, but unlikely that that will ever turn up. Curiously, Asgill sports a gold epaulette on his left shoulder. A battalion company officer in the Foot Guards would have worn a single epaulette on his right shoulder but engravers usually reversed the images, and while they sometimes remembered, e.g., to move a cockade, they could easily have forgotten the epaulette, since in French uniforms single epaulettes were usually on the left shoulder.|$|E
5000|$|The Epic {{publications}} {{were very}} shortly after their initial release collected by American specialty publisher Graphitti Designs in their [...] "Moebius" [...] collection [...] - [...] for whom Giraud created new <b>book</b> <b>plate</b> art, also outside the legal purview of Dargaud [...] - [...] , a deluxe limited edition anthology collection, released in a 1500 copies per volume edition, each volume at least containing {{two of the}} Epic releases. The collection, which ran for nine volumes, also contained Giraud's science fiction body of work, that was concurrently released by Epic in a similar manner. Volume Moebius #9, containing the [...] "The Lost Dutchman's Mine" [...] and [...] "The Ghost with the Golden Bullets", also included the non-Blueberry westerns [...] "King of the Buffalo" [...] (short), and the other Giraud/Charlier western strip, Jim Cutlass: [...] "Mississippi River". Excepting the 1996 Mojo Press release, no additional Blueberry comics {{have been published in}} English since 1993, and, again excepting the Mojo Press release, no English Blueberry reprints have seen the light of day either, contrary to his other work as [...] "Moebius".|$|E
50|$|The Vaux Passional (Peniarth 482D) is an {{illuminated}} manuscript {{from the late}} fifteenth to early sixteenth century. With thirty-four large miniatures {{in the style of}} the Flemish School it is one of the most elaborately decorated manuscripts in the collection of the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth. It retains an original binding of wooden boards covered in velvet from the early sixteenth century. The volume contains the <b>book</b> <b>plate</b> of Watkin Williams of Penbedw.The first section of the manuscript (ff. 1-185v), La Passion de Nostre Seigneur (The Passion of Our Lord), which was originally translated from Latin into French for Isabelle of Bavaria in 1398, is almost identical to several other Passion de Jésus-Christ manuscripts such as Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal MSS. 2038 and 2386, and Bibliothèque Mazarine MS. 949. Thirty-three of the thirty-four miniatures accompany this text. The presentation page (f. 9) shows Henry VII and his children, Margaret, Mary and the future Henry VIII, mourning the death of Elizabeth of York, his wife and their mother. The king is clad in robes of mourning; in the background his daughters, wearing black hoods, kneel in front of a fire; and behind them their brother Henry, dressed in a green smock, clasps his arms around his head and weeps on his mother's deathbed.|$|E

The earlier Fraktur were executed entirely by hand, while printed text became increasingly common in later examples. Common artistic motifs in Fraktur include birds (distelfinks), hearts, and tulips, as well as blackletter (Fraktur) and italic calligraphy.|$|R
