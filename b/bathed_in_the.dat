5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|All Puranas {{agree that}} upon {{reaching}} Varanasi, Brahma's skull falls off Bhikshatana's palm {{at a place}} now called Kapala-mochana ("liberating from the skull") and Vishaksena's corpse disappears. The sin, personified by Brahmahatya, vanishes into hell. Vishaksena is resurrected and the sanctified Bhairava-Shiva, having <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sacred pond in Varanasi, casts off the appearance of Bhikshatana and returns to his abode.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Pandya kingdom in the 14th century, Kumbakonam was conquered by the Vijayanagar Empire. Krishnadevaraya (1509–29), the emperor of Vijayanagara visited the town in 1524 and is {{believed}} to have <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> famous Mahamaham tank during the Mahamaham festival. Kumbakonam was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks and the Thanjavur Nayaks from 1535 to 1673 when it fell to the Marathas. Each of these foreign dynasties had a considerable impact on the demographics and culture of the region. When the Vijayanagar Empire fell in 1565, there was a mass influx of poets, musicians and cultural artists from the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians {{placed a}} great value on hygiene and appearance. Most <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nile {{and used a}} pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk. Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; {{perfumes}} and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin. Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and {{both men and women}} of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics. Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved. Mothers were responsible for taking care of the children, while the father provided the family's income.|$|E
5|$|Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{identified}} primary {{concerns for}} the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and {{the water from the}} treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the {{neurological}} {{phase of}} infection {{is thought to}} be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is that the virus is imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held her right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E

25|$|In most fish, and {{a number}} of other aquatic animals (both {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates) the respiratory system consists of gills, which are either partially or completely external organs, <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> watery environment. This water flows over the gills by a variety of active or passive means. Gas exchange takes place in the gills which consist of thin or very flat filaments and lammelae which expose a very large surface area of highly vascularized tissue to the water.|$|E
25|$|Although the Parthenon is architecturally {{a temple}} {{and is usually}} called so, {{it is not really}} one in the {{conventional}} sense of the word. A small shrine has been excavated within the building, on the site of an older sanctuary probably dedicated to Athena {{as a way to get}} closer to the goddess, but the Parthenon never hosted the cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens: the cult image, which was <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea and to which was presented the peplos, was an olivewood xoanon, located at an older altar on the northern side of the Acropolis.|$|E
25|$|In 1900 Sorolla {{began to}} paint {{children}} bathing.

In the foreground {{one of the children}} comes from the sea and is awaited by a young woman who stretches out a white cloth to dry the wet child. Already this picture anticipates Sorolla's themes in Walk on the Beach. So the white fabric plays a central role: The movement of the cloth in the wind is already the main subject, the shore area between the water and beach has no clear contours and the whole picture is <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light of early evening.|$|E

25|$|Various Puranas narrate {{the greatness}} of bathing in the Yamuna. The Padma Purana narrates {{the story of two}} brothers, who lived a life of indulgence and lust and gave up the virtuous ways. They finally plunged in poverty and resorted to robbery and were killed by beasts in the forest. Both of them reached Yama's court for judgement. While the elder brother was sentenced to Naraka (hell), the younger was granted Svarga (heaven). Astonished, the younger brother asked the reason for it, as both lived similar lives. Yama {{explained}} that the younger brother had lived in the ashram of a sage on Yamuna's banks and <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sacred river for two months. The first month absolved him of sins and the second one granted him place in heaven.|$|E
25|$|Thus it {{happened}} that, with Hermes as their guide, the three candidates <b>bathed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of Ida, then confronted Paris on Mount Ida in the climactic moment {{that is the}} crux of the tale. After failing to judge their beauty with their clothing on, the three goddesses stripped nude to convince Paris of their worthiness. While Paris inspected them, each attempted with her powers to bribe him; Hera offered to make him king of Europe and Asia, Athena offered wisdom and skill in war, and Aphrodite, who had the Charites and the Horai to enhance her charms with flowers and song (according to a fragment of the Cypria quoted by Athenagoras of Athens), offered the world's most beautiful woman (Euripides, Andromache, l.284, Helena l. 676). This was Helen of Sparta, wife of the Greek king Menelaus. Paris accepted Aphrodite's gift and awarded the apple to her, receiving Helen as well as the enmity of the Greeks and especially of Hera. The Greeks' expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War.|$|E
