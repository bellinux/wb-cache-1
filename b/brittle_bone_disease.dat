5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E
25|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), {{also known}} as <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> {{is a group of}} genetic {{disorders}} that mainly affect the bones. It results in bones that break easily. The severity may be mild to severe. Other symptoms may include a blue tinge to the whites of the eye, short height, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems, and problems with the teeth. Complications may include cervical artery and aortic dissection.|$|E

50|$|Firdaus Kanga {{was born}} with osteogenesis imperfecta, a {{condition}} also known as <b>brittle</b> <b>bones</b> <b>disease.</b> This left him with several painful fractures throughout his childhood and adolescence in India. He {{grew up in a}} family of five, in a one bedroom Bombay apartment. He spoke out against the Indian socialist consensus, and was a supporter of Reagan and Thatcher politics. Kanga's first major achievement was Trying to Grow (also translated into French Grandir and Italian) a novel exploring disability, sexuality and culture. In India where religion still dictates most cultural acts, Kanga's novel broke several taboos - portraying disabled people with healthy, rich sexual appetites. Kanga publicly rejected Hindu notions of karma (laying responsibility for suffering at what humans may have done in their last birth) often foisted on disabled people. Kanga {{was one of the first}} few public figures in India who stood up for the views of gay people, celebrating sexuality, in a society that still criminalizes, though hardly, if ever, prosecutes homosexuality.|$|R

My purpose with this capstone is to introduce adaptive apparel for people who are disabled to be able to dress themselves, or {{to make it easier for}} people to help them dress, that is also trendy. My research started with seeing what kinds of adaptive clothing, if any, was already out there (secondary research). Then I took my own disability experiences and interviewed my friend about her brother’s disability for primary research. Then I took what I learned from my research and created a small apparel line consisting of a winter and summer outfit for women with <b>brittle</b> <b>bone</b> <b>diseases</b> and a formal outfit, everyday outfit, and sport outfit for people with Adrenoleukodystrophy. I found that clothing made from a cotton/spandex/polyester blend is most appropriate for clothing, and drawstrings and hidden zipper or snaps are the best way to make the clothes adaptable but look like everyday outfits. There already is adaptive apparel out there, but with my adaptations and update fashion wise, the clothes can be trendier and help people gain more independence. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

Although OI is most commonly associated with mutations of the genes for type I collagen, many other genes (some associated with type I collagen processing) have now been identified.

50|$|Maternal {{deficiencies}} may be {{the cause}} of overt <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> from before birth and impairment of bone quality after birth. The primary cause of congenital rickets is vitamin D deficiency in the mother's blood, which the baby shares. Vitamin D ensures that serum phosphate and calcium levels are sufficient to facilitate the mineralization of bone. Congenital rickets may also be caused by other maternal diseases, including severe osteomalacia, untreated celiac disease, malabsorption, pre-eclampsia, and premature birth. Rickets in children is similar to osteoporosis in the elderly, with <b>brittle</b> <b>bones.</b> Pre-natal care includes checking vitamin levels and ensuring that any deficiencies are supplemented.|$|R

40|$|BackgroundMany studies {{describe}} {{a relationship between}} <b>brittle</b> <b>bones</b> and cardiovascular <b>disease.</b> The physiopathology {{may be explained by}} the osteoprogerin (OPG) that protects the vascular wall and inhibits the RANK-RANKL system which is a strong inhibitor of osteoclasts. Thus it seems interesting to assess the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in patients with a confirmed coronary heart disease. Material and MethodsThis study enrolled 46 patients who underwent a coronary angiography for chest pain. We identified two groups of patients:– Group 1 : patients with significant coronary artery disease. – Group 2 : patients with normal coronary angiography. All patients had a physical exam, a phosphocalcic investigation and bone mineral density (BMD). ResultsThe mean age of the population was 66. 7 ± 6. 5 years old. 52. 17 % were women. Among the 46 patients, 21. 7 % had an osteoporosis, 41. 3 % an osteopenia and 37 % had a normal bone mineral density. 52 % des 52 % of the studied population had significant coronary artery disease, 48 % had a normal coronary angiography. At the statistical analysis, prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p< 0, 001). ConclusionThe association between osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease is a reality. However mechanisms are not well known. Thus it could be interesting to suggest a DXA to coronary patients and a large cardiovascular investigation for osteoporotic patients...|$|R
