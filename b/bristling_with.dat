5|$|The {{most recent}} Grade I {{building}} in North Somerset is Tyntesfield, a Victorian Gothic Revival estate near Wraxall. It {{was acquired by}} the National Trust in June 2002 after a fund raising campaign to prevent it being sold to private interests and ensure it be opened to the public. The appeal by the National Trust collected £8.2 million from the public in just 100 days and the Trust also received the largest single grant ever by the National Heritage Memorial Fund (at £17.4 million), which caused some controversy. The house is built of Bath stone, and is highly picturesque, <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> turrets and possessing an elaborate roof.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally {{this was}} an {{exciting}} period, but Honoré I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honoré's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded {{the end of the}} rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> cannon. Underneath the courtyard a cistern was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.|$|E

This may {{take the form of a}} single incident, such as Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> arrows or St Christopher carrying the Christ Child across the river, or the saint's life may be shown in a narrative sequence, similar to the way in which the life of Jesus is depicted, such as the Life of St Augustine by Benozzo Gozzoli in the Church of Sant' Agostino, San Gimignano.|$|E
25|$|This term {{refers to}} signs that {{represent}} by resemblance, such as portraits and some paintings though {{they can also}} be natural or mathematical. Iconicity is independent of actual connection, even if it occurs because of actual connection. An icon is or embodies a possibility, insofar as its object need not actually exist. A photograph is regarded as an icon because of its resemblance to its object, but is regarded as an index (with icon attached) because of its actual connection to its object. Likewise, with a portrait painted from life. An icon's resemblance is objective and independent of interpretation, but is relative to some mode of apprehension such as sight. An icon need not be sensory; anything can serve as an icon, for example a streamlined argument (itself a complex symbol) is often used as an icon for an argument (another symbol) <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> particulars.|$|E

500|$|The {{house is}} built of {{two types of}} Bath Stone, and is highly picturesque, <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> turrets and {{possessing}} an elaborate roof. The combined effect of the architecture and chosen materials {{has been described by}} journalist Sir Simon Jenkins as [...] "severe". During restoration, stonemasons either conserved or, on occasion, copy-carving new sections, carving new mouldings to replace standard architectural elements that formed the weathering, as well repointing most of the miles of lime pointing. All stone was accurately matched to the original, with Veyzeys quarry near Tetbury providing Cotswold oolitic limestone. The house, which includes the servants' wing and the chapel, was made a Grade II* listed building in 1973, and has since been upgraded to Grade I.|$|E
500|$|Several reviews {{considered}} Born Villain to be {{a comeback}} for the band. Matthew Horton of Virgin Media {{described it as}} [...] "a new step forward, <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> a vitality that Manson {{has no right to}} still have in his locker this far down the line." [...] Similarly, Kill Hipsters called it [...] "one hell of a comeback for a guy everyone–including myself–thought was well and truly dead and gone." [...] Loudwire's Graham Hartmann praised the album as a whole, as did Rick Florino of Artistdirect, who said: [...] "From top to bottom, it's Manson's most vicious and vibrant effort since Antichrist Superstar. Make no mistake about it: this is Manson at his best." [...] Bloody Disgusting ranked it among the band's best work.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{have held}} Lucas blameless {{for refusing to}} fight Elphinstone's force, which was far {{superior}} in both ships and men. Elphinstone's ships carried {{more than twice as}} many men as the Batavian expedition, even before the British troops ashore are taken into account. Lucas could only muster 1,972 men compared with the 4,291 under Elphinstone's command. The expedition has however been criticised for its lack of preparedness; while it is true that promised French support failed to appear, the Batavian troops were insufficient in number to seriously threaten the British garrison. As [...] Parkinson noted: [...] "what could be the point of landing a few hundred men on a shore <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> English bayonets?" [...] An unintended effect of the campaign however was to forestall a British invasion of Île de France, which Elphinstone had postponed to prepare for Lucas's arrival and which was ultimately cancelled entirely.|$|E

500|$|As {{the forces}} loyal to Nobunaga {{moved across the}} plain, several skirmishes were fought in a futile effort to turn the invading forces. [...] Nobunaga's forces then entered the town of Inoguchi, which lay below Inabayama Castle. [...] To clear {{the field of view}} and provide space for the besieging army, Kinoshita Hideyoshi's vanguard set fire to the town. [...] As some {{soldiers}} took positions on Mount Inoguchi and a nearby ridgeline, the main army positioned itself before Mount Inaba to begin the siege. [...] The greatly augmented army, now <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> the flags of the Saitō clan's former vassals and allies, bewildered the castle's defenders. [...] During the days that followed, Kinoshita dispatched men to gather intelligence, especially from peasants willing to help. [...] Kinoshita met with a local resident, Horio Yoshiharu, who showed him a little-known path that led up the north slope of the mountain. [...] The north slopes below the castle were so steep that assault by a large force was considered impossible,and was thus effectively ignored by the defenders at the advent of battle.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews {{for the first}} season were very positive, with critics noting the high production values, the well-realized world, compelling characters, and giving particular note {{to the strength of}} the child actors. Tim Goodman's review for The Hollywood Reporter stated, [...] "a few minutes into HBO's epic Game of Thrones series, it's clear that the hype was right and the wait was worth it". Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "...a great and thundering series of political and psychological intrigue <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> vivid characters, cross-hatched with tantalizing plotlines and seasoned with a splash of fantasy". New York Posts Linda Stasi gave Thrones 3.5/4 stars stating, [...] "The art direction, acting and incredible sets are as breathtaking as the massive scope of the series". Many critics praised Peter Dinklage for his portrayal of Tyrion Lannister, with Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly stating, [...] "...if Dinklage doesn't get an Emmy for his clever, rude Tyrion Lannister, I'll be gobsmacked" [...] and Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times stating, [...] "If the man doesn't win an Emmy, heads should certainly roll".|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} Fromental Halévy's death in 1862, Bizet had been {{approached}} {{on behalf of}} Mme. Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera Noé. Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy {{that she could not}} tolerate the company of her younger daughter Geneviève, who from the age of 15 lived with other family members. It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: [...] "I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!" [...] The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: [...] "penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian", which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from [...] "a family <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> artists and eccentrics". By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: [...] "Bizet has spirit and talent. He should succeed".|$|E

500|$|In {{an early}} review, Billboard called the record [...] "short, to the point, and <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> attitude," [...] and {{predicted}} it would poise the band for commercial breakthrough. In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone Neva Chonin wrote, [...] "It's all harmless but still gnarly enough to foment {{the kind of}} anti-everything rebellion that spawned rock & roll {{way back in the}} day." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic desbribed it as a [...] "fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release." [...] Kerrang! wrote that the album includes [...] "enough energy, attitude and cracking songs here to ensure that blink will be remembered for more than just onstage nudity." [...] The catchy, pop sensibility of the album was praised by Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club, describing the band as finding success within a [...] "well-worn genre" [...] (punk rock). The New York Times also designated the record its 'Album of the Week'. The record did have its detractors: British music publication New Musical Express (NME) gave the record a very poor review, calling the record despicable, [...] "wholly toothless and soulless" [...] and deriding the band as [...] "as bad, as meaningless, as the cock-rockers and hippy wankers punk originally sought to destroy." ...|$|E
500|$|Twenty-first century {{critical}} {{opinion of}} the film is widely positive. Eraserhead holds an average rating of 91% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, representing the distillation of 55 reviews, with the critical consensus [...] "David Lynch's surreal Eraserhead uses detailed visuals and a creepy score to create a bizarre and disturbing look into a man's fear of parenthood." [...] Writing for Empire magazine, Steve Beard rated the film five stars out of five. He felt that it was [...] "a lot more radical and enjoyable than [...] later Hollywood efforts" [...] and highlighted its mix of surrealist body horror and black comedy. The BBC's Almar Haflidason awarded Eraserhead three stars out of five, describing it as [...] "an unremarkable feat by [...] later standards". Haflidason felt that the film was a gathering of loosely related ideas, adding that it is [...] "so consumed with surreal imagery that there are almost limitless possibilities to read personal theories into it"; the reviewer's own take on these themes were that they represented a fear of personal commitment and featured [...] "a strong sexual undercurrent". A reviewer writing for Film4 rated Eraserhead five stars out of five, describing it as [...] "by turns beautiful, annoying, funny, exasperating and repellent, but always <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> a nervous energy". The Film4 reviewer felt that Eraserhead was unlike most films released to that point, save for the collaborations between Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí; however, Lynch denies having seen any of these before Eraserhead. Writing for The Village Voice, Nathan Lee praised the film's use of sound, writing [...] "to see the film means nothing—one must also hear it". He described the film's sound design as [...] "an intergalactic seashell cocked to the ears of an acid-tripping gargantua".|$|E
500|$|At 17:00 the {{regiment}} {{was released from}} their attachment to the 60th Division, {{and returned to the}} command of the New Zealand brigade, which was advancing along the Jordan Valley, joining them an hour later. Problems crossing the mountainous terrain postponed any attack until daylight. At 03:00 the brigade moved out again with the Wellingtons on the right, advancing towards Hill 306, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the left towards Hill 288 and the Auckland Mounted Rifles forming the reserve. The 6th Squadron attacked Hill 306 from the south and the 2nd Squadron from the south-west. At dawn they came up against a large group of Turks [...] "in a fortress-like position {{on the top of a}} steep hill-face, <b>bristling</b> <b>with</b> machine guns, commanding the surrounding country". With no artillery available, the squadrons were unable to advance with any speed, using only their small arms to support the assault. A gap appeared in the line between {{the regiment}} and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, who had moved further north then had been intended. So the Auckland Mounted Rifles moved forward to assault Hill 288 instead. These galloped forward and captured Hill 288, forcing the Turks to withdraw, and the Wellingtons occupied Hill 306. Turkish artillery bombarded the hill, while their troops retired to the east. Holding an observation line overnight, at 06:00 the next morning the brigade advanced towards Jericho leaving the 9th Squadron to capture Rijm El Bahr, including its stores and boats, on the Dead Sea. Jericho was captured the same day by the Australian 1st Light Horse Brigade. As a whole, the operation cost the Wellingtons one killed and four wounded. On 22 February the regiment returned to Bethlehem along the Jericho–Jerusalem road, eventually returning to the Mar Elias Monastery. They met their commanding officer, Whyte, who had now recovered from his injuries. Three days later the brigade crossed back to the west, returning to Richon.|$|E
