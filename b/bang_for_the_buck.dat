500|$|Response to Episode One was {{generally}} positive, and reviewers praised {{the game for}} having more intricate, well-paced gameplay than Half-Life 2. The game's interactivity, particularly {{in the form of}} Alyx and her reactions to the player's actions and the events of the game, was also singled out for praise. PC Gamer commented that [...] "while this inaugural episode may not be the essential FPS that Half-Life2 is, I can't imagine any shooter fan who'd want to miss it." [...] In its review, PC Gamer UK directed particular praise to the balance between puzzle-oriented and action-oriented challenges throughout the game. In Australia, the magazine PC PowerPlay awarded the game 10 out of 10. Edge praised the [...] "deftness" [...] with which the game was able to direct the player's eyes, and the strength of Alyx as a companion, concluding, [...] "In an interactive genre bound to the traditions of the pop-up gun and invisible hero, it simply doesn't get more sophisticated than this." [...] Episode One earned a scores of 87/100 and 85.59% on review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. IGN awarded Episode One with the title of [...] "Best PC FPS of 2006" [...] and described it as a [...] "great <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> using Valve's new episodic plan", although it did not offer [...] "the complete experience that Half-Life2 was".

40|$|Strains {{evident in}} the housing finance system {{on the eve of}} the 80 's suggest {{significant}} difficulties in meeting the housing demands of the decade ahead. The annual increase in residential mortgages outstanding had climbed to historic levels, relative to GNP, without raising residential construction spending above its ordinary share of GNP. This very weak housing <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mortgage <b>buck</b> is traceable, ultimately, to the soaring volume of sales in the used home market, relative to those in the new home market. With significant inflation rates continuing through the 1980 's, mortgage lenders will be under great pressure from demands to refinance the existing housing stock, even if the rate of ownership turnover does not persist at the levels of the late 70 's. And, as the dollar demands mount, for new and used housing purchases, lenders may find repayment flows from earlier loans continuing to provide a historically small fraction of the funds they need in supplying these demands.

40|$|TO THE EDITOR: I enjoyed Green et al. ’s Viewpoint (1) on {{exercise}} and cardiovascular risk reduction suggesting that en-dothelial function improvement {{underlies much of}} the lower risk attributed to exercise training. I {{would be surprised if}} substantial opposition to this notion surfaced. We certainly know that exercise reduces risk and also improves endothelial function. This letter simply asks why wasn’t the 2000 NEJM paper by Hambrecht et al. (2) discussed by Green et al? Much of Green et al. ’s arguments are based on studies evaluating vessels other than coronary arteries. It is not clear how cardiac event risk would be directly reduced by endothelial improve-ment in other vascular beds (other than by blood pressure reduction). It would seem that <b>the</b> biggest <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> exercise <b>buck</b> in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction would come from enhanced coronary endothelial function, and the Ham-brecht paper above tackles this head-on in humans. Since it is unlikely that Green et al. were unaware of the Hambrecht paper, one wonders if there may be a concern with that study. If so, it would be important for Green et al. to explain it...|$|R

40|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} available for weed management, a strategic approach {{is required to}} give <b>the</b> best <b>bang</b> <b>for</b> your <b>buck.</b> <b>The</b> current study incorporates: (1) a model ensemble approach to identify areas of uncertainty and commonality regarding a species invasive potential, (2) current distribution of the invaded species, and (3) connectivity of systems to identify target regions and focus efforts for more effective management. Uncertainty in the prediction of suitable habitat for H. amplexicaulis (study species) in Australia was addressed in an ensemble-forecasting approach to compare distributional scenarios from four models (CLIMATCH; CLIMEX; boosted regression trees [BRT]; maximum entropy [Maxent]). Models were built using subsets of occurrence and environmental data. Catchment risk was determined through incorporating habitat suitability, the current abundance and distribution of H. amplexicaulis, and catchment connectivity. Our results indicate geographic differences between predictions of different approaches. Despite these differences a number of catchments in northern, central, and southern Australia were identified as high risk of invasion or further spread by all models suggesting they should be given priority <b>for</b> <b>the</b> management of H. amplexicaulis.
