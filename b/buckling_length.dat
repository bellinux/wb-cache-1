40|$|An {{approach}} is presented {{for determining the}} minimum weight design of aircraft wing models which takes into consideration aerodynamics-structure coupling when calculating both zeroth order information needed for analysis and first order information needed for optimization.

However, we observed that the non-bonded forces {{along the length of}} these structures are not screened at physiological conditions and introduce a buckling instability. For ?-helical systems of same composition, but different lengths, this is identified by a drop in Kb for longer helices and the length where this drop is triggered {{is referred to as the}} critical <b>buckling</b> <b>length.</b> When shorter than their critical <b>buckling</b> <b>length</b> they behave linearly, and Kb calculated using normal mode analysis in this regime is about (3. 0 ? 3. 4) ? 10 - 28 Nm 2 for ?-helices with varying compositions, and about (1. 9 ? 2. 1) ? 10 ? 27 Nm 2 for coiled coils with leucine zipper periodicity.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{buckling}} of {{hollow section}} members in tubular trusses. The existing codes and instructions {{do not take}} into account several factors that have been indicated to affect buckling lengths in tubular trusses. Furthermore, the existing formulae give -in many cases- <b>buckling</b> <b>length</b> factors that are excessively conservative or even underestimated results. Thus, <b>buckling</b> <b>length</b> of the bracing and chord members is investigated. The emphasis is on the in-plane buckling of K-joints. The influence of dimensional properties of truss members to the joint stiffness is examined. In general, obtaining <b>buckling</b> <b>length</b> is simple in the cases of fully rigid or hinged connections. Since braces are usually welded to the chords in steel girders, the connections can be semi-rigid. This makes the calculation of buckling challenging, because the stiffness of the connection needs to be determined. In this thesis, the the joint stiffness is determined by FE-modeling. The aim of this thesis is to confirm a wider applicability range for recently developed formulae. FE models are validated and verified, after which joint stiffnesses of new joints are derived.

The initial trials also found that changing the lengths of the turn buckles to adjust the shaking beaters position on the canopy shaker significantly affected the grapefruit detachment percentage at the 10 % level of significance. The third beaters' position (turn <b>buckles</b> <b>length</b> 16 inches) had the highest average of 87. 97 %. The beaters shaking speed also significantly affected the grapefruit detachment percentage at the 10 % level of significance. By increasing the beater shaking speed from 56. 50 to 73 in/sec, the grapefruit detachment percentage increased up to 79. 72 % (the maximum average). Also, by increasing the length of the additional beaters, the maximum grapefruit detachment percentage increased to 93. 29 %. On the other hand, the average magnitude of the acceleration (g) among the tree canopy branches increased significantly (average magnitude 8. 65 g) when the shaking beater number was increased from 14 beaters to 26 beaters. Looking at the previous findings, this study recommends operating the new prototype citrus harvesting machine either at forward speed 0. 62 mi/hr or 1. 42 mi/hr, with the turn <b>buckle</b> <b>length</b> at 16 inches, and the beaters' shaking speed at 73 in/sec.

The buckle temperatures of the perfect pipelines are proportional to the <b>buckle</b> <b>lengths</b> and axial forces.

Theoretical framework for predicting the morphology of type B breakout mode is developed {{for the first time in}} this study; both fracture mechanics and shear failure theories are used in predicting the breakout geometry. Furthermore, a framework for estimating the size of caving produced during breakout (type A or B) is presented. Using asymptotic analysis of crack-boundary interactions, the state of damage around the borehole during the breakout process is determined, and the limiting <b>buckling</b> <b>lengths</b> of the resulting wing-cracks are predicted based on plate buckling theory. Third, a three-phase erosion kinetic equations, coupled with an erosion constitutive law, which is based on virtual power principle, are used in modeling radial and axial erosion in the reservoir and along the wellbore respectively.

40|$|An arched {{structure}} {{provides an}} effective load carrying system for large span structures. When {{it comes to}} long span roof structures, timber arches {{are one of the}} best solutions from both structural and aesthetical point of view. Glulam arched structures are often designed using slender elements due to economic consideration. Such slender cross-section shape increases the risk of instability. Instability analysis of straight members such as beam and column are explicitly defined in Eurocode. However, for instability of curved members no analytical approach is provided in the code, thus some numerical method is required. Nonetheless, an approximation is frequently used to obtain the effective <b>buckling</b> <b>length</b> for the arched structures in the plane of arches. In this master thesis a linear buckling analysis is carried out in Abaqus to obtain an optimal effective <b>buckling</b> <b>length</b> both in-plane and out-of-plane for circular glulam arched structures. The elastic springs are used to simulate the overall stiffness of the bracing system. The results obtained by the FE simulations are compared with a simple approximation method. Besides, the forces acting on the bracings system is obtained based on 3 D geometric nonlinear stress analysis of the timber trusses. Our findings conclude that the approximation method overestimates the effective <b>buckling</b> <b>length</b> for the circular glulam arched structures. In addition, the study indicates that the position of the lateral supports {{along the length of the}} arch is an important design aspect for buckling behaviour of the arched structures. Moreover, in order to acquire an effective structure lateral supports are needed both in extrados and intrados. Furthermore, instead of using elastic spring elements to simulate the overall stiffness of the bracing system, a full 3 D simulation of two parallel arches was performed.

In the real structures {{in general and the}} especially in the prefabricated structures the connection of members in the nodes can be partially rigid which can be very significant for the changes in tension and deformation. If the influence of the normal forces is significant and the structure is slender then it is necessary to carry out a calculation according to the Second order theory because the balance between internal and external forces really established on the deformed configuration and displacements in strict formation are also unreal.

These shear walls were tested under monotonic and cyclic lateral loading, where two of three shear walls were also subjected to a constant gravity load. In total, 32 steel frame/wood panel shear walls composed of 1. 09 [...] 1. 37 mm thick steel studs sheathed with DFP, CSP or OSB panels were tested and analyzed. The equivalent energy elastic-plastic analysis approach was used to determine design values for stiffness, strength, ductility and overstrength. The data from this most recent series of tests indicates that the additional gravity loads do not have a detrimental influence on the lateral behaviour of a steel frame/wood panel shear wall if the chord studs are designed to carry the combined lateral and gravity forces following a capacity based approach. A resistance factor of 0. 7 was found to be in agreement with previous tests that did not include gravity loads. The calculated seismic force modification factors also agreed with the previous test results, which suggest that Rd = 2. 5 and Ro = 1. 7...|$|R
40|$|Progressive {{collapse}} is {{a collapse}} where a local failure {{leads to a}} disproportionate collapse. Different terms like initial failure, propagation of failures and disproportionate damage are important aspects of such collapses. In current design practice, a method to measure a structures’ progressive collapse sensitivity in its early design phase and taking into account all aspects of a structures collapse resistance does not exist. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a tool that takes into account all aspects of a progressive collapse and can aid the engineer in assessing a design, in its early design stage, on progressive collapse. At first, the initial failure is elaborated. Different events can cause the failure of elements. The probability an initiating event occurs at a certain element is different for each element. Mitigating measures can limit the chance of occurring for certain events. The initial events are applied on the model in 2 steps. First the location (or: element) of the event is chosen by a random selection method and a distribution of failure chances on the model. Second, the size of the damage is determined by applying a Gaussian curve over the model, both in x- and z-direction. This determines if adjacent elements, related to the removed element in step 1, are removed. The model is calculated by FEA-software. Only linear and first order calculations are considered. These limitations lead to inaccuracies of the results compared with reality. A stability analysis has been performed to determine the <b>buckling</b> <b>lengths</b> of columns with more accuracy. Catenary action {{is one of the main}} modelling methods in designing against progressive collapse. This method is implemented into the tool. Iteratively, the forces and deformations are calculated which develop during the occurrence of catenary action. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
