'Mary Hann,' says I, rot to desperation, 'I shall throttle this darling if he goes on.' 'Do,' says she--'and GO INTO THE REFRESHMENT room,' says she--a snatchin the babby out of my arms. Do go,' says she, youre not fit to look after luggage,' and she began lulling James Hangelo to sleep with one hi, while she looked after the packets with the other. Now, Sir! if you please, mind that packet!--pretty darling--easy with that box, Sir, its glass--pooooty poppet--where's the deal case, marked arrowroot, No. 24?' she cried, reading out of a list she had.--And poor little James went to sleep. The porters were bundling and carting the various harticles with no more ceremony than if each package had been of cannonball.|$|R

On April 19, 1775 -the 2 ̆ 2 glorious April 192 ̆ 2 - General Thomas Gage, {{commander}} of the troops of His Majesty in North America, discreetly sent an expeditionary force to the countryside of Massachusetts, outside Boston, with twofold: first, to capture {{one or more of the}} 2 ̆ 2 patriots 2 ̆ 2 agitators who had been spurring popular discontent against the British government; and second, to destroy military supplies disgruntled colonists had been accumulating in Concord, not far from Boston. There was also another objective, <b>broader</b> set; <b>Gage</b> sympathized with the Americans and did not want to start a war, but should encourage obedience to the British crown and remind the irresistible force that would face them if they chose the path of rebellion...|$|R
40|$|Extract: This paper aims {{to discuss}} {{correlation}} of motivation with learning Japanese {{as a foreign}} language (JFL). It will investigate what features borne from the learning process are key factors that motivate learners to continue, {{and whether or not}} motivational features differ between continuing and discontinuing students, and at different proficiency levels. Motivation {{is one of the most}} important prerequisites for learning. It is often compared to the engine (intensity) and steering wheel (direction) of a <b>car</b> (<b>Gage</b> and Berliner, 1984). Hilgard et al. (1979) state that motivation is concerned with those factors which energise behaviour and give it direction. Motivation in education is generally understood as a trigger of students 2 ̆ 7 thought of engaging in a particular subject, and maintains the intensity of acquiring the knowledge of the subject. Logan (1969 : 155) says that ‘motivation affects the way you practice, what you observe and what you do. And there are what you learn. ...|$|R
25|$|Executed in the {{starting}} hours of Operation Just Cause, this operation was handled by SEAL Team 4. Consisting of 48 U.S. Navy SEALs (three SEAL Platoons; Golf, Echo, and Delta) {{under the command of}} Lt. Cmdr. Toohey, this SEAL Team was tasked with destroying Noriega's private jet on the ground at the Punta Paitilla Airport, a coastal airport in Panama City. The main force of SEALs landed just south of the airport at approximately 0030, shortly before the initial combat operations started within Panama City itself. Several reconnaissance teams were hidden {{on the north side of}} the airfield to provide real-time data on enemy movements. Once the SEALs landed, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey established a command post near the southern edge of the runway. At this time Cmdr. McGrath, a SEAL officer stationed on a patrol boat offshore coordinating several operations, passed on information implying that the aircraft was to be disabled with “minimal damage” (defined as shot out tires and cut control wires), rather than destroyed. This later became a point of controversy after the operation, as the message was poorly worded and forced the SEALs to change their tactics at the last minute and approach the aircraft more closely than anticipated. The three platoons then began advancing up the airfield, with Golf platoon taking up final assaulting positions outside the hangar at roughly 0105. At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey received a message stating that PDF V300 Cadillac <b>Gage</b> armored <b>cars</b> were heading towards the airport. To counter the threat, a squad (Squad One of Golf Platoon) was ordered to move into ambush positions on a nearby road. As they stood up to move, the PDF soldiers stationed in the airfield immediately opened fire, killing one SEAL and wounding five others. The other two platoons moved to reinforce Golf, and within several minutes had secured the hangars, with two more SEALs killed and four more wounded. The SEALs then disabled Noriega’s private plane by shooting it with an AT4 rocket. Shortly after, a MEDEVAC helicopter arrived and transported the injured SEALs to the Joint Casualty Collection Point at Howard Air Force Base. The SEALs held the area throughout the night, and disabled the runway for use by any PDF transport planes by rolling other aircraft onto it. The next day, the SEALs were replaced by a company from the 75th Ranger Regiment. Due to the high level of casualties sustained and several inconsistencies regarding planning and command and control during the battle, the Battle of Paitilla Airport is considered one of the most controversial operations within Operation JUST CAUSE from the US military perspective.|$|R
