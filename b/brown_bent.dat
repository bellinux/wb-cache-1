60|$|How delicious {{was that}} English morning after their voyage; the slant {{rays of the}} sun {{silvering}} the turf, and casting rainbows across the gossamer threads from one <b>brown</b> <b>bent</b> to another; the harvest fields on the slopes dotted with rich sheaves of wheat; the coppices, in their summer glory, here and there touched with the gold of early autumn, and the slopes and meadows bright with lively green, a pleasant change for eyes fresh from the bare, rugged mountain-side and the rank unwholesome vegetation of Panama. Shaggy little Scottish oxen were feeding on the dewy grass, their black coats looking sleek in the sun beyond the long shadows of the thorns; but as Mary said, laughing, 'Only Farmer Fitzjocelyn's cattle came here now,' and she stopped more than once to be introduced to some notable animal, or to hear the history of experiments in fatting beasts.|$|E

60|$|A happy time! But it was {{all over}} now, and brief glimpses of a <b>brown</b> head <b>bent</b> above a desk near that window was the only solace poor Pris had. The head never turned as she went by, but she felt sure that Phil knew her step, and found that moment, as she did, the hardest of the day.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the third gentleman had drawn my attention. Not by {{anything}} he said, for he remained silent, sitting with his dark <b>brown</b> head <b>bent</b> forward, quietly gazing at the scene from under his brows. The instant he spoke they turned towards him. He was perhaps forty, and broad-shouldered, not so tall as Mr. Sevier.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Brown's crowd {{transferred}} {{themselves without}} losing an instant, taking with them their firearms {{and a large}} supply of ammunition. They were sixteen in all: two runaway blue-jackets, a lanky deserter from a Yankee man-of-war, a couple of simple, blond Scandinavians, a mulatto of sorts, one bland Chinaman who cooked--and {{the rest of the}} nondescript spawn of the South Seas. None of them cared; <b>Brown</b> <b>bent</b> them to his will, and Brown, indifferent to gallows, was running away from the spectre of a Spanish prison. He didn't give them the time to trans-ship enough provisions; the weather was calm, the air was charged with dew, and when they cast off the ropes and set sail to a faint off-shore draught there was no flutter in the damp canvas; their old schooner seemed to detach itself gently from the stolen craft and slip away silently, together with the black mass of the coast, into the night.|$|E
6000|$|Newman {{was in no}} {{humor to}} enjoy good company. He could neither eat nor talk; his soul was sore with grief and anger, {{and the weight of}} his double sorrow was intolerable. He sat with his eyes fixed upon his plate, {{counting}} the minutes, wishing at one moment that Valentin would see him and leave him free to go in quest of Madame de Cintre and his lost happiness, and mentally calling himself a vile brute the next, for the impatient egotism of the wish. He was very poor company, himself, and even his acute preoccupation and his general lack of the habit of pondering the impression he produced did not prevent him from reflecting that his companions must be puzzled to see how poor Bellegarde came to take such a fancy to this taciturn Yankee that he must needs have him at his death-bed. After breakfast he strolled forth alone into the village and looked at the fountain, the geese, the open barn doors, the <b>brown,</b> <b>bent</b> old women, showing their hugely darned stocking-heels at the ends of their slowly-clicking sabots, and the beautiful view of snowy Alps and purple Jura {{at either end of the}} little street. The day was brilliant; early spring was in the air and in the sunshine, and the winter's damp was trickling out of the cottage eaves. It was birth and brightness for all nature, even for chirping chickens and waddling goslings, and it was to be death and burial for poor, foolish, generous, delightful Bellegarde. Newman walked as far as the village church, and went into the small grave-yard beside it, where he sat down and looked at the awkward tablets which were planted around. They were all sordid and hideous, and Newman could feel nothing but the hardness and coldness of death. He got up and came back to the inn, where he found M. Ledoux having coffee and a cigarette at a little green table which he had caused to be carried into the small garden. Newman, learning that the doctor was still sitting with Valentin, asked M. Ledoux if he might not be allowed to relieve him; he had a great desire to be useful to his poor friend. This was easily arranged; the doctor was very glad to go to bed. He was a youthful and rather jaunty practitioner, but he had a clever face, and the ribbon of the Legion of Honor in his buttonhole; Newman listened attentively to the instructions he gave him before retiring, and took mechanically from his hand a small volume which the surgeon recommended as a help to wakefulness, and which turned out to be an old copy of [...] "Faublas." [...] Valentin was still lying with his eyes closed, and there was no visible change in his condition. Newman sat down near him, and for a long time narrowly watched him. Then his eyes wandered away with his thoughts upon his own situation, and rested upon the chain of the Alps, disclosed by the drawing of the scant white cotton curtain of the window, through which the sunshine passed and lay in squares upon the red-tiled floor. He tried to interweave his reflections with hope, but he only half succeeded. What had happened to him seemed to have, in its violence and audacity, the force of a real calamity--the strength and insolence of Destiny herself. It was unnatural and monstrous, and he had no arms against it. At last a sound struck upon the stillness, and he heard Valentin's voice.|$|E

5000|$|Bent {{started his}} Wall Street {{career as a}} {{managing}} partner at LF Rothschild and Company Inc. Two years later, he began working at the pension firm, TIAA-CREF, where he met his eventual business partner, Brown. In 1968, the pair created their own firm, <b>Brown</b> & <b>Bent.</b> In August 1969, while brainstorming about investment vehicles, Bent posed {{the idea for a}} mutual fund that could offer rates of return while allowing for zero market risk. The idea was to give investors immediate liquidity and safety for their money above all else.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan of the Apes {{was wrapped}} in {{thoughts}} of the past; pleasant memories of the happier occasions of his lost jungle life. He recalled the countless boyhood hours that he had spent cross-legged upon the table in his dead father's cabin, his little <b>brown</b> body <b>bent</b> {{over one of the}} fascinating picture books from which, unaided, he had gleaned the secret of the printed language long before the sounds of human speech fell upon his ears. A smile of contentment softened his strong face as he thought of that day of days that he had had alone with Jane Porter in the heart of his primeval forest.|$|R
60|$|Coulston, who {{apparently}} concurred with him, {{gazed at the}} picture with a trace of astonishment. It showed a big cargo lancha lurching out, deep-loaded, through a fringe of tumbling surf with four men straining at the ponderous oars. The wet rags they wore clung about their limbs, and there was weariness in their grim, <b>brown</b> faces. <b>Bent</b> backs and set lips had their significance, and the sketch was stamped with the suggestion of endurance and endeavour. Yet, as those who saw it felt, there was triumph in it, too, for while the rollers came seething in to hurl her back the lancha was clawing off the shore.|$|R

50|$|Like other sipunculans, {{the body}} is divided into a larger rear end known as the trunk and a {{narrower}} front end known as the introvert. The trunk is cylindrical and can reach 200 mm in length but is more commonly 20-50 mm. It varies in colour from grey to white to yellow-brown. The two ends of the trunk are often pigmented dark brown or black. The introvert can be retracted into the trunk by the retractor muscles {{of which there are}} usually four but occasionally three. The introvert bears many dark <b>brown,</b> slightly <b>bent</b> hooks. These are arranged irregularly unlike the similar species Golfingia elongata where the hooks are arranged in rings. Young specimens have a crown of around 20 small, finger-like tentacles arranged in a circle around the mouth. As the worm grows the number of tentacles can increase to over 150 and they are arranged in three or more circles. The entoproct Loxosomella phascolosomata often attaches itself to the worm.|$|R

His eyes followed the strong, firm steps of the young woman who walked between the two older women. There was something fine and dignified in her walk, and the odor of her dress as she passed lingered with him, but he did not feel that this was the same woman, till she turned and faced him on the platform.|$|R

60|$|From Yair,--which hills {{so closely}} bind, Scarce can the Tweed his passage find, Though much he fret, and chafe, and toil, Till all his eddying {{currents}} boil, - Her long descended lord is gone, And left {{us by the}} stream alone. And much I miss those sportive boys, Companions of my mountain joys, Just at the age 'twixt boy and youth, When thought is speech, and speech is truth. Close to my side, with what delight They pressed to hear of Wallace wight, When, pointing to his airy mound, I called his ramparts holy ground! Kindled their brows to hear me speak; And I have smiled, to feel my cheek, Despite the difference of our years, Return again the glow of theirs. Ah, happy boys! such feelings pure, They will not, cannot, long endure; Condemned to stem the world's rude tide, You may not linger by the side; For Fate shall thrust you from the shore, And Passion ply the sail and oar. Yet cherish the remembrance still, Of the lone mountain and the rill; For trust, dear boys, the time will come When fiercer transport shall be dumb, And you will think right frequently, But, well I hope, without a sigh, On the free hours that we have spent Together, on the <b>brown</b> hill's <b>bent.</b>|$|R
