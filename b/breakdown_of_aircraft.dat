30|$|From the {{perspective}} of the flight phase where emission production takes place, it can be useful to know the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> utilization on the ground and in the air. In this context, all flights are examined in terms of the utilization duration. The results indicate that the percentage of ground utilization of the aircraft ranges between 22 % to 29 % for AYT and 18 % to 27 % for ADB departures, respectively. The averages of ground utilization of the aircraft by route are around 25 % and 22 %, respectively. That is, almost one fourth of the operation duration takes place on the ground.|$|E
40|$|Perturbations {{of flight}} {{schedules}} may occur everyday. Poor scheduling of flights {{may result in}} a substantial loss of profit and decreased levels of service for air carriers. This research aims at developing a framework to help carriers in handling schedule perturbations caused by the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The framework is based on a basic schedule perturbation model constructed as a dynamic network from which several perturbed network models are developed for scheduling following incidents. These network models are formulated as pure network flow problems or network flow problems with side constraints. The former are solved using the network simplex method while the latter are solved using Lagrangian relaxation with subgradient methods. To show how to apply the framework in the real world, a case study focusing on the operations of a major Taiwan air carrier in East Asia is presented. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of both stability techniques and Direct Numerical Simulation {{to the understanding of}} vortex dynamics around complex geometries of practical engineering interest, specifically in the context of race car aerodynamics. The instability analysis of trailing vortices, of which the Batchelor trailing vortex is the most widespread model, is relevant in the context of Formula One ows where the generation of vortices is an efficient technique to generate downforce. Batchelor vortices were originally motivated by the need to understand the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> vortices. However, contrary to aircraft wakes which consist of relatively isolated vortices, the flow around the complex geometry of a Formula One car involves multiple vortices, some of which will be subject to fast, dynamically driven external effects, like merging or obstacle interactions. Other vortices however are subject to large scale effects such as strong pressure gradients which may lead to vortex breakdown through stabilityrelated mechanisms. The aim of this work is to develop a coherent set of tools to analyse these two types of flow mechanisms. Initially, a mix of BiGlobal linear stability analysis on axially periodic modes is considered, as well as Parabolised Stability Equations to evaluate non-parallel effects on these modes, when the vortices are suffciently isolated. These stability related tools are complemented with local (embedded) Direct Numerical Simulations when the vortex dynamics and interactions with the surrounding geometry prevails. After a systematic characterisation of the vortices present in a typical race car configuration, these methods are tested on model configurations involving co-rotating and counter-rotating vortex pairs interacting with obstacles. Finally, a Direct Numerical Simulations using a spectral/hp discretisation, albeit at reduced Reynolds numbers, of the under oor region of a Formula One car is undertaken, and the results are compared with Detached Eddy Simulations to identify the relative usefulness of both techniques.

These disruptions prevent the planned {{execution of the}} schedule, which either becomes suboptimal or infeasible.

This approach minimizes the impact of disruptions by taking into consideration the flight schedule, the fleet and maintenance management requirements and the impact on passengers, all simultaneously.

40|$|We {{address a}} {{scheduling}} {{problem in the}} context <b>of</b> military <b>aircraft</b> maintenance where {{the goal is to}} meet the aircraft requirements for a number of missions in the presence <b>of</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> The assignment <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> to a mission must consider the requirements for the mission, the probability <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> failure, and capacity of the repair shop that maintains the aircraft. Therefore, a solution both assigns aircraft to mis-sions and schedules the repair shop to meet the assignments. We propose a dispatching heuristic algorithm; three com-plete approaches based on mixed integer programming, con-straint programming, and logic-based Benders decomposi-tion; and a hybrid heuristic-complete approach. Experiments demonstrate that the logic-based Benders variation combin-ing mixed integer programming and constraint programming outperforms the other approaches, that the dispatching heuris-tic can feasibly schedule the repair shop in a very short time, and that using the dispatching solution as a bound marginally improves the complete approaches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Drag {{reduction}} {{is one of}} the main objectives <b>of</b> the transport <b>aircraft</b> manufacturers. The drag <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> a transport <b>aircraft</b> at cruise shows that the skin friction drag and the lift-induced drag constitute the two main sources of drag, approximately one half and one third of the total drag. Hybrid laminar flow technology and innovative wing tip devices offer the greatest potential for drag reduction. Aircraft performance improvement in off-design conditions can also be obtained through trailing edge optimisation, control of the shock boundary layer interaction and of the boundary layer separation. The paper will give an overview of the results obtained for the different mentioned topics and will try to evaluate the potential gains offered by the different technologies...|$|R

In {{order to}} "assist {{the development of}} future GA reliability and safety requirements", a reliability study needs to be performed. Before any studies on General Aviation aircraft reliability begins, a definition <b>of</b> a typical <b>aircraft</b> that encompasses most of the general aviation characteristics needs to be defined. In this report, {{not only is the}} typical general aviation aircraft defined for the purpose of the follow-on reliability study, but it is also separated, or "sifted" into several different categories where individual analysis can be performed on the reasonably independent systems. In this study, the typical General Aviation aircraft is a four-place, single engine piston, all aluminum fixed-wing certified aircraft with a fixed tricycle landing gear and a cable operated flight control system. The system <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> a GA <b>aircraft</b> "sifts" the aircraft systems and components into five categories: Powerplant, Airframe, Aircraft Control Systems, Cockpit Instrumentation Systems, and the Electrical Systems.

40|$|Abstract Background Accommodation and <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> {{accommodation}} {{are important}} elements of information processing in nerve fibers, as they determine how nerve fibers react to natural slowly changing stimuli or electrical stimulation. The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, and that <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
