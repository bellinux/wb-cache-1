25|$|Gennarino (Cavaradossi's manservant) and Eusèbe (the sacristan) discuss Cavaradossi's {{relationship}} with Tosca, his Republican and Bonapartist sympathies, and the apparent {{defeat of the}} French army at Marengo. Cavaradossi arrives {{to work on his}} painting of Mary Magdalen. When Gennarino and Eusèbe leave, Angelotti, a Republican fugitive who has escaped from the Castel Sant'Angelo emerges from his hiding place in his family's chapel. His sister, the Marquise Attavanti, had visited the day before to leave him supplies and women's clothes to disguise himself, including a fan to hide his face. Cavaradossi recalls seeing a beautiful <b>blond</b> <b>woman</b> in the church the previous day and tells how she inspired his painting. Tosca arrives and Angelotti quickly returns to his hiding place. Tosca, who is dark-haired, becomes jealous when she sees Cavaradossi's painting of a blonde woman, but he reassures her of his love. After she departs, Cavaradossi and Angelotti quickly leave for Cavaradossi's country villa. Baron Scarpia and his police enter the church searching for Angelotti. Scarpia finds the fan left by the Marquise Attavanti and keeps it. Worshippers arrive for the Te Deum which has been ordered to give thanks for the French defeat.|$|E

And I'm going to be a... prostitute." [...] Afterwards, Liz rewords the lyrics to [...] "The Wedding Song (There Is Love)" [...] by folk-singing trio Peter, Paul and Mary. Nancy tells Jack that she cannot share him with another woman. She says, [...] "I can't share you with another woman like you're that Mormon guy on HBO who was in that tornado movie with that <b>blond</b> <b>woman</b> who was married to that Jewish guy." [...] Her {{statement}} is a reference to actor Bill Paxton who appeared in the 1996 movie Twister, and starred in the HBO show Big Love, a series about a fundamentalist Mormon family in Utah who practice polygamy. The [...] "blonde woman" [...] and [...] "Jewish guy" [...] Nancy is referring to are actors Helen Hunt and Paul Reiser in their sitcom Mad About You.|$|E
500|$|There was an auditioning {{process for}} both the chair model and the young <b>blond</b> <b>woman</b> that Michael sees in the coffee shop. According to Novak, the chair model was {{supposed}} to be [...] "pretty" [...] and [...] "perhaps even prettier than your average model", but more of just an [...] "average single girl", because the episode is more about Michael wanting to start dating again than the model herself. [...] In the scene with the [...] "Five Families", one of the actors, Paul Faust was the only first-time actor. Faust is the cousin of writer Paul Lieberstein, and had been {{on a tour of the}} set and talked to many of the writers. He made a good impression and so the character of [...] "Cool Guy Paul" [...] was based on him. The day before they were scheduled to shoot, the show still had not cast anyone for the role, so they called Paul in New York City and had him read the lines into a camera and e-mail to them. In less than an hour, Faust had landed the part and was flown out to Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Peter and Joe visit Quagmire and are {{introduced}} to his father, Lieutenant Commander Dan Quagmire. Expecting to see the inspiration for Quagmire's wanton sexual behavior, they are surprised by Dan's stereotypically gay mannerisms and begin texting each other of how gay Dan is. The following morning, Quagmire invites Peter and Lois to the Naval Ball being held to honor his father, but soon begins arguing with Peter about his father's sexuality. At the ball that night, members of the Navy bombard Quagmire with compliments about his war-hero father, most {{of which can be}} taken as double entendres about Dan's alleged homosexuality. Concerned that his dad may be gay, Quagmire confronts him and Dan states that he is not gay, but is instead [...] "a woman who was born biologically Male" [...] and that he plans to have a sex change operation during his stay in Quahog. At first Peter and Lois conflate gender identity and sexual orientation, then at Lois' suggestion, Peter waits with Quagmire during the operation. The surgery is a success, with Quagmire's dad emerging as the newly named Ida Davis, an attractive <b>blond</b> <b>woman.</b> That night, Ida and Quagmire join the Griffins for dinner. As the dinner begins, however, Quagmire becomes frustrated when the Griffins turn the conversation towards Ida's surgery and other related topics, and storms out of the room. At Quagmire's home, Quagmire tells Ida that he is not sure he can deal with her new gender identity. Saddened, Ida leaves Quagmire's home and decides to stay at a nearby Marriott Hotel.|$|E
2500|$|His {{two novels}} both {{deal with the}} subject of unrequited love, and George Călinescu argued {{that they were in}} fact {{disguised}} eulogies. The critic also argued that they showed Tradem to be [...] "too moon-struck to be understood by women". One of them was titled Iubita ("The Lady-Love"), and showed the protagonist, a teacher named Emil Corburescu, falling in love with his pupil's sister—although she does not reject his advances, she eventually marries a more adjusted person. Călinescu concluded that [...] " [...] is a failure". Similarly, Tradem's Cum iubim ("The Way We Love") deals with Nestor Aldea, a young law student who encounters a beautiful <b>blond</b> <b>woman</b> while promenading in a park: the two fall in love, but she refuses to marry Aldea. They meet each other again after she has married, and end up committing adultery. Călinescu dismissed the work, stating: [...] "Everything [...] is vapory, as annoying as a thick fog." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, American pilot Major Steve Trevor (Waggoner) bails out during an air {{battle over the}} Bermuda Triangle, {{location}} of Paradise Island. The island {{is home to the}} Amazons: beautiful, ageless women with great strength, agility, and intelligence. Amazon princess Diana (Carter) rescues the handsome Trevor and helps nurse him back to health. Her mother, the Amazon queen (Cloris Leachman; succeeded by Carolyn Jones and Beatrice Straight in later episodes), decrees that Olympic-style games shall be held to select one Amazon to return Trevor back to America. But she forbids her own daughter Diana, the princess, to participate. Diana states that since she is not allowed to participate, she {{does not want to be}} present for the games and will take a retreat to the other side of the island. The games are held with participants wearing masks and numbers, shown as Roman numerals in triangles on white sleeveless short tunic-dresses. Among the contestants is a blonde Amazon. During the events, the blonde Amazon shows exceptional skills and she ties for first with another Amazon. To break the deadlock, the [...] "bullets and bracelets" [...] event is decided as the tiebreaker, wherein each of the women takes turns shooting at the other; the one being shot at must deflect the bullets with her bulletproof bracelets. The <b>blond</b> <b>woman</b> wins the event, superficially injuring her opponent's arm. When she is pronounced the winner, she removes her mask and wig and reveals that she is Diana.

60|$|That gentleman was not {{yet come}} to his office; would Mrs. Tulliver sit down by the fire in his private room and wait for him? She had not long to wait before the {{punctual}} attorney entered, knitting his brow with an examining glance at the stout <b>blond</b> <b>woman</b> who rose, curtsying deferentially,--a tallish man, with an aquiline nose and abundant iron-gray hair. You have never seen Mr. Wakem before, and are possibly wondering whether he was really as eminent a rascal, and as crafty, bitter an enemy of honest humanity in general, and of Mr. Tulliver in particular, as he is represented {{to be in that}} eidolon or portrait of him which we have seen to exist in the miller's mind.|$|E

"To think o' these cloths as I spun myself," [...] {{she went}} on, lifting things out and turning them over with an {{excitement}} {{all the more}} strange and piteous because the stout <b>blond</b> <b>woman</b> was usually so passive,--if she had been ruffled before, {{it was at the}} surface merely,--"and Job Haxey wove 'em, and brought the piece home on his back, as I remember standing at the door and seeing him come, before I ever thought o' marrying your father! And the pattern as I chose myself, and bleached so beautiful, and I marked 'em so as nobody ever saw such marking,--they must cut the cloth to get it out, for it's a particular stitch. And they're all to be sold, and go into strange people's houses, and perhaps be cut with the knives, and wore out before I'm dead.

60|$|The next moment, {{angry with}} {{himself for the}} boast, he had gripped {{the arms of the}} chair so savagely that every finger-end was stinging. At the same moment he became aware that a woman was {{entering}} the room. He saw the girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the newcomer. They kissed each other, and, with arms around each other's waists, they advanced toward him. That must be her mother, he thought. She was a tall, <b>blond</b> <b>woman,</b> slender, and stately, and beautiful. Her gown was what he might expect in such a house. His eyes delighted in the graceful lines of it. She and her dress together reminded him of women on the stage. Then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and gowns entering the London theatres while he stood and watched and the policemen shoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning. Next his mind leaped to the Grand Hotel at Yokohama, where, too, from the sidewalk, he had seen grand ladies. Then the city and the harbor of Yokohama, in a thousand pictures, began flashing before his eyes. But he swiftly dismissed the kaleidoscope of memory, oppressed by the urgent need of the present. He knew that he must stand up to be introduced, and he struggled painfully to his feet, where he stood with trousers bagging at the knees, his arms loose-hanging and ludicrous, his face set hard for the impending ordeal.|$|E

40|$|Sex Sells: Exploring the Portrayal of Women in Media This project {{analyzed}} {{the idea of}} “sex sells. ” In movies, in song lyrics, in music videos, in shows, and even in commercials, women are often used as a marketing tool. This portrayal implies that a woman’s image makes up her worth. This potentially has two effects. First, it gives men a distorted, exaggerated, and inaccurate view of women, depicting them as sexual objects for their gratification. Secondly, it gives women unrealistic expectations for their own bodies, making them feel inadequate or ashamed for not reflecting the “beauty” they see in the media. This research project used Hardee’s Bacon 3 -Way Thickburger commercial as an example. It features three <b>blond</b> <b>women</b> feeding each other bacon, in an obvious reference to a threesome. This commercial presented women as sexual objects, and the sameness of the women only represents a certain way to be “desireable” (white, skinny, blonde). By using surveys, this project discovered how men, women, and minorities view this commercial and how it affected their opinion of Hardee’s and of women. This project {{analyzed the}} implications of using women as marketing tools. Key words: Media Stereotypes Marketing Advertisment Sexism Women Body image Diversit...|$|R
