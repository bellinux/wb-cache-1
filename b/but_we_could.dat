25|$|According to {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} account available, written by Melchior Estácio do Amaral in 1604: the sea was purple with blood dripping from the scuppers, the decks cluttered with {{the dead and the}} fire raging {{in some parts of the}} ships, and the air so filled with smoke that, not only we could sometimes not see each other <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not recognize each other.|$|E
25|$|I am {{unable to}} state with {{certainty}} what language the Pelasgians spoke, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> consider the speech of the Pelasgians who still exist in settlements above Tyrrhenia {{in the city of}} Kreston, formerly neighbors to the Dorians who at that time lived in the land now called Thessaliotis; also the Pelasgians who once lived with the Athenians and then settled Plakia and Skylake in the Hellespont; and along with those who lived with all the other communities and were once Pelasgian but changed their names. If one can judge by this evidence, the Pelasgians spoke a barbarian language. And so, if the Pelasgian language was spoken in all these places, the people of Attica being originally Pelasgian, must have learned a new language when they became Hellenes. As a matter of fact, the people of Krestonia and Plakia no longer speak the same language, which shows that they continue to use the dialect they brought with them when they migrated to those lands.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and in what sense this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E

500|$|Perhaps {{the marked}} {{signing of the}} summer was defender Sol Campbell, who moved from rivals Tottenham Hotspur on a Bosman ruling. The player's wage demands seemed to have {{extinguished}} Arsenal's chances of signing the player at one point. Campbell was unveiled at a midday news conference on 3 July 2001, which journalists [...] "presumed had been called to announce goalkeeper Richard Wright's arrival from Ipswich." [...] Wenger described Campbell as the [...] "best", adding: [...] "I felt we could not compete on financial basis with the top clubs <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> give him a football challenge." ...|$|E
500|$|DNA {{tests were}} carried out by LGC Forensics, a private company which {{undertakes}} forensic analysis for criminal investigations. Lindsey Lennen, a body fluids and DNA specialist {{member of the team}} that analysed DNA samples from Yeates' body, said that although DNA swabs matched Tabak, they were not of sufficient quality to be evaluated. The team deployed a method known as DNA SenCE, which enhances unusable DNA samples through purification and concentration: [...] "We couldn't say whether the DNA was from saliva, or semen, or even touch. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> say that the probability of it not being a match with Tabak was less than one in a billion." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Grand Met {{merged with}} Guinness, a major drinks concern, {{and the new}} company was named Diageo. In 1999 Walsh {{returned}} to England, and was elected {{chief operating officer of}} Diageo in January 2000, and CEO in September 2000. He took over a company that had stagnated since its merger three years earlier, and that The Economist deemed [...] "mediocre". As head of Diageo he transformed the consumer goods company into a streamlined premium drinks business. Walsh said:"While Diageo had positions in drinks, that leadership was marginal – capital was not limitless. My view, supported by colleagues on the board, was that we should focus on where we can be a global leader. We couldn't aspire to that in food – that slot was taken by the Unilevers and Nestlés and Krafts of this world – <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> command that position in premium drinks." ...|$|E

500|$|The home side's {{performance}} was lauded by journalist Russell Thomas, who opened his match report in The Guardian {{with the line}} [...] "Milan produced football of ease and elegance way beyond the English capabilities." [...] By contrast, Moore noted Arsenal had [...] "looked a different side from the sterile and nervous one seen in domestic matches." [...] Graham described Milan as [...] "...the best team in Europe, or in the world. We've learnt a lot. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have given them a better game, though, and I am disappointed." [...] Capello was content with Milan's win, and believed his team were [...] "still about two months where we should be." [...] It was his eighth trophy as manager of the club, one better than his predecessor Arrigo Sacchi. He said of the achievement: [...] "The mentality of this great club is passed on from the older players to the younger players, so they learn self-sacrifice and how to fight for every trophy they go for." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyrus became {{involved}} with Bolt once she was cast as Penny, Bolt's owner. Filmmakers asked Cyrus to write a song for herself and John Travolta, who stars as Bolt. She co-wrote the song {{with the aid of}} Jeffrey Steele, who also produced the track, {{in a short period of}} time as they had a due date. The film's settings vary in cities throughout the United States, which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song. [...] "Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> add a little country twang to it," [...] she said. Cyrus said the writing process was easy. Before the song's completion, Travolta agreed to sing it, believing [...] "Well, it will be a cute song, whatever it is." [...] After listening to the song, he was surprised at Cyrus' songwriting abilities. [...] "She's really gifted at writing, and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt, so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good, and I really think they pulled it off", Travolta told MTV News.|$|E
500|$|On the tour, {{the dynamic}} nature of Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with his quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. He was {{described}} as aloof from his teammates {{and he did not}} offer to buy them a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw. Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone, writing, as he had sold the rights to a book. On his return to Australia, Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception; he became a [...] "reluctant hero". Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee's newly won fame. They asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, where he received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Bradman received a level of adulation that [...] "embarrassed" [...] him. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, [...] "...permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries". Commenting on Australia's victory, the team's vice-captain Vic Richardson said, [...] "...we could have played any team without Bradman, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not have played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett". A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying [...] "I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013, {{cast member}} Ray Wise stated what Lynch {{had said to}} him {{regarding}} a possible continuation: [...] "Well, Ray, you know, the town is still there. And I suppose it's possible that we could revisit it. Of course, you're already dead... <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> maybe work around that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Naturally, {{this type}} of focus on an {{individual}} in a team game had ramifications. Adding to the criticism offered by Tebbutt, the Australian vice-captain Vic Richardson commented that, [...] "we could have played any team without Bradman, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not have played the blind school without [...] Clarrie Grimmett".|$|E

2500|$|Steve Kloves, the screenwriter for the {{previous}} instalments, returned for Goblet of Fire. On adapting the 734-page book into a feature-length film, Kloves commented that [...] "we always {{thought it would be}} two movies, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never {{figure out a way to}} break it in two. So it will be a different experience from the book." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} from Paris, Fitzpatrick praised the American athletes and criticized Paris {{officials}} for holding key event finals on a Sunday: [...] "The Americans showed themselves superior in every kind of track athletics.

2500|$|In {{his book}} Crucifixion in Antiquity, Gunnar Samuelsson also {{declares}} that the New Testament terminology is not conclusive {{one way or}} another: [...] "(The Gospels) do not describe the event in length ... The non-detailed accounts of the Gospels do not, however, contradict the traditional understanding. So the traditional understanding {{of the death of}} Jesus is correct, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> acknowledge that it is more based on the eyewitness accounts than the actual passion narratives." [...] Further information and examples of various misunderstandings could be found on Samuelsson's Q and A page.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010 it was {{announced}} that all-rounder Mohammad Nabi would captain Afghanistan in the 2010 Asian Games twenty20 tournament in China later that month. The Afghanistan Cricket Board released a statement that [...] "We have played 16 one-day internationals <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only win nine therefore we thought the burden of captaincy is too heavy on Nawroz and Nabi is the next best choice". After causing an upset by beating Pakistan in the semi-finals of the games, Afghanistan lost the final to Bangladesh and finished with a silver medal.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 February 2009, The Jerusalem Post {{published}} the IDF {{account of the}} Palestinian fatalities in the incident. According to IDF's Gaza Coordination and Liaison Administration (CLA), 12 Palestinians were killed– 9 Hamas operatives and 3 noncombatants. The CLA also stated that the IDF was returning fire after coming under attack, that its shells did not hit the school compound, and {{that this has been}} acknowledged by the UN. Colonel Moshe Levi, head of the CLA said that: [...] "From the beginning, Hamas claimed that 42 people were killed, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see from our surveillance that only a few stretchers were brought in to evacuate people".|$|E
2500|$|Rollins {{said that}} he had {{conducted}} a thorough internal investigation into Harris's ties to MZM in hopes of finding conclusive proof of her innocence; but when he could not, he and other advisers, including her lawyer, urged her to drop her candidacy rather than risk federal corruption charges. Although he did not believe Harris intentionally broke any laws, [...] "her story kept changing. Our great concern was that you get into trouble when you don't tell the same story twice ... Maybe you don't think you did anything wrong, but then maybe you start getting questioned about it and so forth, and you may perjure yourself. ... Unlike Cunningham, I don't think she set out to violate the law, but I think she was very careless. She heard whatever she wanted to hear, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find no evidence whatsoever that this was a project going into her district." ...|$|E
