30|$|The various {{degree of}} {{polymerization}} (dp) are obtained when subjected to ultrafiltration can produce Oligosaccharides of uniform molecular weight (Matsubara et al. 1996; Jian et al. 2013). AOS derived from sugar beet pectin (Al-Tamimi et al. 2006) and lemon peel (Hotchkiss et al. 2010) support the intestinal <b>bifidus</b> <b>flora</b> nearly equal to FOS and Inulooligosaccharides (GÃ³mez et al. 2015; Palframan et al. 2002; Rycroft et al. 2001; Sanz et al. 2005). The extent of response is directly proportional to the dp of the oligosaccharide (Sulek et al. 2014; Westphal et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Abstract Prospective {{studies in}} Mayan Indian {{children}} living in their natural setting were carried out from 1964 through 1974; observations began at birth and extended at least throughout {{the first three years}} of life. Adequate growth and survival were characteristic of exclusively breast-fed infants in the first months of life. Despite the high rate of infection, children exhibited a considerable resistance to intestinal protozoa, enterobacteriaceae and enteric viruses. Resistance against colonic invaders is attributed to the <b>bifidus</b> <b>flora,</b> and that against agents acting in the small bowel, to specific antibodies present in colostrum and milk. Diarrhoeal disease was least in this period and increased with weaning to reach maximum peaks at the time of weaning. The protracted weaning consisted of progressive administration of foods of low biological value given under deficient sanitary conditions. The nutrient value of the diet as a function of the child's weight was adequate in protein but in most cases it was markedly deficient in calories. Infectious diseases, particulaily diarrhoea, were found associated with pronounced reduc...|$|E
