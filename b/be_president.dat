5|$|Chandler {{believed}} that he had enough support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be nominated as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him the chance to <b>be</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E

5|$|The High Authority (the {{predecessor}} to the European Commission) was a nine-member {{executive body}} which governed the Community. The Authority consisted of nine members {{in office for}} a term of six years. Eight of these members were appointed by {{the governments of the}} six signatories. These eight members then themselves appointed a ninth person to <b>be</b> <b>President</b> of the High Authority.|$|E
5|$|The senator {{alleged that}} Stevenson had downplayed {{the threat of}} communism, and was thus unfit to <b>be</b> <b>president.</b> He affirmed that Eisenhower was the only man fit {{to lead the country}} in ridding the {{government}} of corruption and communism. Reading parts of a letter from the wife of a serviceman fighting in the Korean War, who, despite her financial woes, had scraped together $10 to donate to the campaign, Nixon promised that he would never cash that check.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed, this dissatisfaction {{increased}} {{and there were}} frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had wished to <b>be</b> <b>president</b> himself, was frustrated as an advisor and resigned {{within a few months}} of his appointment to join the army. Robert Hunter of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina (brother of General Braxton Bragg) took Benjamin's place as Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|Coolidge's {{speech was}} well received, and he {{attracted}} some admirers on its account; {{towards the end}} of the term, many of them were proposing his name for nomination to lieutenant governor. After winning reelection to the Senate by an increased margin in the 1914 elections, Coolidge was reelected unanimously to <b>be</b> <b>President</b> of the Senate. Coolidge's supporters, led by fellow Amherst alumnus Frank Stearns, encouraged him again to run for lieutenant governor. Stearns, an executive with the Boston department store R. H. Stearns, became another key ally, and began a publicity campaign on Coolidge's behalf before he announced his candidacy at the end of the 1915 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Fearing Castro was a socialist, the U.S. {{instructed}} Cantillo to oust Batista. Cantillo secretly {{agreed to}} a ceasefire with Castro, promising that Batista would be tried as a war criminal; however, Batista was warned, and fled into exile with over US$300,000,000 on December 31, 1958. Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra to <b>be</b> <b>President,</b> and began appointing the new government. Furious, Castro ended the ceasefire, and ordered Cantillo's arrest by sympathetic figures in the army. Accompanying celebrations at news of Batista's downfall on January 1, 1959, Castro ordered the MR-26-7 to prevent widespread looting and vandalism. Cienfuegos and Guevara led their columns into Havana on January 2, while Castro entered Santiago and gave a speech invoking the wars of independence. Heading toward Havana, he greeted cheering crowds at every town, giving press conferences and interviews.|$|E

5|$|Great Britain {{secured the}} {{territory}} in 1763 after their victory over France in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War, {{better known as}} the French and Indian War in North America; lasting from 1754 to 1763. The founding of the first agricultural community and settlements in 1812 by Lord Selkirk, north of the area which is now downtown Winnipeg, led to conflict between British colonists and the Métis. Twenty colonists, including the governor, and one Métis were killed in the Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816. Thomas Spence attempted to <b>be</b> <b>President</b> of the Republic of Manitobah in 1867, that he and his council named.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how it affected history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well <b>be</b> <b>president</b> in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E
5|$|Imelda Marcos was {{instrumental}} in the 1980 exile of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Jr., who had suffered a heart attack during his imprisonment. Martial law in the Philippines was later lifted in 1981 but Ferdinand Marcos continued to <b>be</b> <b>president.</b> While her husband began to suffer from lupus, she effectively ruled in his place. Aquino returned in 1983 but was assassinated at the Manila International Airport upon his arrival. With accusations against her beginning to rise, Ferdinand created the Agrava Commission, a fact-finding committee, to investigate her, ultimately finding her not guilty.|$|E

5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was unfit to <b>be</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E
5|$|Robert Kennedy {{was chosen}} by McCarthy as a counsel for his investigatory committee, but {{resigned}} after six months due to disagreements with McCarthy and Committee Counsel Roy Marcus Cohn. Joseph Kennedy had a national network of contacts and became a vocal supporter, building McCarthy's popularity among Catholics and making sizable contributions to McCarthy's campaigns. The Kennedy patriarch hoped {{that one of his}} sons would <b>be</b> <b>president.</b> Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice Al Smith faced during his 1928 campaign for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt was {{receiving}} many letters from supporters {{urging him to}} run, and Republican office-holders were organizing on his behalf. Balked on many policies by an unwilling Congress and courts in his full term in the White House, he saw manifestations of public support he believed would sweep him to the White House with a mandate for progressive policies that would brook no opposition. In February, Roosevelt announced he would accept the Republican nomination if it was offered to him. Taft felt that if he lost in November, {{it would be a}} repudiation of the party, but if he lost renomination, it would be a rejection of himself. He was reluctant to oppose Roosevelt, who helped make him president, but having become president, he was determined to <b>be</b> <b>president,</b> and that meant not standing aside to allow Roosevelt to gain another term.|$|E
25|$|Today, American Jews {{no longer}} face the {{discrimination}} {{in higher education}} that {{they did in the}} past, particularly in the Ivy League. For example, by 1986, a third of the presidents of the elite undergraduate final clubs at Harvard were Jewish. Rick Levin has <b>been</b> <b>president</b> of Yale University since 1993, Judith Rodin <b>was</b> <b>president</b> of the University of Pennsylvania from 1994 to 2004 (and <b>is</b> currently <b>president</b> of the Rockefeller Foundation), Paul Samuelson's nephew, Lawrence Summers, <b>was</b> <b>president</b> of Harvard University from 2001 until 2006, and Harold Shapiro <b>was</b> <b>president</b> of Princeton University from 1992 until 2000.|$|R

5|$|Walker {{publicly}} testifies against Frank, prompting him {{to appear}} before the committee and resign the presidency. When an incredulous Claire confronts him, Franks says that it was his plan all along to resign and set her up to <b>be</b> <b>president,</b> so {{that the two of them}} can run Washington together - she from the White House and he from the private sector. For the plan to work, Claire must pardon Frank, which would damage her politically. Frank resigns and Claire is sworn in as the 47th President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|While Smythe was away, a committee, {{headed by}} Ed Bickle, Bill MacBrien, and Selke ran Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. Upon {{his return from}} the military, Smythe {{found himself in the}} middle of a power {{struggle}} over the presidency of Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. Smythe suspected that MacBrien, a member of the board of directors, wanted to succeed Bickle as president and give Smythe's job to Selke, who had been acting general manager in Smythe's absence. Smythe wanted to <b>be</b> <b>president</b> and asked Selke for his support. Selke equivocated, and relationship between the two long-time friends turned acrimonious, leading to Selke's resignation in May 1946. Two months later, Selke became head of hockey operations for the Montreal Canadiens and manager of the Montreal Forum, succeeding Tommy Gorman.|$|E
5|$|Adams resented Hamilton's {{influence}} with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous {{in his private}} life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and thought him too emotionally unstable to <b>be</b> <b>President.</b> Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E
