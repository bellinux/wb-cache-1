40|$|The macro {{risk premium}} {{measures}} the threshold return for real activity that receives funding from savers. We base our argument {{in this paper}} {{on the relationship between}} the macro risk premium and the growth of financial intermediaries' <b>balance</b> <b>sheets.</b> The spare <b>capacity</b> of their <b>balance</b> <b>sheets</b> determines the intermediaries' risk appetite, which in turn determines the real projects that receive funding and, hence, the supply of credit. Monetary policy affects risk appetite by changing the ability of intermediaries to leverage their capital. We estimate the time-varying risk appetite of financial intermediaries for the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, and study the joint dynamics of risk appetite using macroeconomic aggregates for the United States. We argue that risk appetite is an important indicator of monetary conditions. Monetary policy; Intermediation (Finance); Risk; Capital market; Credit...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{macroeconomic}} effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy {{in an environment}} where commercial banks are undercapitalized after a financial crisis and have large holdings of (risky) government bonds on their balance sheets. An undercapitalized banking system cannot perfectly elastically expand the balance sheet, and therefore has to choose whether an additional euro of funding is used to provide new credit to the real economy or purchase additional government bonds. The main result of this thesis is that the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy is reduced in such an environment. Two channels play a key role. The first is one where capital losses arise on existing holdings of risky government bonds held by commercial banks when the fiscal authority engages in debt-financed fiscal policy. More debt issue increases interest rates and lowers bond prices because of increased sovereign default risk. The ensuing capital losses reduce bank capital (bank equity) and therefore force commercial banks to shrink the balance sheet, with negative effects on financing investment in the real economy. This channel is at work in chapters one and two. The second channel is at work in chapters three and four, where a change in government policy increases the attractiveness for commercial banks to hold government bonds. Because of limited <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>capacity</b> after a financial crisis, commercial banks increase government bond holdings at the expense of loan provision to the real economy, which negatively affects the macroeconomy through lower investment...|$|E
40|$|The covered {{interest}} rate parity (CIP) condition is widely known and taught in academia. Since the Great Financial Crisis, sustained {{violations of the}} CIP condition have occurred, pointing to arbitrage opportunities. Pinnington and Shamloo (2016) investigated these deviations for the foreign currency cross-currency basis (basis) against Swiss franc, {{with a focus on}} the first half of 2015. The objective of this paper consisted of analyzing violations from CIP between January 2011 and December 2016 for the US dollar, Euro and British sterling basis against Swiss franc and whether changes in the basis could have been anticipated with implied FX volatilities. A focus was laid on the negative deviations, signifying that the {{interest rate}} earned over the synthetic replication is higher than over the direct investment. Therefore, the cross-currency bases from 4 January to 30 December 2016 for the maturities of one-, two-, three- and six-month were analyzed, which led to a data sample per currency and tenor of n= 1515. First of all, the data set was investigated for violations of the CIP condition. As the cross-currency basis was hardly never zero, a CIP trading range of 10 basis points above and 10 basis points below zero was determined to differentiate minor from substantial violations. In a second step, the changes in the basis were scatter plotted against the changes in implied FX volatilities. The analysis revealed that CIP violations occurred during the covered period. The US dollar cross-currency basis exhibited the most negative CIP violations of all currency bases analyzed. It was found that the Euro bases showed more positive than negative violations, whereas positive and negative violations were approximately balanced for the British sterling. Generally, the shorter the tenor, the more negative deviations were observed. The cross-currency basis tended to decrease one month {{before the end of the}} year. This was detected for most tenors and currencies under analysis. The highest R 2 observed from the scatter plots stood at 0. 0586. It was concluded that the CIP violations offered substantial arbitrage opportunities. Generally, the cross-currency bases corrected around one month before year-ends and the shorter the tenor, the more pronounced the correction tended to occur. Furthermore, interest rate shocks or sudden changes in central bank policies were followed by a sharp correction of the basis which recovered within one month. Lastly, no evidence was found that changes in bases can be anticipated by changes in implied FX volatility. Banks and financial institutions with ample <b>balance</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>capacities</b> should investigate if they want to take advantage of CIP violations, as they offer a possibility to increase their profits. With the acceptance of interest rate risk, the profits could be further increased as Swiss banks can borrow foreign currency from their clients and deposit the Swiss francs on the sight deposit at the Swiss National Bank. But before engaging in CIP arbitrage transactions, banks should calculate the resulting capital costs thoroughly, to evaluate whether the risk-free profits outweigh the capital costs involved...|$|R
