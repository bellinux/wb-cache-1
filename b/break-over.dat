50|$|A {{suspension}} lift is {{a modification}} to vehicle's suspension system {{that includes a}} lengthening coil springs or re-arching leaf springs to make them taller. Doing this will make the vehicle taller and make the approach, departure, and <b>break-over</b> angles better for off-roading. Increasing {{the distance between the}} axles and body of a vehicle drastically often requries the replacement of other parts in the suspension system to make the work correctly again.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the low-capacity single {{chairlift}} was decidedly outdated and the Winter Sports Association began {{making plans to}} upgrade it to a double chair. Work began in fall 1958, and the old cable was replaced with an 8,800 lb track cable and a new <b>break-over</b> tower was constructed {{at the top of}} the lift for unloading the double chairs. The new lift opened [...] in 1959.|$|E

3000|$|A {{compositional}} simulator {{was used}} to determine the MMP for various gases. The ECLIPSE® E 300 ™ was used. This model has 100 grids with porosity of 0.2 and permeability of 1, 000  mD. In this model, the length was selected as 20  m and 0.5  cm for the width and height to minimize the effect of transition zone length. Smaller diameter tubing is justified to prevent viscous fingering (Elsharkway et al. 1992). The relative permeability graph does not have any effect on results (Lars and [...] Whitson 2000). (residual oil saturation is equal to zero) oil recovery at 1.2  pore volumes of injected gas is plotted as a function of pressure. The <b>break-over</b> pressure in these recovery curves is deemed the MMP.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} analytically and via simulations one-port circuits {{consisting of}} two bipolar junction transistors (BJT's) and a few linear resistors connected in a feedback structure. These circuits possess topologies and parameter values such that their terminal one-port i Γ v characteristics exhibit a negative differential resistance (NDR) region. These structures {{have been used in}} the past to model silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) devices and the latch-up phenomena in CMOS integrated circuits. We show analytically that the large voltages across transistor pn junctions predicted by SPICE are not numerical artifacts of this simulator, but are intrinsic properties of the circuits. Our analysis explicitly accounts for the influence of the Early voltage effects on the calculations of the <b>break-over</b> voltages and currents, and suggests that this sometimes neglected effect may indeed play a dominant role in these circuits' behavior. 1.

40|$|During {{domestication}} of {{the horse}} and its utilization for riding, carrying and towing, their feet were exposed to excessive loads. For Protection of excessive horn capsular abrasion nailed horse shoeing has been developed by different cultures in between 6 th and 10 th century AD. The development of shoes for particular purposes, for correction of mal- positioned limbs and the treatment of foot diseases and lameness occurred first {{in the end of}} the 19 th {{and the beginning of the}} 20 th century. This investigation is targeting the shoes for laminitis treatment of this time period in particular. It is based on the analysis {{of the horse}} shoe collection of the former veterinary medical school of the Humboldt- University in Berlin- Mitte. All horse shoes presented in this location were photographed and analysed. Moreover, these horse shoes were compared to those of the exhibitions at the veterinary schools in Vienna and Leipzig as well as to the collection of the Hohenheim University museum. Until today there is no optimal therapy for laminitis despite enormous increase of knowledge. Analogically there is no optimal orthopaedic treatment available. The forces applied to the foot suspensory must be reduces to prevent dislocation of the pedal bone and to decrease further progress of the disease. Heel elevation is recommended to load sound areas of the foot and to decrease load of the diseased areas. The traction of the deep digital flexor tendon is reduced as well. In chronic laminitis the shoeing should ease the <b>break-over</b> and extend the foot carefully. The damageable sole must be protected from trauma in any case. Ten specific laminitis shoes are located in the collection of the former veterinary medical school in Berlin- Mitte. Concerning different types of shoeing Berlin has the most comprehensive collection of all four locations. Compared to today’s laminitis shoeing the old shoes are still adequate. The pros and cons of the exhibited laminitis shoes are weighed differently. To a greater or lesser extend the shoes satisfy the demand to load the healthy parts of the foot, hence to reduce load on diseased parts, to protect the sole and to reduce traction of the deep digital flexor tendon. At the time no consideration was given to the focalisation of <b>break-over</b> in the examined shoeings...|$|E
40|$|In October 2001, {{a survey}} was {{conducted}} about cavities formed within the hoof wall (called GIDOH in Japanese) of racehorses at the Ritto and Miho Training Centres, which are managed by the Japan Racing Association (JRA). Gidoh {{is defined as a}} progressive cavity within the deep layers between the stratum medium and stratum internum. A total of 148 out of 5386 surveyed horses (2. 75 per cent) were affected. Out of 244  affected feet, fore hooves (84. 02 per cent) were more susceptible than hind hooves, and the site most affected was midline dead centre of the toe (59. 62 per cent) which tends to place extra stress at the <b>break-over</b> point in a straight-line exercise. Logistic regression analysis revealed that prevalence was significantly related with horse affiliation (OR  0. 65, 95 per cent CI 0. 46 to 0. 91) and age (OR 1. 43 per one year, 95 per cent CI 1. 27 to 1. 61). We hypothesised that the primary cause of Gidoh development in JRA stables was mechanical deformation of the hoof wall during exercise, and secondary exciting causes can subsequently lead to the spread of the lesion over the entire hoof wall...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the density of}} the primary epidermal lamellae (PEL) around the solar circumference of the forefeet of near-term fetal feral and nonferal (ie, domesticated) horses. Sample: Left forefeet from near-term Australian feral (n = 14) and domesticated (4) horse fetuses. Procedures: Near-term feral horse fetuses were obtained from culled mares within 10 minutes of death; fetuses that had died in utero 2 weeks prior to anticipated birth date and were delivered from live Thoroughbred mares were also obtained. Following disarticulation at the carpus, the left forefoot of each fetus was frozen during dissection and data collection. In a standard section of each hoof, the stratum internum PEL density was calculated at the midline center (12 o'clock) and the medial and lateral <b>break-over</b> points (11 and 1 o'clock), toe quarters (10 and 2 o'clock), and quarters (4 and 6 o'clock). Values for matching lateral and medial zones were averaged and expressed as 1 density. Density differences at the 4 locations between the feral and domesticated horse feet were assessed by use of imaging software analysis. Results: In fetal domesticated horse feet, PEL density did not differ among the 4 locations. In fetal feral horse feet, PEL density differed significantly among locations, with a pattern of gradual reduction from the dorsal to the palmar aspect of the foot. The PEL density distribution differed significantly between fetal domesticated and feral horse feet. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Results indicated that PEL density distribution differs between fetal feral and domesticated horse feet, suggestive of an adaptation of feral horses to environment challenges. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Ground {{reaction}} forces in sound horses with asymmetric hooves show systematic {{differences in the}} horizontal braking force and relative timing of <b>break-over.</b> The Center Of Pressure (COP) path quantifies the dynamic load distribution under the hoof in a moving horse. The objective was to test whether anatomical asymmetry, quantified by the difference in dorsal wall angle between {{the left and right}} forelimbs, correlates with asymmetry in the COP path between these limbs. In addition, repeatability of the COP path was investigated. Methods : A larger group (n = 31) visually sound horses with various degree of dorsal hoof wall asymmetry trotted three times over a pressure mat. COP path was determined in a hoof-bound coordinate system. A relationship between correlations between left and right COP paths and degree of asymmetry was investigated. Results : Using a hoof-bound coordinate system made the COP path highly repeatable and unique for each limb. The craniocaudal patterns are usually highly correlated between left and right, but the mediolateral patterns are not. Some patterns were found between COP path and dorsal wall angle but asymmetry in dorsal wall angle did not necessarily result in asymmetry in COP path and the same could be stated for symmetry. Conclusion : This method is a highly sensitive method to quantify the net result of the interaction between all of the forces and torques that occur in the limb and its inertial properties. We argue that changes in motor control, muscle force, inertial properties, kinematics and kinetics can potentially be picked up at an early stage using this method and could therefore be used as an early detection method for changes in the musculoskeletal apparatus...|$|E
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the normal position of the third phalanx (P 3) and the distal sesamoid bone {{in relation to the}} size and shape of the hoof capsule in sound horses is helpful in the diagnosis of equine foot lameness. Some measurements on radiographs used to define the position of the pedal bone within the hoof capsule are significantly influenced by hoof trimming and the height of the withers. In this study, the front hooves of 40 Warmblood horses were radiographed twice, eight weeks apart, both before and after their hooves were trimmed by an experienced farrier. Using the software programme Metron PX, 22 parameters on the lateromedial view and 16 parameters on the dorsopalmar view were measured and the effect of hoof trimming and height of the withers were calculated, respectively. Some of the hoof parameters showed mild positive correlation with the height of the withers. In 70 % of the horses the left hoof capsule and P 3 were significantly larger than the right. Hoof trimming had a remarkable influence on hoof conformation, especially for parameters in the toe region. Of all the measurements that describe the position of the third phalanx (P 3) in relation to the hoof capsule, the distances between the distal tip of P 3 to the solar surface of the foot, P 3 to the tip of the toe and P 3 to the point of <b>break-over</b> showed the greatest differences before and after trimming. The database of the present study can be used by farriers and veterinarians as a guideline for routine and corrective shoeing of Warmblood horses...|$|E
