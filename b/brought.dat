Yup said an SS officer had told a million Hungarian Jews would soon be arriving at Auschwitz. Vrba said he also overheard SS guards discuss how they would soon have Hungarian salami. When Jews from the Netherlands arrived, he wrote, they <b>brought</b> cheese, French Jews <b>brought</b> sardines and Greek Jews <b>brought</b> halva and olives. Now it was Hungarian salami.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was <b>brought</b> to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence.

5|$|Allied {{supply was}} entirely by sea. Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment (EBSR) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade, wearing Australian uniforms, {{advanced}} with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side {{as they were}} secured. If a beach looked suitable, a second reconnaissance was made from the sea. Once a beach was selected, a shore party was <b>brought</b> in by landing craft {{to set up an}} administrative area. Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to be <b>brought</b> up by jeeps but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had to be <b>brought</b> by native carriers. Artillery guns were <b>brought</b> forward over the tracks, or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised (LCMs) of the 532nd EBSR. Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles. As the advance continued, new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed. The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be <b>brought</b> forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead.|$|E
