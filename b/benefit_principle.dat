5000|$|A city {{resident}} may rarely use the library, {{never have}} to call the police or fire departments, and never need welfare assistance. But the resident still benefits, indirectly, from the service availability, social order, and economic stability those city services provide. As long as the assessment calculation is logical and proportional, the assessment would be related to an implied level of government service. [...] The concept of implied level of government service is related to the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle</b> of equity, where the proceeds of a tax are directly allocated to a corresponding government service—such as a gas tax financing construction and maintenance of roads. Both implied level of government service and the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle</b> are related to the concept of rational economic exchange.|$|R
40|$|In 1997, I {{wrote an}} article on the {{international}} tax challenges posed by the then-nascent electronic commerce, in which I suggested that the international tax regime is based on two principles: the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle</b> and the single tax <b>principle.</b> The <b>benefits</b> <b>principle</b> states that active (business) income should be taxed primarily by the country of source, and passive (investment) income should be taxed primarily by the country of residence. This is the famous compromise reached by the four economists at the foundation of the regime in 1923 and is not particularly controversial. It is embodied in every one of the over 3, 000 tax treaties that reduce taxation at the source of passive income while allowing source countries to tax active income if there is a permanent establishment. The single tax principle states that cross-border income should be taxed once at the rate determined by the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle.</b> In other words, cross-border income should be taxed only once at the source-country rate for active income and at the residence-country rate for passive income. But if the preferred country (i. e., source for active, and residence for passive) does not tax, it is incumbent upon the other country to do so because otherwise, I argued in my article, double non-taxation would result, which is just as damaging as double taxation. This argument remains hugely controversial. While there are indications that the single tax principle was the idea underlying the adoption of the foreign tax credit by the United States in 1918, as far as tax treaties are concerned, the United States did not accept the single tax principle until more recent times...|$|R
40|$|The Financial Crisis of 2008 and Great Recession that {{followed}} have exacerbated income inequality {{within and between}} countries. In {{the aftermath of the}} economic turbulence, politicians have turned their attention to the twin problems of individual tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance. U. S. legislators enacted the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA), leading to the United States signing a series of Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs) for the exchange of tax information. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) developed the Multilateral Agreement for Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (MAATM) and initiated the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project to reduce tax evasion and tax avoidance globally. Although these efforts were well-intended, this Article argues that the tax policy response to the Financial Crisis and Great Recession has ultimately been inadequate. The problem, which is discussed in-depth in the sections that follow, is the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle.</b> Part I of this Article introduces the primary weakness of the benefits principle: the reliance on source-based taxation for active income and residencebased taxation for passive income requires cooperation by too many jurisdictions. This section provides three case studies of individual tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance to illustrate the principle’s shortcomings. Part II focuses on the individual tax evasion problem. This section analyzes the FATCA, IGA, and MAATM responses and explains why these measures are likely to fall short. Part III focuses on corporate tax avoidance. This section examines the BEPS response and its inadequacies. Part IV proposes an alternative to international tax policy based on the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle.</b> This section argues that reversing the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle</b> by taxing passive income primarily at source and active income primarily at residence will more effectively reduce individual tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance in the developed and developing world...|$|R

50|$|The {{free-rider}} {{problem is}} the primary criticism given for limiting {{the scope of the}} <b>benefit</b> <b>principle.</b> When information about marginal benefits is available only from the individuals themselves, they tend to under report their valuation for a particular good, this gives rise to the preference revelation problem. Each individual can lower his tax cost by under reporting his benefits derived from the public good or service. One solution would be to implement tax choice. If taxpayers had to pay taxes anyway, but could choose where their taxes went (without the possibility of secret rebates or similar), then they would have no incentive to hide their true preferences.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>benefit</b> <b>principle</b> is {{a concept}} {{in the theory of}} {{taxation}} from public finance. It bases taxes to pay for public-goods expenditures on a politically-revealed willingness to pay for benefits received. The principle is sometimes likened to the function of prices in allocating private goods. [...] In its use for assessing the efficiency of taxes and appraising fiscal policy, the benefit approach was initially developed by Knut Wicksell (1896) and Erik Lindahl (1919), two economists of the Stockholm School. Wicksell's near-unanimity formulation of the principle was premised on a just income distribution. The approach was extended in the work of Paul Samuelson, Richard Musgrave, and others. [...] It has also been applied to such subjects as tax progressivity, corporation taxes, and taxes on property or wealth. The unanimity-rule aspect of Wicksell's approach in linking taxes and expenditures is cited as a point of departure for the study of constitutional economics in the work of James Buchanan.|$|E

In essence, the Obama proposals (the “Obama Plan”) introduce a 21 st Century version of the vision begun by Thomas Adams in 1918 and continued by Stanley Surrey in 1961 : A world in which source and residence taxation are coordinated so as to achieve the underlying goals of the international tax regime. As I have explained at length elsewhere, these goals are the Single Tax Principle (all income from cross-border transactions {{should be subject to}} tax once, not more and not less) and the <b>Benefits</b> <b>Principle</b> (active income should be taxed primarily at source, passive income primarily at residence). The Obama Plan does this by addressing the central problem of implementing corporate and individual income taxation in a world of open economies: Effective source taxation requires residence taxation, and effective residence taxation requires source taxation. In what follows, I will comment on the major proposals in the Obama Plan and explain how they form a coherent step forward toward achieving the Single Tax and <b>Benefit</b> <b>Principles.</b> I will first address the proposals related to the taxation of active income earned by corporations, and then the proposals related to the taxation of passive income earned by individuals...|$|R
40|$|Economists {{have long}} argued over {{the nature of}} the {{property}} tax—is it a benefits tax or a capital tax with local excise tax effects? Those who see it as a benefits tax draw upon the pioneering efforts of Tiebout (1956) to argue that households equate taxes paid with the value of public services received by “voting with their feet. ” According to one of the leading advocates of this position (Hamilton, 1975 a), the existence of choice among communities, combined with the use of zon-ing to exclude free riders, transforms the suburban public economy into a quasi-market, with the property tax serving as the price for public goods. If this case holds, as Hamilton (1975 b: 13) pointed out, “ [...] . then this price should not distort the housing market any more than the price of eggs should distort the housing market. ” According to those who see the property tax as a capital/ excise tax, the national average rate of taxation is a tax on capital, and local differences from the national average rate produce local excise effects. Regardless of which of the two views of the property tax one subscribes to, to many economists the property tax does not look like such a bad tax. Two principles are used to judge whether a tax is fair: the <b>benefits</b> <b>principle</b> and the ability-to-pay <b>principle.</b> The <b>benefits</b> <b>principle</b> maintains that taxes paid should rise in proportion to the benefits received from public services.
