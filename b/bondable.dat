In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to Willow, a town [...] north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all <b>bondable</b> construction costs before building could begin.

5000|$|<b>Bondable</b> leases are {{typically}} used in so-called credit tenant lease deals, where the main driver of value {{is not so}} much the real estate, but the uninterrupted cash flow from the usually investment-grade rated [...] "credit" [...] tenant. Because <b>bondable</b> lease investments offer such low risk, higher investment rates can indicate a recovery in not only the bond market, but also in the overall real estate market.|$|E
50|$|Many {{functional}} blocks such as {{impedance matching}} circuits, harmonic filters, couplers and baluns and power combiner/divider {{can be realized}} by IPDs technology. IPDs are generally fabricated using standard wafer fabrication technologies such as thin film and photolithography processing. IPDs can be designed as flip chip mountable or wire <b>bondable</b> components and the substrates for IPDs usually are thin film substrates like silicon, alumina or glass.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "ground lease" [...] {{is another}} {{variation}} of a net lease. Under a ground lease, the landowner leases {{the land to}} the lessee which gives the lessee the opportunity to construct a building. The lessee will then have a leasehold interest in the property. Under a ground lease the tenant will typically pay for the same items they pay for under a Triple Net Lease or <b>Bondable</b> Lease. Generally, ownership of the building will revert to the landowner at conclusion of the lease.|$|E
50|$|Strength, durability, cost, {{and stretch}} make {{polyester}} material {{the most widely}} used in fabric structures. Polyesters that are laminated or coated with PVC films are usually the least expensive option for longer-term fabrications.Laminates generally consist of vinyl films over woven or knitted polyester meshes (called scrims or substrates), while vinyl-coated polyesters usually have a high-count, high-tensile base fabric coated with a <b>bondable</b> substance that provides extra strength. Precontraint fabric is made by placing the polyester fabric under tension both before and during the coating process. This results in a weave that has increased dimensional stability.|$|E
50|$|The term bond or <b>bondable</b> is {{primarily}} used in higher structured lease forms which {{also include a}} requirement that the tenant completely backstop casualty and condemnation loss in addition to assuming all other payment and performance obligations generally associated with a standard triple net lease. At first glance a bond lease may appear identical to a triple net lease, as the tenant is usually responsible for paying all the property taxes, insurance, and maintenance under both lease structures; however in a bond lease the tenant is obligated to rebuild after a casualty (acts of God included) or continue paying rent should the property be condemned.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the hardest}} types of film {{financing}} pieces to obtain is private investor funds. These are funds invested by an individual who is looking to possibly add more risk to his investment portfolio, or a high-net-worth individual with {{a keen interest in}} films. While there are a few steps to cover between development funding and capital funding, with regard to the latter, any capital funding that is approached, whether that source is private equity (private individuals and /or funding groups), or debt financing (finance institutions and /or banks), is going to require that you have certain necessary elements in place before they consider financing your project. These elements include marketplace analytics, audience analytics, a <b>bondable</b> schedule and budget, and a distribution plan.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>bondable</b> lease (also {{called an}} [...] "absolute triple net lease", [...] "true triple net lease", [...] "hell-or-high-water lease", or [...] "absolute net lease") {{is the most}} extreme {{variation}} of a triple net lease, where the tenant carries every imaginable real estate risk related to the property. Notably, these additional risks include the obligations to rebuild after a casualty, regardless of the adequacy of insurance proceeds, and to pay rent after partial or full condemnation. These leases are not terminable by the tenant, nor are rent abatements permissible. The concept {{is to make the}} rent absolutely net under all circumstances, equivalent to the obligations of a bond: hence the [...] "hell-or-high water" [...] moniker. An example of this type of lease would be a leaseback arrangement in which a retailer leases back the building it formerly owned and continues to run the store.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Atwood, then {{publisher}} of the Anchorage Times and an Anchorage [...] "booster," [...] was an early leader in efforts to move the capital to Fairbanks, which many in both cities resisted. Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital {{to be at least}} 30 mi from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to Willow, a town 70 mi north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all <b>bondable</b> construction costs before building could begin. Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated $900 million. A 1984 [...] "ultimate" [...] capital-move vote also failed, as did a 1996 vote.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "bondable NNN lease", {{the most}} extreme form of a NNN lease investment, is often used {{incorrectly}} in the net lease industry when referring to NNN properties which are merely occupied by investment-grade tenants. The tenant's credit rating is a crucial factor which the lender takes into account in their decision to lend on a property and under what terms; however, {{it is not the}} characteristic which distinguishes a <b>bondable</b> triple net from a standard triple net lease investment.When evaluating the value of the credit tenant’s credit, most brokers, and lenders, base their analysis on the credit rating garnered by one of the major credit agencies (Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, Dunn & Bradstreet). Though these ratings are important, they don’t always paint the most accurate picture of a company’s overall picture and future viability. Some brokers offer the services of an in-house stock broker and analyze the credit tenant’s financials and stock performance when the tenant is publicly traded on an exchange. A great deal can be learned by examining the credit tenant’s stock performance in comparison to other industry competitors. Other readily available metrics such as the P/E ratio, PEG ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio can be indicators of a credit tenant’s financial health.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} second-order {{version of the}} resummed {{thermodynamic}} perturbation theory for patchy colloidal models with arbitrary number of multiply <b>bondable</b> patches. The model {{is represented by the}} hard-sphere fluid system with several attractive patches on the surface and resummation is carried out to account for blocking effects, i. e., when the bonding of a particle restricts (blocks) its ability to bond with other particles. The theory represents an extension of the earlier proposed first order resummed thermodynamic perturbation theory for central force associating potential and takes into account formation of the rings of the particles. In the limiting case of singly <b>bondable</b> patches (total blockage), the theory reduces to Wertheim thermodynamic perturbation theory for associating fluids. Closed-form expressions for the Helmholtz free energy, pressure, internal energy, and chemical potential of the model with an arbitrary number of equivalent doubly <b>bondable</b> patches are derived. Predictions of the theory for the model with two patches appears to be in a very good agreement with predictions of new NVT and NPT Monte Carlo simulations, including the region of strong association...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} project we developed and tested successfully a new LTCC tape for anodic bonding between LTCC and silicon. With a CTE = 3, 4 x 10 - 6 /K it is matched to the CTE of silicon {{and close to}} silicon in its behaviour. Driving force was miniaturization and increasing integration density of an acceleration sensor. The targetted size reduction was 40 %. The anodic <b>bondable</b> glass wafer had been substituted with the anodic <b>bondable</b> LTCC multilayer. The sensor, geometric size 4, 5 x 7, 2 x 1, 5 mm 3, had successfully been designed and manufactured and qualified. After material development, the LTCC processability of the developed tape had been tested as well as material compatibility with gold thick-film-metallization. These LTCC substrates had been processed with thin film technology, with adapted material systems, as well. We have manufactured metallized anodic <b>bondable</b> LTCC multilayer wafers, size up to 4 inch, thickness 0, 6 mm suitable for wafer level packaging. The measured surface roughness of the polished LTCC substrates was Ra < 100 nm, substrate flatness < 5 µm/ 10 mm. The anodic bonding tests with LTCC wafers had been carried out with applied bonding temperatures of 350 °C- 400 °C, voltage 1, 0 - 1, 5 kV and demonstrated that the novel LTCC material is appropiate for use in silicon (MEMS) technology...|$|E

40|$|Polymer layered {{silicate}} nanocomposites (PLSN) {{have attracted}} great interest because they exhibit remarkable improvements in materials properties relative to pristine polymers. Successful {{formation of a}} PLSN is critically dependent on generation of very high interfacial area in the composite. This is accomplished when the stacks of silicate platelets (tactoids) split into discrete platelets. The latter phenomenon is known as exfoliation and is strongly influenced by interfacial chemistry (i. e. structure and properties of the interface or interphase) associated with the edge and basal surfaces of the silicate platelets, chemical modification (usually with quaternary alkyl ammonium halides) of the latter and the resulting effect on interactions between the platelets themselves and polymer chains. Interactions between sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) /organically modified montmorillonite (o-MMT) {{and a variety of}} probes, some of which are intended to model the structures present in the components of a polyurethane (PU), epoxy resin and polystyrene system (PS), have been studied. The adsorption process was characterised using flow microcalorimetry (FMC) in conjuncqon with diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), and wide angle x-ray scattering (). Adsorption of hydrogen <b>bondable</b> groups, such as alcohol, ether, amine probes, onto Na-MMT was dominated by the hydrogen bonding interactions with hydrated Na+ ions and with the hydroxyl groups present at the platelet edges. Moreover, stronger interactions with hydrated Na+ ions led to greater retention of the probes after the desorption process. When the Na-MMT was moisturized at ambient atmosphere, hydrogen <b>bondable</b> probes showed a reversible adsorption. In contrast, chemical adsorption (reaction) dominated the adsorption of the isocyanate probe onto Na-MMT; the latter reacted either with the platelet edge hydroxyl groups forming a urethane linkage or with pre-adsorbed ambient water molecules adsorbed onto Na-MMT ultimately forming a physically adsorbed urea. In the case of o-MMTs, when only the platelet edge hydroxyl groups were available, hydrogen <b>bondable</b> probes showed a reversible adsorption. Reactions between reactive probes, including isocyanate and epoxide probes, and surfactant functional groups (OH and COOH groups) are affected by the gallery structures, such as the arrangement of surfactant within the galleries and level of surfactant intercalated. Adsorption of aromatic probes, including styrene, ethylbenzene and polystyrene, was dominated by the relatively weak dispersive interactions with the basal surfaces of o-MMT, and was significantly affected by the gallery structures ofo-MMT (surfactant level and surfactant structure). This study has provided valuable new insight into interactions in nanocomposite materials. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>bondable</b> lingual tongue spurs (BLTS; Tongue Tamers®, Ortho Technology, Tampa, FL) on measures of overbite and incisor position in a sample of anterior open bite subjects who had either a digit-sucking habit or an anterior tongue posture problem. Patient acceptance of the spurs was also evaluated. BLTS were placed on all maxillary and mandibular incisors of 12 subjects (mean age 13. 9 years) with anterior open bite. Dental casts and lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken pre-treatment (T 1) and after 6 months of lingual spur treatment alone (T 2). Overbite and overjet of the anterior teeth were measured and compared on pre- and post-treatment study models. Differences in the cephalometric analyses between T 1 and T 2 were also assessed. Questionnaires were completed to evaluate the subjects 2 ̆ 7 acceptance of the spurs. A statistically significant increase in overbite was found on all 6 anterior teeth measured on the study models. This observation was corroborated by the statistically significant increase in anterior overbite (1. 38 ± 0. 89 mm; P 3 ̆c 0. 001) and uprighting of the upper and lower incisors observed on cephalometric radiographs. Overjet was not affected by the treatment. BLTS were well tolerated by the subjects. Eleven of 12 subjects adjusted to the spurs in 2 weeks or less. <b>Bondable</b> lingual tongue spur treatment, in subjects with either digit-sucking habits or tongue posture problems, resulted in a significant reduction of anterior open bite and incisor proclination by successfully keeping pressure away from the anterior teeth.

40|$|The firmly {{adherent}} film of <b>bondable</b> metal, such as silver, {{is applied}} to the surface of glass or other substrate by decomposing a layer of solution of a thermally decomposable metallo-organic deposition (MOD) compound such as silver neodecanoate in xylene. The MOD compound thermally decomposes into metal and gaseous by-products. Sealing is accomplished by depositing a layer of bonding metal, such as solder or a brazing alloy, on the metal film and then forming an assembly with another high melting point metal surface such as a layer of Kovar. When the assembly is heated above the temperature of the solder, the solder flows, wets the adjacent surfaces and forms a hermetic seal between the metal film and metal surface when the assembly cools...|$|E
40|$|Hydrophilic silicon {{surfaces}} become hydrophobic without microroughening after 2 00 °C {{low energy}} hydrogen plasma cleaning. The fully hydrogen-terminated silicon surfaces do not bond to each other, not {{even by the}} application of exter-nal pressure. A subsequent 400 to 600 °C, 4 mm thermal treatment in ultrahigh vacuum converts the wafer surfaces to hydrophilic and <b>bondable</b> which {{can be attributed to}} desorption of hydrogen from the surfaces. Hydrophobic silicon sur-faces prepared by a dip in HF (without subsequent water rinse) are terminated by H and a small amount of F, or by H and a small amount of OH (after subsequent water rinse).

40|$|Abstract — Services discovery, selection, composition, verification, and {{adaptation}} {{are important in}} service-oriented computing. Existing researches often study techniques to maximize the benefits of individual services. However, following the power laws, {{a small fraction of}} quality services offers their executions to support a significant portion of all service requests. We argue that locating and maintaining such a small and significant set of services is important to the development of service-oriented computing. In this paper, we propose the notion of adaptive service-oriented community. A community consists of peer-reviewed services, and only those operations of member services that the community collectively exceeds a significance threshold are discoverable and <b>bondable.</b> Services also select such communities to bind to its requested operations primarily based on their significance. Our proposal essentially raises a service ecosystem from pursuing the benefits of individual services to that of the community as a whole.
