25|$|Dr Ralph Bodkin Kelley (1890-1970) of the CSIR {{arrived in}} the USA in January 1931 to gather {{information}} about the advantages of Brahman cross-breeding in Texas. On his return to Australia, a CSIR proposal to establish a cattle <b>breeding</b> <b>station</b> for experimental mating of Brahman and British cattle breeds in north Queensland was rejected by a graziers' meeting in Rockhampton. Influential men such as James Lockie Wilson (1880-1956), an executive member of the United Graziers' Association (UGA) for 27 years, opposed CSIR's introduction of Brahman cattle. The project remained dormant until 1933 when Dr Gilruth negotiated an agreement with three pastoral companies and one central Queensland grazier. They would fund the purchase and importation of USA-sourced Brahman cattle into Australia, provide the British cattle for hybridisation and maintain the cattle and their progeny. Negotiations between Winter-Irving and Alison; Meredith Menzies and Company (Millungera); Queensland Stations Ltd; and grazier, and Colin W Wright, owner of Waverley and Branxholm in the St Lawrence district in central Queensland, were completed in January 1933.|$|E

500|$|Gunther Köhler {{found the}} species at {{the brink of}} extinction, perhaps even {{functionally}} extinct in the wild as of 1994 due to overhunting and its restricted habitat. [...] As a result, the Iguana Research and <b>Breeding</b> <b>Station</b> was built in April 1997 with the help and funds of various {{organizations such as the}} Frankfurt Zoological Society, the Senckenberg Nature Research Society, AFE-COHDEFOR (State Forestry Administration-Honduran Forestry Development Corporation), BICA (Bay Islands Conservation Association) [...] and the National Autonomous University of Honduras.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, as {{a result}} of Köhler's {{expedition}} and subsequent book, Reptiles of Central America, the Conservation Project of the Utila Iguana (CPUI) was founded.

500|$|The Iguana Research and <b>Breeding</b> <b>station</b> {{employs a}} [...] "head-starting" [...] program for newly hatched iguanas. [...] "Head-starting", {{originally}} {{used to protect}} hatching sea turtles, is a process by which iguana eggs are hatched in an incubator and the animals are protected and fed until they are {{large enough to be}} protected from predation upon them. In the case of the Utila iguana, 50% of the animals hatched at the Center are maintained for the head-start program and the rest are released into mangrove forests after hatching. The purpose is to get the animals to a size where they are more capable of fleeing from or fighting off predators. The program has proven successful, as the iguanas behave like their wild-born counterparts. The success of the Utila program serves as a blueprint for other such programs in the Caribbean, particularly with Cyclura species such as the Cuban Iguana and Blue Iguana. They employ volunteers and their best volunteer was Ronan McGrath.|$|E

30|$|The nomadic mode of {{production}} underwent {{a series of}} changes, including specialization, sedentarization, {{and the introduction of}} new technologies, which improved the productivity of both animal and people. Sedentarization facilitated government service delivery, such as postal services, business services, education, and health care, which greatly improved the resilience of the herding community (Wang 2006). By 1965, traditional nomadism was largely abandoned (Xu 1999). Then, a pastoral system based on seasonal rotational grazing within a production unit was formed (Wang 2006, 2013). Meanwhile, the introduction of machinery like harvesters and wind generators, as well as <b>breeding</b> <b>stations,</b> greatly promoted the efficiency of animal husbandry (Lin and Zheng 1990). The efficiency of livestock raising was high, while its impacts on the environment were relatively low.|$|R
5000|$|In 1920 a large {{shift in}} the {{breeding}} of strawberries occurred. Breeding stopped being a largely private personal endeavor and became a government matter when the United States department of Agriculture started to fund strawberry breeding. [...] The Plant Patent Act of 1930 gave plant breeders the same status as mechanical and chemical inventors had through patent law. The early objectives of the <b>breeding</b> <b>stations</b> were to develop new varieties to better satisfy the American demand for better dessert, canning and freezing varieties. In the late 1930s and 40s disease resistance became an objective of breeding, particularly to red stele root disease. The 1937 federal work objectives included goals of improving resistance to disease and improving tolerance of long and short days as well as high and low temperatures.|$|R
30|$|By the 1940 s, VIR {{scientists}} began experimenting on genebank {{operations to}} improve long-term storage {{to ensure that}} the deposits in the genebank, and at 40 satellite collections and <b>breeding</b> <b>stations,</b> would stay viable longer than year to year. Eventually, VIR scientists determined optimal conditions for storing seed and other planting material (Loskutov 1999). However, genebank deposits were not only to be conserved, but used. Once stored in the Leningrad genebank, Vavilov trusted that other scientists would see his deposits as a “genetic insurance policy” for future crop improvement. As such, Vavilov insisted that the seed being collected enter into evaluation, screening and crop improvement programs as soon as possible. Through these efforts, Vavilov established plant breeding 2 programs and over 100 experimental stations across Russia, based on principles of Mendelian genetics and on the type of seed collections VIR.|$|R
