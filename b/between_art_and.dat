Other themes include methods of interpretation of history, cultural familiarity with brand names, and tensions <b>between</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> commercialization. The September 11, 2001 attacks are used as a motif representing the transition to the new century.

5|$|The rich art {{elaborated}} by the Muisca {{has inspired}} modern artists and designers in their creativity. Muisca motives are represented as murals, in clothing and as objects found {{all over the}} former Muisca territories {{as well as in}} animated clips and video games. The art of the indigenous inhabitants of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense is well studied by many different researchers who published their work right from the beginning of colonial times. The conquistador who made first contact with the Muisca, Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, wrote in his memoires about a skilled and well-organised civilisation of traders and farmers. Friar Pedro Simón described the relation <b>between</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> the religion and later contributions in the analysis of the various artforms have been made by Alexander von Humboldt, Joaquín Acosta and Liborio Zerda in the 19th century, Miguel Triana, Eliécer Silva Celis and Sylvia M. Broadbent in the 20th century and modern research is dominated by the work of Carl Henrik Langebaek Rueda, Javier Ocampo López and many others.|$|E
5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict <b>between</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to facilities management of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{symbolic}} start-date for {{the collection}} is 1968, but it refers specifically to the socio-cultural events {{of the second half}} of the 1960s which, in addition to consecration of pop art, witnessed the launch of the bases of dematerialisation of art works, mingling of formal genres, the use of film, photography and text to underpin conceptual projects and blurring of the lines <b>between</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> life, accompanied by widespread agitation for new political and social ideas. In Portugal, the late 1960s paved the way to the experimentalism of the 1970s and the beginning of a dialogue that was more informed by international experiences and relationships between Portuguese artists and their foreign counterparts.|$|E
25|$|At {{the outset}} of the First World War many artists were mobilized: Metzinger, Gleizes, Braque, Léger, de La Fresnaye, and Duchamp-Villon. Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to {{continue}} making art, sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an evasion of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift <b>between</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation.|$|E
25|$|Politically, Surrealism was Trotskyist, communist, or anarchist. The {{split from}} Dada has been characterised as a split between anarchists and communists, with the Surrealists as communist. Breton and his comrades {{supported}} Leon Trotsky and his International Left Opposition for a while, {{though there was}} an openness to anarchism that manifested more fully after World War II. Some Surrealists, such as Benjamin Péret, Mary Low, and Juan Breá, aligned with forms of left communism. Others fought for complete liberty from political ideologies, like Wolfgang Paalen, who, after Trotzky´s assassination in Mexico, prepared a schism <b>between</b> <b>art</b> <b>and</b> politics through his counter-surrealist art-magazine DYN and so prepared the ground for the abstract expressionists. Dalí supported capitalism and the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco but cannot be said to represent a trend in Surrealism in this respect; in fact he was considered, by Breton and his associates, to have betrayed and left Surrealism. Benjamin Péret, Mary Low and Juan Breá joined the POUM during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss {{integrated}} working <b>between</b> the <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> those in care settings. Identifying that the field is very broad, with diverse evidence and experience within it, the paper argues that there is a need to find ways in which to be clearer about the purpose of specific <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> care integrated projects. The paper draws on a case study project to develop some insights and a framework to help address this challenge. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is a conceptual discussion and development drawing upon insights from relevant literature and a case study analysis of an integration project between a hospice service, an <b>art</b> gallery <b>and</b> an artist. Findings – The integrated working case study project <b>between</b> the hospice, <b>art</b> gallery <b>and</b> artist highlights some points about a lack of conceptual frameworks to help locate the purpose of diverse <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> care projects. There is scope for much confusion about the nature and purpose of such integration projects without a clear framework for articulating the aims of individual integration endeavours and their place in relation to other <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> care work. This paper develops a framework and a clear understanding about the different kinds and goals of integrated working <b>between</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> care settings to help with future practical and research projects. Research limitations/implications – The paper reports a case study which highlights key themes from which generalisation to other services will require interpretation for particular contexts. Practical implications – The ideas present a helpful approach to articulating the goals of individual projects and to better understand the place of projects in relation to other <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> care initiatives. Social implications – There is much scope for better integrated working <b>between</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> care settings to achieve better outcomes for users of care services, and the ideas presented here should help to better organise and evaluate such developments. Originality/value – This is the first paper to set out the framework presented to help with better integrated working <b>between</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> care settings...|$|R
