Four experimental skin wounds, two in either side of the midline plane at the lumbar region were made, each was of 2. 5 cm length and 0. 5 cm depth. The experimental animals were studied under 6 Groups. A series of 50 and 30 % extracts of <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> (Aerva sanguinolenta), thankuni plant (Centella asiatica), antibiotic (Pronapen®) and saline were used in this experiment and these were applied twice daily to each wound. All extracts seemed to be effective for rapid healing. A 50 % extracts of <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> showed the best result where healing time was 14 days whereas in antibiotic it took 16 days. In contrast more time (20 days) was required for control group. Clinical feature revealed exudation, scab formation, redness and other routine changes. Redness was more prominent in control and antibiotic treated groups compare to other groups on day 3 of wounding. Thus both border and thankuni plant extracts are very much effective for wound healing and can be applied instead of antibiotic...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{host plant}} {{volatile}} – aphid interactions can facilitate {{the selection of}} crop border plants as a strategy to reduce plant virus incidence in crops. Crop <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> species with attractive odours {{could be used to}} attract aphids into the border crop and away from the main crop. As different cultivars of the same crop can vary in their olfactory attractiveness to aphids, selecting an attractive cultivar as a border crop is important to increase aphid landing rates. This study evaluated olfactory responses of the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), to three cultivars each of maize [Zea mays L. (Poaceae) ], potato [Solanum tuberosum L. (Solanaceae) ], and wheat [Triticumaestivum L. (Poaceae) ] with the aim of selecting an attractive crop <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> to reduce the incidence of the non-persistent Potato virus Y [PVY (Potyviridae) ] in seed potatoes. Volatiles emitted by the crop cultivars were collected and identified using coupled gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry. Quantitative and qualitative differences were found among cultivars. Behavioural responses of alate R. padi to odours of the cultivars and synthetic compounds identified from the plants were determined with a four-arm olfactometer. Rhopalosiphum padi was attracted to odours emitted from maize cultivar 6 Q- 121, but did not respond to odours from the remaining eight crop cultivars. Volatile compounds from maize and wheat cultivars that elicited a behavioural response from R. padi and contributed to differences in plant volatile profiles included (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate (attractant) and a-farnesene, (E) - 2 -hexenal, indole, and (3 E, 7 E) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyltrideca- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tetraene (TMTT) (repellents). We conclude that maize cv. 6 Q- 121 is potentially suitable as a crop <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> based on the behavioural response of R. padi to the olfactory cues emitted by this cultivar. The findings provide insight into selecting crop cultivars capable of attracting R. padi to crop border plants.

In order to highlight the employees´ attitudes and representations on the territory, an interdisciplinary methodology has been set up, which is based on semi-structured interviews and mental maps. The results show different meanings for territoriality, where national borders are rarely directly expressed, although they play a structuring role in people´s representations. Three main types of representation emerge, whether they come from persons having their roots in the region, from persons with an expatriate profile, or from persons presenting some uncertainty as regards identity spatial markers...|$|E
40|$|Some {{species of}} fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) shelter and roost in non-host plants {{surrounding}} crops. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the attractiveness of two plants (Poaceae) : maize, Zea mays (Linné) and Napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum (Schumacher) for two species of Dacini damaging cucurbits in Reunion Island: Bactrocera cucurbitae (Coquillett) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and Dacus demmerezi (Bezzi) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Plants of the two plant species were established in pots and presented to adult flies in field cages. In each cage, a cohort consisting of adults of a given species, of known sex and age, was released. For each species, the experiment was replicated four times. The number of adult flies on the different plants as well as their location on the plant was recorded. Maize was more attractive to adults of B. cucurbitae and D. demmerezi than Napier grass irrespective of sex and sexual maturity. Most adults of both species were found under the leaves of maize and Napier grass. The effects of the date, time of day, age, and sex of flies on their attraction to plants are discussed. A possible application of this study would be to use maize as a <b>border</b> <b>plant</b> to apply bait for the control of fruit flies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|The bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) transmits the nonpersistent Potato virus Y (PVY) to seed potatoes. Planting a nonvirus {{host plant}} around the main crop can reduce PVY incidence, because aphids tend {{to land in}} high numbers {{at the edge of}} a field and the crop border acts as a virus sink. This study {{determined}} R. padi landing and settling preferences and reproductive rates on three cultivars each of maize and wheat compared with potato in the laboratory as a basis for identifying an attractive crop <b>border</b> <b>plant.</b> Aphids were reared on maize and wheat to control for bias due to previous experience. Irrespective of origin, alates preferred to land almost exclusively on maize and wheat rather than on potato cultivars in choice experiments. Aphid settling on the maize and wheat cultivars depended on aphid origin. In no-choice experiments, R. padi produced the highest number of offspring on the wheat cultivars, irrespective of origin. Plant nitrogen content and trichome density did not influence R. padi reproduction. The study demonstrates that host plant preference of aphids may vary between plant cultivars and can therefore influence the effectiveness of a crop border. The high landing rate but low reproduction suggest that maize cultivars ' 6 Q- 121 ' and ' 78 - 15 B' could be suitable crop border plants in regions where R. padi is abundant. Before testing potential crop border plants in the field, cultivars should be screened using aphid landing, settling and reproduction as selection criteria...|$|E
40|$|Prairie Pink’ (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) was {{released}} by the Univ. of Nebraska– Lincoln for its winter hardiness, compact growth, attractive pink double flowers, and repeat blooming. Its primary use is as a perennial <b>border</b> <b>plant,</b> but it {{also can be used}} as a cut flower. The name ‘Prairie Pink’ has been registered with the International Dianthus Registration Authority for cultivar names (A. C. Leslie, The Royal Horticultural Society, Wisley GU 23 6 Qb, England). Origin ‘Prairie Pink’ dianthus, tested as NP 76116, was initially field-planted as a seedling in 1976 and was selected in 1977 at the Univ. of Nebraska West Central Research and Extension Center, North Platte. The parentage of this selection originated from plant material obtained from the Cheyenne Horticulture Field Station and brought to North Platte in 1970. The original plant material brought to North Platte was reported to be advanced-generation offspring of Dianthus plumarius L. x ‘Chabaud’ carnation. The exact pedigree (female and male parent) of ‘Prairie Pink’ is unknown. The chromosome number is not available. Several previous Dianthus selections have been released from this project (Lindgren and Uhlinger, 1981; Uhlinger and Lindgren, 1984). Description ‘Prairie Pink’ Dianthus averages 39. 3 ± 7. 2 cm in height, 12 ± 9. 4 stalks per plant, 4. 6 ± 0. 6 cm in flower diameter, 29 ± 4. 0 petals per bloom, and 30 ± 22. 7 buds per plant in North Platte (Table 1). Plants bloom for 2 to 4 weeks beginning in early June and reflower in late summer. They will flower sporadically from June to late summer. Plants normally live an average of 3 to 4 years and have been hardy to the southern edge of zone 4 of the USDA Plant Hardiness Map (U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, 1960); however, no research has been conducted specifically on cold hardiness. ‘Prairie Pink’ has a nonsplitting calyx. Foliage color is blue-green. Since its selection in 1977 in North Platte, ‘Prairie Pink’ has had no major insect pests. Diseases were minimal the first year of planting, but some leaf spots (Alternaria dianthi Stev.) were present on older plants (2 to 4 years old); however, no specific disease susceptibility studies were conducted on this selection. The plant does best in full sun and in soil with good drainage. It has not been tested outside of the midwestern United States, so its adaptability in other geographic regions is unknown...|$|E
