500|$|The nelicourvi weaver (Ploceus nelicourvi) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Ploceidae. It is endemic to Madagascar. Together with its closest relative, the sakalava weaver, it is {{sometimes}} placed in a separate genus Nelicurvius. A slender, sparrow-like bird, it is [...] long and weighing [...] Breeding males have a black bill and head, brown eyes, yellow collar, grey belly, chestnut-brown lower tail coverts, olive back, and blackish flight feathers edged greenish. Non-breeding males have mottled grey and green heads. In the breeding female {{the front of the}} head is yellow and the back olive green, with a broad yellow eyebrow. It builds solitary, roofed, retort-shaped nests, hanging by a rope from a branch, vine or <b>bamboo</b> <b>stem,</b> in an open space. It primarily feeds on insects, looking on its own or in very small groups, often together with long-billed bernieria. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland and mountain forests. The conservation status of Nelicourvi weaver is least concern according to the IUCN Red List.|$|E
500|$|The {{species is}} {{apparently}} monogamous, having long-term relationships. Nests are built distanced from other nests. Although occasionally two nests are {{within a few}} meters, colonies do not occur. Males display during the breeding season, while seated on a horizontal branch, with fluttering wings helt low while calling loudly. Mating starts during the sixth day of nest building. The male chases away other birds from the nest, possibly to forestall the deposition of eggs by other couples or cuckoos. Eggs usually are produced between October and March, corresponding to the late dry season and raining season. Nest building may occur as early as August and does not always signal imminent breeding attempts. Nests are conspicuous, usually in the open and away from surrounding vegetation, attached from an often defoliated limb, <b>bamboo</b> <b>stem</b> or vine, hanging above a clearing or a stream at a height of [...] The nest is attached to its hold by a [...] long rope. It is shaped like a retort, having an oval nesting chamber [...] high and [...] in diameter and a vertical entrance hose is attached high up a side and {{is at least as}} long as the nest is high. It is a firm construction made from strips of grass, sedge, and palm fronds, with a thin lining of palm fibres {{at the bottom of the}} nesting chamber. The male constructs the structure of the nest while the female brings lining material. The total time used to construct the nest is approximately twelve days. A clutch consists of one to four (most often three) oval, smooth, somewhat shiny, variably pale blue-green eggs of about 20½mm (0.8in) long and [...] in diameter. The eggs are incubated only by the female for fifteen days before hatching. The male lacks brood patches. Both parents feed the chicks and remove fecal sacs.|$|E

The study investigated the species richness and the composition of trophic guilds using mist-netting on eight transects (four in burned plots and four in control plots in the same forest fragments). Eight plots (0. 12 [*]ha) were also established parallel to each transect to record the number of live trees (DBH ≥ 10 [*]cm), palms, and dead trees. <b>Bamboo</b> <b>stems</b> were quantified in 0. 024 [*]ha subplots. No significant difference was found between burned and control plots in the species richness or abundance of birds, nor was any significant pattern found in the NMDS ordination of the composition of the communities or guilds.

Multiple regressions based on the PCA scores and bird species richness and abundance found no significant trends.
