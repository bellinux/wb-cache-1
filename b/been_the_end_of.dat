He assumed the title of Celestial Emperor and designated an era name, named his oldest son Yelü Bei as his successor, and commissioned the construction of a Confucian temple. Two years later he established a capital city, Shangjing (上京), which imitated the model of a Chinese capital city.|$|E

However, William published very harsh peace terms in the Declaration of Finglas, excluding the Jacobite officers and the Irish Catholic landed class from the pardon he offered to Jacobite foot-soldiers.

25|$|Between Hughes and Schweizer, and {{including}} foreign-licensed production civil and military training aircraft, nearly 3,000 {{copies of the}} Model 269/300 have been built and flown over the last 50 years.

25|$|One {{positive}} outcome has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> jurisdictional warfare between the UFW and Teamsters.

The agreement also led the UFW to end its boycott of lettuce, grapes, and wine in February 1978. Why did the two unions sign the agreement? UFW officials claimed the Teamsters {{were on the verge of}} losing a jurisdictional battle for 50,000 workers being decided by the ALRB, but at least one press report indicated that the scandal-scarred union wished to burnish its public image.|$|E

I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E
500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Terminus' associations could extend from property boundaries to limits more generally.

Diocletian's decision in 303 AD to initiate his persecution of Christians on February 23 has been seen as an attempt at enlisting Terminus [...] "to put a limit to the progress of Christianity".|$|E

500|$|Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens {{described}} Voyager as the [...] "conceptual cousin" [...] of Phase II, {{in that it}} {{was used}} to launch the United Paramount Network (UPN) in January 1995. This was the fifth network, as Diller had moved to the Fox Entertainment Group in the years between Phase II and Voyager, where he launched the fourth network, the Fox Broadcasting Company. They hypothesised that Phase II would have seen a similar decline in ratings as seen by Voyager {{during the course of the}} first season, except this decline would have resulted in the cancellation of Phase II at the time of first broadcast in 1970s.

500|$|In the First Victory Test, the Australian Servicemen scraped home by six wickets {{with only}} two balls and minutes to spare. The last pre-war series between England and Australia in 1938 had been an attritional and hard-nosed contest, but in the {{afterglow}} of the war victory, the cricketers played flamboyantly with abandon in front of packed crowds. The attractive, attacking style of play was widely praised by commentators and the match raised £1,935 for war relief charities. England then levelled the series by winning the Second Victory Test at Bramall Lane, Sheffield with a hard-fought battle, by [...] 41 runs. Australia won the Third Victory Test by four wickets late {{on the final day}} and drew the Fourth Victory Test at Lord's. That would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the series, but because of the record attendance of 93,000 at Lord's, another match was appended. England drew the series by winning the Fifth Victory Test in front of another capacity crowd. The Victory Tests were regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 and bright and attacking play.|$|E

500|$|When {{radio station}} KEDA-AM {{broke the news}} of Selena's death, many people accused the staff of lying because {{the next day was}} April Fools' Day. In San Antonio, major Spanish-language radio {{stations}} including Tejano 107, KXTN-FM, KRIO-FM and KEDA-AM, began monitoring developments. All major U.S. networks interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The lead item on national television network evening news programs in Corpus Christi had <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike; within thirty minutes of its announcement, Selena's murder was the lead item on all television stations in South Texas. Her death was front-page news in The New York Times for two days, and was featured prominently on BBC World News. News of the singer's death reached Japan, where David Byrne first heard of the shooting. Univision and Telemundo were among the first national news stations to arrive at the crime scene. Carlos Lopez of KMIQ-105.1 told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that [...] "Tejano music is dead for at least today" [...] and compared the reactions to Selena's death to reactions to the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and called March 31, 1995 [...] "Black Friday". Radio stations in Texas began playing Selena's music non-stop and taking telephone calls from distressed fans.|$|E

[...] As a high school sophomore, Boren played guard and was an honors student. [...] During his high school years, his father was his harshest critic. [...] As a junior, he was listed as a nose guard on defense and an offensive tackle. [...] That season, he earned Division I Associated Press All-Ohio High School Football Team special mention. [...] By {{the time he was}} a junior, he was being recruited by both Ohio State, the local school, and Michigan, where his father played. As a senior who bench pressed [...] and squatted , he was regarded as Central Ohio's most sought after high school football recruit. [...] As a result, he was selected to participate as one of 78 players in the 2006 U.S. Army All-American Bowl where he started at left offensive guard for the East team. He was also selected to the Associated Press first-team Division I All-Central District and All-Ohio high school football teams as an offensive lineman.

[...] The Austin American-Statesman viewed the song as a [...] "dramatic closer". Arion Berger of Rolling Stone praised the song's production and the harmony that 98 Degrees' contributed. Chuck Campbell of The Daily News was also positive stating the song was a [...] "grandiose" [...] album-closer. Steve Jones of USA Today wrote that Carey excelled in the song. Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted that Carey found solace in the song. Anthony Johnson, also of the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote that the track is a [...] "surefire winner". However, a few other critics deemed the song as forgettable. Dan DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer dismissed the song as a [...] "colorless quality romance". Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times was also negative in his review, calling it as an [...] "overwrought ballad" [...] and wrote it was un-listenable. Dara Cook of MTV Southeast Asia [...] named the song as [...] "a big-production tragicomedy of hilarious histrionics and absurdly dramatic lyrics." [...] While reviewing Carey's compilation The Ballads (2009), Chuck Campbell of The Press of Atlantic City wrote {{that at some point}} in Carey's career, the quality her songs got [...] "iffier" [...] and commented that [...] "Thank God I Found You" [...] is such an example. He {{went on to say that}} the song was a [...] "trifle". In 2005 Andrew Unterberger of Stylus gave a negative review, writing the song was [...] "a sub-par, extremely lazy example of an artist reaching the top spot almost solely on reputation." [...] He wrote that the song would have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Carey's career. At the 43rd Grammy Awards held in February2001, the song was nominated in the category of the Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals, but lost to B.B.

40|$|Sentence is an {{important}} element in text processing. Period is one of symbols that marks <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a sentence.

This research uses the artificial neural network to build a system to resolve the ambiguity, i. e., the system can automatically determine whether a period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentence or not.
