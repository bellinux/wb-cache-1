5000|$|Harry Muir Kurtzworth, who was Fine Art Curator for the Los Angeles County Museum of History, Art and Architecture from 1930 to 1932 {{seems to}} {{be the first one to}} {{establish}} the term Tonal Impressionism which he used to describe paintings done in the Tonalist manner with simplified compositions, a limited but which utilized the brighter, more chromatic palette of Impressionism. He titled an exhibition he curated [...] "Tonal Impressionism." [...] This was held at the Los Angeles Art Association Gallery at the Los Angeles Central Library in June 1937. The artists he included were Charles Bensco, Frank Tolles Chamberlin, Alson Clark, Clyde Forsyth, Ralph Holmes, Thodore Lukits, J. Mason Reeves, and Seymour Thomas. Kurtzworth's concept was that these painters painted subjects that the Tonalists would have favored, but by painting with a palette without the earth tones many of the earlier painters used, the result became quite different. The large body of work the California artist Theodore Lukits did in the pastel medium or the hundreds of moonlit scenes painted by the Western painter Frank Tenney Johnson, may <b>best</b> <b>exemplify</b> this approach. <b>These</b> artists both painted nocturnes, but they are dominated by a blue palette, clearly derived from the colored shadows of Impressionism.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the representation of}} home movies in UK and US feature fiction films released between 1939 - 2013. For {{the purposes of the}} thesis home movies are defined as a subset of amateur (i. e. non-professional) film concerned with the representation of home and family and intended for domestic consumption. Home movies are further distinguished from home video and domestic productions recorded digitally referring specifically to films shot on, or connoting, small-gauge film. Drawing on James Moran’s notion of the ‘imaginary medium’ (There’s No Place Like Home Video, 2002) and the scholarship on the Imaginary in media, this thesis advances the concept of the ‘home movie imagination’ to describe the way in which cinema constructs home movies in the process of representation. Using textual analysis, this thesis identifies a series of shifts in cinematic depictions of home movies. Accordingly, each case study chapter focuses on a selection of examples which <b>best</b> <b>exemplify</b> <b>these</b> transitions and continuing trends. Placing cinematic home movies {{in the context of the}} histories of amateur film and small-gauge technology, this thesis demonstrates that home movies in fiction films should not be perceived as a reflection on developments of the technology, but studied specifically as fictional stylisations. The first chapter explores the emergence of home movies as a motif in feature fiction films, interrogating the technology’s pervasive association with wealth and spectacle in films released between 1939 - 1949. The second elaborates on these concerns, observing an incongruity between cinema’s continued affiliation of home movies with affluence and the developments in the social history of amateur filmmaking following the Second World War. Chapter Three looks at films released between 1964 - 1980, investigating the dual role of home movies deployed as sentimental reminders of lost familial cohesion and a tool to challenge the family ideal. Chapter Four focuses on the adaptations of Thomas Harris’ novel Red Dragon (1981) — Manhunter (Michael Mann, 1986), Red Dragon (Brett Ratner, 2002) — charting the impact which the advent of home video had on the representation of cinematic home movies. Home movie obsolescence is explored further in Chapter Five which interrogates the transition of home movies from an aim to memory (prop) to texture of memory (aesthetic). The final chapter focuses on the depiction of home movies in Super 8 (2011) and Frankenweenie (2012), investigating the nostalgia which they express towards the materiality of small-gauge technology. This thesis argues that home movies in feature fiction film constitute a unique, and widely overlooked, object of study. As films-within-films they frequently function as a self-reflexive device, a tool for filmmakers to reflect on their art. However, they are also specifically a domestic technology, focusing an inquiry into the role which media and mediation play in the cinematic construction of family narratives. Exploring the ways in which cinema constructs home movies in the process of representation the home movie imagination offers an innovative approach for studying the depiction of domestic moving image technologies, one which recognises their character as stylisations and responds to their historical variability...|$|R
