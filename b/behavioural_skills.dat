Behavior change was qualified by significantly decreased HbA 1 C in the experimental group, and the weight loss either was not significant, the high effect size in the experimental group revealed the impact of intervention on decreasing the weight. The self-care of glucose control (self monitoring), and foot care, also were more than the control group but the differences were not statistically significant.

50|$|More recently, Gordon Muir Giles {{has been}} {{reporting}} on interventions {{for persons with}} acquired neurological impairments and behaviour disorder. Beginning in the 1980s applied behaviour analysis principles were introduced for use with persons with TBI. By the late 1990s however it was recognised that up {{to a third of}} persons with TBI and behaviour disorder were unable to make use of standard behavioural interventions. Non-aversive approaches to behaviour disorder after TBI are consistent with concepts in psychiatric rehabilitation and positive behavioural supports in work with persons with mental retardation but were developed independently from them. The interventions stress a philosophy of normalisation, respect, non-confrontation, positive engagement, support, and functional and <b>behavioural</b> <b>skill</b> development. The approach is based on the observation that much of the behavioural disregulation is hostile/irritable aggression and not instrumental in nature. The interventions attempt to reduce environmental stressors and instigations to aggression and to use inclusion and positive engagement to reduce the frequency of aggressive behaviour. Evidence is currently limited to small-scale proof of concept designs and the approaches have not been subjected to randomised controlled investigations.|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the current {{evidence on the}} effects of yoga interventions on various components of mental and physical health, by focussing on the evidence described in review articles. Collectively, these reviews suggest a number of areas where yoga may well be beneficial, but more research is required for virtually all of them to firmly establish such benefits. The heterogeneity among interventions and conditions studied has hampered the use of meta-analysis as an appropriate tool for summarizing the current literature. Nevertheless, there are some meta-analyses which indicate beneficial effects of yoga interventions, and there are several randomized clinical trials (RCT’s) of relatively high quality indicating beneficial effects of yoga for pain-associated disability and mental health. Yoga may well be effective as a supportive adjunct to mitigate some medical conditions, but not yet a proven stand-alone, curative treatment. Larger-scale and more rigorous research with higher methodological quality and adequate control interventions is highly encouraged because yoga may have potential to be implemented as a beneficial supportive/adjunct treatment that is relatively cost-effective, may be practiced at least in part as a self-care behavioral treatment, provides a life-long <b>behavioural</b> <b>skill,</b> enhances self-efficacy and self-confidence and is often associated with additional positive side effects...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Industrial Pyschology) The {{critical}} labour {{situation in}} South Africa makes industrial peace absolutely vital. In addition, industrial peace creates a healthy climate, both for productivity in {{companies and the}} economic progress of a country. The South African economy has, since the twenties, been oppressed by industrial unrest. The strikes of 1920 and the Soweto unrest of 1976 are good examples of this. In spite of these critical situations, a very narrow—minded view of industrial relations prevails. The only factors which, to date, have received any real attention are political/ legislative or economic in nature. In addition, these factors cannot be manipulated {{by the majority of}} people in any organisation or in the country — they are factors which are handled by top management or the Government. The levels of management most in contact with workers on the floor, are therefore not represented in the framework for improvement of industrial relations. The objective of this research is to build a more comprehensive framework for the improvement of industrial relations. Intensive study has highlighted the fact that three <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills,</b> namely empathy, flexibility and judgement appear to have a considerable influence on the relations between manager and worker. These <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> are manifested in communication in the management process and in the following key behavioural areas: (a) Listen and react consistently and fairly. (b) Continuous feedback: Follow—up date and action. Constructive criticism. Maintain or build self esteem. (c) Encourage the subordinate to participate in situations with which he is familiar and which affect him. the subordinate in unfamiliar situations. Inform the subordinate about situations which affect him. With the use of a questionnaire, it was established that these key behavioural areas and communication between workers in all racial groups are seen to be significantly more important in relationships between manegement and worker. It was also found that management training in planfling, organisation, control, leadership and communication, based on the <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> and key behavioural areas, had a very positive effect on all the key behavioural areas and communication. Although this effect was seen by the total group to be considerable, in the case of two individual racial groups, i. e. Whites and Asians, it was not considered to be significant. This tendency is, however, explained by the time Epread of the training in the company where this research was carried out. Generally, therefore, it appears that scientific management practices, namely <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> and key behavioural areas, have a considerable influence on industrial relations and that management training has a significant contribution to make to its improvement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Successful {{antiretroviral}} {{treatment is}} dependent on sustaining high rates of adherence. In the southern African context, {{only a handful of}} studies (both quantitative and qualitative) have looked at the determinants including a health behaviour theory of adherence to antiretroviral therapy. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess factors including the information, motivation and <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> model (IMB) contributing to antiretroviral (ARV) adherence six months after commencing ARVs at three public hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Methods Using systematic sampling, 735 HIV-positive patients were selected prior to commencing on ART from outpatient departments from three hospitals and followed-up at six months and interviewed with a questionnaire. Results A good proportion of patients were found to be adherent using both adherence instruments (visual analog scale = VAS 82. 9 %; Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group = AATCG 70. 8 %). After adjusting for significant socio-economic variables, both the VAS and the dose, schedule and food adherence indicator found levels of adherence amongst urban residents to be almost 3 times greater than that of rural residents. After adjusting for health-related variables, for both indicators better adherence was associated with low depression and poorer adherence was associated with poor environmental factors. Adjusted odds ratios for adherence when taking into account different behavioural variables were for both adherence indicators, discrimination experiences were associated with lower adherence, and higher scores in adherence information and <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> were associated with higher adherence. For the VAS adherence indicator, higher social support scores were associated with higher adherence. For the dose, schedule and food adherence indicator, using herbal medicines for HIV was associated with lower adherence. Conclusion For the patients in this study, particularly those not living in urban areas, additional support may be needed to ensure patients are able to attend appointments or obtain their medications more easily. Adherence information and <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> as part of the IMB model should be strengthened to improve adherence. Further psychological support is also required and patients' perceived need for ARTs should be routinely assessed. </p...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a preschool}} parent enrichment programme to assess if child and parent {{involvement in the}} programme facilitated the children's subsequent school adjustment. Also examined were the programme's effects on parent-child relationships. Participants were 56 Junior-Senior Kindergarten and Grade One students from one elementary school. Parent participants were 12 parents from the preschool parent enrichment programme, 6 parents whose children had attended other preschool programmes, and 6 parents whose children had remained at home prior to school. Five elementary teachers and both nursery school teachers from the parent enrichment programme also participated. Measures used included the Florida Key to assess children's inferred self-concept as learner and four subscales (relating, asserting, coping and investing), and interviews to assess parent and teacher perceptions. Findings {{indicated that there was}} little difference between parent and teacher perceptions about children who had attended a preschool programme. Both groups showed improved social, emotional, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>skill</b> development, together with increased self-esteem, and the ability to cope with separation from their parents. This enabled children to make the transition from preschool to primary school more successful. Children from the parent enrichment programme were not readily identifiable in terms of the profile promulgated for disadvantaged children. The Florida Key showed a main effect for the coping subscale, indicating that children from the parent enrichment programme may show more confidence in their abilities, and seek assistance from teachers than children who had no preschool experience. The parent enrichment programme appeared to have the biggest impact on the parents. Parents reported improved relationships with their children, increased confidence and self-esteem, as well as improved parenting and general life skills. The implications for short-term gains for children from this type of programme are better readiness for school, more positive self-esteem, improved social behaviour, and a higher achievement motivation. The long-term gains for children are predicted to be fewer special education placements, less grade retention, and a lower dropout rate from school. The short-term gains for parents are better social support networks," greater self-confidence, better interactions with children, and improved parenting skills. The long-term benefits may be an increased motivation to continue education, gain employment, and less family breakdown and abuse...|$|R

Direct observations of parent/child teaching interactions provided measures of parents 2 ̆ 7 ability to implement <b>behavioural</b> teaching <b>skills</b> and measures of the generality of these skills {{across a variety of}} child tasks.;Although all parents showed marked increases in their ability to effectively implement <b>behavioural</b> teaching <b>skills</b> in an easy target task during basic training, different parents showed different patterns of generalized teaching to non-target child tasks. During self-management training, parents who had not yet generalized accurate teaching to all non-target tasks did so, while parents who had already demonstrated generalized teaching with certain tasks often showed additional increases. Changes in children 2 ̆ 7 s correct responding to parental teaching generally parallelled changes in parent behaviour. Changes in parent and child behaviour were maintained over a 4 -month follow-up period. Parents also demonstrated high rates of accurate teaching with new child tasks in the home setting, up to 5 months following the termination of training. Pretraining measures of parent stress were significantly correlated with parent and child behaviour change. Overall, parent satisfaction with the training program was very high.;It was postulated that the self-management procedures were successful because they promoted the transfer of stimulus control from the parent trainer to the parent.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to apply the Information, Motivation and <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Skills</b> (IMB) model in a school-based {{programme}} for the reduction of HIV-risk behaviour among adolescents in South Africa. The study also aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of the model in improving levels of information, motivation to act upon the information, and imparting <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> aimed at reducing HIV-risk behaviour in high school adolescent learners. Prior to the main study, a preliminary study was conducted to identify existing and prior intervention initiatives targeting HIV-risk behaviour within the schools in Alexandra township, Johannesburg. This was a qualitative study in which participating learners from two secondary schools reported on the HIV and AIDS education they were exposed to prior to the main study and intervention. The study sample consisted of 259 Grade 11 learners of which 123 were from School 1 (ES) and 136 from School 2 (CS). The findings from the preliminary study indicate that, while much HIV/AIDS education was done through the LoveLife campaigns, important gaps still existed in the levels of HIV/AIDS information, motivation and <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills</b> among the learners in the participating schools. The main study was quantitative in nature, and involved the same sample as the preliminary study. Data was collected with the use of a questionnaire adapted from the Teen Health Survey instrument. School 1 (ES) was the Experimental group, while School 2 (CS) was the Control group. A baseline assessment (Time 1) was conducted at both schools. This assessment was followed by a 3 -week HIV/AIDS intervention programme at School 1 (ES) which focused on HIV/AIDS information, motivation and <b>behavioural</b> <b>skills.</b> A post-test (Time 2) was carried out at both schools. The intervention at School 1 (ES) was then repeated at School 2 (CS). This was followed by another post-test (Time 3) at both schools. A final test (Time 4) was done at both schools. This was followed by another post-test (Time 3) at both schools. A final test (Time 4) was done at both schools. Data was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA including univariate ANOVA and paired t-tests. The results show significant increases in information across time for both schools. However, while there was clear change, it was not directly linked to the intervention. Overall estimates for all three variables, for instance, indicate that the mean scores at School 2 (CS) rose at Time 2, despite the absence of the intervention between Times 1 and 2 at that school. The fluctuating pattern of mean scores further attests to the deviation of the mean scores from the hypothesized pattern. In some of these fluctuations, the results showed the same trend for both groups, irrespective of the difference in the timing of the intervention. It is recommended, among other things, that when applied in the South African context, the IMB model should be used along with other HIV/AIDS prevention strategies to incorporate the social, cultural, economic and other structural challenges faced by learners...|$|E

Overall, children evidenced improvements in social skills, problem behaviours, or externalizing behaviours (Reliable Change Indices [RCI] = - 0. 27 to 3. 29). Moreover, knowledge of behavioural principles increased significantly for two parents at posttest when compared to pretest (RCI = 1. 25 to 3. 47). Also, parents used more praise statements, fewer critical statements, and fewer no-opportunity commands at posttest than at pretest. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings, limitations of this study, and future research directions are discussed...|$|R

The social participation construct is proposed by the World Health Organization, which in 2001 published the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.

In this chapter will be presented programmes which can be {{defined in terms of}} <b>behavioural</b> social <b>skill</b> training (SST) that can actually produce changes in the quality and frequency of the social behaviours shown by the individual who participate in the training. This requires considerable involvement from significant others. The interventions described took place in environment where specific activities in favour of inclusion had been carried out, where school and non school participants were able to implement specific operation in favour of “generalization”...|$|R
