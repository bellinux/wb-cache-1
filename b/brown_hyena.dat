5|$|The species dwells in semi-deserts, savannah, open woodland, dense dry woodland, and mountainous forests up to 4,000m in altitude. It {{is scarce}} or absent in {{tropical}} rainforests and coastal areas. Its preferred habitats in west Africa include the Guinea and Sudan savannahs, and is absent in the belt of dense coastal forest. In the Namib Desert, {{it occurs in}} riverine growth along seasonal rivers, the sub-desertic pro-Namib and the adjoining inland plateau. In ideal habitats, the spotted hyena outnumbers other large carnivores, including other hyena species. However, the striped and <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> occur at greater densities than the spotted species in desert and semi-desert regions. Population densities based on systematic censuses vary substantially, from 0.006 to 1.7 individuals per km2.|$|E
25|$|The list follows McKenna and Bells Classification of Mammals for prehistoric genera (1997) and Wozencraft (2005) in Wilson and Reeders Mammal Species of the World for extant genera. The percrocutids are, in {{contrast}} to McKenna and Bell's classification, not included as a subfamily into the Hyaenidae, but as the separate family Percrocutidae (though they are generally grouped as sister-taxa to hyenas). Furthermore, the living <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> and its closest extinct relatives {{are not included in}} the genus Pachycrocuta, but in the genus Hyaena. The Protelinae (aardwolves) are not treated as a separate subfamily, but included in the Hyaeninae.|$|E
25|$|The {{species may}} have evolved from H. namaquensis of Pliocene Africa. Striped hyena fossils {{are common in}} Africa, with records going {{back as far as}} the Middle Pleistocene and even to the Villafranchian. As fossil striped hyenas are absent from the Mediterranean region, {{it is likely that the}} species is a {{relatively}} late invader to Eurasia, having likely spread outside Africa only after the extinction of spotted hyenas in Asia at the end of the last glacial period. The striped hyena occurred for some time in Europe during the Pleistocene, having been particularly widespread in France and Germany. It also occurred in Montmaurin, Hollabrunn in Austria, the Furninha Cave in Portugal and the Genista Caves in Gibraltar. The European form was similar in appearance to modern populations, but was larger, being comparable in size to the <b>brown</b> <b>hyena.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> are {{primarily}} scavengers {{the bulk of}} whose diet consists of carcasses killed by larger predators, but they may supplement their diet with rodents, insects, eggs, fruit and fungi (the desert truffle Kalaharituber pfeilii). They are however poor hunters, and live prey makes up only {{a small proportion of}} their diet: in the southern Kalahari, species such as springhare, springbok lambs, bat-eared foxes and korhaan species constitute only 4.2% of their overall diet, while on the Namib coast, cape fur seal pups compose 2.9% of their food. They have an exceptional sense of smell and can locate carcasses kilometers away. <b>Brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> are aggressive scavengers, frequently appropriating the kills of black-backed jackals, cheetahs, and leopards. Single <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> may charge at leopards with their jaws held wide open and can tree adult male leopards; they have been observed treeing leopards even when no kill was in contention. In the Kalahari Desert, <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> are often the dominant mammalian carnivores present because of this dominance behavior and the relative scarcity of lions, spotted hyenas, and packs of African wild dogs. In areas where they overlap, <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> may on rare occasions be killed by spotted hyenas and lions.|$|R
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{dominate}} other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. <b>Brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> encounter spotted hyenas in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually {{has the effect of}} seemingly confusing spotted hyenas, which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped hyenas in the Serengeti.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> are {{distinguished}} from other species by their long shaggy coat and pointed ears, a dark brown {{coat and a}} short tail. Their legs are striped brown and white, and adults have a distinct cream-colored fur ruff around their necks. Erectile hairs up to 305 mm in length cover the neck and back and bristles during agonistic behavior. Body length is 144 cm on average {{with a range of}} 130 - 160 cm. Shoulder height is 70 - 80 cm and the tail is 25 - 35 cm long. Unlike the larger spotted hyena, there are no sizable differences between the sexes, although males may be slightly larger than females. An average adult male weighs 40.2 - 43.7 kg, while an average female weighs 37.7 - 40.2 kg. <b>Brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> have powerful jaws. Young animals can crack the leg bones of springboks within five minutes of birth, though this ability deteriorates with age and dental wear. The skulls of <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> are larger than those of the more northern striped hyena, and their dentition is more robust, indicating a less generalized dietary adaptation.|$|R
25|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (Crocuta crocuta) diverged from the striped and <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> 10 million years ago. Its direct {{ancestor}} was the Indian Crocuta sivalensis, which lived during the Villafranchian. Ancestral spotted hyenas probably developed social behaviours {{in response to}} increased pressure from rivals on carcasses, thus forcing them to operate in teams. Spotted hyenas evolved sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars, therefore they {{did not need to}} wait for their prey to die, as is the case for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's turf. Spotted hyenas spread from their original homeland during the Middle Pleistocene, and quickly colonised a very wide area from Europe, to southern Africa and China. With the decline of grasslands 12,500 years ago, Europe experienced a massive loss of lowland habitats favoured by spotted hyenas, and a corresponding increase in mixed woodlands. Spotted hyenas, under these circumstances, would have been outcompeted by wolves and humans, who were as much at home in forests as in open landsand in highlands as in lowlands. Spotted hyena populations began to shrink after roughly 20,000 years ago, completely disappearing from Western Europe between 11 and 14 thousand years ago, and earlier in some areas.|$|E
500|$|Fur colour varies greatly {{and changes}} with age. Unlike the fur of the striped and <b>brown</b> <b>hyena,</b> {{that of the}} spotted hyena {{consists}} of spots rather than stripes and is much shorter, lacking the well defined spinal mane of the former two species. The base colour generally is a pale greyish-brown or yellowish-grey on which an irregular pattern of roundish spots is superimposed {{on the back and}} hind quarters. The spots, which are of variable distinction, may be reddish, deep brown or almost blackish. The spots vary in size, even on single individuals, but are commonly [...] in diameter. A less distinct spot pattern is present on the legs and belly but not on the throat and chest. A set of five, pale and barely distinct bands replace the spots on the back and sides of the neck. A broad, medial band is present {{on the back of the}} neck, and is lengthened into a forward facing crest. The crest is mostly reddish-brown in colour. The crown and upper part of the face is brownish, save for a white band above both eyes, though the front of the eyes, the area around the rhinarium, the lips and the back portion of the chin are all blackish. The limbs are spotted, though the feet vary in colour, from light brown to blackish. The fur is relatively sparse and consists of two hair types; moderately fine underfur (measuring [...] ) and long, stout bristle hairs (...) [...] European Paleolithic rock art depicting the species indicates that the Eurasian populations retained the spots of their modern-day African counterparts.|$|E

50|$|In the Kalahari, 80% of a <b>brown</b> <b>hyena's</b> {{activity}} time {{is spent}} at night, searching for food in an area on spanning 31.1 km on average, with territories of 54.4 km having been recorded. They may cache excess food in shrubs or holes and recover it within 24 hours.|$|R

50|$|The Kalahari has {{a number}} of game reserves—Tswalu Kalahari, Southern Africa's largest private game reserve, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (the world's second largest {{wildlife}} park), Khutse Game Reserve and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. Animals that live in the region include <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas,</b> the Kalahari lion, meerkats, giraffes, common warthogs, jackals, chacma baboons, and several species of antelope (including the eland, gemsbok, springbok, hartebeest, steenbok, kudu, and duiker), and many species of birds and reptiles.|$|R
50|$|In {{areas where}} the black-backed jackal is {{sympatric}} with the larger side-striped jackal, the former species aggressively drives out the latter from grassland habitats into woodlands. This is unique among carnivores, as it is more common for larger species to displace smaller ones. Black-backed jackal pups are vulnerable to African golden wolves, ratels, and spotted and <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas.</b> Adults have few natural predators, save for leopards, caracals, African wild dogs, and martial eagles.|$|R
50|$|Subordinate {{individuals}} often {{demonstrate a}} huge reproductive disadvantage in dominance hierarchies. Among <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas,</b> subordinate females have less opportunity to rear young in the communal den, and thus had decreased survival of offspring {{when compared to}} high-ranking individuals. Subordinate males have far less copulations with females compared to the high-ranking males. In African wild dogs which live in social packs separated into male and female hierarchies, top ranking alpha females have been observed to produce 76-81% of all litters.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> inhabits desert areas, semi-desert, {{and open}} {{woodland}} savannahs. It can survive close to urban areas by scavenging. The <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> favors rocky, mountainous areas, as they provide shade {{and it is}} not dependent on the ready availability of water sources for frequent drinking. Home ranges are 233 to 466 km2 in size.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> (Hyaena brunnea, {{formerly}} Parahyaena brunnea), {{also called}} strandwolf, is {{a species of}} hyena found in Namibia, Botswana, western and southern Zimbabwe, southern Mozambique and South Africa. It is currently the rarest species of hyena. The largest remaining <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> population {{is located in the}} southern Kalahari Desert and coastal areas in Southwest Africa.|$|E
50|$|Hyaena is a genus {{comprising}} two of {{the living}} species of hyenas: the striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) from western Asia and northern Africa and the <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> (Hyaena brunnea) from southern Africa. The <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> has sometimes been placed in a separate genus Parahyaena, or even included in the otherwise fossil genus Pachycrocuta, but recent sources have tended to place it in Hyaena. The brown hyena's skull is larger {{than that of the}} striped hyena. The male <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> is slightly larger than the female, while the sexes of the striped hyena are equally sized. Both species are smaller than the spotted hyena, but larger than the aardwolf. They are predominantly scavengers.|$|E
50|$|Subordinate {{individuals}} {{suffer a}} range of costs from dominance hierarchies, {{one of the most}} notable being reduced access to food sources. When a resource is obtained dominant individuals are first to feed as well as taking the longest time. Subordinates also lose out in shelter and nesting sites. <b>Brown</b> <b>hyenas,</b> which display defined linear dominance in both sexes, allow subordinate males and females decreased time of feeding at a carcass. In toque monkeys subordinates are often displaced from feeding sites by dominant males. Additionally, they are excluded from sleeping sites, and they suffer reduced growth and increased mortality.|$|R
50|$|The {{manifestation of}} intrasexual {{conflict}} {{can be observed}} in one of two systems. The social order can be either egalitarian or despotic. In a linear ranking system (often referred to as a pecking order), every member of the gender is recognized as either dominant or submissive relative to every other member, creating a linear distribution of rank. For example, groups of spotted <b>hyenas</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> both demonstrate linear dominance. In a despotic system, one member is considered dominant while all other members of the living group are equally submissive. Examples of despotic social systems are found in meerkat, gray wolf, gorilla, Neolamprologus pulcher, and African wild dog.|$|R
50|$|During the Middle Paleolithic Period, humans dwelt {{in caves}} at the Jeommal Site near Jecheon {{and at the}} Durubong Site near Cheongju. From these two cave sites, fossil remains of rhinoceros, cave bear, <b>brown</b> bear, <b>hyena</b> and {{numerous}} deer (Pseudaxi gray var.), all extinct species, were excavated.|$|R
50|$|The global {{population}} of <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> {{is estimated at}} less than 10,000 individuals. They are listed as near threatened in the IUCN Red List. The major threat to brown Hyenas is human persecution based on the mistaken belief that they are harmful to livestock. Farmers will find hyenas scavenging on livestock carcasses and wrongly assume that hyenas have killed their property. <b>Brown</b> <b>hyena</b> body parts are also occasionally used for traditional medicines and rituals, but the species is not as sought after as the spotted hyena. The <b>brown</b> <b>hyena</b> is not in high demand for trophy hunting. The only major predator of hyenas is the African lion. Hyena cubs are especially susceptible to lion predation.|$|E

50|$|Cry of the Kalahari (1984) is an autobiographical book {{detailing}} {{two young}} American zoologists, Mark and Delia Owens, and their experience studying wildlife in the Kalahari desert in Botswana in the mid-1970s. There they {{lived and worked}} for seven years in an unexplored area named Deception Valley in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. With no roads and no people and the nearest civilization eight hours away they had only {{each other and the}} animals they studied as company, most of which had never seen humans before. Their research focused mainly on lions, <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas,</b> jackals and other African carnivores. Cry of the Kalahari is the personal story of the Owens' encounters with these and a myriad of other animals and depicts their own struggle to live and work in such an inhospitable and unforgiving environment.|$|R
5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} {{mothers with}} young cubs, are highly vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large carnivores who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to sturdier carnivores such as lions, leopards, spotted and <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas,</b> and wild dogs. Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time. In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped not just with those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other carnivores, such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|R
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, <b>brown</b> <b>hyenas</b> and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast ice for protection.|$|R
50|$|The large {{carnivores}} {{that can}} be found in the reserve include the Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatis), Leopard (Panthera pardus), Lion (Panthera leo), <b>Brown</b> <b>Hyena</b> (Hyaena brunnea), Spotted Hyena (Crocuta crocuta), and African Wild Dog (Lycaon pictus).|$|E
