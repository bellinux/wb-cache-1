5|$|During World War II, {{the trophy}} {{was held by}} 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.|$|E
5|$|The {{air traffic}} control at Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over {{the responsibility for the}} radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the air field.|$|E

25|$|The summit overlooks Glencoyne, {{but being}} {{set back from}} both the {{southern}} and eastern sides <b>of</b> the fell <b>better</b> <b>views</b> may be had from other places. The cairn above Black Crag, or the top of Heron Pike, both give <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> Ullswater, and a well-used sheep path above the crags along {{the south side of}} the fell gives the best <b>views</b> <b>of</b> upper Glenridding, backed by Catstye Cam and Helvellyn.|$|R
25|$|The Michael Simmons Activity Center {{was added}} to the Recreation East complex in 2005. This {{building}} has added a new dimension to the practices and race by providing officials a central place to score the race and fans to have bleachers for <b>better</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>of</b> the competition.|$|R
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} {{the engineers}} struggled with {{was how to}} deal with radioactive contamination. Once the canyons began processing irradiated slugs, the machinery would become so radioactive that it would be unsafe for humans ever to come in contact with it. The engineers therefore had to devise methods to allow for the replacement of any component via remote control. They came up with a modular cell concept, which allowed major components to be removed and replaced by an operator sitting in a heavily shielded overhead crane. This method required early practical application of two technologies that later gained widespread use: Teflon, used as a gasket material, and closed-circuit television, used to give the crane operator a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the process.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Joan of Arc, Etty's health continued to deteriorate. He continued to paint and exhibit, but his retirement plans grew firmer. In April 1846 he {{bought a house in}} Coney Street, central York, as a retirement home, and in December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy. Following structural alterations to give him a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September of that year, although he retained his London apartments. His move from London caused some consternation among that city's models, who were losing one of their most regular customers, as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the All England Regulations for the Management of Prize Meetings, the draw for the 22 entrants was made on Saturday, 7 July 1877, at 3:30p.m. in the club's pavilion. H.T. Gillson had {{the distinction of being}} the first player in the history of modern tennis to be drawn for a tournament. The posts, nets and hand-stitched, flannel-covered India-rubber balls for the tournament were supplied by Jefferies & Co from Woolwich, while the rackets used were an adaptation of those used in real tennis, with a small and slightly lopsided head. The ball-boys kept the tennis balls, 180 of which were used during the tournament, in canvas wells. The umpires who were provided for the matches sat on chairs which in turn were placed on small tables of 18 inches height to give them a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the court.|$|E
50|$|Meerkats can {{be found}} here in their {{enclosure}}, which in 2013, was renovated to give the meerkats almost double the space that they had previously. Their new enclosure boasts a tall artificial termite mound upon which the meerkats like to do ‘sentry duty’. Ground level windows also enable young children <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the meerkats.|$|R
5000|$|Russell's {{depiction}} of perspective and depth are stiff and flat, and his images [...] "were appreciated {{more for their}} accurate representation than their artistic value." [...] However, most of his work is perfectly to scale, resembling control drawings, and Russell watercolors are some <b>of</b> the <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the mid-19th-century American whaling industry, until photography became available in the 1850s.|$|R
50|$|Fionn Bheinn is {{most often}} climbed {{from the village of}} Achnasheen to the south, with the normal route {{following}} the burn called Allt Achadh na Sine to the nose at Creagan nan Laogh, and then up the grassy slopes to the summit. An ascent or descent via the east ridge is also common, this route giving <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> {{the north side of the}} mountain.|$|R
5|$|She and Tony meet up {{with her}} Israeli friend, Adam Eshel (Damon Dayoub), who gives them {{information}} on Bodnar's whereabouts and intentions. Bodnar contacts Ziva on the computer, urging her to walk away. They are able to track his location but are unable to apprehend him as he disappears into a crowd. Later, they learn that he is planning {{to pick up the}} diamonds from an ally (Willem Van Der Vegt) at a night club. While waiting to intercept him, Tony dances with Ziva both to help her get a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the area and to calm her agitated state of mind. Bodnar seems to appear, but when Ziva approaches him, she is stunned to see that it is Ilan's brother, Yaniv (Iddo Goldberg).|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo DS's two screens {{act as one}} tall screen; however, in practice, this {{essentially}} {{just gives}} the player a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the surroundings and, save for one boss battle, (Hector the Reflector, where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle) only provides the benefit {{of being able to}} see more (above) and, when the player is on the top screen, below. The game does not make use of the bottom screen's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay, though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini-games. Each of DSs five worlds has two bosses, each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited. Most of the time, these are simply giant-sized versions of normal enemies, though some are more inventive.|$|E
5|$|The site of CenturyLink Field is the {{smallest}} of those developed for new NFL stadiums. The upper levels were cantilevered over the lower sections to fit within the limited space. Along with the angle of seats and {{the placement of the}} lower sections closer to the field, this provided a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the field than typically seen throughout the country and allowed for a 67,000-seat capacity. Space is available to increase the total capacity to 72,000 for special events. Included in the capacity are 111 suites and over 7,000 club seats. The stadium has 1,400 seats for those with disabilities and their companions located in various sections. In 2009 CenturyLink Field ranked 21st out of the 31stadiums in the NFL for total seating capacity.|$|E
50|$|On October 17, 2014 at the 1st Pangyo Techno Valley Festival, tragedy struck {{during a}} concert. Despite {{repeated}} safety warnings, {{a group of}} participants climbed {{on top of a}} ventilation grate to obtain a <b>better</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>of</b> the stage. The grate, covering an underground parking lot 10 metres (33 feet) down, gave way under the sheer weight of roughly 20-30 additional bodies. According to BBC News, 16 people were killed with an additional 11 injured.|$|R
50|$|At 91 m, the airport's {{air traffic}} control tower was the tallest {{standalone}} control tower in Canada upon its opening in 2013; compared to the previous tower, it has space for more {{air traffic control}}lers and is situated closer to {{the centre of the}} airport, giving controllers <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the airfield. Meanwhile, the headquarters of Canadian North as well as WestJet and its subsidiary WestJet Encore are located onsite. There are also two hotels on the airport property.|$|R
50|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, the open loggias around {{the ground floor}} were enclosed. Although the house {{was built in the}} floor plan shape of the letter E in honour of Queen Elizabeth, it is now missing its north-west wing. During the period of the 9th earl's ownership, and under the {{guidance}} of Capability Brown, the south front was raised to alter the roof line, and the north-west wing was demolished to allow <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the new parkland.|$|R
5|$|The two vessels were {{pounding}} {{each other}} at such close range, they also managed to collide with one another at five different times. By 11:00am Monitors supply of shot in the turret had been used up. With one of the hatches to the gun ports damaged and jammed shut she hauled off to shallow waters to resupply the turret and effect repairs to the damaged hatch, {{which could not be}} repaired. During the lull in the battle Worden climbed through the gun port out onto the deck to get a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the overall situation. Virginia, seeing Monitor turn away turned her attention to the Minnesota and fired shots that set the wooden vessel ablaze, also destroying the nearby tugboat Dragon. When the turret was resupplied with ammunition Worden returned to battle with only one gun in operation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E
25|$|He {{was well}} known for his batting technique, {{temperament}} and skill. He even experimented with a side-on batting stance, where one foot was placed {{at an angle to}} the crease, giving the body had a more open stance with a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the bowler.|$|E
5000|$|The ship {{sports a}} “flying bridge”, an {{additional}} deck directly above the main bridge with platforms extending to {{port and starboard}} to allow crew <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the ship’s approach to piers during docking manoeuvres. The flying bridge was not an original feature of the Jupiter; it was an innovation integral {{to the design of}} younger sister ship [...] (launched in September 1974) that was felt so useful it was retrofitted into Jupiter during her first annual refit.|$|R

The Devil's Path in the Greene County Catskills appears to the north on clear enough days. Some vineyards join the orchards along the road, reflecting a developing local wine industry. The campus of SUNY New Paltz starts to form a distinct skyline to the north, and to the east the ridgeline of Illinois Mountain complements the Shawangunks.|$|R
25|$|Increasing {{background}} illumination or using a pinhole to effectively decrease pupil diameter may allow {{a person to}} obtain a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> {{his or her own}} floaters.

25|$|The Invalidenfriedhof lay {{near the}} {{dividing}} line between East Berlin and West Berlin. Tombstones were removed from many graves in 1960, including Berthold's, so that communist border guards preventing escapes from East Berlin had a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the boundary. Berthold's stone disappeared. However, after Germany's reunification, private donors raised the funds for a simple marker {{to be placed on}} his grave in 2003.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that while serum or blood plasma levels follow the circadian rhythm or short term dietary changes, those within tissues themselves are more stable and give a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the availability of ascorbate within the organism. However, very few hospital laboratories are adequately equipped and trained to carry out such detailed analyses, and require samples to be analyzed in specialized laboratories.|$|E
50|$|An old airport beacon, {{now out of}} service, is on {{the highest}} point of the {{mountain}} and can be climbed for <b>better</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding terrain. It has been vandalized by many people writing their names and the dates they reached the summit. Some of the dates are as old as 1954. Evidence of power to the beacon is still present in the surrounding area. Old electrical wire is strewn about in various places, and rusted conduit is still present, along with boxes that contained breakers.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{redundant}} calculations in solving the decision problem, the positive mode and the negative mode are combined into one ideal mode, as the interval numbers are composed of upper- and lower-limits. The closer an alternative is to the ideal mode, the better it is. An alternative will be considered as <b>better</b> in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the index, when the standardized interval value of the efficiency index {{is closer to the}} interval [1, 1]. With the cost index, an alternative will be considered as <b>better</b> in <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the index, when the standardized interval value of the cost index is closer to the interval [0, 0].|$|R
2500|$|The top of Glenridding Dodd {{is a short}} ridge, with {{patches of}} heather, rocky knolls and marshy hollows.

For a low fell the view is [...] "delightful." [...] Beyond Glenridding are the claw-shaped end of Birkhouse Moor, and Keldas, its {{subsidiary}} top closer to the lake. Further south, the fells clustered around the valleys above Patterdale are seen.|$|R
25|$|Church restorations {{were also}} {{strongly}} influenced by the Oxford Movement, which advocated moving the centre of importance in the church from preaching to the sacrament of the Eucharist: from the pulpit to the altar. Consequences of this included moving the pulpit from a more central position {{to the side of}} the church, replacing box pews with open pews, creating a central aisle to give a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the altar, and the removal of galleries. Another consequence was that a larger chancel was required for the associated ritual.|$|E
25|$|In the laboratory, stratigraphers analyze {{samples of}} stratigraphic {{sections}} {{that can be}} returned from the field, such as those from drill cores. Stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface. Geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the subsurface, and stratigraphers often use computer programs {{to do this in}} three dimensions. Stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring {{on the surface of the}} Earth, interpret past environments, and locate areas for water, coal, and hydrocarbon extraction.|$|E
25|$|The {{summit is}} broad and too flat to allow good all round views. These are further {{restricted}} by the higher fells to the west, {{but there is}} a fine prospect to the Pennines and Howgill Fells. Walls and fences follow the ridges from Gatesgarth, Tarn Crag and Selside Pike, meeting near the summit. A small cairn is situated a little to the north. A <b>better</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> Mardale, and certainly a better foreground, can be seen from Artlecrag Pike. This subsidiary top a little to the north has two fine columnar cairns built from the nearby outcrop of flaky rocks.|$|E
50|$|For the 2007 Pan American Games, the gym was remodelled, {{relying on}} central air {{conditioning}} and adding a four-sided scoreboard, a new sound system, a dome which allows natural lighting during the day, comfortable seating, and adapting to all international requirements. As a result, the Maracanãzinho became a venue for the volleyball competitions of the 2007 Pan American Games and many other international competitions. After the renovations, {{the capacity of the}} arena was reduced from approximately 13,000 to 11,800 spectators. The arena is much more comfortable for spectators, as the field of vision has been increased for <b>better</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>of</b> the arena floor.|$|R
