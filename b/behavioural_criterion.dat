40|$|One {{hundred and}} eighty new women {{patients}} attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic answered the Eysenck personality questionnaire (EPQ) which measures psychoticism, extraversion, neuroticism, and a tendency to "fake good". These personality scores were correlated with the patients' attendance or non-attendance for their first review appointments. The {{results showed that the}} mean psychoticism scale scores of the 41 non-attenders was significantly higher than that of the 139 who kept their first appointment. This relation was confirmed using point biserial correlations. The mean scores of non-attenders on the other three EPQ scales were not significantly different from those of attenders, and none of the correlations between the other EPQ scales and this <b>behavioural</b> <b>criterion</b> was significant. The psychoticism scale is tentatively recommended for identifying women patients who may need special counselling about the importance of keeping their first review appointment...|$|E

In such networks, peers are heterogeneous in providing the services {{and they do not}} have the same competence of reliability. Therefore, it is necessary to estimate whether a peer is trustworthy or not for file sharing and other services. In this paper, we propose two fuzzy-based trustworthiness system for P 2 P communication in JXTA-overlay. System 1 has only one fuzzy logic controller (FLC) and uses four input parameters: mutually agreed behaviour (MAB), actual behaviour criterion (ABC), peer disconnections (PD) and number of uploads (NU) and the output is peer reliability (PR). System 2 has two FLCs. In FLC 1 use three input parameters: number of jobs (NJ), number of connections (NC) and connection lifetime (CL) and the output is actual <b>behavioural</b> <b>criterion</b> (ABC). We use ABC and reputation (R) as input linguistic parameters for FLC 2 and the output is peer reliability (PR). We evaluate the proposed systems by computer simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed systems have a good behaviour and can be used successfully to evaluate the reliability of the new peer connected in JXTA-overlay.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 41) On {{the basis}} of the Rosen and Komorita findings demonstrating high correlations between Action Potential (AP) and <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Criterion</b> (BC), it was hypothesized that Ss who scored low, medium, and high on the AP index will also score low, medium, and high in their overt behaviour, respectively. Two hundred and eighty-four Ss from California State University (Northridge) participated in this study. Ss were classified as low, medium, and high on three assessed variables: (1) Action Potential(AP),(2) Internal-???External Scale (IE), and (3) Anomie Scale (A). The AP index consisted of measures of intention to act (I) and perceived effectiveness of act ion (E) and "was obtained by weighting each response to the I scale with the effectiveness rating for that item, and summing the product across all items. " (Rosen and Komorita, 1971, p. 193). The IE scale as developed by Rotter, differentiates people who believe what happens to them is contingent on their own behaviour and those who feel that what happens to them is determined by chance or forces outside their control. Srole's A scale measures the individual's perception of social environment and his place in this environment...|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} an animal’s memory {{to qualify as}} ‘episodic-like,’ it must meet three <b>behavioural</b> <b>criteria</b> {{reflecting}} the content, structure and flexibility of the memory. Content refers to recalling what happened, where it happened, and when it happened {{on the basis of}} a specific past experience. Structure refers to forming an integrated what-where-when representation, and flexibility refers to being able to use the information in a versatile way. In order for an animal to meet these <b>behavioural</b> <b>criteria</b> then, they must be able to not only form what-where-when memories, but integrate the what, where and when of the event into an integrated framework. The assessment of episodic-like memory must rely on these behavioural characteristics because animals do not have the language capabilities to participate in the episodic memory tests developed for humans.|$|R

Our work attempts to reproduce an increase in rat cerebral ammonia level, study the hyperamonemic animals' performance of two learning tasks, an allocentric (ALLO) and a cue guided (CG) task, and elucidate the contribution of hyperammonemia to the differential energy requirements of the brain limbic system regions involved in these tasks. To assess these goals, four groups of animals were used: a control (CHA) CG group (n = 10), a CHA ALLO group (n = 9), a hyperammonemia (HA) CG group (n = 7), and HA ALLO group (n = 8). Oxidative metabolism of the target brain regions were assessed by histochemical labelling of cytochrome oxidase (C. O.). The behavioural results revealed that the hyperammonemic rats were not able to reach the <b>behavioural</b> <b>criterion</b> in either of the two tasks, in contrast to the CHA groups. The metabolic brain consumption revealed increased C. O. activity in the anterodorsal thalamus when comparing the HA ALLO group with the CHA ALLO group. Significant differences between animals trained in the CG task were observed in the prelimbic, infralimbic, parietal, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, the anterolateral and anteromedial striatum, and the basolateral and central amygdala. Our findings may provide fresh insights to reveal how the differential damage to the brain limbic structures involved in these tasks differs according to the degree of task difficulty...|$|E
3000|$|The {{experiments}} reported offer {{direct evidence}} {{that in the}} standard class inclusion question the hypernym (A) has referential ambiguity (of the privative variety). Experiment 1 has shown that it can refer with an inclusive denotation to the superclass, but also with an exclusive denotation to the subclass that is {{not mentioned in the}} question, that is, the minor subclass B’. The main claim of this paper is that the interpretation of the hypernym is pragmatically determined {{as a function of the}} child’s perception of the aim of the standard task, which evolves with age. Depending on their level of development, children may or may not adopt spontaneously the interpretation that enables the experimenter to test their acquisition of the simple inclusion judgement. One interpretation (the exclusive one) does not offer this possibility. Consequently, experimenters who wish to know whether the younger children are capable of the simple inclusion judgement should attempt to disambiguate the hypernym and help interpret the question in such a way that the hypernym refers to the superclass, which is its intended meaning in the standard question; only then can it be considered that the children are put to a valid test. The results of experiments 2, 3, and 4 have shown that when one, or even better, two disambiguation procedures are applied, the children reach the critical <b>behavioural</b> <b>criterion</b> of inclusion three to four years earlier than is usually claimed in the literature, that is, as early as five years of age.

In this study, we intend to examine in particular the mechanisms through which job insecurity affects work performance, a criterion of central interest to management scholars. Drawing on the compatibility principle in attitude theory, we proposed that overall job attitude (job satisfaction and affective commitment) predicts <b>behavioural</b> <b>criteria</b> in response to job insecurity. In particular, according to social exchange theory and rational choice theory two predictions were compared: job insecurity can be a harmful stressor with negative strain reactions (behavioural withdrawal, low performance) or a challenge stressor that motivates employees to engage actively in actions coping with the threat (higher performance). A sample of 570 Italian employees were used to test the hypotheses derived from our framework. Results from structural equations provided support for the social exchange model, showing the negative influence of job insecurity (as hindrance stressor) on task and contextual performance, i. e. in-role and extra-role behaviours. status: publishe...|$|R

They can update their memory of the contents of a cache depending on whether or not they have emptied the cache site, and can also remember where another bird has hidden caches, suggesting that they encode rich representations of the caching event. They make temporal generalizations about when perishable items should degrade and also remember the relative time since caching when the same food is cached in distinct sites at different times. These results show that jays form integrated memories for the location, content and time of caching.
