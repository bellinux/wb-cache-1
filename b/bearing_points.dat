Upon a glass plate, fig. 43, placed over, but raised above {{a piece of}} white paper, so that shadows may not interfere, put two pieces of tinfoil a, b; connect one of these by an insulated wire c, or wire and string (301.) with the machine, and the other g, with the discharging train (292.) or the negative conductor; provide two pieces of fine platina wire, bent as in fig. 44, so that the part d, f shall be nearly upright, whilst the whole is resting on the three <b>bearing</b> <b>points</b> p, e, f place these as in fig. 43; the points p, n then become the decomposing poles.

If the oscillator is at least filled up to its <b>bearing</b> <b>points,</b> the same precisely defined volume always participates in the oscillation, thus the measured value of the sample’s mass can be used to calculate its density.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>point</b> <b>bearing</b> {{behavior}} of rock-socketed drilled shafts under axial loading is investigated by numerical analysis and a load transfer approach (q–w).

The emphasis is quantifying the <b>point</b> <b>bearing</b> mechanism by taking rock discontinuity into consideration based on field loading tests performed on 39 instrumented piles. A new hyperbolic q–w function is proposed considering the <b>point</b> <b>bearing</b> resistance influence factors, including rock mass discontinuity.

However, the table selection procedures are becoming rare with the evolution in computer-aided custom designs.|$|E
5000|$|In {{this style}} of rotisserie, balance is important. If the object to be cooked is far out of balance, it will impose a heavy load on the drive {{mechanism}} or cause the mechanism to fail to turn. Loose chicken legs or wings can also cause the mechanism to jam. For these two reasons, some skewering skill is required.High-end consumer ovens commonly come with a rotisserie (or allow the installation of a rotisserie as an option). In these cases, the motor drive mechanism is usually concealed within the oven. The rotisserie is used by removing the normal cooking racks; a special carrier {{may be needed to}} provide one or both <b>bearing</b> <b>points</b> for the spit.|$|E
5000|$|A {{roller screw}} is a {{mechanical}} actuator {{similar to a}} ball screw that uses rollers as the load transfer elements between nut and screw instead of balls. The rollers are typically threaded but may also be grooved depending on roller screw type. Providing more <b>bearing</b> <b>points</b> than ball screws within a given volume, roller screws can be more compact for a given load capacity while providing similar efficiency (75%-90%) at low to moderate speeds, and maintain relatively high efficiency at high speeds. Roller screws can surpass ball screws in regard to positioning precision, load rating, rigidity, speed, acceleration, and lifetime. Standard roller screw actuators can achieve dynamic load ratings above 130 tons of force (exceeded in single-unit actuator capacity only by hydraulic cylinders).|$|E

50|$|The {{most obvious}} sign {{that a person}} is {{suffering}} from pitted keratolysis is its classic appearance. The circular and shallow pits are the calling card of pitted keratolysis. The pits often overlap in places to produce larger areas of erosion. Occasionally these lesions present with a green or brown hue around and within the pits. These superficial erosions are found under the toes and on the soles of the feet, and especially at the pressure <b>bearing</b> <b>points</b> such as the heel. Both sides of the foot are usually equally effected. Pitted keratolysis is often linked to excessive sweating of the palms or soles (palmoplantar hyperhidrosis.) The bacterial digestion of the keratin results in a very foul odor, causing many of its sufferers great anxiety, especially in social situations. Thankfully, irritation is generally minimal, though occasionally burning, itching, and soreness are experienced with pitted keratolysis. The appearance of this condition’s characteristic lesions is much more pronounced when the affected area is wet.|$|E

40|$|Utilization time {{of maximum}} power losses (UTL) {{has been applied}} for {{determination}} of energy losses in power grids. UTL is a parameter allowing for accurate estimation of energy losses. Using the maximum load time for UTL determination, better results {{can be achieved by}} decomposing the load duration graph (LDG) into two parts: the base and the delta ones. Bearing in mind that the latter occupies a smaller area of the entire LDG, the goal is achieved, since the errors can be caused only by the inaccuracy of delta part calculation. Based on this method it is possible to calculate UTL directly from the load graph and to achieve the same accuracy as with the classical method and with the smaller number of load measurements needed. By modifying this method once again, we can estimate UTL from the load graph based on its <b>bearing</b> <b>points</b> which are bending and flex points of the load time curve. The load time graph is decomposed into columns, each of them being contained between two neighboring <b>bearing</b> <b>points.</b> The UTL of each column is calculated to obtain the total UTL, which is the sought for value. The UTL of a column takes into account the minimum load value within the column, the maximum load time and the UTL of its upper part, both of the last quantities depending on the degree of the load curve diversion from a straight line...|$|E

As {{the wheel and}} axle system rotates around its <b>bearings,</b> <b>points</b> on the circumference, or edge, of the wheel move faster than points on the circumference, or edge, of the axle. Therefore, a force applied {{to the edge of}} the wheel must be less than the force applied {{to the edge of the}} axle, because power is the product of force and velocity.|$|R

The load case corresponding to the car crash seat pull test according to ECE-R 14 standard has been applied for selection of material savings and for additional reinforcement.

Glass panels are parts of the structural façade of the Fontanarossa International Airport of Catania (Italy).

Two different kinds of tests were carried-out, cyclic and monotonic, able to reproduce the serviceability and the ultimate conditions of the glass panels when subjected to the coupled effects of dead load and horizontal forces, the latter reproducing the wind action. Results obtained focused the high performances of structural glasses for structural applications (structural façade) characterised by multiple and progressive failure that did not interest the <b>bearing</b> <b>points</b> neither the zone of the shell near the supports.
