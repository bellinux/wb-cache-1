This paper aims at presenting the E-Gen system (Automatic Job Offer Processing system for Human Resources). E-Gen will implement several complex tasks: an analysis and categorization of jobs offers which are unstructured text documents (e-mails of job offers possibly <b>with</b> an <b>attached</b> <b>document),</b> an analysis and a relevance ranking of the candidate answers. We present a strategy to resolve the last task: After a process of filtering and lemmatisation, we use vectorial representation and different similarity measures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} partnerships of towns of the South Bohemian region with towns in France. The thesis explored cooperation between the following towns: České Budějovice and Lorient, Tábor and Dole, Milevsko and Guichen, Blatná and Sargé-les-Le Mans and Nové Hrady and Vaulx-Vraucourt. The first part focussed {{on the history of}} international cooperation of European towns and its general importance. Another aim was to compare Czech and French law concerning international cooperation of municipalities and approach both of them <b>with</b> <b>attached</b> <b>documents</b> which confirms willingness of partnership towns to cooperate. The characteristics of towns and their relations were also included in the first part. In the second part of this study, the author presented thorough surveys based on interviews with important people who are connected to mentioned partnerships. The inquiry was focussed towards the history of partnerships, the structure of people involved in organisation of external activities, range of cooperation, funding, institutional support and age bracket of people participating in every possible way. The author found out which associations take part in international relations between explored towns. The results revealed some towns cooperate more then the others and that in one case there is no activity anymore. However, the existing partnerships have a good chance to last for a long time...|$|R

50|$|Early online {{document}} collaboration used email, whereby comments {{would be}} written in the email <b>with</b> the <b>document</b> <b>attached.</b> The problem {{was that this was}} not a document-centric solution (i.e. Comments and discussions around the document were separate from the document itself). Today, the best document collaboration tools are more document-centric. These systems provide a user with a document-centric collaboration experience because they allow users to tag the document and add content specific comments, maintaining a complete version history and records and storing all comments and activities associated around a document. For this reason, an increasing number of firms are using email less and file sharing and document collaboration tools more.|$|R
30|$|The {{latter part}} of the toolbox {{includes}} specific guidance, providing details about the implementation of different measures. The question answered by the specific guidance is how to implement the selected measure(s) in order to minimise the shortcomings and enhance the expected effect? This part of the toolbox provides the end-user with a wide list of preventative and mitigation measures (70 specific measures grouped into 25 families and classified in 3 broader categories according to their type and general mode of intervention). The measures are also classified according to the theoretically driven model which explains the sequential process of railway suicide and trespass [19]: measures to (1) influence decision, (2) deter access, (3) influence behaviour in track area, (4) reduce consequences, and (5) improve practice and processes. Moreover, this second part of the toolbox includes implementation tips and other useful details which may be important during the implementation phase. The presentation of each specific measure follows a standard structure: description, recommendations, warning points, observations, study results, and a gallery <b>with</b> examples and/or <b>attached</b> <b>documents.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 3 September 1939 Britain {{declared}} war on Germany marking the start of World War II. Maharaja Hari Singh {{was a member of}} the Imperial War Cabinet and went to Britain to participate in its deliberations in April 1944.

As his cavalcade (consisting of a flotilla of boats on the river Jehlum) approached Mujahid Manzil the headquarters of the National Conference Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah along with his party members garlanded him with flowers and bouquets were given to him.

Surveillance of notifiable health conditions is essential in establishing what, how, and when events impact the public’s health.

In 2012, in addition to 850 cases reported with no lab results, there were more than 79, 000 laboratory results of infectious diseases and conditions submitted to IDPH disease surveillance programs. IDPH also investigates non-infectious conditions related to lead, occupational, and environmental hazards like carbon monoxide.

50|$|Document {{collaboration}} {{is a system}} allowing people to collaborate across different locations using Internet, and cloud collaboration enabled approach. In recent years, the market has seen a rapid development in document collaboration tools. Primitive document collaboration used email, whereby comments would be written in the email <b>with</b> the <b>document</b> <b>attached.</b> However, if the email is then forwarded or replied to, the comments can be easily lost, also {{it is hard to}} keep track of the most recent version of a document. Document-centric {{collaboration is}} the next step in the evolution of document collaboration. These systems put the document and its contents at the center of the process and allow users to tag the document and add content specific comments, maintaining a complete version control and records and storing all comments and activities associated around a document.|$|R
