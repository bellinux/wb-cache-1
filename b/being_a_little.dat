5|$|By February {{the next}} year, {{construction}} had resumed. On 8 April 25men {{working on the}} bridge went on strike. This was of concern due to time dependent concreting being undertaken at that time. As the construction was considered unemployment relief, the constructing authority began to look for men who would do the work in their places. By 13 April, further details had emerged; {{the number of the}} men on strike was actually 32, and it had been caused by the alleged wrongful dismissal of three men who had left for their lunch break early. The strike continued until at least 21 April. Work had resumed by early May, and the bridge was reported as <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over half completed at that time.|$|E
5|$|To the north, the New Zealand Rifle Brigade {{suffered}} {{the attention of}} German artillery even before beginning to move forward at 1:00 am. The attack did not begin until 6:30 am, when three battalions of riflemen began advancing. There had been no time to arrange a covering barrage {{and there was no}} armoured support. Despite heavy machine gun fire, all three battalions made their initial objectives but made little progress beyond these due to the strongly defended villages of St. Aubin and Beugnâtre, both to the northeast of Bapaume. Beugnâtre had been thought to have been captured by the 5th Division and thus the German presence in the village was unexpected. By 10:00 am, the attack had petered out and the battalions were consolidating their positions, during which they had to fend off a counterattack from Beugnâtre. On short notice, a further attack was arranged for the evening with the aim of pushing forward to the road to Cambrai, this time with a supporting artillery barrage. The 3rd Rifle Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, in a salient between Bapaume and St. Aubin, was to test the defences of the town with fighting patrols. The 2nd Rifle Battalion was to flank St. Aubin and advance for the Cambrai Road alongside 4th Rifle Battalion, which would also link up with 5th Division, which had the task of taking Beugnâtre. However, instructions to the attacking battalions were issued late and several companies did not receive their orders until the barrage had already commenced. Brigadier General Herbert Hart, commanding the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, realising the inadequacy of the preparation time, tried to cancel the operation but to no avail. Despite this, Beugnâtre did fall to the British; advancing under a covering barrage, the King's Own Scottish Borderers (KOSB) penetrated the village relatively easily before encountering strong machine gun. Even so, the KOSB pushed the Germans out and this secured the outer flank of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. However, while the New Zealanders did reach the Cambrai road, they were unable to hold it and had to settle for securing the railway line to Cambrai instead, this line <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{to the west of the}} road. St. Aubin was also captured by the 2nd Rifle Battalion.|$|E
25|$|Along with Williams, the Outlaws roster {{included}} rookie Oklahoma State star RB Ernest Anderson. Former Pittsburgh Steelers {{defensive coordinator}} Woody Widenhofer coached the team. Williams {{had been one}} of the biggest NFL stars to bolt to the USFL. He left the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after they offered him a contract that would have still made him among the lowest-paid starters in the league, even though it would have been triple his previous salary. Williams was not a very refined, efficient, or consistent passer at that point in addition to <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rusty, but had a big arm and a knack for making plays.|$|E

Despite his short stature, he is a skilled rugby player, often getting the better of Wal. Rangi's father is an {{abattoir}} slaughterman and his mother teaches at Raupo School. In his first appearance, Rangi considers skinning the Dog to make a fur coat. As a testimony to Murray Ball's skill as an artist, the character of Rangi grew up over the years, appearing slightly older in each book from <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid to a teenager. First appearance: Book 4 (April 1981).|$|E
25|$|Charles' next club {{would be}} Welsh Football League side Porthmadog. Despite <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> known outfit, {{the club was}} bankrolled by a millionaire, and so Charles was paid a higher wage than he had {{received}} at Arsenal and Cardiff. They finished the 1965–66 season second in the Welsh League, behind Caernarfon Town. Despite enjoying his time in North Wales, {{he decided that he}} could not turn down an offer to return to the Football League by Port Vale, then managed by Stanley Matthews. Port Vale paid Porthmadog a £1,250 fee, and Charles made his Vale debut in a 1–0 defeat at local rivals Crewe Alexandra on 3 February 1967. He played a further six games, including a rough encounter with Walsall, another one of Vale's rivals, before he decided to head back to Wales.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{boundary of}} the fell is formed by the Whinlatter Pass road. The summit of the pass lies south east of Whinlatter Top, marking {{the line of the}} Derwent-Cocker watershed. This falls from Tarbarrel Moss to the road, bypassing the highest point of the fell so that all of its waters flow to the Cocker. From the road summit Whinlatter Beck runs westward beneath the steepest face of the fell, Whinlatter Crag <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> below the highest point. To the north of Whinlatter is the quiet valley of Aiken Beck, its entrance neatly hidden in the woods between Brown How and Graystones. Its tributaries Willybrag Gill and Drycloff Gill drain the slopes of the fell. One wonders at the derivation of the former name. Aiken Beck and Whinlatter Gill combine to form Blaze Beck, a sizeable stream flowing into the Cocker at Low Lorton.|$|E

In keeping with the film's theme, Van Hoytema sought to eliminate the color blue as much as possible, feeling it was too well associated with the sci-fi genre. He also felt that by eliminating the color it would give the rest of the colors [...] "a specific identity." ...|$|E

500|$|The New York Yankees {{baseball}} team {{refused to give}} Homicide: Life on the Street {{permission to use the}} Yankees logo in the episode, which Fontana said angered the writers and inspired them to portray Yankees fans in a particularly negative light.

The names [...] "Stringfield" [...] and [...] "Doherty" [...] can be seen under Ballard's case list on the white board.

The false rumors were actually leaked by Tom Fontana himself to keep fans guessing.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{contains}} flashbacks to {{the events}} of [...] "Rose", [...] "Aliens of London", and [...] "The Christmas Invasion"; some footage was reused, but most was restaged to be from Elton's point of view. Rose remarks on the Abzorbaloff as <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit Slitheen-ish in appearance; the Abzorbaloff states that he comes from Clom, the sister planet of the Slitheen homeworld Raxacoricofallapatorius. Victor Kennedy mentions that Rose's Torchwood files are missing because they were corrupted by a [...] "Bad Wolf virus", referencing both the recurring phrases of the first and second series. This line was included to establish why Torchwood does not know what Rose looks like later in [...] "Army of Ghosts". The copy of The Daily Telegraph that the Abzorbaloff reads has the headline [...] "Saxon leads polls with 64 percent".

After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play.

Ken Tucker for NPR noticed that [...] "It's hard to resist the clever come-on refrain of [...] "Grenade" [...] — [...] "I'd catch a grenade for ya", adding that the song had a [...] "creamy melody". Reviewers, Meredith Whitmore and Adam R. Holz, for Pluggedin, think that [...] "Grenade" [...] is the reverse side of [...] "Just The Way You Are", commenting that the song [...] "ponders what happens when that flower fades and dies". However, Slant's Eric Henderson {{dismissed}} its unrealistic lyrics, while AllMusic's Tim Sendra thought the song was [...] "over-the-top"—one of the weaker ones on the album. Spencer Hawk from Little Village criticized the song by calling it [...] "fairly innovative" [...] and notice that the shouting of the lyrics [...] "doesn’t feel genuine", however he felt that [...] "It’s very safe while <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> risky, and Mars is a solid singer".

500|$|Typical of sealed-box {{speakers}} of similar size, the 3/5A {{has little or}} no low bass, but the design reinforced its lower register by a boost at around 160Hz, giving the subjective impression that the speaker is more bass-rich. It has a gently rising frequency response above 5kHz, leading reviewers to notice the sound <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bright at the treble registers, or that the speakers [...] "reproduce the high-end roughness of solid-state amplifiers mercilessly" [...] thus suggested partnering with valve amplification would be advantageous. A slight nasal quality in the midrange has also been noted in the earlier versions. The accuracy and stability of its stereo imaging and its clean midrange reproduction are also appreciated qualities. J. Gordon Holt suggests that the quality was [...] "comparable to that from Quad Electrostatics, at far lower cost and with added bonuses of slightly smoother high end, better stereo imaging, a broader listening area". John Atkinson suggests in Stereophile that the LS3/5A is ideally suited to the reproduction of program having a limited dynamic-range requirement, for example chamber music; he said that the LS3/5A [...] "has never boogied and never will; it's just too polite ever to cut the mustard on rock, or even straightahead jazz".|$|E
500|$|In November, [...] "Apples and Oranges" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} but failed to chart at all. The band eventually went back to De Lane Lea and recorded the unreleased track [...] "Vegetable Man". Sometime around Christmas, David Gilmour (Barrett's old school friend) was asked to join the band as a second lead guitarist to cover for Barrett when his erratic behaviour prevented him from performing. As Barrett had, up until then, written (or co-written) most of the songs on the band's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, {{as well as the}} band's three singles up to this point, the initial plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member – in similar style to Brian Wilson's recent status in The Beach Boys – but this meant that Barrett and the group were essentially separated. For two days from 10 January 1968, Pink Floyd reconvened at EMI Studios, attempting to work on older tracks: Waters' vocals and Wright's organ were overdubbed onto [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", while Mason added vocals to [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream".
