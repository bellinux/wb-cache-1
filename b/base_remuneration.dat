However, a higher remuneration increases absence. With respect to political selection, we find that a higher remuneration increases re-election rates. The composition of the pool of MEPs in terms of (ex-ante) quality approximated with formal education, previous political experience and occupational background is, however, unaffected. If we restrict our attention to freshmen, we find that a higher remuneration is related to a lower fraction of MEPs with previous political experience at the highest national level...|$|E

Most of these new approaches {{are based on the}} principles of aligning a portion of individual or team remuneration to achievement against specific goals. Such systems are most commonly referred to as performance <b>based</b> <b>remuneration</b> systems. Alpha (Pty) Ltd has very recently introduced a performance <b>based</b> <b>remuneration</b> system aimed at individuals within the organisation. It is evident that there is no single system that can be applied across the infinite number of organisations globally, and that developing any ideal performance related system requires careful consideration of many variables. To develop and implement an effective system within any organisation, requires custom tailoring the system to best suit that organisation.

40|$|This BEER {{addresses}} informational {{barriers to}} energy efficiency. It {{is a widely}} acknowledged result that an energy efficiency gap exists implying {{that the level of}} energy efficiency is at an inefficiently low level. Several barriers to energy efficiency create this gap and the presence of asymmetric information is likely to be one such barrier. In this article a theoretical framework is presented addressing the issues of moral hazard and adverse selection related to energy efficiency. Based on the theoretical framework, European policies on energy efficiency are evaluated. The article is divided into two main parts. The first part presents the theory on information asymmetries and its consequences on energy efficiency focusing on the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection. Having established a theoretical framework to understand the agency barriers to energy efficiency, the second part evaluates the policies of the European Union on energy efficiency. The BEER finds that problems of moral hazard and adverse selection indeed can help explain the seemingly low levels of energy. In both presented models the cost to the principal from implementing high energy efficiency outcome is increased with the informational asymmetries. The theory reveals two implications to policies on energy efficiency. First, the development of measures to enable contractual parties to <b>base</b> <b>remuneration</b> on energy performance must be enhanced, and second, the information on technologies and the education of consumers and installers on energy efficiency must be increased. This could be complemented with certification of installers and energy efficiency advisors to enable consumers to select good agents. Finally, it is found that the preferred EU policy instrument on energy efficiency, so far, seems to be the use of minimum requirements. Less used in EU legislation is the use of measuring and verification as well as the use of certifications. Therefore, it is concluded that the EU should consider an increased use of these instruments, and in particular focus on a further development of standards on measurability and verification as well as an increased focus on education of consumers as well as installers and advisors on energy efficiency. ...|$|E

Within the study, remuneration systems which involve a correlation between the performance of employees and their remuneration {{are referred to as}} Performance Related Remuneration (PRR). Since the early 1980 's, the use of performance <b>based</b> <b>remuneration</b> within UK organisations has increased to a level never witnessed before. Such remuneration systems have generally been employed as part of a wider management strategy to improve employee and organisational performance. In the companies of the 1990 's, it has become `normal' to find part of the total remuneration package tied to individual, group or organisational performance. There are many systems of PRR in use in the 1990 's and these include various forms of merit pay, profit related pay, payment by results, commission, profit sharing and employee share ownership plans. This thesis is motivated by the increasing use of performance <b>based</b> <b>remuneration</b> systems and focuses on the use of such systems within one specific industry - the UK food industry. The aim of the thesis is to identify trends relating to the use of PRR within the industry and in particular examine the extent to which PRR is used, why such systems are used, the various systems in operation, {{and the way in which}} the various systems are implemented and managed. The first part of the thesis contains a substantive literature review which examines several important aspects of PRR. The remainder of the thesis is concerned with the data gathered on the use of PRR within the UK food industry...|$|R

40|$|Background: The zone-of-tolerance (ZOT) {{is used in}} {{customer}} management to determine which customer interventions a company should focus their attention on. This research seeks to apply the ZOT to talent management in a South African context. The ZOT was used to investigate which HRM practices organisations should focus on and how the different social grouping and organisational tenure may change the focus of these HRM practices. Results: It was found that career and performance management, communication and employee reward showed significant lower impacts on employee satisfaction when an employee was inside the ZOT across all social groups. At a detailed level though there were differences among the social groups on which aspects of each element lowered the impact on employee satisfaction when inside the ZOT. Conclusion: Talented employees in a South African context value autonomy, training, adequate staffing and reduced job stress. These elements need to be managed {{regardless of whether the}} employee is in the ZOT or not. Career and performance management and employee reward, underpinned by clear career paths and performance <b>based</b> <b>remuneration</b> need to be monitored, as the impact of these on employee satisfaction is much lower when in the ZOT.
