500|$|The initial {{result was}} the {{construction}} of 30 new fortifications of various sizes during 1539. The stone castles of Deal, Sandown and Walmer were constructed to protect the Downs in east Kent, an anchorage which gave access to Deal Beach and on which an invasion force of enemy soldiers could easily be landed. These defences, known as the castles of the Downs, were supported by a line of four earthwork forts, known as the Great Turf Bulwark, the Little Turf Bulwark, the Great White Bulwark of Clay and the Walmer Bulwark, and a [...] long defensive ditch and bank. The route inland through {{a gap in the}} Kentish cliffs was guarded by Sandgate Castle. In many cases temporary bulwarks for artillery batteries were <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>during</b> the initial stages of the work, ahead of the main stonework being completed.|$|E

She did not become a [...] "real" [...] cruise ship as her cardecks were not <b>built</b> <b>in.</b> <b>During</b> conversion there was a fire on board, but it was extinguished by the shipyard staff. Renamed Sally Albatross, the ship entered service for the new Sally Cruise brand in May 1986. She was mainly used for cruising around the Baltic Sea from Helsinki.|$|E

AQbD is a systematic methods development strategy which consists of an overall consideration of scientific and regulatory knowledge, as well as quality control needs.

40|$|An {{explicit}} test of {{the ability}} of the galaxy two-point correlation function to be recovered from the Lick counts of galaxies (Shane and Wirtanen, 1967) is reported. High-fidelity simulations are created, starting with the distribution of galaxies in space. These distributions are projected onto a set of simulated Lick plates which are reduced to a uniform limiting magnitude with the method of Seldner et al. (1977). The simulated catalogs are then analyzed with the methods of Groth and Peebles (1977). The resulting correlation functions are found to reproduce accurately the correlation functions that were <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>during</b> the first step of the simulations...|$|E

30|$|The {{construction}} of the Brazilian power grid mostly adopts the EPC (Engineering Procurement and Construction) model, which optimizes its function and design as well as reducing the cost of construction to some extent. Conclusions {{can be drawn from}} the analysis of many faults, and experience in operation, that these potential faults are systemic and <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>during</b> design and construction, and are difficult to detect by experiments before commission. The {{construction of}} the power grid in China is changing from one based on professional and system integration to merging with the primary, secondary and EPC model. We should not reduce the reliability of relay protection and influence the safety and stability of the electrical power system because of the cost savings and optimization of design and function. Thus, we should place emphasis on the effects of transforming the construction model.|$|E
40|$|For {{automotive}} plastic parts {{there is a}} clear demand on an increased quality of the FE models. This demand is related to the increased use of simulations, both due to a reduced number of prototypes and an increased number of load cases. There have been studies showing a change of dynamic properties in injection molded components. The conclusion from these studies are that the change depends on residual stresses <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>during</b> the injection process. This study use simple models {{to try to get a}} working method and from the results find out the basic relations between residual stresses and dynamic properties. A method was developed and the results showed that the residuals had a major impact on the dynamic properties. Continuation on this work would be to use more complex models, to try to mimic results from reference studies and tests...|$|E
40|$|Multi-stage {{filtration}} Air-conditioning systems Filtration efficiency An {{important factor}} which reduces {{the quality of}} air supplied to a room by an air-conditioning plant is inadequate cleaning of the installation. This fault may exist in tandem with others <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>during</b> the design process (e. g. improperly placed filters with too low filtration efficiency). When, in addition to any design errors, the whole system is also badly maintained and the net-work of ducts and conditioning devices are not cleaned this can result {{in an increase in}} the pollution of the air supplied to the room. For proper operation of air-conditioning it is necessary to comply with the guidelines concerning cleanliness of ventilation systems. Also, it seems reasonable to include the addition of a multi-stage filtration system, which will decrease the concentra-tion of contaminants in air supplied to a room. This article describes a model of the effect of adding a four-stage filtration system to an air-conditioning system...|$|E

40|$|BN {{thin films}} are grown on Si(100) {{substrates}} in a pulsed-laser-deposition (PLD) process using a pulsed CO 2 laser, a hexagonal-phase BN (h-BN) target, and N 2 as processing gas. The effect of RF power coupled to the substrate during PLD is invesigated. Films are analysed using optical microscopy and micro-Raman and X-ray photomission spectroscopies. They are generally {{composed of a}} fine-grained matrix in which particles 10 - 100 micron meter in size are embedded, with the morphology and chemical composition dependent on the lateral position on the film surface relative to the laser-induced plasma plume from the target. The roughness and contaminant concentration (B 2 O 3, elemental B, and boron-oxynitride) are largest nearest the plasma-affected region. The matrix material over the entire film surface exhibits weak, broad spectral structures, indicating an amorphous structure. Certain regions have in in addition h-BN Raman peaks that are shifted by up to 15 cm- 1 to lower wave numbers relativ e to crystaline h-BN due to strain <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>during</b> deposition. No peaks characteristic of cubic BN or B 2 O 3 are found. Positions further from the plasma-affected region show stronger peaks, implying more crystalline order. The highest degree of crystallinity is reached for deposition with RF power applied to the substrate mainly during the laser pulses, as opposed to deposition with power applied between pulses or to deposition without RF power. In general, embedded particles have more intense Raman peaks than the surrounding matrix, comparable in strength {{to those of the}} target, suggesting that they arise from material ejection...|$|E
40|$|The modern food {{industry}} has developed and expanded {{because of its}} ability to deliver a wide variety of high quality food products to consumers on a nationwide and worldwide basis. This feat has been accomplished by building stability into the products through processing, packaging, and additives that enable foods to remain fresh and wholesome throughout the distribution process. Consumer demands for convenience have fueled new innovations in the food product development, packaging and chemical industries, and the widespread desire for products to use in the microwave oven has added further impetus to this effort. As an increasing number of new foods vie for space on supermarket shelves, the words “speed and innovation ” have become the watchwords for food companies seeking to become “first to market” with successful products. That all important market share which goes to the pioneer of each successful new product keeps that company in an excellent competitive position. Total quality is of paramount importance to this competitive posture and needs to be built into the speed and innovation system. How the consumer perceives the product is the ultimate measure of total quality. Therefore, the quality <b>built</b> <b>in</b> <b>during</b> the development and production process must last through the distribution and consumption stages or all is for naught. Shelf-life studies can provide important information to product developers enabling them to ensure that the consumer will see a high quality product for a significant period of time after production. Of course long shelf-life studies do not fit with the speed requirement and therefore accelerated studies have been developed as part of innovation. As the mechanisms of food deterioration became known to food scientists, methods of counteracting these losses in quality have been developed. The rate at which these reactions occur, the effects of temperature, water, and the myriad of other parameters have become characterized factors contributing to the science of accelerated shelf-life studies. Processed Food Deterioration The principal mechanisms involved in the deterioration of processed foods are as follows...|$|E
