40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>and</b> geographical” {{is a term}} {{short for}} the {{relationship}} <b>between</b> <b>human</b> <b>and</b> geographical environment.

It is an ever-lasting fundamental relationship, and it is the foundation of all other relations in human society. The process of <b>human</b> using <b>and</b> changing physical geography equals to the evolutive process of the relationship <b>between</b> <b>human</b> <b>and</b> geography. With the social development and the progress of productive forces, this relationship develops and progresses. It is of dynamic character.

5|$|The archaeological and {{historical}} records suggest interdependence <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> vultures {{for millions of}} years.

5|$|There {{was also}} great {{interest}} in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, {{but at the time}} it was not clear that they represented a different species from modern humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of Java Man, the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> apes, in 1891.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the debate}} that {{immediately}} followed the publication of On the Origin of Species centered on {{the similarities and differences}} <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> modern apes. Carolus Linnaeus had been criticised in the 18th century for grouping humans and apes together as primates in his ground breaking classification system. Richard Owen vigorously defended the classification suggested by Georges Cuvier and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that placed humans in a separate order from any of the other mammals, which by the early 19th century had become the orthodox view. On the other hand, Thomas Henry Huxley sought to demonstrate a close anatomical relationship <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> apes. In one famous incident, which became known as the Great Hippocampus Question, Huxley showed that Owen was mistaken in claiming that the brains of gorillas lacked a structure present in human brains. Huxley summarized his argument in his highly influential 1863 book Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature. Another viewpoint was advocated by Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace. They agreed that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but questioned whether any purely materialistic mechanism could account for all the differences <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> apes, especially some aspects of the human mind.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the numbers}} of dogs killed each year are {{relatively}} low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs.

The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the last}} quarter century, the {{dominant}} tendency in comparative cognitive psychology has been to emphasize the similarities <b>between</b> <b>human</b> <b>and</b> nonhuman minds and to downplay the differences as “one of degree and not of kind ” (Darwin 1871). In the present target article, we argue that Darwin was mistaken: the profound biological continuity <b>between</b> <b>human</b> <b>and</b> nonhuman animals masks an equally profound discontinuity <b>between</b> <b>human</b> <b>and</b> nonhuman minds. To wit, {{there is a significant}} discontinuity in the degree to which <b>human</b> <b>and</b> nonhuman animals are able to approximate the higher-order, systematic, relational capabilities of a physical symbol system (PSS) (Newell 1980). We show that this symbolic-relational discontinuity pervades nearly every domain of cognition and runs much deeper than even the spectacular scaffolding provided by language or culture alone can explain. We propose a representational-level specification as to where <b>human</b> <b>and</b> nonhuman animals’ abilities to approximate a PSS are similar and where they differ. We conclude by suggesting that recent symbolic-connectionist models of cognition shed new light on the mechanisms that underlie the gap <b>between</b> <b>human</b> <b>and</b> nonhuman minds...|$|R
5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent {{advantage of the}} player (White) who makes the first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E

Escad seeks to destroy Irwin, and Daena tries to act as a mediator between all parties while keeping Matilda away from Irwin. The conflict eventually escalates into a war <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> faeries. Depending on the choices of the player, either Daena or Escad will die, while the player helps {{bring an end to the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of commercial exploitation had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E

5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation: Applied Ethics and Human Obligations is a 2012 book by the British {{political}} theorist Alasdair Cochrane, {{in which}} it is argued that animal rights philosophy can be decoupled from animal liberation philosophy by the adoption of the interest-based rights approach. Cochrane, arguing that there is no reason that (nonhuman) animals should be excluded from justice, adopts Joseph Raz's account of interest rights and extends it to include animals. He argues that sentient animals possess a right not to be made to suffer and a right not to be killed, but not a right to freedom. The book's chapters apply Cochrane's account to a number of interactions <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> animals; first animal experimentation, then animal agriculture, the genetic engineering of animals, the use of animals in entertainment and sport, the relationship of animals to environmental practices and the use of animals in cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{arrived in}} the area where the park is located in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had {{plentiful}} wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. People complained that giraffes and zebras walked on and ruined their flower beds. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of Out of Africa, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.|$|E
5|$|Elmer {{recounts the}} initial violent {{backlash}} by humanity and how Ben hid {{the three of}} them from groups out to kill chickens. This is followed by retaliation against humans by chickens, chicken-rights groups, and eventually recognition of chickens as humans by the United Nations. During this time, Elmer becomes a syndicated columnist in a newspaper and writes about chicken-related topics, both light-hearted and serious. The peace <b>between</b> <b>humans</b> <b>and</b> chickens is disrupted in the late 1980s by an outbreak of bird flu. Millions of healthy chickens are killed by humans {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease, and Ben hides Elmer and Helen again. When others come for them, Ben intervenes and is accidentally shot protecting Elmer. Once the flu is contained, humanity expresses regret for its rash actions and Elmer writes a scathing editorial about the panic. His journal entries become less frequent after he and Helen have children.|$|E
