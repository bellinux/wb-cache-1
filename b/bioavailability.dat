5|$|Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic {{precursor}} of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve <b>bioavailability.</b> The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of {{an overdose of}} paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 {{was found to be}} greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and <b>bioavailability</b> data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low <b>bioavailability.</b> By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high <b>bioavailability</b> and are toxic in large doses.|$|E

The <b>bioavailabilities</b> of ampicillin from two products, which had been found to be different in calves, were investigated. The pharmacokinetics of ampicillin in the rabbit after intravenous administration can be described by an open two-compartment model. The elimination halflife of ampicillin in the rabbit is about 45 min. A large difference between male and female rabbits was observed in the apparent volume of distribution (0. 26 l/kg and 0. 13 l/kg resp.) and the total body clearance (1. 07 l/kg and 0. 60 l/kg. h.). In a two- way cross-over design the <b>bioavailabilities</b> of two intramuscular ampicillin products (Ampikel and Albipen) were compared. The ampicillin levels in plasma, the plasma creatin kinase activity and the tissue damage in the injection sites were estimated. The absolute <b>bioavailabilities</b> from both products were 100 % and 40 % for Ampikel and Albipen respectively. Differences in pharmacokinetics of ampicillin between sexes was also observed after intramuscular administration. After intramuscular administration of these products only slight tissue damage could be detected in the injection sites.

40|$|The {{current study}} aims to {{investigate}} the effect of chitosan derivatives on the intestinal absorption and <b>bioavailabilities</b> of forsythoside A (FTA) and Chlorogenic acid (CHA), the major active components in Flos Lonicerae- Fructus Forsythiae herb couple. Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics properties of the two compounds have been characterized in vitro, in situ {{as well as in}} rats. Based on the identified biopharmaceutics characteristics of the two compounds, the effect of chitosan derivatives as an absorption enhancer on the intestinal absorption and pharmacokinetics of FTA and CHA in pure compound form as well as extract form were investigated in vitro, in situ and in vivo. Both FTA and CHA demonstrated very limited intestinal permeabilities, leading to oral <b>bioavailabilities</b> being only 0. 50 % and 0. 13 % in rats, respectively. Results from both in vitro, in situ as well as in vivo studies consistently indicated that Chito-oligosaccharide (COS) at dosage of 25 mg/kg could enhance intestinal permeabilities significantly as well as the in vivo <b>bioavailabilities</b> of both FTA and CHA than CMCs in Flos Lonicerae- Fructus Forsythiae herb couple preparations, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation. Besides, treatment with Flos Lonicerae- Fructus Forsythiae herb couple preparations with COS at the dosage of 25 mg/kg prevented MDCK damage after influenza virus propagation, which was significantly better than control.

40|$|International audienceThe phytoavailabilities and {{potential}} remobilization of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) such as Zn, Pb, Cd, As, and Sb were assessed in contaminated technosols from former mining and smelting sites. The PTE concentrations in soil pore water (SPW) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) -measured concentration (C DGT) methods {{were used to}} assess the <b>bioavailabilities</b> of PTE and their remobilization in this study. Together with classical Chelex- 100 DGT probes to measure Zn, Cd, and Pb, novel ferrihydrite-backed DGT were used for As and Sb measurements alongside with Rhizon soil moisture sampler method for SPW sampling. To assess the phytoavailabilities of PTE, a germination test with dwarf beans as a plant indicator was used for this purpose. Dwarf bean primary leaves showed high Zn concentrations in contrast to Pb and Cd which showed low phytoavailabilities. Despite As and Sb are present in high concentrations in the mine tailings, their phytoavailabilities indicate very low <b>bioavailabilities.</b> The amounts of Zn, Pb, Cd, As, and Sb extracted with DGT devices correlated well with the total dissolved PTE concentrations in the SPW. The highest R values were observed for Zn, followed by Cd and Pb, indicating the ability of the soil to sustain SPW concentrations, which decreased in that order. Good correlations were also observed between each of dissolved PTE concentrations in SPW, DGT-measured PTE concentrations (C DGT), and the accumulation of PTE in dwarf bean primary leaves. It could be concluded that the use of Rhizon soil moisture samplers and DGT methods may be considered to be a good methods to predict the PTE <b>bioavailabilities</b> in contaminated technosols...|$|R

5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the <b>bioavailability</b> of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds to stimulate the entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E

Because different sources would have differ-ent optimal feeding levels to maximize profits, we dem-onstrate the challenge of calculating a single optimal level for the different methionine sources. Further, we apply an economic analysis to results of the previous meta-analysis to demonstrate that the relative values of HMTBA and DLM for BW and ADG are between 81 and 86 %, depending on the value of a broiler and the costs of feed and DLM.
