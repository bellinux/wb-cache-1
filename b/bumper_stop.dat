500|$|The only {{fatality}} on the Central Link project {{occurred on}} February 7, 2007 near the west portal of the northbound Beacon Hill Tunnel, where 49-year-old mechanic Michael Merryman was thrown from a supply train after it collided with an unoccupied locomotive, also injuring another worker who {{was released from}} a local hospital the following day with minor injuries. The accident prompted the public release of an ongoing Sound Transit audit of Obayashi {{in addition to an}} investigation led by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries into workplace safety at the tunnel site. The Sound Transit audit, which began after a previous supply train accident the previous October, released a report days after the accident that recommended unannounced brake inspections and criticized Obayashi's Beacon Hill managers for not participating in safety meetings and inspections; the report also blamed frequent employee turnover for the lack of safety awareness. Obayashi was fined $29,000 for the accident in addition to other workplace violations, ranging from failure to properly train the workers operating the supply trains to a lack of a <b>bumper</b> <b>stop</b> to prevent train collisions. Another controversy emerged during tunnel construction shortly after work began in December 2004, when caustic mud found at a landfill was traced back to the Beacon Hill Tunnel project by a state inspection. The contamination was determined to have originated in the jet grout, a highly alkaline substance, used to solidify dirt around the vertical station shafts during the early stages of station construction. Obayashi decontaminated nearly [...] of dirt and debris dumped at a sand mine in Maple Valley at a cost of $2.4 million.|$|E
500|$|All {{electronics}} {{equipment is}} {{carried by the}} 4MOB mobile platform manufactured by Sterela. The off-road platform, equipped with four-wheel drive, can move at a speed of 2 metres per second (...) [...] Its lithium-ion battery allows an operating time of eight hours. Two bumpers are located at the front and at the rear. These are obstacle detection <b>bumpers.</b> They <b>stop</b> the platform if they are compressed.|$|R
5000|$|In the Soviet Union, a clone {{was made}} under [...] "Elektronika IM-11" [...] designation. The early {{production}} version was named Lunokhod after the Lunokhod programme. It featured an obstruction sensor {{disguised as a}} plastic front <b>bumper,</b> which would <b>stop</b> the program when the toy got stuck. However, there was no provision for an accessory, and its motion sensor {{was based on a}} cheaper reed switch instead of an opto-isolator. A later version, named [...] "Planetokhod," [...] additionally featured a shootable rotor blade as an accessory, LED head and rear lamps, and the on/off switch was relocated to the rear side. A Soviet popular science journal Nauka i Zhizn published a detailed article on the IM-11.|$|R
2500|$|At the 2012 Aaron's 499 at Talladega, Busch paid {{homage to}} the 2006 racing comedy [...] by running his No. 51 car with the paint scheme of Ricky Bobby's No. 62 [...] "ME" [...] Cougar car from the movie, causing NASCAR on Fox {{commentators}} Mike Joy, Larry McReynolds and Darrell Waltrip to jokingly refer to Busch as [...] "Ricky Bobby" [...] throughout the race, and Busch also dropped movie lines into radio chatter with his spotter and crew chief. Busch's girlfriend Patricia Driscoll spent months getting permission from Sony and Will Ferrell {{as well as other}} trademark and license holders. Busch's real-life fall from grace during the 2011â€“12 Sprint Cup offseason has been compared to Ricky Bobby's. Busch's car was one of the stronger performers, running near the front and leading for a few laps. Towards the end of the race, with six laps to go, he dropped back when he spun out in the trioval off ex-teammate Brad Keselowski's <b>bumper.</b> After <b>stopping,</b> Busch drove backwards down pit road to get replacement tires, though he was not penalized and finished in 20th place as the last car on the lead lap.|$|R

50|$|By lap 14, McKay had a lead of 26 seconds over Pitt, while {{rain was}} {{beginning}} to fall over the circuit. Sawyer spun his car coming over the crest at Connaghans Corner, hitting the inside bank and rolling. Jack van Schaik narrowly missed Sawyer's car while Ken Miller scraped his roof on one of Sawyer's <b>bumpers.</b> Des West <b>stopped</b> to held Sawyer escape the car while the driver of a Ford Zephyr had also stopped, their car blocking the track. After helping Sawyer, West burned his hands while restarting his own car. McKay was able to slow safely {{as he approached the}} scene but was forced to use his car to move the stationary Zephyr out of the way. This allowed Pitt to close the gap and he took the lead when McKay spun on the following lap. However, the overdrive mechanism in Pitt's car began to fail and McKay was able to retake the lead with two laps remaining. McKay led to the finish, six seconds ahead of Pitt, with Hodgson more than a minute behind. Volkers was the best of the rest, finishing one lap down in fourth place.|$|R
