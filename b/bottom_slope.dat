40|$|An {{efficient}} {{method for}} increasing the dilution rate of brine water discharged into the sea is an inclined negatively buoyant jet from a single port or a multi-diffuser system. Such jets typically arise when brine is discharged from desalination plants. Two small-scale experimental studies were conducted to investigate the behaviour of a dense jet discharged into lighter ambient water. The first experiment concerned {{the importance of the}} initial angle of inclined dense jets, where the slope of the flow increased for the maximum levels as a function of this angle. An angle of 60 ° produced better results than 30 ° or 45 °. An empirical predictive equation was developed based on five geometric quantities to be considered in the design of plants. The second experiment studied the near and intermediate fields of negatively buoyant jets.

Three-dimensional perturbations superposed on a continuously stratified shelfbreak front were investigated using linearized, hydrostatic primitive equations. For all model runs in the study, the frontal instability mode, which is the fastest-growing mode for a baroclinic flow, was not influenced by the bottom: Retrograde, prograde, and flat-bottom jets all share the same stability characteristics. In contrast, weakly baroclinic jets are strongly influenced by bottom topog-raphy. The presence of a <b>bottom</b> <b>slope</b> stabilizes prograde jets and destabilizes retrograde jets, a difference attributed to the orientation of the isopycnals relative to the <b>bottom</b> <b>slope.</b> Temporal and/or downstream changes in the <b>bottom</b> <b>slope</b> and/or background stratification are shown to produce sizeable changes in the instability of a weakly baroclinic jet. 1...|$|E

Through both logistic regression and clas-sification tree models, we compared the characteristics of 29 known sand lance locations to 58 randomly selected sites. The best models indicated a strong selection of shallow water by sand lance, with weaker association between sand lance distribution and beach shorelines, sand bot-toms, distance to shore, <b>bottom</b> <b>slope,</b> and distance to the nearest sand bottom. We applied an information-theoretic approach to {{the interpretation of the}} logistic regression analysis and de-termined importance values of 0. 99, 0. 54, 0. 52, 0. 44, 0. 39, and 0. 25 for depth, beach shorelines, sand bottom, distance to shore, gradual <b>bottom</b> <b>slope,</b> and distance to the nearest sand bottom, respectively. The classification tree model indicated that sand lance selected shallow-water hab-itats and remained near sand bottoms when located in habitats with depths between 40 and 60 m. All sand lance locations were at depths, 60 m and 93 % occurred at depths, 40 m.

40|$|During Pliensbachian-Bajoeian times {{northern}} Europe, including Britain, {{was covered}} by an epeiric sea. Sediments formed include clays sandstones, limestones and ironstones, usually cyclically arranged; different facies were developed synchronously in different areas.

The sequence clay, sandstone, limestone ironstone is here interpreted as representative of a shallowing.

We relate the Mendip, London Platform and Dorset coast 'swells' to early Jurassic positive fault motions in the basement. The Market Weighton 'swell' is ascribed to relative buoyant rise of a salt pillow or granitic body whose movement was probably triggered by the same motions.
