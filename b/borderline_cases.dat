25|$|There {{was some}} {{speculation}} by financial analysts that the Dynegy-Ameren deal {{was a poor}} one. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, executive director of UBS Investment Research, said Dynegy is {{far more likely to}} shutter all five coal-powered plants rather than add pollution control devices. Dumoulin-Smith pointed out that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued final rules on sulfur dioxide emissions that go into effect in July 2018. Because the Edwards plant is in an area of low air quality, EPA is likely to force Dynegy to close the plant anyway. The remaining four plants are <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> with the exception of Duck Creek Station which spent nearly US$800m on sulfur dioxide removal, and may also be forced to close if EPA regulations tighten in the future (a highly likely possibility, he said).|$|E

25|$|For this reason, Egyptian rituals often {{included}} {{actions that}} symbolized mythical events. Temple rites included {{the destruction of}} models representing malign gods like Set or Apophis, private magical spells called upon Isis to heal the sick as she did for Horus, and funerary rites such as the Opening of the Mouth ceremony and ritual offerings to the dead evoked the myth of Osiris' resurrection. Yet rituals rarely, if ever, involved dramatic reenactments of myths. There are <b>borderline</b> <b>cases,</b> like a ceremony alluding to the Osiris myth in which two women took on the roles of Isis and Nephthys, but scholars disagree about whether these performances formed sequences of events. Much of Egyptian ritual was focused on more basic activities like giving offerings to the gods, with mythic themes serving as ideological background rather than {{as the focus of}} a rite. Nevertheless, myth and ritual strongly influenced each other. Myths could inspire rituals, like the ceremony with Isis and Nephthys; and rituals that did not originally have a mythic meaning could be reinterpreted as having one, {{as in the case of}} offering ceremonies, in which food and other items given to the gods or the dead were equated with the Eye of Horus.|$|E

2500|$|As {{common in}} biology, {{there are several}} <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> between solenoid {{architectures}} and regular protein domains. Proteins that contain tandem repeats of ordinary domains are very common in eukaryotes. Even if these domains are perfectly capable of folding on their own, some of them might bind together and assume a rigidly fixed orientation in the full protein. These supradomain modules can perform functions that its individual constituents are incapable of [...] A famous example {{is the case of}} tandem BRCT domains, found in the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1. While individual BRCT domains are found in certain proteins (e.g. some DNA ligases) binding DNA, these tandem BRCT domains evolved a novel function: phosphorylated linear motif binding. In the case of BRCA1 (and MDC1), the peptide-binding groove lies in a cleft formed by the junction of the two domains. This elegently explains why individual constituents of this supradomain block are incapable of ligand binding, while their proper assembly endows them with a novel function. Therefore, tandem BRCT domains can be regarded as a form of a single, linear solenoid domain as well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{definition}} {{of life is}} controversial. The current definition is that organisms maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. However, many other biological definitions have been proposed, {{and there are some}} <b>borderline</b> <b>cases</b> of life, such as viruses. Throughout history, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by [...] "life" [...] and many theories on the properties and emergence of living things, such as materialism, the belief that everything is made out of matter and that life is merely a complex form of it; hylomorphism, the belief that all things are a combination of matter and form, and the form of a living thing is its soul; spontaneous generation, the belief that life repeatedly emerges from non-life; and vitalism, a now largely discredited hypothesis that living organisms possess a [...] "life force" [...] or [...] "vital spark". Modern definitions are more complex, with input from a diversity of scientific disciplines. Biophysicists have proposed many definitions based on chemical systems; there are also some living systems theories, such as the Gaia hypothesis, the idea that the Earth itself is alive. Another theory is that life is the property of ecological systems, and yet another is elaborated in complex systems biology, a branch or subfield of mathematical biology. Abiogenesis describes the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds. Properties common to all organisms include the need for certain core chemical elements to sustain biochemical functions.|$|E

40|$|A {{clinical}} name of "Borderline Case" {{is generally}} used {{for such a}} case which {{is very difficult to}} diagnose as schizophrenia or neurosis. It is inevitable that the various cases with different genesis and symptomatology are classified in the <b>borderline</b> <b>case,</b> as the concept and the diagnostic standpoint of schizophrenia or neurosis are not uniform. Although there are many papers on the psychodynamic structure of the <b>borderline</b> <b>case,</b> the clinical pictures of this case are not the same. The author feels that the further clinical observation and the classification are also necessary as well as the psychodynamics of the <b>borderline</b> <b>case.</b> 17 cases are observed and classified into 3 types, who had been the in-patient during two years, from Jan. 1961 to Jan. 1963, at the Dep. of Neuro-Psychiatry, Okayama University Hospital. 1. Pseudoneurotic Type Various neurotic symptoms such as anxiety, phobia, obsession and neurasthenic symptom are flourish. Thought disorder or the superficial emotional contact are prominent in most cases, but autism, the primary schizophrenic disorder is not remarkable in some of these cases, although Hoch, P. insisted that pseudoneurotic schizophrenia is not the <b>borderline</b> <b>case,</b> but a sub-type of schizophrenia. 2. Type of Character Deviation Symptoms are vague and transient, and the disorders of the social life due to the various abnormal behavior and the distortion of the inter-personal relationship are characteristic. Severe disorder of the personality which is difficult to differentiate from psychopath or simple schizophrenia is cardinal in this type. 3. Mono-symptomatic Type Delusional interpretation about his shape, expression or smell persists for a long period. The appearance of the symptom is closely related with the special situation, the presence of other peoples, and the disorder of the personality is minimum. In these cases, the neurotic picture is more evident than in the other types...|$|R

2500|$|The {{priority}} {{system is}} reinforced by a line of case law, whose principle {{is to ensure that}} creditors cannot contract out of the statutory regime. [...] This is sometimes referred to as the [...] "anti-deprivation rule". The general principle, according to the Mellish LJ in Re Jeavons, ex parte Mackay is that [...] "a person cannot make it a part of his contract that, in the event of bankruptcy, he is then to get some additional advantage which prevents the property being distributed under the bankruptcy laws." [...] So in that case, Jeavons made a contract to give Brown & Co an armour plates patent, and in return Jeavons would get royalties. Jeavons also got a loan from Brown & Co. They agreed half the royalties would pay off the loan, but if Jeavons went insolvent, Brown & Co would not have to pay any royalties. The Court of Appeal held half the royalties would still need to be paid, because this was a special right for Brown & Co that only arose upon insolvency. In a case where a creditor is owed money by an insolvent company, but also the creditor itself owes a sum to the company, Forster v Wilson held that the creditor may set-off the debt, and only needs to pay the difference. The creditor does not have to pay all its debts to the company, and then wait with other unsecured creditors for an unlikely repayment. However, this depends on the sums for set-off actually being in the creditors' possession. In British Eagle International Air Lines Ltd v Compaigne Nationale Air France, a group of airlines, through the International Air Transport Association had a netting system to deal with all the expenses they incurred to one another efficiently. All paid into a common fund, and then {{at the end of each}} month, the sums were settled at once. British Eagle went insolvent and was a debtor overall to the scheme, but Air France owed it money. Air France claimed it should not have to pay British Eagle, was bound to pay into the netting scheme, and have the sums cleared there. The House of Lords said this would have the effect of evading the insolvency regime. It did not matter that the dominant purpose of the IATA scheme was for good business reasons. It was nevertheless void. Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd and Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc observed that the general principle consists of two subrules [...] the anti-deprivation rule (formerly known as [...] "fraud upon the bankruptcy law") and the pari passu rule, which are addressed to different mischiefs [...] and held that, in <b>borderline</b> <b>cases,</b> a commercially sensible transaction entered into in good faith should not be held to infringe the first rule. All these anti-avoidance rules are, however, subject to the very large exception that creditors remain able to jump up the priority queue, through the creation of a security interest.|$|E

40|$|The chapter takes Schiffer’s central {{contribution}} {{to the study of}} vagueness to be his treatment of the characterization problem: saying what being a <b>borderline</b> <b>case</b> of a concept expressed by a vague expression consists in.
