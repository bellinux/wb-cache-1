40|$|The legal {{regulations}} of closing material cycles {{in order to}} preserve valuable resources are obeyed increasingly also in sewage management. At the treatment of process water in sewage plants these demands are observed just by recycling ammonium, which is separated as salt or an aqueous ammonia solution from distillates or separation waters from sludge dewatering. Due to the new developed acid and alkaline vapor-washing it is possible to produce ammonium sulfate and carbon sources for biological denitrification in a compact column simultaneously. From vapors, loaded with ammonia and organic acids, i. e. caused by drying sewage sludge, the acid and alkaline compounds are separated in two independent washing cycles using this method. Ammonium is enriched in the acid washing liquid whereas the salts of the organic acids are concentrated in the alkaline solution. The velocity of mass transfer in a washing system with chemical reaction is limited by the vapor-phase. In spite of this limitatio n and the higher pressure drop, there should be used a <b>bubble</b> <b>tray</b> column for practicable design of an acid and alkaline vapor-washing. The advantages of tray columns are their compact construction and the easy control of pH, concentration and quantity of the liquids. For pure chemical absorption, the efficiency of one tray is only a function of bubble size distribution and the height of the two-phase layer. A reduction of the vapor contamination of more than 90 per cent is achieved in the employed system for a 13 cm high two-phase layer. A limitation of the mass transfer coefficient by the vapor concentration of the transferring compound could not detected in the examined field of concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and testing of a mathematical model of a distillation process in which the components react chemically. The formaldehyde-methanol-water system was selected and only the reversible reactions between formaldehyde and water giving methylene glycol and between formaldehyde and methanol producing hemiformal were assumed to occur under the distillation conditions. Accordingly the system has been treated as a five component system. The vapour-liquid equilibrium calculations were performed by solving iteratively the thermodynamic relationships expressing the phase equilibria with the stoichiometric equations expressing the chemical equilibria. Using optimisation techniques, the Wilson single parameters and Henry's constants were calculated for binary systems containing formaldehyde which was assumed to be a supercritical component whilst Wilson binary parameters were calculated for the remaining binary systems. Thus the phase equilibria for the formaldehyde system could be calculated using these parameters and good accuracy was obtained when calculated values were compared with experimental values. The distillation process was modelled using the mass and energy balance equations together with the phase equilibria calculations. The plate efficiencies were obtained from a modified A. I. Ch. E. <b>Bubble</b> <b>Tray</b> method. The resulting equations were solved by an iterative plate to plate calculation based on the Newton Raphson method. Experiments were carried out in a 76 mm I. D., eight sieve plate distillation column and the results were compared with the mathematical model calculations. Overall, good agreement was obtained but some discrepancies were observed in the concentration profiles and these may have been caused by the effect of limited physical property data and a limited understanding of the reactions mechanism. The model equations were solved in the form of modular computer programs. Although they were written to describe the steady state distillation with simultaneous chemical reaction of the formaldehyde system, the approach used may be of wider application...|$|E

40|$|Heat {{and mass}} {{transfer}} processes governing {{the performance of}} <b>bubble</b> dehumidifier <b>trays</b> are studied {{in order to develop}} a predictive model and design rules for efficient and economical design of bubble column dehumidifiers for humidification-dehumidification (HDH) systems. As a result of their high heat transfer coefficients and large interfacial areas, bubble columns are an inexpensive and compact solution for dehumidification in HDH, which has promising applications in small-scale desalination and industrial water remediation. Performance parameters for dehumidifier design for HDH, including a device-specific parallel-flow effectiveness, are explained. A new model for the performance of single <b>bubble</b> <b>trays</b> is developed based on the rapid mixing in the column and the approximation of negligible gas-side resistance. An experiment is performed to measure the heat transfer coefficients outside cooling coils in shallow bubble columns, in which geometric parameters including liquid height and cylinder diameter, height, and horizontal position relative to the sparger orifices are varied. The highest heat transfer coefficients are recorded on cylinders placed in the coalescing region and directly above the sparger orifices. Heat flux and parallel-flow effectiveness of a bubble column dehumidifier are investigated experimentally to validate the model, which predicts the heat transfer rate well with an average absolute error of < 3 %. The independence of heat flux and effectiveness from liquid depth supports the assumption of negligible gas-side resistance to heat and mass transfer. Despite the mass exchange, the bubble column dehumidifier performs like a typical heat exchanger: the heat flux decreases and effectiveness increases with increasing coil area. The results of this study enable modeling and design of bubble column dehumidifiers for high heat recovery and low capital cost. by Emily Winona Tow. Thesis: S.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an extensive {{study on the}} gas holdup, axial liquid dispersion, and mass transfer for packed, <b>trayed,</b> and empty <b>bubble</b> columns. Four types of structured packings (Super-Pak, Flexipac, Mellapak, and Gauze) and two types of perforated partition trays (with 25 % and 40 % tray open area) were used to characterize the packed and <b>trayed</b> <b>bubble</b> columns, respectively. It was observed that the gas holdup and mass transfer characteristics of the packed and <b>trayed</b> <b>bubble</b> columns are superior to those of an empty bubble column, while the axial dispersion coefficients are much lower. This article discusses in detail {{the effect of the}} liquid and gas flow rates, liquid-phase viscosity, and type of internals. Additionally, experimental data of the packed, <b>trayed,</b> and empty <b>bubble</b> column are correlated by dimensionless numbers. Novel empirical correlations are proposed for the gas holdup, Bodenstein number (for the axial dispersion coefficient), and Stanton number (for the volumetric mass transfer coefficient), {{as a function of the}} Froude and Galileo dimensionless numbers...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} acid gases, CO 2 and H 2 S from natural gas streams is {{essential}} for environmental and health reasons. In this work, the simulated gas sweetening unit with Methyl-DiEthanolAmine (MDEA) solvent was studied to improve quality. Firstly, the effect of trays types and then, the effect of various packing {{and the effect of}} the packing size were considered on the flow rate of CO 2 and H 2 S in the main streams. Results show that with considering the different trays types in the regenerator tower, the flow rate of CO 2 in the sweet gas stream with <b>bubble</b> cap <b>tray</b> is lower than other trays types. Also, with considering the different trays types in the absorber tower, the flow rate of CO 2 in the sweet gas stream with <b>bubble</b> cap <b>tray</b> is lower than other trays types in the absorber tower. In considering with different types of packing, results show that the flow rate of CO 2 with ballast ring packing and the flow rate of H 2 S with Raschig ring packing are lower than other types of packing. However, in some types such as cascade miniring, Intalox Saddles and pall ring, there is no difference for the flow rate of CO 2 or H 2 S. In all cases, with increasing the size of the packing, the flow rate of CO 2 and H 2 S in the sweet gas stream increases, however, this increasing in the metal packing is very small...|$|R
50|$|Trayed {{strippers}} {{can have}} sieve, valve, or <b>bubble</b> cap <b>trays</b> while packed strippers can have either structured packing or random packing. Trays and packing {{are used to}} increase the contact area over which mass transfer can occur as mass transfer theory dictates. Packing can have varying material, surface area, flow area, and associated pressure drop. Older generation packing include ceramic Raschig rings and Berl saddles. More common packing materials are metal and plastic Pall rings, metal and plastic Zbigniew Bia≈Çecki rings, and ceramic Intalox saddles. Each packing material of this newer generation improves the surface area, the flow area, and/or the associated pressure drop across the packing. Also important, {{is the ability of}} the packing material to not stack on top of itself. If such stacking occurs, it drastically reduces the surface area of the material. Lattice design work has been increasing of late that will further improve these characteristics.|$|R

Multi-product simulations {{were performed to}} find the operational parameters for producing different grades of polyester in the same equipment. The product transition time during product changeover is determined for various configurations and product grades.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} demonstrations of intermolecular forces is the tension at the surface of liquid n-alkanes. The prediction of surface tension is important in the design of distillation towers, extraction units and tower internals such as <b>bubble</b> caps and <b>trays,</b> since it has a considerable influence on the transfer of mass and energy across interfaces. Surface tension data are needed wherever foaming emulsification, droplet formation or wetting are involved. They are also required in a number of equations for two-phase flow calculations and for determining the flow regime. Petroleum engineers are especially interested in the surface tension in the extraction of crude oil to add surfactants to modify the interfacial properties between crude oil and the geological reservoir to improve production and increase oil yields. In this work, a simple computer program using Arrhenius-type asymptotic exponential function, Vandermoned matrix and Matlab technical computing language, is developed for the estimation of surface tension of paraffin hydrocarbons as a function of molecular weight and temperature. The surface tension is calculated for temperatures in the range of 250 to 440 K and paraffin hydrocarbons molecular weights between 30 and 250. The proposed numerical technique is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly if more data become available in the future. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being less than 2 %...|$|R
