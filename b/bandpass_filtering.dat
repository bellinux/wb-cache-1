The combination of lo- and hi-pass filters provide broadband <b>bandpass</b> <b>filtering</b> to the rx front end. For 6 m the hi-pass filter includes a preamplifier (always used on 6 m rx and not affected by the IPO menu setting). The appropriate high pass filter output is selected with a PIN diode with logic levels. The output from the PIN diodes are routed to the MAIN unit. Here the rx signal is applied to dual PIN diode modules (type DAP236U). One path routes the signal directly between the two modules and the other path passes the signal through a 10 db pad - the pad that is switched in as a menu item. The output is then passed through a simple lo-pass filter to another DAP236U. One of the outputs is applied to a preamplifier {{and the other is}} applied to a diode, bypassing the preamplifier. The output of the diode is applied to an IF trap. The purpose of which is to prevent 68.33 MHz energy from the antenna from getting into the 1st IF.
