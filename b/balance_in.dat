5|$|Lines {{that have}} been bred with {{selection}} pressure focused on uniformity and finer fiber diameter often do not perform as optimally as lamb producers, and vice versa.

5|$|One final {{suggestion}} for political policy reform {{is the notion}} that {{there ought to be a}} political <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> every branch of public service. Lack of <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> public institutions creates havens for reactionary forces, which in turn undermine democracy. Russell emphasises two conditions necessary for the achievement of balance. He advocates, first, the abolition of the legal standing of confessions as evidence, to remove the incentive for extraction of confession under torture by the police (Russell 1938:232). Second, the creation of dual branches of police to investigate particular crimes: one which presumes the innocence of the accused, the other presuming guilt (Russell 1938:233).|$|E

The first chapter describes the reasons why {{to deal with this}} topic further. The second chapter summarizes the state of load balancing. This chapter is based on research of already elaborated thesis which were focused on load <b>balancing</b> <b>in</b> different ways. The third chapter summarizes load balancing including its key principles. The fourth chapter describes an actual state of load <b>balancing</b> <b>in</b> data center environment. An observation of real usage of load <b>balancing</b> <b>in</b> selected data center was used for the main purpose of this chapter. The fifth chapter consists of analysis of the currently existing methodologies which are used from the infrastructure projects purpose. The sixth chapter deals with creation of methodology for optimal usage of load <b>balancing</b> <b>in</b> data center. The seventh chapter evaluates usage of methodology by applying of this methodology to real practical example of implementation of load balancing. The eighth chapter summarizes all detected conclusions...|$|R

5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|Differences {{of opinion}} over social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding the slavery of Africans and African Americans, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and free states, keeping a sectional <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> the Senate, while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|E

5|$|During the 1952 Winter Olympics, Rødkleiva {{hosted the}} men's slalom and the women's slalom, {{with the other}} events taking place at Norefjell. The {{organizing}} committee had set up 15,000 tickets for the men's discipline on 19 February, but between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the race, the surplus who did not pay for tickets. The large popularity was to see Norway's favoured Stein Eriksen. Although leading after the first heat, {{he came out of}} <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> the second and finished second behind Austria's Othmar Schneider.

5|$|In 1870, during Sarmiento's presidency, {{total debt}} {{amounted}} to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president {{after winning the}} 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina's first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions {{needed to get the}} debt under control. In 1876 convertibility was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda's administration was the first to deliver a <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio Argentino Roca, a much more manageable economic environment.|$|E
5|$|Influenced by Keynes, {{economics}} {{texts in}} the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on <b>balance</b> <b>in</b> trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management {{and in particular the}} 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, {{since the end of the}} Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns – and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses – have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–08.|$|E

As commander of an imperial bodyguard regiment, Kourkouas was among the chief supporters of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (reigned 920–944) and facilitated the latter's rise to the throne. In 923, Kourkouas was appointed commander-in-chief of the Byzantine armies along the eastern frontier, facing the Abbasid Caliphate and the semi-autonomous Muslim border emirates.
