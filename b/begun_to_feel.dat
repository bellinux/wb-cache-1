He was soon {{to be replaced by}} vice president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who was catapulted by the opposition into power as the least offensive standard bearer.

25|$|GE {{was never}} {{extremely}} pleased that Lowe had quit {{them when the}} war began, and the position they offered him when he returned was not the position he thought he deserved. He was tired of traveling, and of being away from his family so much, and at GE he had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> like an increasingly insignificant part of an increasingly large company.

500|$|Following Happy Endings, she {{starred in}} the 2006 films Trust the Man, Stranger than Fiction, Monster House, World Trade Center, and Sherrybaby. In Trust the Man, {{featuring}} Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, and Billy Crudup, she played Elaine, who has been dating Tobey, Crudup's character, for seven years and has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> {{that it is time}} for her to settle down and start a family. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Ethan Alter of Premiere felt that the performances by Gyllenhaal and Duchovny were [...] "much more at ease" [...] and concluded with [...] "that's probably because they're [...] played these characters many times before". In Stranger than Fiction, Gyllenhaal played a love interest of Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell. Her performance in the film received favorable reviews; Mike Straka of Fox News wrote: [...] "Gyllenhaal has never been sexier in any film before and her interplay with Ferrell will propel her to more A-list films, leaving her indie-darling days behind, no doubt." [...] She voiced Elizabeth [...] "Zee" [...] in the computer animated horror film Monster House. Gyllenhaal played Allison Jimeno, the wife of Port Authority officer Will Jimeno, in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, based on the September 11 attacks in New York City. She regarded this as [...] "one of the films she most enjoyed making". The film received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, earning US$162million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1940 Guthrie {{was invited}} by the Model Tobacco Company to host their radio program Pipe Smoking Time. Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an {{impressive}} salary in 1940. He was finally making {{enough money to}} send regular payments back to Mary. He also brought her and the children to New York, where the family lived briefly in an apartment on Central Park West. The reunion represented Woody's {{desire to be a}} better father and husband. He said, [...] "I have to set [...] real hard to think of being a dad." [...] Guthrie quit after the seventh broadcast, claiming he had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> the show was too restrictive when he was told what to sing. Disgruntled with New York, Guthrie packed up Mary and his children in a new car and headed west to California.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{and during}} World War II, some ethnic Germans {{gathered}} around local Nazi organizations (sponsored financially by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Third Reich), actively supported the Nazis {{in countries such}} as Czechoslovakia, Poland and Yugoslavia. During the social and economic tensions of the Great Depression, some had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> aggrieved with their minority status. They participated in espionage, sabotage and other Fifth column means in their countries of origin, trained and commanded by Abwehr. In November 1938 Nazi Germany organized German paramilitary units made out German minority members in Polish Pomerania that were to engage in diversion, sabotage as well as political murder and ethnic cleansing upon German invasion of Poland. Reich intelligence was actively recruiting ethnic Germans and the Nazi secret service [...] "SicherheitsDienst" [...] (SD) was forming them as early as October 1938 into armed unit that were to serve Nazi Germany ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} The Aquabats began writing new {{material}} {{for their next}} studio album in 1998, the group had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> pigeonholed by their public status as a [...] "cheesy ska band" [...] and consciously decided to start exploring more diverse musical styles rather than merely returning to a ska-based sound. As such, the band's third album, The Aquabats vs. the Floating Eye of Death!, marked an abrupt stylistic shift, completely abandoning the ska rhythms which dominated their previous albums {{in favor of more}} punk and new wave-influenced textures, emphasizing guitar and synthesizer-driven melodies over brass and woodwinds. With the total absence of The Aquabats' formerly marketable ska sound, Goldenvoice expressed mixed feelings over Floating Eye, reportedly telling the band that the album had no potential single material and would be difficult to promote. In a 2005 interview, Larson retrospectively lamented upon Floating Eyes lack of a commercial sound, noting that while he and the band felt the material was strong, it [...] "probably wasn't the record we should have put out at that time".|$|E
2500|$|The initial {{critical}} {{reaction to the}} half-hour sitcom Honeymooners was mixed. The New York Times and Broadcasting & Telecasting Magazine wrote that it was [...] "labored" [...] and lacked the spontaneity of the live sketches. ButTV Guide praised it as [...] "rollicking," [...] "slapsticky" [...] and [...] "fast-paced." [...] In February 1956, the show {{was moved to the}} 8 p.m. (EST) timeslot, but already had begun losing viewers to the hugely popular Perry Como Show. Gleason's writers also had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> confined by the restrictive half-hour format—in previous seasons, Honeymooners sketches typically ran 35 minutes or more—and Gleason felt they were beginning to run out of original ideas. So, after just one season, Gleason and CBS agreed to cancel The Honeymooners, which aired its 39th and last original episode on September 22, 1956. In explaining his decision to end the show with $7 million remaining on his contract Gleason said, [...] "The excellence of the material could not be maintained, and I had too much fondness for the show to cheapen it.. Gleason subsequently sold the films of the [...] "Classic 39" [...] episodes of the show to CBS for $1.5 million.|$|E
