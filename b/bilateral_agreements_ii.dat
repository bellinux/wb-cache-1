50|$|Switzerland {{referendum}} to {{join the}} EEA in 1992 failed, so Swiss products {{do not participate in}} the European single market. However the country recently negotiated two series of bilateral agreements with the Union. The first series, Bilateral Agreements I, consists of seven bilateral agreements and was signed in 1999 (entry into force in 2001), the main part being Free Movement of Persons (full text of the agreement). The second series, <b>Bilateral</b> <b>Agreements</b> <b>II,</b> relates to nine areas and was signed in 2004 (entered into full force on 30 March 2005) and includes the Schengen treaty and the Dublin Convention (full text of the agreement) (official press release).|$|E

50|$|Some {{priority}} rights {{also exist}} {{on the basis of}} <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> A <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreement</b> between a first and a second country may allow an applicant who filed an application in the first country to claim the priority of the first application when filing a second application in the second country. These kinds of <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> usually involve at least one country not party to the Paris Convention.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} {{bilateral}} relations between Qatar and Turkey {{date back to}} the 1970s. In the 1980s, the two nations began signing <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> with one another. Bilateral relations gained further traction in the 2000s with the signing of a number of <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the European Union and Switzerland constitutes {{one of the most}} interesting phenomenons in Europe. Both entities have closely cooperated e. g. in the field of economy, culture or education but there have been just few formal agreements which would regulate this cooperation till the recent time. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> I and <b>II</b> between the EU and Switzerland, which were negotiated at the turn of the century, therefore represent a "small revolution" for both contracting parties and a new quality in their relationship. They regulate the most important common fields of interest, mainly at the area of mutual trade. But the main question remains: do these negotiations and agreements create a solid basis for a further integration of Switzerland into the EU or do they contrariwise constitute a status quo which will not be changed for a longer period of time? The search for this answer is not an easy one. The EU would be surely interested in an accession of Switzerland but it is quite obvious that there is not so much enthusiasm on the Swiss side. The skepticism towards a deeper integration into the EU is spread mainly among electors and it has been proved in several plebiscites on this theme. The accession is backed approximately by 30 percent of voters and there is no canton with a majority of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Coordination {{of social}} {{security}} by <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> on social security is a specific area of international law that is essential to pay attention to. Czech Republic has up to now signed 16 <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> that are valid in their entirety. This thesis focuses on these 16 <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> and compares them with Regulation (EC) 883 / 2004 which became valid as the Czech Republic became member of European Union and which replaced <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> that were concluded with member states of European Union. The aim of this thesis is to perform a detailed analysis and to answer on following questions that {{are directly related to}} this issue. Firstly the thesis focuses on personal scale and answers a question of who is covered by <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> Secondly the thesis focuses on material scale and answers a question of what subsystems are covered by agreements and compares them with the principles applied by Regulation (EC) 883 / 2004. Finally the thesis deals with a question of a future possible approach to coordination {{of social security}} in a global scale. It can be concluded that <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> concluded by the Czech Republic are each unique legal instruments. Therefore it is essential to study each agreement separately and not to make conclusions based on general knowledge of the issue...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{globalization}} is increasing {{the cooperation of}} states in the international marketplace. Labour mobility is a key area that has proven difficult to liberalize due to its complex nature and sovereign border controls. As a proponent of free trade Canada has sought to establish the rules of trade in multilateral agreements though more recently has turned to <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements.</b> However, the proliferation of <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> is seen by economic scholars to frustrate the more efficient multilateral agreements. Comparing the technical language within various agreements reveals that a consistent trend to deepen Canada’s commitments in bilateral arrangements is not found. Rather, <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> have served to broaden trade globally. This finding suggests that <b>bilateral</b> trade <b>agreements</b> do not complicate the liberalization process to the extent proposed by multilateralists. In this light, <b>bilateral</b> <b>agreements</b> are considered to support Canada’s multilateral objectives by acting as building blocks and creating new trade partners...|$|R
