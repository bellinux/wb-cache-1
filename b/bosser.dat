50|$|After {{retrieving}} and reloading his shotgun, the Mafia <b>boss</b> {{makes his}} way to the boiler room. As he enters, the Yakuza <b>boss</b> jumps out and tries to shoot him with his P38.

The Yakuza <b>boss</b> seizes the chance and puts the P38 to his head. He pulls the trigger but his gun is also empty. The Mafia <b>boss</b> swings his shotgun into the Yakuza’s stomach then discards it in favor of his switchblade. The Yakuza <b>boss</b> resorts to his sai once more. The two vigorously swing at each other, avoiding the other's weapon. The Yakuza <b>boss</b> kicks the Mafia <b>boss</b> into a boiler and charges at him, but the Mafia <b>boss</b> kicks back and pushes him away. The two recover and briefly glare at each other before resuming. Eventually, the Mafia <b>boss</b> shoves the Yakuza <b>boss</b> into the boiler and tries to stab him. The Yakuza <b>boss</b> avoids the blow and the Mafia <b>boss</b> inadvertently punctures a pipe. Steam spews out. He accidentally drops his knife, allowing the Yakuza <b>boss</b> to close with him. Just before the Yakuza <b>boss</b> can stab him with one of his sai, the Mafia <b>boss</b> pulls out his ice pick as a last resort and stabs the Yakuza’s arm, causing him to drop a sai. He seizes the Yakuza <b>boss</b> by his hair and slams his head into the punctured pipe, burning his face. He pulls the Yakuza <b>boss’s</b> head to the side so that his neck is exposed and slowly drives in the ice pick. The Yakuza slumps to the ground. The Mafia <b>boss</b> throws away his ice pick, lights a cigar in celebration and walks away.|$|R
