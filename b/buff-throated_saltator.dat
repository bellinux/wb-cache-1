5000|$|Saltator maximus, the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>saltator,</b> a seedeating {{bird species}} that breeds from southeastern Mexico to western Ecuador and northeastern Brazil ...|$|E
50|$|It {{appears to}} be rather close to the type species, the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>saltator,</b> and thus seems {{more likely than not}} to retain its genus name.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buff-throated</b> <b>saltator</b> (Saltator maximus) is a {{seed-eating}} bird. Traditionally {{placed in}} the cardinal family (Cardinalidae), it actually seems {{to be closer to}} the tanagers (Thraupidae). It breeds from southeastern Mexico to western Ecuador and northeastern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a species}} of dense vegetation. The <b>buff-throated</b> <b>saltator</b> feeds on fruit (e.g. of Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae), Trophis racemosa (Moraceae), and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba)), buds, nectar and slow-moving insects. It forages at low and mid levels, {{sometimes}} with mixed species flocks.|$|E
50|$|The genus Saltator is {{apparently}} polyphyletic. Whether the present species {{will remain in}} Saltator or eventually be moved to another genus remains to be seen. Somewhat similar in coloration to the <b>buff-throated</b> <b>saltator,</b> the genus' type species (which would retain the genus name), it resembles the probably well distant black-throated saltator or even the golden-billed saltator in other aspects.|$|E
50|$|The <b>buff-throated</b> <b>saltator</b> is {{on average}} 20 cm long and weighs 42 - 52 g. The adult has a slate-grey {{head with a}} white {{supercilium}} and a greenish crown. The upperparts are olive green, the underparts are grey becoming buff on the lower belly, and the throat is buff, edged with black. The thick convex bill and legs are black. Young birds are duller, and have a white-mottled blackish throat and breast, and brown markings on the lower underparts.|$|E
50|$|This bird is {{on average}} 24 cm long and weighs 85 g. The adult has a slate-grey {{head with a}} whitish supercilium. The upperparts are {{yellowish}} green, the underparts are pale grey, and the throat is white edged with black. The thick convex bill is black and the legs are brown. Young birds are duller, and have mottling on the breast and brown markings on the underparts. This species {{is similar to the}} <b>buff-throated</b> <b>saltator,</b> but is larger and has a darker head and paler underparts.|$|E
40|$|Five {{new species}} of Myrsidea {{parasitic}} on members of the avian family Cardinalidae are described. They and their type hosts are M. lightae ex the <b>Buff-throated</b> <b>Saltator,</b> Saltator maximus (Statius MÃ¼ller, 1776), M. markhafneri ex the Slatecolored Grosbeak, S. grossus (Linnaeus, 1766), M. pittendrighi ex the Streaked Saltator, S. striatipectus Lafresnaye, 1847, and M. johnklickai and M. sychrai ex the Blue-black Grosbeak, Cyanocompsa cyanoides (Lafresnaye, 1847). Results from sequences of {{a portion of the}} mitochondrial COI gene for several specimens of two of these species and other species of Myrsidea are presented.
