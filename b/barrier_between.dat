Local preservationists have supported a plan to redesign the highway and restore access to the waterfront that spurred the area's original development. The city received a $16.3 million grant to make this possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{behaviour}} of the Crusaders appalled the Greeks and Muslims, {{creating a}} lasting <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> the Latin world {{and both the}} Islamic and Orthodox religions.

5|$|The {{majority}} of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double- and triple-decker housing (though row houses are rare, found so commonly in other Northeast cities), {{a small number of}} high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. Interstate 95 serves as a physical <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End.|$|E
5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great {{strategic}} importance because the Shannon and its lowlands provided a natural <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E

5|$|In {{the interim}} period, work went into {{expanding}} the six lane freeway through Toronto and Markham. In early 1998, the MTO {{announced plans for}} two contracts to widen Highway404 south of Highway7. The first contract converted the grass median into an additional lane in each direction with a central <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> them. High-mast lighting was also installed, replacing the unique luminaires used on the freeway. The second contract resulted in an additional lane in each direction on the outside the existing freeway south of Steeles Avenue, making it ten lanes wide. The proposal to eventually convert the inner lanes into HOV lanes was announced at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Jervis had the {{reputation}} as a disciplinarian and {{put in place a}} new system that would ensure that the men in the Mediterranean fleet did not mutiny. To begin with the admiral wrote a new set of standing orders. For example, Jervis divided the seamen and marines and berthed the two separately putting the marines between the officers aft and the men forward. Thus he created an effective <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> officers and potentially unruly crews.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical {{pest control}} {{is the use}} of {{hands-on}} techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage {{and is one of the}} oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.|$|E

5|$|Old Louisville's {{boundaries}} are Kentucky Street to the north, Avery Street (Cardinal Boulevard) to the south, I-65 to the east, the CSX railroad tracks to the west. Originally, the neighborhood extended {{all the way}} to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed for parking lots and light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size of its main campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> it and Shelby Park neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1989, OTA {{approved}} {{a contract to}} transplant approximately 290 live trees {{in the path of}} the turnpike to locations along the edge of the right-of-way. There, the trees would serve as a <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E
5|$|The Captaincy General of Chile {{followed}} a process analogous {{to that of}} the May Revolution, and elected a Government Junta that inaugurated the brief period known as Patria Vieja. The Junta was defeated in 1814 at the Battle of Rancagua, and the subsequent Reconquista of Chile would make it a royalist stronghold once more. The Andes provided an effective natural <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> the Argentine revolutionaries and Chile, so there was no military confrontation between them until the Crossing of the Andes, led by José de San Martín in 1817, a campaign that resulted in the defeat of the Chilean royalists.|$|E

5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers crashing into the safety <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the peaceful resolution of the Berlin Blockade.|$|E
5|$|Intelligent, passionate, and {{the moral}} center of the family, Lisa Simpson, at eight years old, is the second child of Homer and Marge, younger sister of Bart, and older sister of Maggie. Lisa's high intellect and liberal {{political}} stance creates a <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> her and other children her age, therefore she {{is a bit of}} a loner and social outcast. Lisa is a vegetarian, a strong environmentalist, a feminist, and a Buddhist. Lisa enjoys many hobbies, including reading and playing the baritone saxophone. Lisa's character develops many times over the course of the show: she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13. A strong liberal, Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes and stands with the Tibetan independence movement. She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons– including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books– and inspired a line of merchandise.|$|E

5|$|The {{fish and}} {{bivalves}} {{were found in}} clay which was probably a lagoon, and the dinosaurs and lizards in sand which probably was land, perhaps a beach; turtles and crocodiles were found in both. Freshwater snails were found in clay {{that may have been}} shallow, drying lakes behind a sandy <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> lagoon and sea, in a setting perhaps similar to the Florida Keys or the southwestern coast of Jutland. Dinosaurs may have fed there, based on the remains of plants and small land animals, and theropods may have hunted along the shore. Bornholm and Scania appear to be the only places were remains of the Scandinavian-Russian fauna of the Early Cretaceous can be found. Further investigations there may show whether this fauna has European or Asian affinities.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Oslo had two stations, {{the larger}} Oslo East Station (or OsloØ, {{located at the}} spot of the current OsloS) and Oslo West Station (OsloV), which served the Drammen Line. This caused a {{physical}} <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> the {{two parts of the}} railway network, only connected by the Oslo Port Line which ran partly in city streets. Formal planning of a central station and a tunnel connecting the Drammen Line to OsloØ started in 1938, and the final plans were approved in 1968. The Oslo Tunnel opened on 1 June 1980, and made it possible to close OsloV in 1989. Nationaltheatret saw a major upgrade in 1999, when it was expanded to four tracks, and from 2008 to 2010, the tunnel will see a major technical upgrade. There are plans to build a second tunnel to increase train capacity west of Oslo.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events of the game, three entities known as the Warring Triad initiated a conflict that would come to be called the War of the Magi. This quarrel grew to catastrophic proportions, unleashing magical energy into the world which transformed afflicted humans into espers—magical beings who themselves were used as soldiers in the war. Eventually realizing the horrific calamity wrought by their hands, the Triad returned free will to the espers and sealed their own powers, becoming stone statues. Their only request was that the espers ensure their power remain locked away so it might never be used again. The espers carried their stone gods to a hidden land, sealing both the statues and themselves off from the realm of humans. The concept of magic gradually faded to legend and myth as mankind built a society extolling science and technology. At the game's opening, the most advanced nation is the Empire, a cruel and expanding dictatorship led by Emperor Gestahl and his clownish general Kefka Palazzo. Approximately eighteen years before {{the events of the}} game begin, the <b>barrier</b> <b>between</b> the espers' land {{and the rest of the}} world weakened. Soon after, Gestahl takes advantage of this and attacks the espers' land, capturing several of them.|$|E
