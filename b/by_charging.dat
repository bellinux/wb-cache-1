5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, {{both male and}} female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to themselves or their mate <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> at them. Males tend to fight more than females, and attack each other by repeatedly pecking at their rival's chest, ripping out feathers and even skin on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|Sitting Bull {{stayed with}} the show for four months before {{returning}} home. During that time, audiences considered him a celebrity and romanticized him as a warrior.

5|$|As he {{attempted}} to withdraw with the wounded soldier, Bleak was confronted by two more Chinese. Putting down the wounded soldier, Bleak reportedly surprised the Chinese soldiers <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> them and smashing their heads together {{with such force that}} he may have fractured the skulls of {{one or both of the}} assailants before pushing them out of his way. Eventually, all 20 men of the patrol returned to the UN lines, but a third of them were wounded. Bleak was credited with saving the patrol, both by promptly treating the wounded and by aggressively attacking and killing or neutralizing five Chinese soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> that, when Chandler was a senator, he {{had voted}} in favor of declaring World War II, but soon after {{resigned}} his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor}} of the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
5|$|After the Civil War, Oxford Castle served {{primarily}} {{as the local}} prison. As with other prisons at the time, the owners, in this case Christ Church College, leased the castle to wardens who would profit <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> prisoners for their board and lodging. The prison also had a gallows to execute prisoners, such as Mary Blandy in 1752. For most of the 18th century, the castle prison was run by the local Etty and Wisdom families and was in increasing disrepair. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard visited the castle several times, and criticised its size and quality, including {{the extent to which}} vermin infested the prison. Partly {{as a result of this}} criticism, it was decided by the County authorities to rebuild the Oxford Prison.|$|E

5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until {{it became clear that}} the latter ship was out of control and then turned north in an effort to get behind Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage in the mist and fog.|$|E
5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> the predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E
5|$|The debtors' {{prison at}} the castle {{came in for}} {{particular}} scrutiny. It emerged {{that out of the}} 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels' Castle, 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of £5 or less (£373 in 2009 prices), increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes. A penalty of up to £7 (£522 in 2009 prices) was also being charged for each case, making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way. The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors' prison, which could hold up to six inmates at a time, was appointed by the constable, and made part of his income <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> each prisoner one shilling a week {{for the use of the}} beds in the prison; with no other public funding, prisoners depended on friends or relatives for food and other essentials, or from donations from their original parishes.|$|E

5|$|When the loyalist {{reinforcements}} {{rolled into}} the capital aboard tanks and armored vehicles and began to wrest the initiative, the rebels began to break. After a brief, violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. The casualties included {{a large number of}} anti-Diệm civilians; Thi exhorted them to bring down the Ngô family <b>by</b> <b>charging</b> the palace; 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers as they invaded the grounds. After the failed coup, Đông, Thi and other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a long-time Diệm opponent. Diệm promptly reneged on his promises, and intensified his authoritarian rule and crackdowns on dissidents. Almost three years after the incident, Diệm opened the trial for those involved in the coup on 8 July 1963. Thi and his fellow exiled officers were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia. In the meantime, Thi lived self-sufficiently in Cambodia for three years.|$|E
