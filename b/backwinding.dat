50|$|The {{video was}} filmed at Telecine Cell in London, using a motion control system. The entire video {{and all the}} effects were shot on a single 400 ft roll of film, by {{multiple}} exposure and frame-accurate <b>backwinding</b> of the film strip. The graphics were shot {{as a series of}} secondary exposures using a TV monitor, and the flashing lights were created with an LED strip board, also exposed on the same piece of film. At Gondry's insistence, no edits were made after the film was exposed; the only post-processing consisted of colour correction during transfer of the piece to videotape.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study assessing respiratory symptoms in individuals employed in wool textile mills {{in the north of}} England relations between symptoms of chronic bronchitis, breathlessness and wheeze, and rhinitis and current exposure to airborne mass concentration of dust were shown. As preliminary steps in defining the potential hazard associated with dust from the air of wool mills the ability of inspirable dust, collected from the air of wool textile mills, to cause inflammation when injected into the lungs of rats was determined. Dusts were collected from the beginning of wool processing (opening) in one factory and from the middle (combing) and late (<b>backwinding)</b> stages of the process in two other factories. Ability of the dusts to cause inflammation was assessed by instillation into the lungs of rats followed by bronchoalveolar lavage. All the dusts caused some inflammation which peaked on day 1 and did not persist beyond one week. A distinctive aggregation response of mononuclear cells in the lavage, however, had a different time course, peaking at day 7. An attempt was made to determine how the wool mill dusts caused inflammation and experiments showed that the dusts themselves had no inherent chemotactic activity but that they did have a pronounced ability to generate chemotaxins in serum and so could activate complement in lung fluid. In addition, dust collected from ledges in the mills had the ability to injure epithelial cells in vitro which could also contribute to inflammation. A role for endotoxin in the inflammatory activity of the dusts was not discounted and a leachate of the dust had the ability to cause inflammation when injected into the lungs of rats. Wool mill dust {{is likely to be a}} complex mixture of materials and these experiments represent a preliminary approach to understanding the biological activity of the whole unfractionated dust and further studies are in progress to define more accurately the toxic material(s) in the dust...|$|E
50|$|In 1930, a large {{electric}} motor was installed {{to replace the}} steam engine, chimney and boiler house, which were pulled down. After some storm damage (sails <b>backwinded),</b> the mill had to stop grinding under wind power, and the City Council had the sails and the fantail removed. Milling with the {{electric motor}} ceased entirely in 1933. In 1939, a new white-painted cap was built onto the milltower. The mill's last known miller was Thomas Mollet; Eliza Gutch and her family were the last known owners of the mill.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Larsen {{was never}} in top shape and did not win any {{international}} titles. His best results were 5th on K1-500 in the European Championships, and 6th on K1-1000 in the World Championships. This wake-up call may well {{have turned out to}} sharpen his focus towards the 2008 Olympics for which he was a clear gold candidate. After a disappointing 2006 he was back on track in 2007 and won the Gold medal on K1-1000 at the European Championships, and he finished 3rd in the World Championships later the same year.Before the 2009 season Verås Larsen decided to go for K2 with Jacob Norenberg, and did not race internationally in K1. Together they won the 2009 European Championships at K2-1000 in Germany and finished 5th in the World Championships in Halifax later the same year.Verås Larsen held the individual (K-1) 1000m world record of 3:24.920 (Duisburg 2004) until it was bettered by Ben Fouhy of New Zealand (Poznań 2006) with the time of 3:24.495 (<b>backwind</b> of 2 m/s).|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} 8 mm format {{was quickly}} displaced, {{for the most}} part, by the Super 8 mm film format - which offers cartridge loading, a 50% larger frame size and electric-powered cameras - from the mid-1960s onwards. Super 8 was criticized that the film gates in some cheaper Super 8 cameras were plastic, as was the pressure plate built into the cartridge; while the standard 8 cameras had a permanent metal film gate that was regarded as more reliable in keeping the film flat and the image in focus. In reality, {{this was not the}} case, since the plastic pressure plate could be moulded to far smaller tolerances than their metal counterparts could be machined. Another criticism of Super 8 was that more sophisticated standard 8 mm cameras permit <b>backwind</b> of the film - difficult but not impossible with a Super 8 cartridge - enabling simple double-exposure and dissolve effects to be made in-camera. Finally, Super 8's smaller sprocket holes, while allowing a larger frame size, were also inherently more liable to tear.|$|R
5000|$|Accidental jibes {{may occur}} when running dead {{downwind}} {{and the wind}} catches the leeward side of the sail. When the wind direction crosses the centerline of the boat without jibing the point of sail {{is referred to as}} [...] "by the lee" [...] When sailing [...] "by the lee" [...] {{the outer edge of the}} mainsail is facing slightly into the wind. Rolling motion, slight changes in the boat heading or wind direction can cause an unexpected and surprising jibe, suddenly and forcefully flipping the mainsail to the opposite side of the boat. Do not sail [...] "by the lee" [...] except for brief durations (such as to avoid an obstacle), and only when keeping all crew clear of the boom swing and the arc of the mainsheet sweep. A crew member can be used to help hold the boom in place in smaller boats. When sailing directly downwind, unintentional jibes can also occur; diligent helmsmanship is required to prevent [...] "by the lee" [...] conditions and keeping clear of the boom sweep is advised. In larger stable boats, a preventer can help by keeping the boom held forward, preventing the boom motion of a jibe, especially in light winds. However, in high winds, the [...] "sheeting in action" [...] of a preventer can cause severe rounding up on the other tack. Smaller boats may find that a <b>backwinded</b> sail is more heel inducing than allowing a jibe. See broach, Chinese gybe and death roll.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{characterizes the}} mass and {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} fine particle air pollution over several cities in South Asia and quantifies how major sources impact the observed levels by using Chemical Mass Balance modeling with organic compounds as tracers. During February 1999, {{as part of the}} INDOEX program, a study was conducted to measure the size distribution and chemical composition of the fine particles in a remote island in Maldives off the coast of India. We found that the fine particle concentrations were comparable to those found in major cities in the United States, and were surprisingly high for a background site. 10 -day <b>backwind</b> trajectories pointed the source region towards the Indian subcontinent; other INDOEX studies confirmed the presence of a thick haze layer over the Indian Ocean and the subcontinent {{during the time of the}} experiment. Motivated by these findings, a detailed analysis of ambient PM 2. 5 was carried out in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chandigarhfour cities located upwind of the island in Maldives. Seasonality of the fine particle concentrations was observed in each of these cities with the highest concentrations occurring during the wintertime and the lowest concentrations during the summer. Size distribution and chemical composition of the fine particle emissions from five Bangladeshi biomass (rice straw, coconut leaves, dried cow dung, synthetic biomass log, and jackfruit wood) and three Asian coals (Bangladeshi, Indian, and Chinese) were characterized and important source signatures were identified. Finally, recently developed chemical tracer techniques were applied to the ambient samples from North India to differentiate between the contributions from the many different source types. The emission profiles and source signatures from the source tests conducted previously along with the ones conducted using the Indian Subcontinent fuels were used as inputs to the model. These results serve several purposes. First, they provide a description of the mass and detailed inorganic and organic chemical characteristics of fine particulate matter conducted for the first time ever in this region. Second, the source apportionment study will help to define the relative importance of those sources that should be included within an air quality control program. Chemical tracer techniques are particularly attractive for application in regions that have not been studied previously because they are able to yield rapid insights into the causes of a local air pollution problem before the completion of an accurate emissions inventory. Third, the source tests results will prove useful in constructing and evaluating regional emission inventory and assessing source impacts on air quality. Fourth, this work has been carried out with collaborations from Georgia Tech and several other Indian research institutions where pollution control personnel in India was trained in the operation of air sampling equipments that were left for continued monitoring, thus contributing to technology transfer and knowledge transfer from the US.
