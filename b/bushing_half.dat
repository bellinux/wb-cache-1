Yet feel I little of the cool bleak air, [...] Or of the dead leaves {{rustling}} drearily, [...] Or of those silver lamps that burn on high, Or of the distance from home's pleasant lair: For I am brimfull of the friendliness [...] That in a little cottage I have found; Of fair-hair'd Milton's eloquent distress, [...] And all his love for gentle Lycid drown'd; Of lovely Laura in her light green dress, [...] And faithful Petrarch gloriously crown'd.|$|R
50|$|The APD patrol {{officer who}} rescued Paulson is outraged that the detectives refuse to pursue Hansen. He surreptitiously photocopies {{information}} about the case and sends it to the Alaska State Troopers. Meanwhile, state trooper Jack Halcombe (Nicolas Cage) has been called to investigate a female body that {{was found in the}} <b>bush,</b> <b>half</b> eaten by bears. The police connect the case to other missing girls, who have disappeared after going to what they thought were legitimate photo shoots. With secret information from the APD officer, Halcombe connects the other cases to Paulson's and starts to put together a portrait of Hansen. Paulson details how Hansen kept her captive, and that she escaped from his car when he tried to transfer her to his bush plane.|$|R

60|$|Even {{as he had}} guessed, {{the first}} charge carried the howling warriors but a short {{distance}} into the open--a shrill, weird challenge from the ape-man being all that was necessary to send them scurrying back to the <b>bush.</b> For <b>half</b> an hour they pranced and yelled their courage to the sticking-point, and again essayed a charge.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to classify Datura as to its species, and it often happens that the descriptions of new species are accepted prematurely. Later, these [...] "new species" [...] {{are found to be}} simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as D. wrightii and D. inoxia, are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, Datura species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location. The same species, when growing in a half-shady, damp location can develop into a flowering <b>bush</b> <b>half</b> as tall as an adult human of average height, but when growing in a very dry location, will only grow into a thin plant not much more than ankle-high, with tiny flowers and a few miniature leaves.|$|R
60|$|Austin felt {{inclined}} {{to agree with}} him, for they had blundered through the shadowy <b>bush</b> for <b>half</b> an hour, and its hot, saturated atmosphere made exertion almost impossible.

50|$|<b>Bush</b> lost <b>half</b> of his vocal {{range and}} was {{sometimes}} unable to talk. RCA dropped him in 1974 after three albums, {{he developed a}} drug habit, and was often stricken with performance anxiety when {{he was able to}} perform at all. After several misdiagnoses, doctors diagnosed the cause in 1978, when they discovered he had a rare neurological disorder called spasmodic dysphonia. Although this did not prevent him from recording, Bush's career began to take a downturn. He worked with a vocal coach in 1985, and was able to regain seventy percent of his original voice.|$|R
60|$|They {{started on}} {{a run for the}} {{overturned}} car and as they drew near the sound of moaning from the wreck gave wings to their feet.

If dead there was nothing for them to do. If unconscious she could receive attention later. The moans from beneath the wrecked car told them that there was where aid was needed first.|$|R
50|$|The yeheb nut {{bush has}} been known to the Somali nomads for centuries. The first {{recovery}} of his existence dates back to 1871, when the Italian Robecchi noticed the plant when traversing Somalia to Bari. The {{bush has been}} named after Cordeaux, a botanic who first obtained botanical specimens in the Ogaden province (Ethiopia) which were found to be a leguminous plant belonging to a hitherto unknown genus in the Caesalpinaceae. Afterward, Hemsley gave the plant the generic name Cordeauxia, with the specific epithet edulis (edible).In 1929, the yeheb <b>bush</b> covered <b>half</b> of the vegetation of large territories in Somalia and south-east Ethiopia. In 1983 the distribution has been reduced to small regions.|$|R
6000|$|You gaze astounded. Ten steps downward, and {{the vision}} is gone. [...] The green cloud has closed again over your head, {{and you are}} {{stumbling}} {{in the darkness of}} the <b>bush,</b> <b>half</b> blinded by the sudden change from the blaze to the shade. Beware. 'Take care of the Croc-chien!' shouts your companion: and you are aware of, not a foot from your face, a long, green, curved whip, armed with pairs of barbs some four inches apart; and are aware also, at the same moment, that another has seized you by the arm, another by the knees, and that you must back out, unless you are willing to part with your clothes first, and your flesh afterwards. You back out, and find that you have walked into the tips--luckily only into the tips--of the fern-like fronds of a trailing and climbing palm such as you see in the Botanic Gardens. That came from the East, and furnishes the rattan-canes. This {138a} furnishes the gri-gri- canes, and is rather worse to meet, if possible, than the rattan. [...] Your companion, while he helps you to pick the barbs out, calls the palm laughingly by another name, 'Suelta-mi-Ingles'; and tells you the old story of the Spanish soldier at San Josef. You are near the water now; for here is a thicket of Balisiers. {138b} Push through, under their great plantain-like leaves. Slip down the muddy bank to that patch of gravel. See first, though, that it is not tenanted already by a deadly Mapepire, or rattlesnake, which has not the grace, as his cousin in North America has, to use his rattle.|$|R

His eyes were fire, and his heart was ice.|$|R
5000|$|I write {{only what}} I have seen, I might mention that pigs and dogs running loose were {{burned to death}} - birds were {{dropping}} down off the trees before the fire in all directions - oppossums, kangaroos, {{and all sorts of}} beasts can be had today ready roasted all over the <b>bush.</b> Fully one <b>half</b> of the timber in this neighbourhood has been burned or blown down, and all the grass has been burnt.|$|R

50|$|The Timber Trail, {{originally}} {{known as}} the Central North Island Rail Trail or Pureora Timber Trail, in the North Island of New Zealand is an 83 km cycleway (also used by walkers and hunters) in Pureora Forest Park, fully opened in 2013, with 35 bridges (built by DoC staff, community max workers, or contractors), including 8 large suspension bridges (one of the longest on a NZ cycleway, much more stable than the swing bridges used on older tracks). It {{is one of several}} cycleways developed as part of the New Zealand Cycle Trail and passes through podocarp forests of rimu, totara, miro, matai and kahikatea, as well as some exotic forestry and regenerating <b>bush.</b> About <b>half</b> the trail is on the track-bed of an old bush tramway, including a spiral and tunnel.|$|R
6000|$|So you {{can imagine}} {{that in some ways}} the judge's house was a pretty {{difficult}} house to go to. I mean you can see how awfully hard it must have been for Mr. Pupkin. I tell you it took some nerve to step up on that piazza and say, in a perfectly natural, off-hand way: [...] "Oh, how do you do, judge? Is Miss Zena in? No, I won't stay, thanks; I think I ought to be going. I simply called." [...] A man who can do that has got to have a pretty fair amount of savoir what do you call it, and he's got to be mighty well shaved and have his cameo pin put in his tie at a pretty undeniable angle before he can tackle it. Yes, and even then he may need to hang round behind the lilac <b>bushes</b> for <b>half</b> an hour first, and cool off. And he's apt to make pretty good time down Oneida Street on the way back.|$|R
60|$|They {{set out a}} {{few minutes}} later, taking with them a pole which had a big iron hook lashed to it and a long Indian salmon spear. There was a small fork {{at one end of}} the latter on which were placed two nicely made bone barbs {{attached}} to the haft by strips of sinew. Harry removed them to show Frank that they would slip off their sockets easily. Leaving the clearing, they struck into a narrow trail through the <b>bush,</b> and after <b>half</b> an hour's scramble over fallen logs and through thick fern they reached the river.|$|R

Later that night, Hornblower takes Bush to an exclusive establishment, where he plays whist with Admiral Edward Pellew, Captain Hammond, and Hammond's nephew Jack, who aspires to serve under Hornblower. Hornblower's whist winnings are enough to pay the rent he owes to his landlady, Mrs. Mason; Mrs. Mason's daughter Maria is attracted to him.|$|R
5000|$|Oregon was won by Democratic nominee Barack Obama with a 16.4% {{margin of}} victory. Prior to the election, all 17 news {{organizations}} considered this a state Obama would win, or otherwise {{considered as a}} safe blue state.

The last Republican presidential nominee to carry Oregon was Ronald Reagan in his 1984 landslide reelection. Although George W. <b>Bush</b> came within <b>half</b> a percent of Al Gore in 2000, he lost the state to John Kerry by four points, and the Republicans have not seriously contested here since.

6000|$|All these dispositions duly made, at 10 A.M. on the 29th December we mounted our animals, and, {{guided by}} Mad Said, trotted round the {{northern}} {{side of the}} Wilensi table-mountain down a lane fenced with fragrant dog roses.

The path would be safe to nought less surefooted than a mule: we rode slowly over rolling stones, steps of micaceous grit, and through thorny <b>bush</b> for about <b>half</b> an hour. In the plain below appeared a village of the Gerad's Midgans, who came out to see us pass, and followed the strangers to some distance.
