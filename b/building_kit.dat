5000|$|Starting in 1924, Sutnar {{designed}} toys {{consisting of}} simple geometric structures {{of animals and}} puppets. He attempted to introduce modern aesthetics into children's toys by developing a <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> that consisted of sawtooth roofs, cones, and pieces in the colors of red, blue, and white (this remained a prototype). He also wrote a children's book {{on the future of}} traffic in Transport: Next Half Century. Sutnar created art-oriented toys, i.e. [...] "Apisonadora" [...] (construction vehicle).|$|E
50|$|MADtv parodied Cook Islands in its twelfth-season premiere episode, which aired September 16, 2006. The parody {{involved}} {{giving the}} white challengers significantly easier tasks, {{such as a}} swimming challenge which allowed the white challengers to use a canoe, or building a fire with a fire <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> that consisted of gasoline and a DVD on how to build fire, the Hispanic contestants received flint, the Asians received a matchstick, and the African-Americans were given a glass of water.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Machine was {{primarily}} made of plastic. This was unique for its time. Innovations in plastic and injection moulding allowed toy manufacturers to produce parts less expensively than previous manufacturing techniques. Packaged as a <b>building</b> <b>kit,</b> the box contained 44 individual pieces {{along with a}} plastic wrench. Once assembled, Mr. Machine was complete with a top hat, bell, swinging arms, and an articulated jaw. The toy’s clockwork mechanism of wheels and gears could be seen through the its transparent plastic body. Mr. Machine “walked” forward as {{his arms and legs}} moved and his mouth opened and closed as its internal gears turned. The toy could vocalize by emitting a mechanical “Aw!”, as if he were talking.|$|E

5000|$|Moto Martin is a French {{engineering}} company, {{started by}} Georges Martin, {{known for its}} motosport inspired or Café racer style racing frame kits for motorcycles. The original Moto Martin frame designs {{were based on the}} work of Fritz Egli. The company also manufactured its own wheels, body kits and, later, kitcars. Georges Martin capitalized upon <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> cars at a time when many riders in Europe couldn't afford to build their own modified cars. One model is known as a KZ900 Turbo. Cycle World in 1987 stated that [...] "Moto Martin's products have a reputation for high-quality construction that places them above the level of most other frame manufacturers." [...] Moto Martin motocycles have been compared to the likes of Bimota, Harris, Nico Bakker, and Honda RGB.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, SEAT won {{the title}} by 70 points, ahead of Skoda in second place, {{with the latter}} company debuting their Skoda Octavia Kit Car. Also <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> cars {{for the first time}} in 1997 were Hyundai, with their Hyundai Coupe Kit Car, whilst Nissan entered a 1300cc Micra Kit Car and a 2000cc Almera GTI Kit Car, with Citroen and Peugeot {{entering}} the 1600cc Saxo Kit Car and 106 Maxi respectively. Gilles Panizzi caused a major upset when he finished third outright on the all-tarmac Rallye Catalunya in his Peugeot 306 Maxi, defeating all bar two of the World Championship cars. To prove it was not a fluke Panizzi did the same on the Tour de Corse just weeks later with team mate François Delecour finishing fourth. This emphasised a split in W2L car production with the French manufacturers building tarmac specialised cars that could win outright at the cost of making them uncompetitive on gravel events. With several national championships in western Europe running all-tarmac series it became a viable option.|$|E
50|$|By late 1961 {{he succeeded}} in {{producing}} the first four hydrogel contact lenses on a home-made apparatus built using a children's <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> (Merkur) and a bicycle dynamo belonging {{to one of his}} sons, and a bell transformer. All the moulds and glass tubing needed to dose them with monomer were also individually made by himself. On Christmas afternoon, {{with the help of his}} wife Linda, using the machine on his kitchen table, he finally succeeded. He tried the lenses in his own eyes and although they were the wrong power they were comfortable. Thus, he invented a new way of manufacturing the lenses using a centrifugal casting procedure. A few days later, he completed his patent application and produced over 100 lenses by spin casting. He built several new prototype machines using Merkur toys with increasing numbers of spindles which required the stronger motor taken from his gramophone. With these rudimental devices, in the first four months of 1962 they made 5,500 lenses. The early experimental lenses were called Geltakt and the later production lenses Spofalens after the state enterprise SPOFA which manufactured them.|$|E

50|$|In 1987 Phil Ware {{formed a}} {{syndicate}} to acquire moulds and basic kit from the United Kingdom. Returning to England Ware approached GT40 kit car manufacturer KVAs owner Ken Attwell about acquiring moulds to produce GT40's in New Zealand. Agreement was reached with Attwell selling a disused set of moulds. KVA had taken its moulds from a genuiine Mk 1 GT40. A KVA Ctype chassis was also purchased {{to be used}} as the chassis design for Wares Ford GT40 replicas. After the initial 10 car bodies were built, Ware was approached by a number of people wanting to acquire one. He formed GT40 Replication Limited for that purpose and had Replicar Developments improve the mould quality. Replicar were <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> car bodies called Ibis which were designed for Mini's and later the Wasp, a car of their own design. John Simpson, a specialist automotive engineer, improved the GT40s suspension and chassis. In total 35 kits (including the initial 10) in total were sold, some turnkey. David Harvey acquired the business from Ware in 2002. Harveys holding company was Nelson based GT 40 NZ Limited. This was renamed in May 2010 as GT40 & Lola Parts Limited.|$|E
50|$|The {{next day}} the group enters the Desolate Mountains, which were once part of the Nameless One's kingdom. They get {{attacked}} by mysterious soldiers, who succeed in getting Shimmer entangled in a net. While seeking refuge on a ledge, the disguised cauldron is nearly lost. A sudden avalanche that is triggered sweeps them from the ledge and onto trees that had been broken loose and are being carried on a river {{that runs through the}} mountains. Monkey ends up on a tree with Thorn, finding that despite what he has {{had to put up with}} Shimmer, he sticks by her, because she was the first person in his life who showed him kindness. Thorn vows to prove that he is as worthy of her esteem as Indigo. Finding Shimmer, Indigo and Civet close by, they pass by a small, strange island with an odd, egg-shaped building on it. They are forced to seek refuge on the island in order to escape a waterfall the river empties into, and are helped by a mysterious, giant white dog. Trying to leave, they find that they cannot fly or swim away from the island due to a magical barrier in place around it, which also nullifies magic. Left with a boat <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> by the mysterious dog, they try various means of constructing a boat, which fail. The dog is not the only other being on the island, but they are unable to determine who it could be.|$|E
50|$|Thorn {{figures out}} that the barrier spell is selective, {{filtering}} in certain things while blocking out others. The group searches the egg-shaped house on the island for suitable flotation devices, but when tested none proves able to float past the barrier. After being goaded by Indigo, Thorn throws a pebble in his hand into the river in frustration, which skips several times. He realizes that clay is {{an exception to the}} barrier spell, or otherwise the island would have silted up. Monkey recalls a large lamp at the egg house that might work, which Shimmer manages to save after the mysterious dog hears of their plans. Although Monkey ties it up with rope, it manages to escape and succeeds in destroying the lamp when they try to bring it to the beach. However Thorn proposes using multiple smaller clay jars, which they are able to secure. Monkey finds a patch of human skin inside one of the jars, which is buried. Finding that the jars work, a raft is built out of them, but the reeds used to bind it prevent it from working. The glue left in the boat <b>building</b> <b>kit</b> proves to be quite strong and waterproof, so a smaller raft is made which proves successful, although it can only transport one person at a time. The surplus jars are destroyed, and Shimmer in her dragon form manages to float off the island, helping the humans cross the river.|$|E
