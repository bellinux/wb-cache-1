25|$|The {{polyphenol}} {{composition of}} olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, {{as measured by}} the Folin method, are 117mg/100 g in <b>black</b> <b>olives</b> and 161mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for <b>black</b> <b>olives,</b> anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82mg/100 g in <b>black</b> <b>olives,</b> and 56 and 59mg/100 g in green olives.|$|E

25|$|Olives are {{harvested}} {{in the autumn}} and winter. More specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, green olives are picked {{from the end of}} September to about the middle of November.

25|$|Pizza strips are {{prepared}} in Italian bakeries {{and sold in}} most supermarkets and convenience stores. They are rectangular strips of pizza without cheese. Their rich flavor comes solely from a dense, zesty tomato paste baked on a half-inch (1.3cm) thick pan pizza crust, and may be enjoyed warm or cold. Party pizza is a box of these pizza strips. Spinach pies are similar to a calzone but filled with seasoned spinach instead of meat, sauce, and cheese. Variations can include <b>black</b> <b>olives</b> or pepperoni with the spinach.|$|E

500|$|Pizza, or as David notes [...] "pissaladina or pissaladière" [...] in Provence (the cuisines of Mediterranean France and Italy having {{something}} in common), {{is a piece}} of bread dough rolled out thin, with a topping which varies from place to place, but is generally much simpler than those in the English-speaking world. In Naples this is tomato, anchovies and buffalo mozzarella. In San Remo it is onions cooked in olive oil, with salted sardines. The Provençal variety uses onions, <b>black</b> <b>olives,</b> and anchovies.|$|E
500|$|The version {{known in}} Nice {{in the late}} 19th century was a basic {{combination}} of tomatoes, [...] anchovies and olive oil, described as [...] "simple food for poor people". Over time, [...] other fresh and mostly raw ingredients {{were added to the}} salad as served in Nice. A 1903 recipe by Henri Heyraud in a book called La Cuisine à Nice included tomatoes, anchovies, artichokes, olive oil, red peppers and <b>black</b> <b>olives,</b> but excluded tuna and lettuce. The dressing included olive oil, [...] vinegar, [...] mustard and fines herbes.|$|E

500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, <b>black</b> <b>olives,</b> basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{notes of}} Grenache are berry fruit such as raspberries and strawberries. When yields {{are kept in}} check, Grenache-based wines can develop complex and intense notes of blackcurrants, black cherries, <b>black</b> <b>olives,</b> coffee, gingerbread, honey, leather, black pepper, tar, spices, and roasted nuts. When yields are increased, more overtly earthy and herbal notes emerge that tend to quickly fade on the palate. The very low-yielding old vines of Priorat can impart dark black fruits and notes of figs and tar with many traits similar to the Italian wine Amarone. Rosado or rosé Grenaches are often characterized by their strawberry and cream notes while fortified vin doux nautrels and Australian [...] "port style" [...] wines exhibits coffee and nutty tawny-like notes.|$|E

Goat cheese, sheeps cheese, Swiss cheese, Parmegiano, stracchino, caciocavallo, torolone, how many cheeses I don't know the names of! But they cost about the same as in Sicily, eighteen francs, twenty francs, twenty-five francs the kilo. And there is lovely ham--thirty and thirty-five francs the kilo. There is a little fresh butter too--thirty or thirty-two francs the kilo. Most of the butter, however, is tinned in Milan. It costs the same as the fresh. There are splendid piles of salted <b>black</b> <b>olives,</b> and huge bowls of green salted olives. There are chickens and ducks and wild-fowl: at eleven and twelve and fourteen francs a kilo. There is mortadella, the enormous Bologna sausage, thick as a church pillar: 16 francs: and there are various sorts of smaller sausage, salami, to be eaten in slices. A wonderful abundance of food, glowing and shining. We are rather late for fish, especially on Friday.

40|$|Now-a-days {{the quest}} for foods with high {{flavonoid}} polyphenols content, lower fat concentration and relative high proportion of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fatty acids is increasing. Following this tendency green and <b>black</b> <b>olive</b> pastes applying soy cream or cream of animal origin were produced equating a subsequent industrial output, and the rheological, physicochemical and sensory characteristics of were characterized. It {{was found that the}} cohesiveness, adhesiveness and hardness of the <b>black</b> <b>olive</b> paste having cream of animal origin showed minimal values. Among samples the moisture varied between 67. 15 - 72. 16 % and the inorganic residue of the <b>black</b> <b>olive</b> pastes were also significantly lower from the green olive pastes. Minimum and maximum pH values were measured in green olive paste having soy cream and black paste with cream of animal origin, respectively. The crude fat showed significant differences among the olive pastes, whereas the protein content did not vary significantly. The colour of the black paste with cream of animal origin and soy were slightly orange, whereas the green paste remained green. The sensory analysis of the <b>black</b> <b>olive</b> paste including cream of animal origin showed lower average values for consistency and appearance attributes but the opposite occurred with the salty taste and overall assessment. Concerning to the aroma, the <b>black</b> <b>olive</b> pastes showed the highest values, while the green olive pastes kept similar values. It is concluded that the higher pH of the <b>black</b> <b>olive</b> pastes in conjunction with the water contents limits the shelf life and clearly pointed the need a careful microbial control. Considering that the colour parameters of a food is the first contact point of the consumer, these descriptors in the green olive pastes also seemed to have better acceptance, whereas preferences did not followed healthy options...|$|R
