40|$|A newly {{designed}} apparatus for {{experimental studies of}} pyroclastic flows consists of a cylindrical conduit that is filled with samples of natural volcanic products (tephra). <b>Blowing</b> <b>nozzles</b> in the base plate of the conduit are connected to a volume of highly pressurized gas. Opening of fast solenoid valves results in impulse-like coupling of the released gas to the sample. The system was designed so that the range of mechanical energy transferred to the particle mass in the conduit reflects the mechanical energy observed and measured during fragmentation experiments with melts of similar composition. Depending on the specific mechanical energy (SME) of the system, which results from Delta PV/m, where Delta P is gas overpressure (i. e., pressure > atmospheric), V is gas volume, and m is sample mass, different behaviors are observed. If SME > 2. 6 kJ/kg, a dilute plume develops, and particles are sedimented by fallout exclusively.

Flow visualization photographs were obtained for angles of attack up to 30 deg and sideslip angles up to 10 deg. The sensitivity of the vortex flows to changes in flap deflection angle, nozzle position, and jet momentum coefficient was determined. Deflection of the leading edge flap delayed flow separation {{and the formation of}} the wing vortex to higher angles of attack. Spanwise blowing delayed the breakdown of the wing vortex to farther outboard and to higher angles of attack. Spanwise blowing over the trailing edge flap entrained flow downward, producing a lift increase over a wide range of angles of attack. The sweep angle of the windward wing was effectively reduced in sideslip. This decreased the stability of the wing vortex, and it burst farther inboard.
