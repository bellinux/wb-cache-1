5|$|A.phalloides {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{poisonous}} of all known toadstools. It is estimated that as little as half a mushroom contains enough toxin to kill an adult human. It has <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> majority of human deaths from mushroom poisoning, possibly including the deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in AD 54 and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. It has been the subject of much research, and many of its biologically active agents have been isolated. The principal toxic constituent is α-amanitin, which damages the liver and kidneys, causing hepatic and renal failure that can be fatal.|$|E

5|$|Although ancient Lapita potteries {{date back}} to 1500 BC, {{and the people of}} the island have long <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arts, since the {{establishment}} of the ADCK, Kanak arts and crafts have become more popular in New Caledonia. Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are popular as is flèche faîtière, a carving which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes. Music, dance and singing are part of many a Kanak ceremonial function and dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing relationships within the clan and with ancestors.|$|E
5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, have <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any way he could.|$|E

One aircraft was shot down, but the pilot was recovered by helicopter.|$|E

5|$|Hamauzu has not <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} {{of any other}} Chocobo soundtracks.

Hamauzu was not involved in the creation of either the remixes or original tracks for these albums. His role was filled by Kumi Tanioka for Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon, Kenji Ito for Chocobo Racing, and Yuzo Takahashi for Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book: The Witch, The Maiden, and the Five Heroes.|$|E
5|$|Housing {{the main}} {{armament}} in triple turrets {{was new to}} the Royal Navy though British companies had <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of triple gun turret designs for other navies. The choice of a high muzzle velocity with a relatively lighter shell {{was taken from the}} German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the BL 15-inch Mark I gun of 42-calibre length which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, a {{reconstruction}} of the case was filmed on location in Bristol for broadcast in the 26 January edition of the BBC television programme Crimewatch. Snow Business, a Gloucestershire-based firm that had <b>been</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of the Harry Potter films was contracted to reproduce the snowy conditions {{at the time of}} Yeates' disappearance. The reconstruction of Yeates' last movements was filmed on 18 January, and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production, over 300 people contacted the police. A breakthrough led investigators to believe that Yeates' body might have been transported in a large holdall or suitcase.|$|E
40|$|Our {{work has}} {{suggested}} that a high-frequency event <b>is</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initiation phase of malignant transformation in vitro; a later, mutationlike event appears to <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later stages of transformation. There may be no specific "target gene" which directly interacts with carcinogens. It is hypothesized that nonspecific types of DNA damage <b>are</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> induction of an ongoing process we know as carcinogenesis. Several genes could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> maintaining this process. Our recent results suggest that c-myc and c-fos could <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early stages of carcinogenesis, as they are affected by anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors {{in a manner that}} corresponds to <b>the</b> way <b>in</b> which protease inhibitors suppress malignant transformation...|$|R
