40|$|We {{consider}} unsteady undular bores {{for a pair}} of coupled equations of Boussinesq-type {{which contain}} the familiar fully nonlinear dissipationless shallow-water dynamics and the leading-order fully nonlinear dispersive terms. This system contains one horizontal space dimension and time and can be systematically derived from the full Euler equations for irrotational flows with a free surface using a standard long-wave asymptotic expansion. In this context the system was first derived by Su and Gardner. It coincides with the one-dimensional flat-bottom reduction of the Green-Naghdi system and, additionally, has recently found a number of fluid dynamics applications other than the present context of shallow-water gravity waves. We then use the Whitham modulation theory for a one-phase periodic travelling wave to obtain an asymptotic analytical description of an undular bore in the Su-Gardner system for a full range of "depth" ratios across the <b>bore.</b> The <b>positions</b> of the leading and trailing edges of the undular bore and the amplitude of the leading solitary wave of the bore are found as functions of this "depth ratio". The formation of a partial undular bore with a rapidly-varying finite-amplitude trailing wave front is predicted for ``depth ratios'' across the bore exceeding 1. 43. The analytical results from the modulation theory are shown to be in excellent agreement with full numerical solutions for the development of an undular bore in the Su-Gardner system.

25|$|After the war Johnston {{struggled}} {{to make a living}} for himself and his wife, who was ailing. He became president of a small railroad, the Alabama and Tennessee River Rail Road Company, which during his tenure of May 1866 to November 1867, was renamed the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad. Johnston was <b>bored</b> with the <b>position</b> and the company failed for lack of capital. He established in 1868 an insurance company in Savannah, Georgia, acting as an agent for the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, and within four years had a network of more than 120 agents across the deep South. The income from this venture allowed him to devote time to his great postwar activity, writing his memoirs. His Narrative of Military Operations, published in 1874, was highly critical of Davis and many of his fellow generals, continuing his grievance about the unfairness of his ranking as a general and attempting to justify his career as a cautious campaigner. The book sold poorly and its publisher failed to make a profit.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Crossrail project {{currently}} {{under construction in}} Central London {{has been described as}} “The Big Dig on Steroids”, obviously referencing the Central Artery/Tunnel project in Boston completed in 2007. To address the multiple demands for timely construction performance monitoring, Crossrail envisioned the underground construction information management system (UCIMS) to monitor construction progress and structural health along the entire route, with a network of geotechnical instruments (i. e. slope inclinometers, extensometers, piezometers, etc.) and tunnel <b>boring</b> machine (TBM) <b>position</b> information. The UCIMS is a geospatially referenced relational database that was developed using an open source geographic information system (GIS) that allowed all stakeholders near immediate feedback of construction performance. The {{purpose of this article is}} to provide a brief history of geotechnical and structural monitoring software, to describe the structure and operation of the UCIMS, and to demonstrate how the functionality afforded by this system provided the requisite feedback to the stakeholders. Examples will be given regarding how the data management and visualization concepts incorporated into the UCIMS advanced the geotechnical construction industry...|$|R

40|$|The {{lability}} of cobalt(III) in vitamin B 12 {{is thought}} to come about {{as a function of}} its coordination environment. The thermodynamics and kinetics of ligand substitution reactions of vitamin B 12 a were compared to those of a synthetic, more electron rich, corrole-based biomimetic model. The feasibility of corrole synthesis was established with the synthesis of several corroles with different meso substituents. The biomimetic model was designed such that the central meso <b>position</b> <b>bore</b> a substituent with a terminal imidazole (referred to as the ‘tail’) which might act as an axial ligand for a coordinated cobalt ion while the remaining two meso <b>positions</b> <b>bore</b> water-solubilising glucose substituents. Unfortunately, the biomimetic model was water soluble below pH 4 only. This rendered the model unsuitable for the present study and these water solubilising groups were not incorporated into the final model. The model system used in this work is [10 -(2 -[4 -(1 Himidazol- 1 -ylmethyl) benzoyl]aminophenyl) - 5, 15 -diphenylcorrolato]cobalt(III), referred to as DPTC-Co Intermediates of the ‘tail’ meso substituent were found to be polymorphic and five pairs of polymorphs were identified. Polymorphism arose from differences in weak termolecular forces and these differences were evaluated. The stability constants for the binding of various neutral N-, P- and S-donor ligands and anionic N-, S-, I- and C-donor ligands to both vitamin B 12 a and DPTC-Co were determined in a buffered 80 : 20 methanol:water solvent system. The more stable binding of neutral ligands to DPTC-Co and anionic ligands to vitamin B 12 a indicates that the interaction between the metal and an incoming ligand is indeed affected by the metal’s coordination environment. Cobalt(III) in DPTC-Co appeared to favour softer ligands while harder ligands were favoured by vitamin B 12 a. Kinetic studies showed that the coordination of cyanide to cobalt in vitamin B 12 a was faster than in DPTC-Co. The reaction between cyanide and vitamin B 12 a was found to be entropically driven while the reaction with DPTC-Co was enthalpically driven. This suggests that while the reaction between cyanide and vitamin B 12 a is faster, the reaction between cyanide and DPTC-Co is electronically more labile. The coordination environment of cobalt has been seen to significantly affect its chemistry. Coordination by the more electron rich corrole macrocycle led to a softer and more electronically labile metal then when coordinated by the corrin macrocycle of vitamin B 12 a...|$|R

30|$|For {{details on}} the InSPira system, see [1, 2]. In short, {{high-resolution}} imaging is achieved by the unique design of the detector ring of the InSPira HD. The detector ring consists of two clamshells, each containing 12 (focusing) fanbeam collimators, creating a 29.0 -cm diameter <b>bore.</b> At start <b>position,</b> the two clams touch and the collimators are focused {{at the center of}} the ring, achieving a focal point of 3  mm in diameter. During acquisition, the gantry rotates and simultaneously the two clams are moved outward leading the two focal points of the clam’s collimators to follow spiral trajectories over the field of view (FOV). A proprietary iterative reconstruction algorithm (with 60 iterations) tailored to this unique method of spatial sampling is used to reconstruct the data into 3 D images. This iterative reconstruction algorithm is based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. It includes a point spread function (PSF), which is defined as the detector response to an impulse activity source point placed in the scanner FOV [2]. For positioning see section “NeuroFocus scan procedure”. For phantom studies, the same scan parameters were applied as on the NeuroFocus. A CT-scan of the phantom was used for attenuation correction. For subjects, slice timing ranged from 120 to 240  s, slice thickness from 3.125 – 6  mm. The energy window was set at 159  keV, with 20 % lower and upper boundaries (resulting in an energy window of 143 – 175  keV). An adult head CT template was manually aligned and used for attenuation correction.|$|R

Kendall's tau-b formula was employed to test the hypotheses to analyze the relation between each of the independent variable with the dependent variable. Besides, Kendall Concordance (W) analysis was employed to analyze {{the relation of the}} independent variables collectively with the dependent variable. Meanwhile determinant coefficient yielded from Kendall Concordance coefficient square was employed to analyze the influence of independent variables to the dependent variable. Analysis on the relations of organization culture (Xi), working satisfaction (X 2) and motivation (X 3) simultaneously with personnel performance (Y) show positive and significant relation with concordance coefficient of 0. 753 at 0. 05 significance level. X 2 (Chi-Square) calculation support this result at the value of 88. 103 in which the calculated X 2 is bigger than X 2 table (88. 103 > 7. 185). Among these three variables, motivation has the highest influence to the enhancement of personal working performance, followed by working satisfaction and organization culture. Therefore it is recommended that conducive working climate is needed to enable the suitability of working execution with expected target and goal, as well as enhancing personnel knowledge by giving them various education and training. To prevent <b>boring</b> the personnel <b>position</b> should be moved periodically and equally, rewards and appreciation should be given to personnel with high achievement according to existing normative standard, while punishment should be given to undiscipline personnel...|$|R
