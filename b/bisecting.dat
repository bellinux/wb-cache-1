5|$|The {{substitution}} method for both P2 and P3 tilings {{can be described}} using Robinson triangles of different sizes. The Robinson triangles arising in P2 tilings (by <b>bisecting</b> kites and darts) are called A-tiles, while those arising in the P3 tilings (by <b>bisecting</b> rhombs) are called B-tiles. The smaller A-tile, denoted AS, is an obtuse Robinson triangle, while the larger A-tile, AL, is acute; in contrast, a smaller B-tile, denoted BS, is an acute Robinson triangle, while the larger B-tile, BL, is obtuse.|$|E

40|$|Hierarchical text {{clustering}} plays {{a significant}} role in systematically browsing, summarizing and organizing documents into structure manner. However, the <b>Bisect</b> K-means which is a well-known hierarchical clustering algorithm is only able to generate local optimal solutions due to the employment of K-means as part of its process. In this study, we propose to replace the K-means with firefly algorithm, hence producing a <b>Bisect</b> FA for hierarchical clustering. At each level of the proposed <b>Bisect</b> FA, firefly algorithm works to produce the best clusters. For evaluation purposes, we performed experiments on 20 newsgroups dataset that is commonly used in text clustering studies. The results demonstrate that <b>Bisect</b> FA obtains more accurate and compact clustering than <b>Bisect</b> K-means, K-means and C-firefly algorithms. Such a result indicates that the proposed <b>Bisect</b> FA is a competitive algorithm for unsupervised learning...|$|R

5|$|The shape I {{have adopted}} {{is that of}} an ellipse, formed by <b>bisecting,</b> on each side, the {{horizontal}} ordinates of a circle of 32 feet diameter, down to its center, below which the sides are to be made vertical, if no arch is necessary lower down; otherwise, the ellipse is to continue {{down to the bottom}} and to be shaped all round with bricks, stones, or iron, as may appear most eligible. This shape leaves ample room for the cars, and, by contracting the roof, is more secure than a semicircle of 16 feet diameter.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the perpendicular bisector line of any two. Hence, the center {{is the point of}} intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line <b>bisecting</b> the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E

The line <b>bisecting</b> the shield {{horizontally}} symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford {{from east to west}} and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. The fist holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|E

5|$|At this intersection, Communipaw Avenue {{continues}} {{to the east}} and US1-9 Truck turns to the north, becoming an unnamed four-lane undivided road. <b>bisecting</b> Lincoln Park before coming to an intersection with County Route 605. Here, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway again, passing some urban business areas before running between wetlands to the west and Holy Name Cemetery to the east. The route heads into more commercial areas again before passing urban residences, coming to an intersection that provides access to the Pulaski Skyway. Here, US1-9 Truck turns east on Broadway, running through a business district. A short distance later, it turns north onto an unnamed road with County Route 642 continuing east on Broadway. The route passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line and PATH's Newark – World Trade Center Line before crossing under the Pulaski Skyway. Immediately after, US1-9 Truck intersects the eastern terminus of Route 7 and turns to the east, with County Route 645 continuing north at this intersection. The truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway called the St. Paul's Viaduct that runs {{to the north of the}} Pulaski Skyway and passes through industrial sectors, crossing over a Conrail railroad line and County Route 646. A short distance later, US1-9 Truck comes to the Tonnele Circle with US1-9 and Route 139, where it ends.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{idea was}} an {{attractive}} one because initial construction {{was to be}} financed {{by the private sector}} via sales of revenue bonds, allowing state highway funds to be used for other important projects. The new toll road would also reduce traffic, and thus maintenance costs, on existing roads. There was also a concern that if Kansas lagged behind in turnpike construction, it might be bypassed by toll roads in other states, leaving it at an economic disadvantage. The toll concept also had the benefit of ultimately putting the financial burden on the drivers who actually used the road, instead of using tax revenue that had been collected from residents statewide. There was a some opposition to the plan, from both government officials and citizens, due to concerns that the toll revenue might not cover the repayments to investors, bankrupting the turnpike authority and burdening the state government with the remaining debt. There were also worries about the possibility of the turnpike requiring maintenance before the bonds had been repaid. Some critics also felt that the high speeds typical of turnpike driving were unsafe. As right-of-way for the project was obtained, the turnpike drew opposition from farmers and ranchers, who objected to the turnpike <b>bisecting</b> their property, making it difficult to access disjointed parcels of land.|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the critical cell numbers needed to form blastocyst stage embroys, <b>bisected</b> mouse embryos of 8 -cell stage and compacted morula (approximately 16 cells) containing different numbers of blastomeres were cultured in vitro. The percentage of <b>bisected</b> compacted morulae with 7 - 9 blastomeres that developed to eu-blastocysts was 98. 8 %, while only 64. 2 % of the <b>bisected</b> 8 -cell embryos with 4 blastomeres developed to eu-blastocysts. The percentage of eu-blastocysts decreased, while that of pseudo-blastocysts and trophectodermal vesicles increased {{as the number}} of blastomeres decreased in the <b>bisected</b> embryos of the two stages. Inner cell masses were observed in all the eu-blastocysts and in 87. 3 % of the pseudo-blastocysts that developed from <b>bisected</b> embryos. The cell number of inner cell mass in the pseudo-blastocysts was significantly less than that of eu-blastocysts (P< 0. 01). The ratios of inner cell mass to total cell number of eu-blastocysts that developed from 4 blastomeres in 8 -cell embryos and from 7 - 9 blastomeres in compacted morulae were similar to those of control embryos, respectively. However, the ratios decreased in proportion to the {{decrease in the number of}} blastomeres in the two groups. Five sets of monozygotic twins and 4 singletons of live fetuses were obtained after transfer of the 20 twin sets of eu-blastocysts that developed from the <b>bisected</b> compacted morulae with 7 - 9 blastomeres.
