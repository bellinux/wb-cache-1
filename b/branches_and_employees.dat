50|$|In Canada the {{struggle}} for the total ban of alcohol began in the 1898 national referendum, asking people if they wished total prohibition which included importation, manufacturing and sale {{of all types of}} alcohol beverages (p. 4). Although the national results were extremely close with Yes leading by 2%, regional disparities were wide (p. 5). In Quebec, 81% of voters ended up rejecting the prohibition proposal in contrast to the rest of Canada (Petkantchin, 2005, p. 8). In fear of splitting the country on a sharp divide between Catholic French and Protestant English Canada, then Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier decided not to act upon the vote results (Dupré, 2008, p. 5). By 1917, every province except Quebec implemented a complete ban on alcohol. A year later, a law was proposed in Quebec calling for complete prohibition in 1919. The law was never enacted due to opposition from the public and the Catholic Church (Petkantchin, 2005, p. 8). Quebec did prohibit spirits, such as whisky and scotch, which came to be called partial prohibition. The government invoked illegal distillation, but mounting pressure forced it to backtrack. The Alcoholic Beverages Act abolished partial prohibition in 1921. This act created the Quebec Liquor Commission as a monopoly in distribution and retail of alcohol (SAQ, 2009). Officially, the government stated control of alcohol abuse as the official reason to create this new agency (Paradis & Sacy, 2005). Over the years, the SAQ increased its profits, which were transferred to the government. The Régie des alcools du Québec (RAQ) was created in 1961 in order to promote business growth, which opened its first self-service branch soon afterward. With the opening of other branches, the government began to focus on different aspects of alcohol sales in Quebec. “The government commissions a new study into the alcoholic beverage trade, creating the Thinel Commission for the purpose” (SAQ, 2009). Based on the recommendations of the Thinel Commission in 1971, the Société des Alcools du Québec was founded in order {{to be in charge of}} sales. The SAQ took over the RAQ <b>branches</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> and became strictly commercial (Petkantchin, 2005, p. 10). The SAQ continued to produce economic growth for the Quebec government as time went on. Its strength in commercialization prompted several privatization projects that were submitted to the government. Specifically in 1983, when it was announced that the SAQ retail network would be privatized, it was strongly opposed by unions. Petkantchin (2005) explains that this privatization project suffered many weaknesses: it involved privatizing “certain points of sale in Montreal” but with no competition allowed from the remaining SAQ stores. Petkantchin argues that “benefits to consumers of this partial privatization, had it gone ahead, would have been very limited.” Consumers would have remained “captive, with no real alternative” (p. 10). Baffling the mind, the remaining SAQ branches would also have been sheltered from competition from the privatized stores, which would have been required to buy their merchandise from the SAQ at fixed prices.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} 'mutual gains' {{argument}} that employees benefit when teamworking is introduced alongside employee involvement in problem-solving {{and within a}} co-operative industrial relations climate. It reports worker outcomes from negotiations to introduce teamworking across two steelworks. Moderate union <b>branches</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> {{at one of the}} works (Scunthorpe) co-operated with managers in joint problem-solving teams to redesign work. However, contrary to mutual gains expectations, greater job insecurity at this works coerced union branches to accept teamworking agreements containing extensive demanning and a pay increase for fewer employees. Employees perceived greater job security at the other works (Teesside) and by rejecting joint problem-solving with managers, militant union branches protected more jobs and extracted higher payment for teamworking. The findings indicate that job insecurity can lead co-operative unions down a slippery slope of coerced co-operation restricting employee benefits from teamworking.

40|$|The {{political}} and economic changes taking place {{at the end of}} the 20 th century have provided Western European banks the opportunity to enter into Central and Eastern European (CEE) markets. Their entry was made either by greenfield investment or by acquisition of existing domestic banks. The motivations for the entry decision were various, e. g. managerial decisions, tightening profit margins in home markets, challengers imitation, profit-maximizations, looking for new customers in new markets, or keeping and extending relations with existing customers on the new markets where they are implanted. The expansion was amplified by the deregulation, the global capital expansion and the emergence of a single currency, throughout a period of prosperity and economic growth lasting for almost two decades (1990 - 2008). Until the crisis, changes in the CEE banking markets mainly concerned the increasing share of foreign capital (in market share, assets, number of <b>branches</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees)</b> along with the diminishing importance of state-owned banks. After 2008, the process displays new features: the restructuring of banks, mergers or strategic acquisitions, reducing operations in certain countries or even exits, adjusting the number of units and employees, improving efficiency and profitability indicators etc. Domestic banks, both private and state-owned, have bridged the gap (at least in terms of efficiency) separating them from the leaders, i. e. mostly the subsidiaries of large international banks. Apparently, greenfield banks are losing the importance they had in the preceding period (1990 - 2008). This paper aims at investigating the relation between foreign banks’ mode of entry into the emerging markets of CEE (i. e. acquisition vs greenfield) and the strategies’ results on those markets, before and after the crisis. Although foreign banks have implemented common strategies at group level, often dependent on the entry mode, these strategies were influenced by the specific features of the host markets and, quite frequently, by transformations occurred within home markets. We found that the entry is relevant for the development of the banks, but less than in the previous period, i. e. when banks entered the emerging markets of CEE...|$|E

This study used the stratified random sampling technique. There are two groups of respondents which consist of customers from the Pasir Mas <b>branch</b> <b>and</b> <b>employees</b> from all <b>branches</b> of Bank Rakyat. Descriptive analysis was used to gauge the overall picture of factors influencing respondents’ acceptance.
