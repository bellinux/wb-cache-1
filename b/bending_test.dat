25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for bone replacement) are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

50|$|Considering the {{importance}} of elastic properties for design and engineering applications, a number of experimental techniques are developed and these can be classified into 2 groups; static and dynamic methods. Statics methods (like the four-point <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> and nanoindentation) are based on direct measurements of stresses and strains during mechanical tests. Dynamic methods (like ultrasound spectroscopy and impulse excitation technique) provide an advantage over static methods because the measurements are relatively quick and simple and involve small elastic strains.

50|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique used to study the surface properties of materials. It relies on the interactions that can be observed between {{the surface of a}} material and the very fine tip (ideally one atom in diameter) of the AFM. This tip is mounted on a cantilever that will move in certain directions according to the surface’s charge, topography or composition. The information received can provide inside knowledge on the topography of the material, the dimensions of certain particles, the interactions between the different molecules, the mechanical properties of the sample (a <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> can be realized using AFM), as well as other properties such as the electrical and magnetic properties. The resolution of this technique {{is one of the best}} you can achieve using microscopy techniques. In fact, unlike other electron microscopy techniques such as SEM, STM and so forth, AFM provides a resolution in the range of Angstrom. This technique is therefore perfect for studying nanomaterials and is sometimes referred to as a single atom resolved technique. Another big advantage of this technique is the minimal sample preparation it requires. The data collection process it relies on is also quite simple. The movements of the cantilever are recorded using a photo detector and a laser that is deflected by the cantilever. These movements induce a change in the voltage of the photodetector which then transforms this signal into an “image”.|$|E

The test results were also compared with the moment capacities obtained from deformation-based Continuous Strength Method (CSM). It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the three specifications are generally conservative, while the CSM provides a more accurate prediction.
