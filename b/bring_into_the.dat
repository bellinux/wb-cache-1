25|$|Like in {{the rest}} of Mexico, this festival is a mix of Catholic and pre-Hispanic {{practices}} and serves as one of the way the town preserves its social cohesion and culture. Dance features heavily in these rituals as well as ritual intoxication. The festival in May for the Virgin Mary actually lasts eight days. First is the “convite” when invitations are sent to various communities to participate. Next is the election of the Queen of the Festival as well as a “Corn Goddess” who represents the goddess Centoalt, a practice derived from pre-Hispanic times. Mass is then celebrated, which is followed by a procession through the town with guests, accompanied by mascots, children in masks and dress similar to that of Carnival. This procession ends at the main church’s atrium. “Las Mañanitas” (a song of congratulations) is sung and on 10 May Mothers Day is celebrated at the same time. On the morning of 11 May is another Mass called the “Misa de Aurora” which commences at 5 am. This hour is considered to be “God’s time” and attendees consume hot chocolate and a type of egg bread. Later in the morning, representative from various communities gather at the main <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> municipal seat to march carrying banners of their communities’ patron saints. After this are various attractions such as cockfights, rodeo, folk dance and fireworks. The day ends with a “dance of gratitude” in the evening and then the festival’s organizers offer drinks and sweets to attendees. The festival closes with music played by hired musicians.|$|E
500|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that cockroaches are serious vectors of disease. Cockroaches are not vagile, i.e. they do not travel far from their birthplace {{as opposed to the}} housefly which may travel miles from its birthplace. The cockroach will spread its GI tract contents throughout a building. If that is a home it will be helping to spread the diseases that the family and friends <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> home. [...] In a hospital or a restaurant it can spread diseases from sick to well individuals. [...] They have no bite or sting. [...] It is true that by external contact that cockroaches can carry bacteria such as salmonella onto surfaces. Their shells contain a protein, arylphorin, implicated in asthma and other respiratory conditions.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Julian re-joined {{his former}} club, now renamed simply Stevenage, on a free transfer, {{three years after}} leaving the club. The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} and we all know how much quality he will <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with". On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming back now and we are in League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town. He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.|$|E

2500|$|With Contimporanul launched, Vinea {{declared}} himself {{a member of}} Romanian and Balkan artistic-revolutionary elite, which was to educate the passive public and <b>bring</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> modernist fold—as argued by Cernat, this showed Vinea's [...] "peripheral complex", his feeling of being stuck in an [...] "accursed" [...] cultural backwater. He delved in art criticism, with short essays on exhibits by Janco and Maxy, and with eulogies for folk and abstract art. He continued to deride, or simply ignore, Lovinescu, whose Sburătorul competed {{for the role of}} modernist guardian. As Cernat notes, his scorn had a personal and political, not artistic, motivation. Contimporanul managed to neutralize and absorb smaller Futurist magazines such as Scarlat Callimachi's Punct. However, it was chronically plagued by financial setbacks, and almost shut down several times; during such episodes, Vinea took up work for Cocea at Facla.|$|E
