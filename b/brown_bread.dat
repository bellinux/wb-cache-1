25|$|Laura attends {{school with}} her younger sister, Carrie until the weather becomes too severe to {{permit them to}} walk {{to and from the}} school building. Blizzard after {{blizzard}} sweeps through the town over the next few months. Food and fuel become scarce and expensive, as the town depends on the trains to bring supplies but the frequent blizzards prevent the trains from getting through. Eventually, the railroad company suspends all efforts to dig out the train, stranding the town. For weeks, the Ingalls subsist on potatoes and coarse <b>brown</b> <b>bread,</b> using twisted hay for fuel. As even this meager food runs out, Laura's future husband Almanzo Wilder and his friend Cap Garland risk their lives to bring wheat to the starving townspeople – enough to last the rest of the winter.|$|E
500|$|On 23June 1916, Dallas took {{delivery}} of the newest RNAS fighter, Sopwith Triplane #N500. This was the original prototype, having undergone Admiralty trials before being shipped to France. Though still only a test plane, it was flown into combat 15minutes after its arrival. Dallas named it <b>Brown</b> <b>Bread,</b> {{and it was the}} first of a series of 'Tripes' that he would fly and fight in over the next year. He achieved his first victory with <b>Brown</b> <b>Bread</b> on 1July, the same day he was promoted to flight lieutenant. Three days later, he was recommended for further promotion. He scored his last Nieuport-mounted 'kill' on 9July, earning the Croix de guerre and a mention in despatches for coming to the aid of a French Maurice Farman biplane. On 7September 1916, Dallas was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, [...] "for the specially gallant manner in which he has carried out his duties" [...] since first seeing action in December 1915. By the end of the year he was among the earliest RNAS aces, with eight confirmed and four unconfirmed victories, and had been raised to the rank of flight commander.|$|E
500|$|The Holdens {{lived in}} {{suburban}} Norbiton, Surrey (now Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames) until 1902, {{when they moved}} to Codicote in Hertfordshire. Around 1906, they moved to Harmer Green near Welwyn, where Holden designed a house for them. The house was plainly furnished and the couple lived a simple life, described by Janet Ashbee in 1906 as [...] "bananas and <b>brown</b> <b>bread</b> on the table; no hot water; plain living and high thinking and strenuous activity {{for the betterment of}} the World". The couple had no children together, though Margaret had a son, Allan, from her marriage. Charles and Margaret Holden lived at Harmer Green {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse bread. By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with bread had progressed to the point that white or <b>brown</b> <b>breads</b> could be produced. The Roman {{invasion}} led to many Welsh people moving to the less hospitable uplands, where the only cereal crops which could be grown were oats, barley and rye. Oat and barley breads were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with rye bread created for medicinal purposes. Oats were used to bulk out meat or meat and vegetable stews, also known as pottage.|$|R
50|$|In Ireland, as elsewhere, {{the exact}} {{constituents}} {{of a full}} breakfast vary, depending on geographical area, personal taste and cultural affiliation. The breakfast became popular there whilst Ireland {{was a part of}} the United Kingdom. Traditionally, the most common ingredients in Ireland are bacon rashers, pork sausages, fried eggs (or scrambled), white pudding, black pudding, toast and fried tomato. Sauteed field mushrooms are also sometimes included, as well as baked beans, hash browns, liver, and <b>brown</b> soda <b>bread.</b> Fried potato farl, boxty or toast is sometimes served as an alternative to <b>brown</b> soda <b>bread.</b> Limerick in particular has a long-standing traditional association with pork-based meat products.|$|R

2500|$|Cereals {{formed the}} staple diet. The two main grains were wheat ( [...] sitos) and barley ( [...] krithe). Wheat grains were {{softened}} by soaking, then either reduced into gruel, or ground into flour ( [...] aleiata) and kneaded and formed into loaves ( [...] artos) or flatbreads, either plain or mixed with cheese or honey. Leavening was known; the Greeks later used an alkali ( [...] nitron) or wine yeast as a leavening agent. Dough loaves were baked {{at home in}} a clay oven ( [...] ipnos) set on legs. Bread wheat, difficult to grow in Mediterranean climates, and the white bread made from it, were associated with the upper classes in the ancient Mediterranean, while the poor ate coarse <b>brown</b> <b>breads</b> made from emmer wheat and barley.|$|R

50|$|The glycemic {{effect of}} foods {{depends on a}} number of factors, such as the type of starch (amylose versus amylopectin), {{physical}} entrapment of the starch molecules within the food, fat and protein content of the food and organic acids or their salts in the meal — adding vinegar, for example, will lower the GI. The presence of fat or soluble dietary fiber can slow the gastric emptying rate, thus lowering the GI. In general, coarse, grainy breads with higher amounts of fiber have a lower GI value than white breads. However, most breads made with 100% whole wheat or wholemeal flour have a GI not very different from endosperm only (white) <b>bread.</b> Many <b>brown</b> <b>breads</b> are treated with enzymes to soften the crust, which makes the starch more accessible (high GI).|$|R

50|$|Bread is an {{important}} feature in Ghanaian breakfast and baked foods. Ghanaian bread, which {{is known for its}} good quality, is baked with wheat flour and sometimes cassava flour is added for an improved texture. There are four major types of bread in Ghana. They are tea bread (similar to the baguette), sugar bread (which is a sweet <b>bread),</b> <b>brown</b> (whole wheat) <b>bread,</b> and butter bread. Rye bread, oat bread and malt bread are also quite common.|$|R

50|$|In South Asia (including India, Pakistan, and the Middle East), chapati or roti, {{types of}} unleavened flatbreads usually made from whole-wheat flour or {{sometimes}} refined wheat flour and baked {{on a hot}} iron griddle called a tava, form the mainstay of the people's diet. The Miracle Chapati, as it became known, is an unleavened bread with a long tradition. The bread can be spelled Chapathi, Chapati, Chapatti, or Chappati. Rotis and naans are usually served with curry throughout the region. A variant called makki di roti uses maize flour rather than white flour. Another variant is puri, a thin flat bread that is fried rather than baked and puffs up while cooked. Paratha is another variation on roti. Naan (leavened wholewheat bread) is baked in a tandoor or clay oven and is rarely prepared at home. White and <b>brown</b> <b>breads</b> are also very common, but not as common as roti.|$|R

50|$|A toaster, or a toast maker, is an {{electric}} small appliance designed to <b>brown</b> sliced <b>bread</b> by exposing it to radiant heat, thus converting it into toast.

5000|$|It is {{commonly}} prepared by cutting a circular or square {{hole in the}} center of a piece of bread.
