5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, {{it is not uncommon}} to flavor the chicken's crisp exterior with a variety of spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E
5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert utility power or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> such.|$|E

These labelling allowances are not widely known, but as an awareness of them develops, controversy over truthful labelling is growing. In Canada, trans fat quantities on labels include naturally occurring trans fats from animal sources.|$|E

25|$|Depending on {{the color}} of the roasted beans as {{perceived}} by the human eye, they will <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> light, medium light, medium, medium dark, dark, or very dark. A more accurate method of discerning the degree of roast involves measuring the reflected light from roasted seeds illuminated with a light source in the near-infrared spectrum. This elaborate light meter uses a process known as spectroscopy to return a number that consistently indicates the roasted coffee's relative degree of roast or flavor development.|$|E

25|$|If atheism {{is defined}} as disbelief in {{existence}} of a God, then Jainism cannot <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> atheistic, as it not only believes in existence of gods {{but also of the}} soul which can attain godhood. As Paul Dundas puts it – “while Jainism is, as we have seen, atheist in a limited sense of rejection of both the existence of a creator God and the possibility of intervention of such a being in human affairs, it nonetheless must be regarded as a theist religion in the more profound sense that it accepts the existence of divine principle, the paramātmā i.e. God, existing in potential state within all beings”.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 {{the cost}} of the rapid {{expansion}} of JCP forced Crockett to sell his promotion to Ted Turner. Turner began to rebrand the promotion as World Championship Wrestling, but still used the NWA prefix for all of their championships at that point in time. In January 1991 WCW officially split from the NWA, spinning off the NWA Championships into WCW championships, which meant that then-reigning champions Doom (Ron Simmons and Butch Reed) became the first champions to officially <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> WCW World Tag Team Championship. At that point in time the NWA did not determine a new set of NWA World Tag Team Champions.|$|E
25|$|Trees {{should not}} <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> polluters because their total {{benefits}} on air quality and emissions reduction {{far outweigh the}} possible consequences of BVOC emissions on ozone concentrations. Emission of BVOCs increase exponentially with temperature. Therefore, higher emissions will occur at higher temperatures. In desert climates, locally native trees adapted to drought conditions emit significantly less BVOCs than plants native to wet regions. As discussed above, the formation of ozone is also temperature dependent. Thus, {{the best way to}} slow the production of ozone and emission of BVOCs is to reduce urban temperatures and the effect of the urban heat island. As suggested earlier, {{the most effective way to}} lower temperatures is with an increased canopy cover.|$|E
25|$|Derided as one-hit wonders and {{estranged from}} their {{original}} producer, Rick Rubin, and record label, Def Jam, the Beastie Boys were in self-imposed exile in Los Angeles during early 1988 and were written off by most music critics before even beginning {{to record their}} second studio album, Paul's Boutique. Following the commercial success of Licensed to Ill, the Beastie Boys were focusing on making an album with more creative depth and less commercial material. The group's previous album had been enormously popular and received critical acclaim among both mainstream and hip hop music critics, although its simple, heavy beats and comically juvenile lyrics led it to <b>be</b> <b>labeled</b> <b>as</b> frat hip hop. The group signed with Capitol Records and EMI Records.|$|E
