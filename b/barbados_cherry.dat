40|$|The {{angiosperm}} order Malpighiales includes ~ 16, 000 {{species and}} constitutes up to 40 % of the understory tree diversity in tropical rain forests. Despite remarkable progress in angiosperm systematics {{during the last}} 20 y, relationships within Malpighiales remain poorly resolved, possibly owing to its rapid rise during the mid-Cretaceous. Using phylogenomic approaches, including analyses of 82 plastid genes from 58 species, we identified 12 additional clades in Malpighiales and substantially increased resolution along the backbone. This greatly improved phylogeny revealed a dynamic history of shifts in net diversification rates across Malpighiales, with bursts of diversification noted in the <b>Barbados</b> <b>cherries</b> (Malpighiaceae), cocas (Erythroxylaceae), and passion flowers (Passifloraceae). We found that commonly used a priori approaches for partitioning concatenated data in maximum likelihood analyses, by gene or by codon position, performed poorly relative {{to the use of}} partitions identified a posteriori using a Bayesian mixture model. We also found better branch support in trees inferred from a taxon-rich, data-sparse matrix, which deeply sampled only the phylogenetically critical placeholders, than in trees inferred from a taxon-sparse matrix with little missing data. Although this matrix has more missing data, our a posteriori partitioning strategy reduced the possibility of producing multiple distinct but equally optimal topologies and increased phylogenetic decisiveness, compared with the strategy of partitioning by gene. These approaches are likely to help improve phylogenetic resolution in other poorly resolved major clades of angiosperms and to be more broadly useful in studies across the Tree of Lif...|$|R

Two large area field control trials were then carried out using the protein bait mixed with fipronil insecticide and applied weekly as a low volume spot spray to the foliage. The first trial was conducted in north Vietnam in over 35 ha of peach (Prunus persica L.) that was severely infested by Bactrocera pyrifoliae and B. dorsalis. The second trial was conducted in the Mekong Delta on over 50 ha of <b>Barbados</b> <b>cherry</b> (Malpighia glabra) that was severely damaged by B. correcta and B. dorsalis. In the peach crop the protein bait spot sprays reduced the damage to less than 5 per cent in one season compared with 100 per cent fruit damage in the control (untreated) area. In the <b>Barbados</b> <b>cherry</b> crop, protein bait spot sprays reduced the damage to less than 4 per cent compared with over 70 per cent damage to fruits in the control (untreated) area. As a result of the huge reductions in fruit fly damage, highly significant increases in peach and <b>Barbados</b> <b>cherry</b> yields have been obtained leading to a 4 -fold increase in income for peach farmers and a 2 -fold increase in income for <b>Barbados</b> <b>cherry</b> farmers.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} physiological genotypic {{differences between}} two <b>Barbados</b> <b>cherry</b> genotypes (13 - and 14 -CPA) under water deficit, initial growth, water relations, and organic solute accumulation were evaluated {{in an experiment}} performed using four-month-old seedlings, which were subjected to four water treatments (100, 75, 50, and 25 % of field capacity), with five replications. Severe water deficit (25 % of field capacity) negatively affected plant height, stem diameter, leaf area, dry matter of the leaves and stem to both genotypes, and root dry matter to genotype 13 -CPA. Predawn (Ywpd) and midday leaf water potentials (Ywmd) were reduced in plants grown under 25 % of field capacity, only in the genotype 14 -CPA. There was not a change in relative water content, even with {{the reduction in the}} leaf water potential. Severe water deficit did not induce organic solutes accumulation, instead it reduced carbohydrate content in leaves of genotypes and aminoacids, proline and proteins, in genotype 13 -CPA. In the roots accumulation of all organic solutes studied, it was verified genotype 13 -CPA under 25 % of field capacity, but only carbohydrates increased in plants under 25 % of field capacity to 14 -CPA. These results suggest two different mechanisms used by <b>Barbados</b> <b>cherry</b> genotypes to maintain the water status. To the 13 -CPA one, the accumulation of soluble organic solutes in the roots is the main mechanism used to maintain the tissue hydration. However, the 14 -CPA genotype changed the root to shoot ratio in order to avoid desiccation.

Para tanto, foi implantado um experimento em pomar comercial no município de Junqueirópolis-SP. Foram avaliados dois ciclos reprodutivos: setembro de 2009 e janeiro de 2010, sendo que, em cada época, foram marcados 400 botões florais distribuídos em 10 plantas. Para avaliação fenológica, o ciclo foi dividido em estádios, sendo avaliados a duração destes, do ciclo reprodutivo, a taxa de frutificação efetiva e o crescimento dos frutos. A duração dos estádios e do ciclo reprodutivo, a taxa de frutificação efetiva e o crescimento dos frutos foram influenciados pelo fator época, sendo que, no mês de janeiro, a duração dos estádios fenológicos foi menor, resultando no desenvolvimento mais rápido dos frutos, que também apresentaram maior diâmetro. Porém, no que se refere à taxa de frutificação, a época de setembro apresentou maior fixação dos frutos. Também foi verificado que o maior índice de abortamento se deu no estádio de perda de pétala em ambas as avaliações.

Crude wax amount and p-alkane profi les have been evaluated for three distinct genotypes of acerola. The total amount of wax ranged from 11 μg. cm- 2 to 24 μg. cm- 2 on leaves and 10 μg. cm- 2 to 30 μg. cm- 2 on fruits. Two of the three genotypes presented statistically distinct totals for leaf and fruit-wax. Type A (yellow epicarp) presented the highest amounts of crude wax on both leaves and fruits. p/Alkanes ranged from C 18 to C 34 in fruits, with p/pentacosane (C 25) as the main homologue of most individuals. Narrower p/alkane distribution was found in cuticular foliar wax, with C 22 -C 33, with p/ hentriacontane (C 31) as the major component of most individuals.

O experimento realizou-se no município de Paudalho, PE. Os valores da transpiração e do potencial da água foram, de modo geral, mais elevados no início da manhã e no final da tarde; os da resistência difusiva e temperatura foliar foram menores no início da manhã e no final da tarde. Houve uma limitação das trocas gasosas com o ambiente, em decorrência da redução da transpiração nas horas mais quentes do dia, sendo mais acentuada na estação seca e na matriz UFRPE 7. Os valores mínimos do potencial ocorreram na época seca, variando de - 3, 4 MPa (UFRPE 7) a - 4, 3 MPa (UFRPE 8), enquanto os valores máximos da resistência variaram de 16, 30 s cm- 1 (UFRPE 7) a 22, 10 s cm- 1 (UFRPE 8) na mesma estação. O potencial hídrico e a resistência difusiva mostraram forte correlação com o déficit de pressão de vapor. A maior capacidade fotossintética foi verificada em folhas maduras da matriz UFRPE 8. Os mecanismos fisiológicos apresentados pelas plantas demonstram que elas podem resistir a períodos de estresse hídrico quando estes se manifestam.

Changes in daily and seasonal behavior of gas exchange, water potential, and leaf temperature were observed. The transpiration and water potential measurements were higher {{at the beginning of the}} morning and at the end of the afternoon, while those for diffusive resistance and leaf temperature were lower at these same periods of the day. There was a reduction of gas exchange with the environment as a result of the lower transpiration during the hotter hours of the day, being this tendency strongest in the dry season and in the UFRPE 7 accession. The lowest values for leaf water potential were registered in the dry season, varying from - 3. 37 MPa (UFRPE 7) to - 4. 32 MPa (UFRPE 8), while the maximum resistance values varied from 16. 30 cm s- 1 (UFRPE 7) to 22. 10 cm s- 1 (UFRPE 8) during this same season. The water potential and the diffusive resistance showed a strong correlation to the vapour pressure deficit. The greatest photosynthetic capacity was registered for mature leaves in the UFRPE 8 plant.

Para obtenÃÃo do fracionamento dos carboidratos, de acordo com o sistema CNCPS, foram calculados os carboidratos totais, as suas fraÃÃes B 2, C e os componentes solÃveis em detergente neutro. Foram determinadas as fraÃÃes potencialmente degradÃvel (B 2) e nÃo-degradÃvel (C) da fibra em detergente neutro, corrigida para cinzas e proteÃna. Para determinaÃÃo das fraÃÃes nitrogenadas, foram analisados os compostos nitrogenados nÃo-protÃicos, nitrogÃnio solÃvel e insolÃvel em tampÃo borato-fosfato e nitrogÃnio protÃico insolÃvel em detergente neutro e em detergente Ãcido. Para a estimaÃÃo dos Nutrientes DigestÃveis Totais (NDT) foram utilizadas as equaÃÃes propostas pelo NRC (2001). Para a determinaÃÃo da digestibilidade intestinal da proteÃna nÃo-degradada no rÃmen, os alimentos foram inicialmente incubados no rÃmen de fÃmea bovina fistulada, por 16 horas para determinaÃÃo da ProteÃna nÃo-degradada no rÃmen (PNDR), sendo o resÃduo submetido Ã digestÃo com soluÃÃo de pepsina durante 1 hora, e soluÃÃo de pancreatina a 38 ÂC durante 24 horas, cujos resÃduos foram analisados para nitrogÃnio total. Acerola e melÃo apresentaram substancial conteÃdo nitrogenado na fraÃÃo C o que reduziria a disponibilidade de N tanto para microrganismos do rÃmen quanto para o hospedeiro. As forrageiras estudadas apresentaram maiores proporÃÃes do nitrogÃnio nas fraÃÃes A e B 2, consequentemente disponibilizando nitrogÃnio para bactÃrias fermentadoras de carboidratos fibrosos. O percentual de fraÃÃo C na acerola e no melÃo em detrimento da fraÃÃo B 2 acarretaria maior efeito de repleÃÃo ruminal e diminuiÃÃo da disponibilidade energÃtica, por sua caracterÃstica de indigestibilidade ao longo do trato gastrointestinal, quando submetidos a ensaios de alimentaÃÃo para animais. Nas forrageiras nativas e nas adaptadas ao clima da regiÃo Nordeste foram observados valores de fraÃÃo A + B 1 de 35, 26 a 73, 37 %, para fraÃÃo B 2, de 3, 87 % a 28, 45 % e para fraÃÃo C de 17, 34 e 40, 63 %. As fraÃÃes A, B 1, B 2, B 3 e C dos compostos nitrogenados apresentaram variaÃÃo de 9, 84 a 42, 33 %; 1, 58 a 11, 47 %; 48, 63 a 80, 10 %; 0, 70 a 6, 13 % e 0, 43 a 2, 86 %, respectivamente. As fraÃÃes de carboidratos dos subprodutos analisados variaram de 19, 35 a 58, 52 %; 9, 95 a 61, 44 % e 15, 35 a 70, 06 para A+B 1, B 2 e C, respectivamente; enquanto para os compostos nitrogenados variaram de 5, 01 a 33, 02 %; 1, 69 a 15, 23 %; 2, 26 a 75, 60 %; 1, 53 a 40, 26 % e 0, 08 a 43, 84 % para fraÃÃes A, B 1 B 2, B 3 e C, respectivamente. O NDT estimado das forrageiras variou de 48, 30 a 65, 42 %, enquanto o dos subprodutos variou de 31, 41 a 128, 90 %. A estimativa da PNDR das forragens variou de 13, 37 a 83, 6 %, e dos subprodutos variou de 39, 14 a 89, 06 %. A digestibilidade intestinal da PNDR das forragens variou de 26, 09 a 80, 68 %, enquanto para os subprodutos variou de 22, 26 a 76, 82 %. O sabiÃ foi a forrageira que apresentou a maior DI e o maior teor de PNDRd, e a flor-de-seda os menores valores; enquanto para os subprodutos, o melÃo apresentou o maior valor para DI, entretanto o caju forneceu maior teor de PNDRd, enquanto o coco apresentou os mais baixos valores para DI e PNDRdThe {{objective of}} this research was to characterize the protein and carbohydrate fractions,estimate energy values and evaluate the intestinal digestibility protein of algaroba (Prosopis juliflora), canafÃstula (Pithecellobium multiflorum), flor-de-seda (Calotropis procera), jitirana (Ipomea sp.), juazeiro (Ziziphus joazeiro), mata-pasto (Senna obtusifolia) and sabiÃ (Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth), palma gigante (Opuntia ficus indica) and xique-xique (Cereus gounellei) and the agroindustry byproducts from pineapple (Ananas comosus L.), <b>barbados</b> <b>cherry</b> (Malpighia emarginata), cashew (Anacardium occidentale), coconut (Cocos nucifera L.), melon (Cucumis melo), passion fruit (Passiflora eduli), grape (Vitis labrusca) and anatto seeds (Bixa orellana L.). To obtain the carbohydrates fractions, according with Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) system, were calculated the total carbohydrates, their fractions B 2, C and the soluble components in neutral detergent. It was determinated the potentially degradable (B 2) and undegradable (C) fractions of the neutral detergent fiber, corrected for ashes and protein. The non-protein nitrogenous compounds, soluble and insoluble nitrogen in borate-phosphate buffer, nitrogenous protein insoluble in neutral and acid detergent were analyzed for the determination of the nitrogen fractions. To estimate Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) had been used the equations proposals by National Research Council - NRC (2001). The feeds were incubated in rumen during 16 hours to determine the rumen-undegradable protein (RUDP), then the residue was incubated with pepsin solution during 1 hour, and pancreatic solution during 24 hours at 38 ÂC, whose residues were analyzed for total nitrogen. The Malpighia emarginata and Cucumis melo showed substantial nitrogen content in fraction C which would reduce the disponibility of nitrogen for the rumen microorganisms and its host. The evaluated forages showed higher proportions of nitrogen in fractions A and B 2, providing nitrogen for the rumen microorganisms. The percentage of fraction C in Malpighia emarginata and Cucumis melo {{at the expense of the}} B 2 fraction would entail greater effect of ruminal fill and decreased availability of energy, for its characteristic of indigestibility along the gastrointestinal tract, when being tested for feeding animals. In the evaluated forages had been observed values of A+B 1 fraction from 35. 26 to 73. 37 %, for B 2 fraction, from 3. 87 % to 28. 45 % and for C fraction from 17. 34 to 40. 63 %. The fractions, A, B 1, B 2, B 3 and C of nitrogenous compounds had presented variation from 9. 84 to 42. 33 %; 1. 58 to 11. 47 %; 48. 63 to 80. 10 %; 0. 70 to 6. 13 % and 0. 43 to 2. 86 %, respectively. The byproducts carbohydrate fractions analyzed varied from 19. 35 to 58. 52 %; 9. 95 to 61. 44 % and 15. 35 to 70. 06, for A+B 1, B 2 and C, respectively. In turn, the nitrogenous compounds varied from 5. 01 to 33. 02 %; from 1. 69 to 15. 23 %; from 2. 26 to 75. 60 %; from 1. 53 to 40. 26 % and from 0. 08 to 43. 84 % for fractions, A, B 1 B 2, B 3 and C, respectively. The forages TDN values varied from 48. 30 to 65. 42 %, while of by-products it varied from 31. 41 to 128. 9 %. The estimate of RUDP in the forages ranged from 13. 37 % to 83. 6 %, and the byproducts RUDP ranged from 39, 14 to 89. 06 %. The intestinal digestion of RUDP ranged from 26. 09 to 80. 68 %, %, while for byproducts varied of 22, 26 76. 82 %. The Mimosa caesalpiniaefolia Benth was the forage that presented better ID and better RUDPd, and the Calotropis procera, presented lowest values for these variables. For byproducts, the Cucumis melo presented the biggest value for DI, while the Cocos nucifera L. presented the lowest values for DI and RUDP...|$|E
