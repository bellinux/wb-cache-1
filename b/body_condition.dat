5|$|In {{their summer}} camps, {{starting}} in January, male grey-headed flying foxes set up mating territories. Mating territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in {{males in the}} mating season, and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain their territories, and this {{is associated with a}} steep drop in the males' <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> during this time.|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs {{can also}} carry mites, but {{a study of}} the feather mite Gabucinia delibata, {{acquired}} by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually improved the <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> of its host. It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter pathogens, and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and anting—rubbing the plumage with ants (the formic acid from the insects deters parasites).|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{rituals of}} the American goldfinch include aerial maneuvers and singing by males, who begin courtship in late July. The flight displays begin as the male pursues the female, who flies in zigzagging evasive patterns. The male {{is able to}} signal his quality and fitness, both {{in the short term}} (current <b>body</b> <b>condition)</b> and long term (genes), through ornamentation (bill color and plumage). If a female accepts the male as a mate, the pair will fly in wide circles, as the male warbles throughout the flight.|$|E
30|$|To the contrary, the {{following}} cattle <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> and behaviors {{are regarded as}} signs of a normal rainy season. They lick each other’s body, wander around villages in search of bone to eat, they display a relaxed mood and get away from water points after drinking. They show normal sexual desire and the bull visits many cows within {{a short period of}} time. The popular belief is that the above <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> and behaviors, if exhibited when cattle are not sick or hungry, are reflections of future weather conditions. A study report in Kenya reveals that some of these <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> are interpreted similarly but disagrees that cattle fight over food in view of a future of drought (Speranza et al. 2010).|$|R

Zooplankton samples were collected by net sampling at locations in the western regions of the Galapagos Islands on 14 - 15 January 2006. Copepod abundance, body length, and color were examined.

5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from its mother for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs its mother for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> and reproductive ability.|$|E
5|$|Ingestion {{of plastic}} flotsam is another problem, one faced by many seabirds. The amount of plastic in the seas has {{increased}} dramatically since the first record in the 1960s, coming from waste discarded by ships, offshore dumping, litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers. It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that {{should be used for}} food, or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly. Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and <b>body</b> <b>condition.</b> This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents. While not the direct cause of death, this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings, reducing its food intake and the chances of survival.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} visible {{difference}} between the sexes {{in most of the}} family, although in several species the iris is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed bee-eater found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by <b>body</b> <b>condition,</b> suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two Nyctyornis species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.|$|E
5|$|After {{hatching}} {{the chick}} is brooded by a parent {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own <b>body</b> <b>condition.</b> The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.|$|E
50|$|On {{the habitat}} quality subject for the Adelaide pygmy blue-tongue skink (Tiliqua adelaidensis), {{it has been}} {{observed}} that when artificial burrows were offered in the field to lizards, all lizards preferred vertical burrows over angled burrows, while juvenile lizards preferred shallower burrows than did adult lizards. Observation of 36 artificial burrows showed a significant increase in lizard numbers, during 2001-02 and over three surveys. The same study suggested that this local increase in population could be due to lizards locating appropriate burrows much more easily. The overall success could be appreciated as a tool for conservation management of this endangered species. Another study compared the fitness of female pygmy blue-tongue lizards in natural burrows and artificial ones, over a 3-year period. The study showed that the females in the artificial burrows had better <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> and produced larger offspring with better <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> also.|$|R

30|$|It is indigenously {{believed}} {{among the}} Borena that specific <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> {{and behaviors of}} animals during resource abundant time give clues about the future weather. A future drought is forecasted if cattle display the following behaviors. They become calm and sleep in the pen very close to one another. They refuse to go and graze in a nearby pasture while preferring to stay near water points after drinking. They lose appetite for grass and salt, not only do bulls lack interest in mating but also isolate themselves from the herd by staying in the nearby bush and showing reluctance {{to return to the}} pen. Likewise, other cattle <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> regarded as signs of a future drought are: They become thinner with erected skin hair; their bellies never look full no matter how well they are fed; they defecate and urinate while in sitting position; and the amount of dung becomes smaller although they consume enough like other times.|$|R
25|$|The next 30 to 60 {{days of the}} {{lactation}} {{cycle is}} characterized by peak milk production levels. The amount of milk produced per day during this period varies considerably by breed and by individual cow depending on her <b>body</b> <b>condition,</b> genetics, health, and nutrition. During this period the <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> of the cow will suffer because the cow will draw on her body stores to maintain such high milk production. Food intake of the cow also will increase. After peak lactation, the cow’s milk production levels will slowly decline {{for the rest of}} the lactation cycle. The producer will often breed the cow soon after she leaves peak production. For a while, the cow’s food intake will remain high before also beginning a decline to pre lactation levels. After peak milk production her <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> will also steadily recover.|$|E

25|$|Producers will {{typically}} {{continue to}} milk the cow until she is two {{months away from}} parturition then they will dry her off. Giving the cow a break during {{the final stages of}} pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> in the cow means she will not be as productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the replacement herd. There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the dry period that is essential to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.|$|E
40|$|In {{an effect}} to {{determine}} how far inspired air could penetrate into the respiratory tract before being brought to <b>body</b> <b>conditions,</b> we measured {{the temperature in the}} airways of the anterior basilar segment of the right lower lobe in five normal subjects while they breathed air at subfreezing and ambient conditions. During quiet breathing, most of the heating of the incoming gas took place in the upper airways as expected. However, as the thermal burden was increased by rapid inspirations, frigid air, and hyperventilation, the temperature of the distal airways progressively fell and {{the point at which the}} incoming air reached <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> moved deep into the periphery of the lung.

40|$|To {{determine}} if postexercise thermal events {{play a role}} in exercise-induced asthma (EIA), nine normal and eight asthmatic subjects on three occasions exercised while they inhaled frigid air. During the recovery period, either cold air, air at room temperature and humidity, or air at <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> was administered in a random fashion. On a fourth occasion, body-condition air was given during exercise. Pulmonary mechanics were measured before and after each challenge. No changes in mechanics developed when air at <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> was inhaled during exercise, however, increasing the heat content of the air during recovery produced progressively greater obstruction in both groups. On a separate occasion, seven asthmatics hyperventilated frigid air and either recovered spontaneously or had their ventilation slowly reduced. Controlling ventilation markedly attenuated the obstructive response. These data demonstrate that the severity of EIA is dependent not only on airway cooling but also upon the rapidity and magnitude of airway rewarming postchallenge...|$|R

25|$|Most dairy {{producers}} aim for {{a replacement}} heifer {{to give birth to}} her first calf, and thus join the milking herd, on her second birthday. As the cow’s gestation period is a little over 9 months this means the cow must be inseminated by the age of 15 months. Because the breeding process is inefficient, most producers aim to first breed their heifers between 12–14 months. Before a heifer can be bred she must reach sexual maturity and attain the proper <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> to successfully bear a calf. Puberty in cattle depends largely on weight among other factors. Holstein heifers reach puberty at an average body weight between 550 to 650 lbs. Smaller breeds of cattle, such as Jerseys, usually reach puberty earlier at a lighter weight. Under typical nutritional conditions, Holstein heifers will reach puberty at the age 9–10 months. Proper <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> for breeding is also largely judged by weight. At about 800lbs Holstein heifers will normally be able to carry a healthy calf and give birth with relative ease. In this way, the heifers will be able to give birth and join the milking herd before their second birthday.|$|E
50|$|The {{problem of}} {{compatibility}} in continuum mechanics involves {{the determination of}} allowable single-valued continuous fields on <b>bodies.</b> These allowable <b>conditions</b> leave the <b>body</b> without unphysical gaps or overlaps after a deformation.

5000|$|Enantiostasis {{is not a}} form of {{classical}} homeostasis, meaning [...] "standing at a similar level," [...] which focused on maintenance of internal <b>body</b> <b>conditions</b> such as pH, oxygen levels, and ion concentrations.

25|$|In addition, sexual {{coercion}} {{can lower}} <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> and immunity in ways other than physical damage. Harassment {{can lead to}} stress, which can result in weight loss, decreased immune function and energy stores, and less feeding, which has been seen in red-spotted newts. Furthermore, when females are constantly moving around to avoid violent males, they {{are not able to}} form female social ties (for example, Grévy's zebra/Equus grevyi). This also happens in species where herding males sometimes do not permit females to join their family in different groups, like in hamadryas baboons.|$|E
25|$|Swallows {{are able}} to produce many {{different}} calls or songs, which are used to express excitement, to communicate with others of the same species, during courtship, or as an alarm when a predator is in the area. The songs of males {{are related to the}} <b>body</b> <b>condition</b> of the bird and are presumably used by females to judge the physical condition and suitability for mating of males. Begging calls are used by the young when soliciting food from their parents. The typical song of swallows is a simple, sometimes musical twittering.|$|E
25|$|The {{adaptive}} foraging {{hypothesis is}} a proposed pre-copulatory explanation in which females assess the nutritional {{value of a}} male compared to the male's value as a mate. Starving females are usually in poor physical condition {{and are therefore more}} likely to cannibalize a male than to mate with him. Among mantises, cannibalism by female Pseudomantis albofimriata improves fecundity, overall growth, and <b>body</b> <b>condition.</b> Among spiders, Dolomedes triton females in need of additional energy and nutrients for egg development choose to consume the closest nutritional source, even if this means cannibalizing a potential mate. In Agelenopsis pennsylvanica and Lycosa tarantula, a significant increase in fecundity, egg case size, hatching success, and survivorship of offspring has been observed when hungry females choose to cannibalize smaller males before copulating with larger, genetically superior males. This reproductive success was largely due to the increased energy uptake by cannibalizing males and investing that additional energy in the development of larger, higher-quality egg cases. In D. triton, post-copulatory sexual cannibalism was observed in the females that had a limited food source; these females copulated with the males and then cannibalized them.|$|E
