25|$|Medical hand-washing is for {{a minimum}} of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed {{together}} with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Detail {{in other}} colours, like white or red, were applied at this point. The relief line was {{probably}} drawn with a <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> or a hair, dipped in thick paint. The {{suggestion of a}} hollow needle seems somewhat unlikely. The application of relief outlines was necessary, as the rather liquid glossy clay would otherwise have turned out too dull. After the technique's initial phase of development, both alternatives were used, so as to differentiate gradations and details more clearly. The space between figures {{was filled with a}} glossy grey clay slip. Then, the vases underwent triple-phase firing, during which the glossy clay reached its characteristic black or black-brown colour through reduction, the reddish color by a final re-oxidation. Since this final oxidizing phase was fired using lower temperatures, the glazed parts of the vase did not re-oxidize from black to red: their finer surface was melted (sintered) in the reducing phase, and now protected from oxygen.|$|E
6000|$|Some of {{the chiefs}} had copper rings of home manufacture, with neatly cut raised figures. The king {{held in his}} right hand an article which at first puzzled us--a foot's length of split reed, with the bulbous root attached. He may not, like his vassals, point with the finger, and without {{pointing}} an African can hardly give an order. Moreover, the Sangálávú or Malaguetta pepper (Amomum granum Paradisi), fresh or old, is not only a toothstick, but a fetish of superior power when carried on journeys. Professor Smith writes [...] "Sangala woo," [...] and tells us that it was always kept fresh in the house, to be rolled in the hands when invoking the Fetish during war-time; moreover, it was chewed to be spat at the enemy. Possibly he confuses it with the use as a tooth-stick, the article which Asia and Africa prefer to the unclean hog's- <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> of Europe.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used types of brushes mainly because it can be used for any type of coat. As a general rule, longer and widely spaced {{bristles}} are suitable for dogs with longer coats and shorter and tightly-packed ones are better to use on dogs with short hair. Typically, the <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> is used on dogs with long coats to finish the coat and to bring out the natural lustre and shine of the coat. It is commonly used in daily grooming as it removes surface dust and dirt.|$|E
50|$|The smooth, short haired coat {{is easy to}} maintain. The {{brushing}} can be {{done with}} a firm <b>bristle</b> <b>brush,</b> and dry shampoo may be used occasionally if needed. The coat does not need bathing unless extremely dirty. Finnish hounds are average shedders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bristle</b> <b>brushes</b> {{are usually}} used to apply {{plumbing}} paste flux. For electronic work, flux-core solder is generally used, but additional flux {{may be used}} from a flux pen or dispensed from a small bottle with a syringe-like needle.|$|R
50|$|A new 2-3 inch {{diameter}} soft <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> is a {{good choice}} for the application of wax. “Chip” brushes are easy to find in hardware stores, and are a good choice because of their natural bristles and relative inexpensiveness.|$|R
5000|$|Rough stucco is used {{to imitate}} stonework. It is worked with a hand float covered with rough felt (a stiff <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> can also be used), which forms a sand surface on the plaster. Lines are ruled before the stuff is set to {{represent}} the joints of stonework.|$|R

50|$|The {{wire brush}} is {{primarily}} an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It {{is also used}} to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel <b>bristle</b> wire <b>brush,</b> as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass <b>bristle</b> <b>brushes</b> are used on softer surfaces or in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.|$|R

50|$|Dog brushes come {{in various}} {{sizes and shapes}} {{can be made from}} metal, plastic and wood. Although there are many types of dog brushes, they are not very popular amongst the {{professional}} dog groomers as most of them prefer using teasels. Dog brushes are perfect for breeds that have long and fragile hair, especially if the coat is getting properly taken care of. Common dog brushes are the <b>bristle</b> <b>brush,</b> wire pin brush, and the slicker brush.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{distribute}} the hair's natural oils through the hair is by brushing with a natural <b>bristle</b> <b>brush.</b> The natural bristles effectively move the oil from the scalp through to the hair's mid-lengths and ends, nourishing these parts of the hair. Brushing the scalp also stimulates the sebaceous gland, which in turn produces more sebum. When sebum and sweat combine on the scalp surface, they help to create the acid mantle, which is the skin's own protective layer.|$|E
5000|$|Brush: For liquid foundation, a {{brush with}} a {{synthetic}} bristle is recommended as the brush won’t soak {{up too much}} of the liquid. Alternatively, a natural bristle which is more porous works best for powder foundations such as mineral makeup. A densely <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> is best for foundation as it is less likely to leave tell-tale streaky brush marks. As with all tools used to apply makeup to the face, brushes should be soft and gentle, as anything too stiff will scratch and irritate the skin.|$|R

50|$|A hard {{shaving soap}} is {{used with a}} shaving brush to create lather for shaving. For soap {{in the form of}} a puck or bar, the brush is first soaked in water and then swirled vigorously over the surface of the soap, causing moist soap to coat the <b>brush's</b> <b>bristles.</b> The <b>brush</b> is then {{transferred}} either to a separate bowl or to the shaver's face to be lathered.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic {{materials}} such as nylon are also used to make bristles in items such as brooms and sweepers. Bristles are often used to make brushes for cleaning purposes, as they are strongly abrasive; common examples include the toothbrush and toilet brush. The <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> and the scrub brush are common household cleaning tools, often used to remove dirt or grease from pots and pans. Bristles are also used on brushes other than for cleaning, notably paintbrushes.|$|E

50|$|Some fluxes for {{electronics}} {{are designed}} to be stable and inactive when cool and {{do not need to be}} cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or <b>bristle</b> <b>brushes</b> to remove flux residue after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.|$|R
50|$|Dust {{and dirt}} can {{accumulate}} feathers {{and can be}} cleaned manually. The preferred methods are gentle brushing with a soft <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> or pinpoint vacuuming through a screen. These methods will leave the feathers in good condition in their natural alignment. However, solvents {{may be needed to}} clean feathers if dust is held in place by grease, which can leach out of skins. Distilled water may be used if dry methods fail, but more stubborn dust may need to be cleaned with non-denatured 70% ethanol. However, solvents may strip natural oils in feathers and leave them brittle.|$|R

50|$|After {{returning}} to New York from a Fulbright Fellowship {{in his native}} Ecuador in the early 1990s, Bastidas began using a restricted color palette of black and white, alluding to black-and-white photography. His medium- and large-scale paintings featured contrasting zones {{of high and low}} detail. By making thousands of marks with a size No. 1 hog's <b>bristle</b> <b>brush</b> on linen primed with rabbit-skin glue, Bastidas achieved a high level of image definition. He also works in digital photography, which informs his subject matter without rendering a photo-realistic effect.|$|E
50|$|If the {{aetiology}} of abrasion {{is due to}} habitual behaviours, the discontinuation {{and change}} of habit is critical {{in the prevention of}} further tooth loss. The correct brushing technique is pivotal and involves a gentle scrub technique with small horizontal movements with an extra-soft/soft <b>bristle</b> <b>brush.</b> Excessive lateral force can be corrected by holding the toothbrush in a pen grasp or by using the non-dominant hand to brush. If abrasion is the result of an ill-fitting dental appliance, this should be corrected or replaced by a dental practitioner and should not be attempted in a home setting.|$|E

If applied to woodwork distemper is apt to flake off. The one-knot brush for cornices and other moldings and the two-knot and brassbound brushes for flat surfaces are usually employed for distempering and whitewashing. A granular surface is produced by stippling or dabbing the surface with a stiff <b>bristled</b> <b>brush</b> specially made for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{technique}} [...] ( [...] , [...] "staight-line bokashi") {{is the one}} {{associated with}} the works of Hokusai and Hiroshige. Ink is applied only to {{one end of the}} <b>brush's</b> <b>bristles,</b> and the <b>brush</b> is drawn across the desired portion of the printing block; this area is first wetted with a [...] cloth, so that the ink bleeds somewhat across the wet area. This creates a gradation at the width of the brush.|$|R
