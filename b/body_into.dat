5|$|An {{incidental}} {{appearance of}} Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of Medea's brother. In {{the myth of}} Jason and the Argonauts, as they journeyed home, Medea killed her brother and dismembered him, flinging the parts of his <b>body</b> <b>into</b> the sea, represented by the Milky Way. Each individual star represents a different limb.|$|E

5|$|A Canadian mutant {{and future}} X-Men member and often {{referred}} as Jimmy by Victor Creed. Jackman, who played Wolverine {{in the previous}} films, has also become producer of the film via his company Seed Productions, and earned $25million for the film. Jackman underwent a high intensity weight training regimen to improve his physique for the role. He altered the program to shock his <b>body</b> <b>into</b> change and also performed cardiovascular workouts. Jackman noted no digital touches were applied to his physique in a shot of him rising from the tank within which Wolverine has his bones infused with adamantium.|$|E
5|$|According to Hindu legend, Sati, the {{daughter}} of Prajapati Daksha, married Shiva against the wish of Daksha. Daksha organised a great yajna (sacrifice), but did not invite Sati and Shiva. Uninvited, Sati reached the yajna-site, where Daksha ignored Sati and vilified Shiva. Unable to withstand this insult, Sati sacrificed herself in the fire. The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with her half-burnt corpse. Finally, Vishnu dismembered her <b>body</b> <b>into</b> 51 parts, each of which fell on different places on the earth, each creating a Shakti Pitha.|$|E

5|$|Brett {{follows the}} crew's cat, Jones, into an engine {{room and the}} now fully-grown alien (Bolaji Badejo) attacks him and disappears with his <b>body</b> <b>into</b> an air shaft. After heated discussion, the crew decide the {{creature}} {{must be in the}} air ducts. Dallas enters the ducts, intending to force the alien into the airlock, but it ambushes him. Lambert implores the others to abandon ship and escape in its small shuttle. Now in command, Ripley explains that the shuttle will not support four people and pushes to continue with Dallas' plan of flushing out the alien.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's <b>body</b> <b>into</b> pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult centers of Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the murder}} of Jon Snow, his dire-wolf Ghost begins to howl as the sun rises above Castle Black, {{attracting}} the attention of Davos Seaworth, Eddison Tollett, {{and a few other}} loyalists. They release Ghost from his nearby pen and take Jon's <b>body</b> <b>into</b> a store-room, whereupon Melisandre briefly visits and is troubled, as she had experienced a vision in the flames where Jon was fighting at Winterfell. The loyalists become fearful and also lock themselves in from the mutineers, with the exception of Edd, who sneaks out of Castle Black to get assistance from the Wildlings against the mutineers.|$|E

Archeocytes remove mineral particles that threaten to block the ostia, transport them through the mesohyl and generally dump them into the outgoing water current, although some species incorporate them into their skeletons.|$|E
5|$|The Scotch bonnet is preyed upon by vertebrates, such as fish, and invertebrates, {{including}} crabs such as {{the blue}} crab and the Florida stone crab. Crabs can crush the snail's shell, eating the soft internal organs and muscle tissue. The snail's only defense mechanism against predation is to draw its <b>body</b> <b>into</b> the shell. By doing so, they can close the aperture using the operculum.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the toxic constituents eluded researchers until 1968, when acetaldehyde N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone, better known as gyromitrin, was isolated. Gyromitrin is a volatile water-soluble hydrazine compound hydrolyzed in the <b>body</b> <b>into</b> monomethylhydrazine (MMH). Other N-methyl-N-formylhydrazone derivatives have been isolated in subsequent research, although they are present in smaller amounts. These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.|$|E

By this time, Irwin's group had organized churches in eight U. S. states and two Canadian provinces.|$|E

Alan and Joanna throw the <b>body</b> <b>into</b> the incinerator, but become paranoid that they will be discovered. Alan however learns from Boyce that the death is being viewed as a suicide, so Alan and Joanna go on a rampage, thinking themselves above the law.|$|E
5|$|At the time, prison-based {{films were}} not {{considered}} likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainment producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce The Shawshank Redemption. Director and Castle Rock co-founder Rob Reiner also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million {{to allow him to}} direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's novella The <b>Body</b> <b>into</b> the 1986 film Stand by Me, planned to cast Tom Cruise as Andy and Harrison Ford as Red.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the <b>body</b> <b>into</b> several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E
