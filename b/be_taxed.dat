5|$|In Rome the portico of the Palazzo dei Conservatori {{sheltered}} {{offices of}} various guilds. Here disputes arising in the transaction of business were adjudicated, {{unless they were}} of sufficient importance to go before a communal tribunal, {{such as that of}} the conservatori. It was a natural place for such activity. Until the 1470s the main market of the city was held on and around the campidoglio, while cattle continued to <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> and sold in the ancient forum located just to the south.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would <b>be</b> <b>taxed.</b> Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should <b>be</b> <b>taxed.</b> Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E
5|$|Ralph de Luffa (or Ralph Luffa (died 1123) was an English {{bishop of}} Chichester, from 1091 to 1123. He built {{extensively}} on his cathedral {{as well as}} being praised by contemporary writers as an exemplary bishop. He took little part in the Investiture Crisis which took place in England during his episcopate. Although at one point he refused to allow his diocese to <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> by King Henry I of England, Luffa remained on good terms with the two kings of England he served.|$|E

5|$|The Sugar Act {{provoked}} outrage in Boston, {{where it}} was widely viewed {{as a violation of}} colonial rights. Men such as James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, they could not <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.|$|E
5|$|Tuition is {{paid for}} by general {{taxation}} in Germany, although only 27% of young people gain higher education qualification there, whereas in the UK the comparable figure is 48%. Fully or partly funding universities from general taxation has been criticised by the Liberal Democrat party as a 'tax cut {{for the rich and}} a tax rise for the poor' because people would <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> to pay for something that many would not derive a benefit from, while graduates generally earn more due to their qualifications and only have to pay them back.|$|E
5|$|From the Székelys, {{continuing}} warfare demanded increased military service, and {{the royal}} administration imposed special taxes on them. Although {{the leaders of}} the Székely community were exempted from taxation in 1554, but all the foot soldiers continued to <b>be</b> <b>taxed,</b> resulting in a double burden of military and monetary obligations for them. In 1562 many Székelys took up arms against John II Sigismund, but they were defeated. The Saxon towns continued to develop even in the years of upheaval. Their population, however, increased slowly, mainly {{as a consequence of the}} Saxons' traditional desire for segregation: even Hungarian craftsmen and merchants were prohibited from settling in their towns.|$|E
50|$|Corporate <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> levied {{at a rate}} of 12% for revenue {{less than}} 3 million kn and 18% for more.

Several types of credits reduce tax, and {{some types of}} credits may exceed tax before credits. An alternative tax applies at the federal and some state levels.|$|R
5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> to him).|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the bookseller and apothecary, the scholarly gentry class did not engage in trade professions, since scholars and government officials viewed the merchant class as lowly and contemptible. Sympathetic to the plight of farming peasants who had lost their land, a court edict of 94 CE stipulated that farming peasants who had been reduced to selling wares as street peddlers were not to <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> as registered merchants, since the latter were heavily taxed by the state. Registered merchants, the majority being small urban shopkeepers, were obligated to pay commercial taxes in addition to the poll tax.|$|E
5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E

50|$|The second tax, the {{processors}} tax, {{applies to}} the processing of natural resources. It also {{is based on the}} taxable value of the natural resource. Timber processing <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at 0.375% of taxable value; processing of potash and molybdenum <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at 0.125%; and processing of all other resources <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> at 0.75%.|$|R
50|$|With a flat tax, by comparison, {{all income}} <b>is</b> <b>taxed</b> {{at the same}} percentage, {{regardless}} of amount. An example <b>is</b> a sales <b>tax</b> where all purchases <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> equally. A poll <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> a flat <b>tax</b> of a set dollar amount per person. The marginal tax in these scenarios would be zero.|$|R
5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E
5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also <b>be</b> <b>taxed</b> nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, they have all the immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|E

5000|$|Progressivity in {{the income}} <b>tax</b> <b>is</b> {{accomplished}} mainly by establishing tax [...] "brackets" [...] - branches of income that <b>are</b> <b>taxed</b> at progressively higher rates.
