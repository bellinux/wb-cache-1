40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{identity}} disorders in schizophrenics and <b>borderlines.</b> Nineteen schizophrenics and 17 <b>borderlines</b> {{were compared with}} 18 normal controls. The technique used was an adapted version of the repertory grid test to describe the self and nine significant others (i. e., family members). Three indices were derived from the 10 person x 20 self-generated-attribute matrix to measure {{the extent to which}} self was differentiated from others: (1) overlap of salient attributes, (2) overlap of opposite attributes, and (3) degree of differentiation among others. Results showed that both schizophrenics and <b>borderlines</b> describe themselves more in terms of opposites than in terms of salient attributes. Differentiation among significant others was severely impaired in schizophrenics and preserved in <b>borderlines.</b> These findings were interpreted as a failure of the individuation process in schizophrenics and as an incomplete construal of self-identity in <b>borderlines.</b> (C) 1995 by W.

5|$|In biochemistry, {{heavy metals}} are {{sometimes}} defined—on {{the basis of}} the Lewis acid (electronic pair acceptor) behaviour of their ions in aqueous solution—as class B and <b>borderline</b> metals. In this scheme, class A metal ions prefer oxygen donors; class B ions prefer nitrogen or sulfur donors; and <b>borderline</b> or ambivalent ions show either class A or B characteristics, depending on the circumstances. Class A metals, which tend to have low electronegativity and form bonds with large ionic character, are the alkali and alkaline earths, aluminium, the group 3 metals, and the lanthanides and actinides. Class B metals, which tend to have higher electronegativity and form bonds with considerable covalent character, are mainly the heavier transition and post-transition metals. <b>Borderline</b> metals largely comprise the lighter transition and post-transition metals (plus arsenic and antimony). The distinction between the class A metals and the other two categories is sharp. A frequently cited proposal to use these classification categories instead of the more evocative name heavy metal has not been widely adopted.|$|E

The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E

5|$|During {{this period}} {{her mother had}} died, and Bryher had {{divorced}} her husband, only to marry H.D.'s new male lover, Kenneth Macpherson. H.D., Bryher, and Macpherson lived together and traveled through Europe as what the poet and critic Barbara Guest termed in her biography of H.D. as a 'menagerie of three.' Bryher and Macpherson adopted H.D.'s daughter, Perdita. In 1928, H.D. became pregnant but chose to abort the pregnancy in November. Bryher and Macpherson set up the magazine Close Up (to which H.D. regularly contributed) as a medium for intellectual discussion of cinema. In 1927, the small independent film cinema group POOL or Pool Group was established (largely funded with Bryher's inheritance) and was managed by all three. Only one POOL film survives in its entirety, <b>Borderline</b> (1930), which featured H.D. and Paul Robeson in the lead roles. In common with the <b>Borderline</b> novellas, the film explores extreme psychic states {{and their relationship to}} surface reality. As well as acting in this film, H.D. wrote an explanatory pamphlet to accompany it, a piece later published in Close Up.|$|E

5|$|The bonding in boron {{has been}} {{described}} as being characteristic of behaviour intermediate between metals and nonmetallic covalent network solids (such as diamond). The energy required to transform B, C, N, Si and P from nonmetallic to metallic states has been estimated as 30, 100, 240, 33 and 50 kJ/mol, respectively. This indicates the proximity of boron to the metal-nonmetal <b>borderline.</b>|$|E

5|$|Abuse during {{childhood}} is {{accepted as a}} primary social factor increasing the incidence of self-harm, as is bereavement, and troubled parental or partner relationships. Factors such as war, poverty, and unemployment may also contribute. Self-harm is frequently described as an experience of depersonalisation or a dissociative state. As many as 70% of individuals with <b>borderline</b> personality disorder engage in self-harm. An estimated 30% of individuals with autism spectrum disorders engage in self-harm at some point, including eye-poking, skin-picking, hand-biting, and head-banging.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} a simple method for wafer-scale {{production}} of precisely-shaped 2 D patterns of porous anodic alumina (PAA) by masked anodization of aluminum films. The produced dielectric PAA structures, featuring cylindrical nano-pores of very high aspect ratio (> 100), are useful for several applications including the production of nanowires and miniature MEMS packages. The fabrication process utilizes a photoresist mask; but to overcome the instability of the photoresist during the anodization process, special <b>borderlines</b> {{are included in the}} mask design. These <b>borderlines</b> act as self-synchronized switches for the anodization current, preventing the undesired photoresist delamination and lateral extension of the PAA structures. Employing such <b>borderlines</b> resulted in a reduction of the lateral extension of masked Al anodization on 200 mm wafers from more than 300 μm to approximately 6 μm...|$|R

5|$|The {{distinction}} between nonmetals and metals {{is by no}} means clear. The result is that a few <b>borderline</b> elements lacking a preponderance of either nonmetallic or metallic properties are classified as metalloids; and some elements classified as nonmetals are instead sometimes classified as metalloids, or vice versa. For example, selenium (Se), a nonmetal, is sometimes classified instead as a metalloid, particularly in environmental chemistry; and astatine (At), which is a metalloid and a halogen, is sometimes classified instead as a nonmetal.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied to metals that floated on water (lithium, sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Only recently, since the mid-20th century, has it been widely {{used to refer to}} elements with intermediate or <b>borderline</b> properties between metals and nonmetals.|$|E
40|$|Building {{or space}} {{is not a}} single entity, it is a (piece of) manifestation of life and the environment. Architecture is about the whole, {{including}} individual space, building and all surroundings- urban and rural- rather than treating {{it as if it were}} a single, abstract phenomenon. Architecture is about life; its connection with life is existential … And if the motto of life at present can be stated as “living in the city or the city life, ” today’s architecture can also be stated as a manifestation of the city life. City life means having privacy, joining the public life, and moving about easily. This can also be summed up as private in the public and public in the private. Briefly, living in the city is being able to join both parties, belong to both parties: public and private, and to move somehow, mentally, emotionally, virtually or physically. Therefore, <b>borderlines</b> appear as important accesses as well as problematic of today’s cities. Designing today can be called designing the <b>borderlines</b> and the passages, which is designing the interactions … <b>Borderlines</b> give opportunities for passages, mix usage and open structures. They make possible the moving from one side and situation to another side and situation … From several perspectives, <b>borderlines</b> look like the places for the creation of new knowledge and new settings of life, city and architecture… Briefly, this paper will look at the possibilities of <b>borderlines</b> … the possibilities of enlarging them into the passages … the necessary life corridors...|$|R
