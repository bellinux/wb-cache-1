40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper I argued {{that we do}} not have an {{objective}} conception of <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> and that this is a particular problem because the courts describe that they use an ‘…objective approach or test.

I further argued that there was no obvious way in which we could hope to develop an objective notion of <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> As well as this, I argued that a best-interest-based approach was a particular problem around the time of death of some children. A response from a legal perspective argued that, while there is not a clear conception of objective <b>best</b> <b>interests,</b> the courts have a well-described approach to finding a child's objective <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> In this paper, I argue that without clear agreement on an objective conception of <b>best</b> <b>interests,</b> the courts are unable to locate an objective sense of <b>best</b> <b>interests</b> and that the solutions do not solve the problems that were identified in the initial paper ‘Death and best interests’...|$|R

40|$|The Mental Capacity Act (2005) is an {{impressive}} {{piece of legislation that}} deserves serious ethical attention, but much of the commentary on the Act has focussed on its legal and practical implications rather than the underlying ethical concepts. This paper examines the approach that the Act takes to <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> The Act does not provide an account of the underlying concept of <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> Instead it lists factors that must be considered in determining <b>best</b> <b>interests,</b> and the Code of Practice to the Act states that this list is incomplete. This paper argues that this general approach is correct, contrary to some accounts of <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> The checklist includes items that are unhelpful. Furthermore, neither the Act nor its Code of Practice provides sufficient guidance to carers faced with difficult decisions concerning <b>best</b> <b>interests.</b> This paper suggests ways in which the checklist can be developed and discusses cases {{that could be used in}} an updated Code of Practice...|$|R
5|$|From the beginning, the {{alliance}} {{was much more}} valuable to the Commonwealth than to Prussia. Soon after the treaty was signed, the international situation, and changes within the Commonwealth, made the treaty much less valuable to the Prussian side. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth embarked {{on a series of}} major internal reforms, seeing {{the alliance}} as a guarantee that it had the backing of a powerful neighbor in this process – where in fact Prussia felt those reforms were not in its <b>best</b> <b>interest,</b> and felt threatened by them. When Russia invaded the Commonwealth in May 1792, Prussia refused a request to honor the alliance and intervene, arguing that it was not consulted with regard to the 3rd May Constitution, which invalidated the alliance. A few months later, in 1793, Prussia aided Russia in the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E

At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen U.S. representatives and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial swing state in presidential elections, {{and it would have been}} devastating to the fledgling Democratic Party to lose Ohio's electoral votes.

With the help of U.S. Supreme Court justice Felix Frankfurter, Bohr met with the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was initially sympathetic to his ideas about controlling nuclear weapons on 26 August 1944; but Churchill was adamantly opposed to informing the Soviet Union of such work.

Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E
5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is in their <b>best</b> <b>interest,</b> expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
