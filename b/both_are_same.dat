2500|$|Kali and Tara {{are similar}} in appearance. They both are {{described}} as standing upon a supine Shiva in an inert or corpse-like form. However, while Kali is described as black, Tara is described as blue. Both wear minimal clothing, however Tara wears a tiger-skin skirt, while Kali wears only a girdle of severed human arms. Both wear a garland of severed human heads. Both have a lolling tongue, and blood oozes from their mouths. Their appearances are so strikingly similar that {{it is easy to}} mistake one for the other. Indeed, they are manifestations of each other and Sadhaka should not have duality among Kali and Tara in his/her mind as <b>both</b> <b>are</b> <b>same.</b> Tara has eight form called Ashta Tara and the names are Tara, [...] Ugra Tara, Maha Ugra Tara, Kam Tara, Ekjata, Nil Saraswati, Vajra, and Bhadra-kali. Tara is said to be more approachable to the devotee (Bhakta) or Tantrika because of her maternal instincts; a large population of Bengali Hindus approach both Kali and Tara as [...] "Ma" [...] or [...] "mother".|$|E

Alternatively, a company could have one or the other, or both occupied by separate people. Often, a CSO exists in heavily client-focussed companies, while a COO exists in product development focused companies. A CSO almost always has a strong operations background and advanced degree, whereas a COO often has a background in business development. Both CSO and COO report to the CEO or managing director of a company.|$|E

His mother with Nazeera starts preparing badam kheer for Ram. Nazeera starts speaking indirectly about Ram when Parvati calls her Nazeera (not Khanum) {{for which she}} gets shocked. Parvati tells {{that it was only}} Khanum who knows about the shoes and how Nazeera can give the money unless <b>both</b> <b>are</b> <b>same,</b> and thus Nazeera's identity is revealed again.

Nazeera tries to call Ram but is obstructed. She goes to Malaysia. Then Ram tells that he never knew Nazeera and only has a letter which he got from her after that.|$|E

The arts, referring to the performing arts and literature, have the corresponding degrees: Bachelor of Arts (BA) and the Master of Arts (MA). Management degrees are also classified under 'Arts' but is nowadays considered a major new stream, Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) and Master Of Business Administration (MBA). Science referring to the basic sciences and natural science (Biology, Physics, Chemistry etc.) the corresponding degree are Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) and its master is called Master of Science (M.Sc.). Another new set of Information Technology degree conferred specially {{in the field of}} computer science, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (B.Sc.IT.) and Master of Science in Information Technology (M.Sc.IT.). The engineering degrees in India follow two common patterns. Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) and Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) both representing a bachelor's degree in engineering and Pakistan Engineering Degrees are Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) and B.Sc. Engineering <b>both</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> in curriculum, duration and pattern. where as B. Tech.

5000|$|On {{the edge}} of Sariska National Park, 14 {{kilometres}} from Amanbagh is Narayani Mata temple. As the most sacred pilgrimage site for the people All over India of sain samaj, its sanctity is matched only by Pushkar and Mount Abu. According to legend, Narayani Mata {{is the site of}} the first Sati (immolation by fire) in Northern India before rani sati. The legend states that following the death of her husband from a snakebite mid way to alwar when she was going first time to her husband house after marriage, Narayani was stricken by grief and knelt in prayer beside his unlit funeral pyre. Such was her devotion to Lord Shiva and so fervent her wish to join her dead husband, that Shiva sent his holy fire to consume them both. Marking the site is a holy spring - an unusual source of water in a semi-desert land - that acts as a draw to colourfully dressed pilgrims offering their puja to Narayani Mata's main Shiva temple. the priest of this temple is meena caste. and some people also says that narayani sati and rani sati <b>both</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> [...] but due to caste sain has been given this temple and all baniyas ( [...] agrawals [...] ) are not allowed to enter in this temple.As per history of Maa narayani sati, its avtar of Mata Sati, she was First wife of Lord Shiva.when ever Sati father (Raja Daksha) announced the big Yagya, He is Invited to all Devtas, but don't Invited to Lord Shiva. after this announcement Shiva is very angry that he don't Invite me in the Yagya. then sati has knowledge that her Husband don't invite then she is angry also.Sati went to in yagya without Invitation, she thought its my father events. there presents almost gods, then sati's father meet her daughter then insult her husband Lord Shiva. Sati was very angry and invoked Yoga aagni to sacrifice her avatar.Since it was yoga aagni, the body was not burnt and Shiva carried it along. Vishnu followed Shiva and tore the body into pieces. These pieces fell at different places and are called [...] "Shakti Peethas". They are 18 in number. Although a wife is called [...] "Ardhangi, Patni, Sahadharmacharini", yet when a wife leaves her body because of unable to bear the separation from husband, such a process is called [...] "sati sahagamanam". It should be in Yoga aagni unlike popular belief of husbands' chiti.After That Shiva Came in Yagya or Cut the head of Raja Daksha by Trishul then pick the burn body of Sati in both hands and went to fly over the Sky [...] and he has visit here & there in Sky. So during the visit by Shiva some Peace of Sati Body drop the many places on Earth. then Shiva Announced about these places shall be famous by Sati Place. so one of Place is Maa Narayani Sati.Before 1993 yrs every year big Fair organised by Local Peoples.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{temperature}} distribution in convective radiative continuously moving fin with variable thermal conductivity, which is losing heat by simultaneous convection radiation to surroundings, is studied. We consider three particular cases, namely thermal conductivity is (I) constant (II) a linear function of temperature and (III) an exponential function of temperature. Wavelet Collocation Method {{is used to}} solve this nonlinear heat transfer problem. The exact solution obtained in absence of radiation- conduction fin parameter and compared with Wavelet Collocation solution <b>both</b> <b>are</b> <b>same.</b> The whole analysis is presented in dimensionless form and effect of different parameters such as thermal conductivity parameter â€˜Aâ€™, Peclet number â€˜Peâ€™, convection-conduction parameter â€˜Ncâ€™, radiation-conduction parameter â€˜Nrâ€™, dimensionless convection sink temperature â€˜Î¸a â€™ and dimensionless radiation sink temperature â€˜Î¸s â€™ on the fin temperature is discussed in detail. Effect of different parameters on surface heat loss also studied...|$|E

40|$|The {{essence of}} manga are the lines. Drawing lines, or lines drawn, inevitably {{involves}} both symbolism and imagism. Manga {{is an art}} of simulation. Drawing manga is not a representation imitating reality. It is a creative activity portraying another reality which can/could be a counterpart to a real reality. It was Walter Benjamin that thought an artwork had been had maximal worth of worship, called an aura, for its singleness, however after the invention of photography in 19 th century, artworks has been had maximal worth of exhibition, what I want to call another aura, for its plurality. He admired cinematography as a montage of photos. Its plurality expresses motion. It is an aura that cinematography has. Manga is an art of time employing technology of reproduction as well as cinematography is. In 1827, Rodolphe TÃ¶pffer drew an original comic-strip. He thought that the essence of manga {{is a series of}} dual reproduction. It is reproductions based on a mechanism named autography, also based on a manual mechanism named simple drawing. He thought that permutations and combinations of types of facial parts make his characters have various personalities and feelings. A kyara in manga, is a double symbolic image. It is drawn by symbolic lines, composed by typical signs. We can reproduce kyaras limitlessly by our hands. In a single text, different (/a various of) kyaras propagate syntaxly. We regard them as motion in separated frames. We can reproduce kyaras limitlessly by technology. Across some texts, kyaras propagate paradigmatically. We can observe them in printing and binding products. Both are results by reproduction, while <b>both</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> essentially facilitate the same effect in kyara-representation. In case that kyaras cross other media, they are all reproduction. A kyara has high symbolism by its typification. It contributes largely to reproducing and pluralising itself. However, even though a kyara is single, it can be entirely appraised by its potential plurality: aura...|$|E
