25|$|Ironically, Will and Jim {{can be said}} to have aged prematurely in the novel; {{the horrors}} of the {{carnival}} force them to grow up fast to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> its tricks on a knowledgeable level. Furthermore, Will and Jim do take a brief ride on the carousel before Will pulls Jim off, and they are never shown reversing this process before Charles destroys its machinations. Thus, it can be stated that they, in fact, grow up slightly. In this case, though, Will and Jim have also matured emotionally, too, having had their first encounter with evil. This enables them to grow more proportionally in both physical and emotional status.|$|E

And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it of yours? You just shut your mouth, and stay out of it. Because in the future, we gonna become a nation.

25|$|The core {{objective}} in {{training to be}} a solo diver is to become as self-sufficient and self-reliant as possible, to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> any reasonably foreseeable problems without assistance, {{and to have the}} competence, fitness, discipline, skills and equipment that will achieve this result. This requires competence at risk-assessment and the ability to plan dives and select equipment that limit the risks. An additional benefit of these disciplines is that they will improve the safety of buddy diving whenever the competent solo diver pairs up with another diver in a buddy team by reducing the risk of the second diver being exposed to an emergency which they may not be capable of managing. Agencies training solo divers also recommend the self-sufficiency training in their courses for all divers as their diving experience grows, so as to achieve greater safety in all diving—buddy and solo.|$|E

25|$|By 3:30 on 1 September Psyche {{had caught}} up with the Dutch vessels and run them ashore. She went as close as the water depth would allow, {{anchored}} and exchanged fire with them. All three surrendered quickly. One that she captured was the 24-gun corvette Scipio, which had a crew of 150 men. Scipio was badly shot up and her commander, Captain-Lieutenant Jan Hendrik Correga, had been mortally wounded. The largest armed merchant ship was the Resolutie, of 700 tons. She had a valuable cargo and as passengers the colours and staff of the Dutch 23rd European Battalion. The third vessel was the brig Ceres, of 12 guns and 70 men. Pellew had too few men to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the prisoners so he paroled the officers to the governor of Samarang and gave up the all the other men against a receipt. The British took Scipio into service under her existing name, but then renamed her Samarang.|$|E
500|$|NASA {{administrator}} James Webb {{became increasingly}} worried about Shea's mental state. Specifically, {{he was concerned}} that Shea might not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the hostile questioning that he would receive from the congressional inquiry into the Apollo 1 fire. Senator Walter Mondale had accused NASA engineers of [...] "criminal negligence" [...] {{with regard to the}} design and construction of the Apollo command module, and it was reliably expected that Shea would be in the firing line. In March, Webb sent Robert Seamans and Charles Berry, NASA's head physician, to speak with Shea and ask him to take an extended voluntary leave of absence. This would, they hoped, protect him from being called to testify. A press release was already prepared, but Shea refused, threatening to resign rather than take leave. As a compromise, he agreed to meet with a psychiatrist and to abide by an independent assessment of his psychological fitness. Yet this approach to removing Shea from his position was also unsuccessful. As one of his friends later recounted: ...|$|E

[...] The remedy is to keep it away from zero, possibly by using RCS firings. [...] This is not very satisfactory, and in practice all spacecraft using CMGs are fitted with at least three.
