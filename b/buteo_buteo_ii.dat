40|$|VAURIE (1961) in {{a recent}} review of the {{geographical}} races of the Common, or Eurasian, Buzzard (<b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo</b> (Linnaeus)) has found no evidence in favour of the recognition of a West Chinese or Tibetan mountain race of that species. Even less he considers it likely that the Buzzard nests in mountain forests in the Himalayas. In his conclusion he is at variance with PORTENKO (1929 : 644) who described a special race from the Cham region in East Tibet and mentioned specimens ascribed to this race from West China, Darjeeling, Sikkim, and the northwestern Himalaya. This race, originally described as <b>Buteo</b> japonicus saturatus, was re-named by PORTENKO in 1935 <b>Buteo</b> japonicus refectus on nomenclatorial reasons (Orn. Monatsb., 43 : 152). It was considered by HARTERT & STEINBACHER (1932 — 38) as a synonym of <b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo</b> burmanicus Hume and by VAURIE (1961) as a synonym of <b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo</b> japonicus Temminck & Schlegel. Neither {{the question of the}} occurrence of Buzzards as breeding birds in the Sino-Himalayan mountains, nor the nomenclature of Buzzards actually collected in these regions has at present been solved. Still, the Buzzard is mentioned to breed in Tibet and Ladakh by both RIPLEY (1961) and ALI (1962) under the name of burmanicus, but not in Sikkim (ALI, 1962). For zoogeographical reasons the occurrence of a Sino-Himalayan race of Common Buzzard would be most interesting since these mountain populations would enclose a Central Asiatic group of buzzards living in semi-deserts and cold steppes (B. rufinus and B. hemilasius). These Central Asiatic high plateau buzzards occur south of the forest-inhabiting Common Buzzards from Siberia and are sometimes considered as conspecific, or almost so, with the whole group of Buzzards of the species <b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo.</b> The breeding range and the characters of the mountain buzzards therefore have those noteworthy zoogeographical complications in that they would indicate an additional ecological basis for the subspecies formation in this group of raptors...|$|R

50|$|The {{northern}} goshawk {{appears on the}} flag of the Azores. The archipelago of the Azores, Portugal, takes its name from the Portuguese language word for goshawk, (açor), because the explorers who discovered the archipelago thought the birds of prey they saw there were goshawks; later it was found that these birds were kites or common buzzards (<b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo</b> rothschildi). The goshawk features in the crest of the Drummond Clan.|$|R
50|$|The {{name of the}} {{archipelago}} comes from the Portuguese word açor, meaning goshawk, because {{it was supposed to}} be a common bird at the time of the discovery. However these birds never existed on the islands, they actually were a local subspecies of the buzzard (<b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo),</b> that was erroneously identified as goshawks by the first explorers. The Portuguese lesser arms are present in the top left corner of the flag.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern buzzard or Japanese buzzard (<b>Buteo</b> japonicus) is {{a medium}} to large {{bird of prey}} that is {{sometimes}} considered a subspecies of the widespread common buzzard (<b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo).</b> some scientists treated is as a distinct species starting 2008, but most people still treat it as a subspecies,It is native to Mongolia, China, Japan and some offshore islands.

50|$|Klonk is the nesting {{place for}} a number of birds, among others the grey wagtail (Motacilla cinerea), Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} (Accipited nisus) or the common buzzard (<b>Buteo</b> <b>buteo).</b> Most of the fauna here is represented by invertebrates, however apart from other areas of the Bohemian karst it is somewhat poorer in molluscs.

The woods have a rich fauna which includes fallow deer (Dama dama).

5|$|Mountain birds around Helvellyn {{include the}} raven (Corvus corax), {{which has now}} become common.

Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably Aquila chrysaetos) soared over the mountain and bred on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, but even in Wordsworth's day they had gone, having been persecuted to extinction.|$|R
