5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed {{on through the}} village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he sensed a counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E

5|$|Clark {{chaired the}} government's Industrial Development Advisory Board from 1973 to 1980. In this {{position}} {{he found himself}} frustrated by Secretary of State for Industry Tony Benn's decision to ignore the board's advice and found workers' co-operative schemes at struggling firms Triumph Engineering and Fisher-Bendix in the early 1970s. Clark decided not to resign but to stay on and try to restrain Benn in the future. Benn bore him no ill-will for this and in 1974 asked him to join the government committee into the future of ailing car-makers Austin and British Leyland. He agreed to take the chair of Leyland in 1976 as a stop-gap measure but ended up holding the post {{for more than a}} year <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> beset with strikes, nationalised and he handed the chair to Michael Edwardes. Clark remained a board member and in 1986 undertook discussions with General Motors in an attempt to get an increased bid for Leyland Vehicles, a bid later stopped by public outcry over the inclusion of the Land Rover name.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo's overall {{net sales}} {{declined}} from its peak of ¥1.8trillion (US$18.7billion) in 2009 to ¥549billion (US$4.6billion) in 2015. Net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014. In 2010, Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of ¥68 million (US$770,000), which increased to ¥187 million (US$2.11million) with performance based bonuses. In comparison, Miyamoto earned {{a salary of}} ¥100 million (US$1.13million). Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for the poor sales while {{other members of the}} Nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of 20–30percent. This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo's employees, preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short-term finances. In 2012, the company experienced its first operating loss since entering the video game market more than 30years earlier. Losses continued {{for the next two years}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> finally returned to profitability at the end of the 2015fiscal year. The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas Oy (VAT) was a {{producer}} of heavy vehicles based in Hämeenlinna, Finland. The company was founded as Yhteissisu Oy in 1943 by the Finnish government {{and a number of}} major Finnish companies with the aim of producing lorries and buses for the Finnish Defence Forces. World War II was over <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> could start series production; it was renamed Vanajan Autotehdas and the marque became Vanaja. Subsequently, the production consisted of outdated lorry models, partly built from military surplus materials. After overcoming initial difficulties, the company modernised its products, became profitable and grew until the mid 1950s. Many major components, including engines, were imported. Diesel engines became widely available in 1955, and in 1959 VAT introduced its most significant innovation, the full load lifting tandem axle mechanism, which improved off-road capability significantly; the system is now used in Sisu vehicles.|$|E
