5|$|The company {{announced}} in November 1945 that its first production would be James Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, produced {{and directed by}} Capra. In Spring 1946 {{it was announced that}} Liberty would <b>be</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> fifth partner, producer-director Victor Fleming, although that deal never saw fruition. The film was released in November 1946, but was a financial failure. Although it was in the top 7% of that year's films as ranked by box office gross, it was unable to recoup its high production cost of $2.3 million, much less show a profit. After the film's release, Briskin became an outspoken advocate for the policy of longer runs for films, allowing them to recoup the cost of production. Without longer runs, he told The Film Daily, the quality of films would decline, as production costs continued to escalate.|$|E
