50|$|Brazing {{has many}} {{advantages}} over other metal-joining techniques, such as <b>welding.</b> Since <b>brazing</b> does not melt the base metal of the joint, it allows much tighter control over tolerances and produces a clean joint {{without the need}} for secondary finishing. Additionally, dissimilar metals and non-metals (i.e. metalized ceramics) can be brazed. In general, brazing also produces less thermal distortion than welding due to the uniform heating of a brazed piece. Complex and multi-part assemblies can be <b>brazed</b> cost-effectively. <b>Welded</b> <b>joints</b> must sometimes be ground flush, a costly secondary operation that brazing does not require because it produces a clean joint. Another advantage is that the brazing can be coated or clad for protective purposes. Finally, brazing is easily adapted to mass production and it is easy to automate because the individual process parameters are less sensitive to variation.|$|R
40|$|A joining process {{designated}} <b>weld</b> <b>brazing</b> {{which combines}} resistance spot <b>welding</b> and <b>brazing</b> has been developed. Resistance spot welding {{is used to}} position and align the parts {{as well as to}} establish a suitable faying surface gap for brazing. Fabrication is then completed by capillary flow of the braze alloy into the joint. The process has been used successfully to fabricate Ti- 6 Al- 4 V titanium alloy joints using 3003 aluminum braze alloy. Test results obtained on single overlap and hat-stiffened structural specimens show that <b>weld</b> <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> are superior in tensile shear, stress rupture, fatigue, and buckling than joint fabricated by spotwelding or brazing. Another attractive feature of the process is that the brazed joints is hermetically sealed by the braze material...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this program}} {{was to develop a}} 50 MW, {{multiple}} beam klystron at 11. 424 GHz. The device uses eight electron guns and beam lines to achieve the required power level at a beam voltage of 190 kV, consistent with solid state power supplies. The electron gun operates with confined flow focusing, which is unique among current multiple beam sources, and allows operation at power levels consistent with producing 10 s of MWs of pulsed RF power. The circuit consists of a ring resonator input cavity, eight sets of buncher cavities, and a ring resonator output cavity. The RF output power is coupled into four rectangular waveguides equally spaced around the klystron. Eight individual collectors absorb the spent beam power in each beam. The klystron operates in a solenoid. The principle challenges in the design included development of the beam optics using confined flow focusing, shaping of the magnetic field in the gun region to avoid beam spiraling, coupling input power equally to all eight beam lines from a single input, and obtaining the required frequency and Q in the output cavity. The mechanical design was particularly complex due to the large parts count, number of <b>braze</b> and <b>weld</b> <b>joints,</b> and close proximity of the beam lines that limited access.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program was to develop the technology necessary for operating Stirling power converters in a space environment and to demonstrate this technology in full-scale engine tests. Hardware development focused on the Component Test Power Converter (CTPC), a single cylinder, 12. 5 -kWe engine. Design parameters for the CTPC were 150 bar operating pressure, 70 Hz frequency, and hot-and cold-end temperatures of 1050 K and 525 K, respectively. The CTPC was also designed for integration with an annular sodium heat pipe at the hot end, which incorporated a unique "Starfish" heater head that eliminated highly stressed <b>brazed</b> or <b>weld</b> <b>joints</b> exposed to liquid metal and used a shaped-tubed electrochemical milling process to achieve precise positional tolerances. Selection of materials that could withstand high operating temperatures with long life were another focus. Significant progress {{was made in the}} heater head (Udimet 700 and Inconel 718 and a sodium-filled heat pipe); the alternator (polyimide-coated wire with polyimide adhesive between turns and a polyimide-impregnated fiberglass overwrap and samarium cobalt magnets); and the hydrostatic gas bearings (carbon graphite and aluminum oxide for wear couple surfaces). Tests on the CTPC were performed in three phases: cold end testing (525 K), engine testing with slot radiant heaters, and integrated heat pipe engine system testing. Each test phase was successful, with the integrated engine system demonstrating a power level of 12. 5 kWe and an overall efficiency of 22 percent in its maiden test. A 1500 -hour endurance test was then successfully completed.

The microstructures of all joint types and tensile properties of fusion <b>welds</b> and <b>braze</b> <b>joints</b> were characterized. Sound fusion welds {{were created by}} the Gas-Tungsten Arc Weld (GTAW) process with alloy 617 filler wire. Cross-weld tensile strengths were equal to the parent metal at temperatures of 25, 800, and 1000 °C; ductilities of the joints were only slightly {{lower than that of}} the parent metal. Failure occurred in the weld fusion zone at room temperature and in the parent metal at elevated temperatures. Incomplete wetting occurred in joints produced by vacuum brazing using AWS BNi- 1 braze alloy, believed to be due to tenacious Al and Ti oxide formation. Incompletely bonded butt joints showed relatively poor tensile properties. A second set of braze joints has been created with faying surfaces electroplated with pure Ni prior to brazing; characterization of these joints is in progress.

50|$|<b>Braze</b> <b>welding</b> {{has many}} {{advantages}} over fusion welding. It allows the joining of dissimilar metals, minimization of heat distortion, and {{can reduce the}} need for extensive pre-heating. Additionally, since the metals joined are not melted in the process, the components retain their original shape; edges and contours are not eroded or changed by the formation of a fillet. Another effect of <b>braze</b> <b>welding</b> is the elimination of stored-up stresses that are often present in fusion welding. This is extremely important in the repair of large castings.
