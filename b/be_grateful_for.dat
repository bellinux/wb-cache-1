5|$|The {{text of the}} cantata {{is taken}} from a 1704 {{collection}} of librettos from Meiningen, many {{of which had been}} set to music in the cantatas of Bach's distant cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, Capellmeister at Meiningen. The librettos have been attributed to his employer Duke Ernst Ludwig von Sachsen-Meiningen. The symmetrical structure of seven movements is typical for this collection: the opening quotation from the Old Testament, followed by a recitative and an aria; then the central quotation from the New Testament, followed by an aria and a recitative, leading into the final chorale. The theme of BWV 39 is an invocation to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> God's gifts and to share them with the needy.|$|E

He persuaded a group of twenty-five writers, headed by Washington Irving, to sign a petition {{for him to take}} to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he should <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.|$|E

25|$|The {{main problem}} with the food rations {{is that they do}} not {{necessarily}} provide the elements necessary for a basic diet. Furthermore it is insensitive to cultural differences and household needs, leading to refugees considering food assistance as degrading – where they are expected to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> inappropriate provisions. Moreover, when, as is frequent, WFP is unable to provide all of these staples, the calories are distributed through whatever commodity is available. There have been times when all of the 1900 calories (i.e. before it was increased to 2,100) were supplied in maize flour. In 1997, refugees had not received any beans or lentils for eight weeks, their only potential source of protein.|$|E
25|$|The {{circumstances}} {{behind the}} war were complicated {{as was the}} final settlement. In going to war in 1919 against British India, Amir Amanullah's war aims were complicated. Even up against a depleted British Indian Army, a tactical victory was unlikely; however, the war served the dual purpose of deflecting domestic criticism and also offering the opportunity for strategic political gains. As {{a result of the}} peace treaty that was negotiated, the British ceased payment of the Afghan subsidy, and thus ended their claim to direct Afghan foreign policy, which had been the pro quid quo of the Emir accepting the subsidy. The British had traditionally wanted Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and the Russian Empire. In 1919, the Russian Civil War was raging and any threat from Russia to India at the time was potential rather than real. Moreover, the British were by far the largest supporters of the White movement in the Russian Civil War with the British contributing more arms to the Whites than all of the other nations supporting the Whites did combined. It was assumed in London that if the Whites won the Civil War, a new era in Anglo-Russian relations might possibly open as the victorious Whites might <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> British support, rendering the need for a buffer state in Central Asia irrelevant. The British also stopped arms sales from India to Afghanistan. But, as British influence declined, the Afghans were able to gain control of their own foreign affairs and in the aftermath emerged as a fully independent state. The British also made some political gains, most notably the reaffirmation of the Durand Line – which had long been a contentious issue between the two nations – as the political boundary separating Afghanistan from the North-West Frontier, and the undertaking that the Afghans made to stop interference on the British side of the line.|$|E

Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he liked that he could shape the film into. He took the job, giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{had been}} hailed in Dublin seven years earlier, after the Battle of the Nile, as {{defender of the}} Harp and Crown, the {{respective}} symbols of Ireland and Britain. When news of Trafalgar reached the city on 8 November, there were similar scenes of patriotic celebration, together with a desire that the fallen hero should be commemorated. [...] The mercantile classes had particular reason to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> a victory that restored {{the freedom of the}} high seas and removed the threat of a French invasion. Many of the city's population had relatives who had been involved in the battle: up to one-third of the sailors in Nelson's fleet were from Ireland, including around 400 from Dublin itself. In his short account of the Pillar, Dennis Kennedy considers that Nelson would have been regarded in the city as a hero, not just among the Protestant Ascendancy [...] but by many Catholics among the rising middle and professional classes.|$|E
500|$|Katrina Kaif {{was born}} in Hong Kong with her mother's surname Turquotte (also spelt Turcotte), on 16 July 1983. According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British {{businessman}} of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> all the other things I have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when I thank the Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|Worried of Clarkson being {{continually}} typecast as {{a talent}} show winner, Davis met with various producers, primarily Max Martin, and {{encouraged them to}} produce records for Clarkson in a pop rock direction. Clarkson revealed that she expected that she'll always be labeled as an American Idol winner; she remarked, [...] "I'm the first one, so it's {{going to be on}} my grave, I'm aware of that. (There's no getting away from it) so why even try?" [...] Upon their meeting, Martin presented songs he wrote with Dr. Luke. These songs include [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and a demo version of what would have been [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes". Davis wanted Clarkson to record the songs, describing them having [...] "a sharp rock edge but were still capable of being pop hits. They would push Kelly in a promising direction for her, while maintaining and even growing her audience." [...] Martin insisted that the songs should be given to rock acts, wanting to stray from his reputation for producing pop singles for the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears in the 1990s. Davis recalled, [...] "Max was looking to move on from what he had done with Backstreet Boys, and I really spent time convincing them that an American Idol winner could bring all the feeling and passion that was required to the song." [...] Martin and Dr. Luke eventually agreed and invited Clarkson to travel to Sweden to record the songs. Upon hearing the tracks, Clarkson was skeptical of the pop elements; and the three eventually decided to develop a rock sound, a move Clarkson claimed Davis did not approve. Davis reiterated that he was ecstatic with the prospect, claiming that she disliked it and demanded that both the songs be removed from the album. Clarkson then asserted that she wanted it to be on the record and claimed that Davis had detested [...] "Because of You" [...] instead, saying that she [...] "was a shitty writer (sic) who should <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the gifts that he bestows upon her". Davis reiterated that he loved the song and felt that Clarkson could indeed write hits.|$|E
