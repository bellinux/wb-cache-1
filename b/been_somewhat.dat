5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, especially when he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E

5|$|Inappropriate {{handling}} {{in rough}} weather {{was the most}} obvious cause for Kronans sinking. Unlike Vasa, Kronans sailing characteristics were not inherently flawed and the ship had served for several years in rough seas. During {{the work of the}} commission, artillery officer Anders Gyllenspak even made direct comparisons to Vasa. He testified that Kronans ballast had been lightened at Dalarö {{at the beginning of the}} campaign and that she had not replenished her supply of drink, so that the ship had a shallower draft and would have <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> less stable than with full stores, though he did not blame this on Creutz.|$|E
5|$|Obama is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. Former presidential campaign surrogate and Georgetown professor, Michael Eric Dyson, is both critical and sympathetic of President Obama's leadership in race relations, indicating that Obama's speeches and action on racial disparity and justice have <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> reactive and reluctant when, especially in the later part of his second term, racial violence demanded immediate presidential action and conversation.|$|E

5|$|Later on September9, Sarah turned sharply northward as the {{lee side}} low rapidly tracked northeast. Reintensification {{gradually}} took {{place as the}} storm {{moved away from the}} Philippines, with the storm reaching typhoon status by September10. Tracking generally towards the north-northwest, Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period of explosive intensification on September11. Over a six-hour span, the storm's winds increased from 140km/h (85mph) to 215km/h (135mph). A powerful typhoon, Sarah featured a well-defined eye and multiple outflow channels. The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category4equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). The JMA assessed Sarah to have <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> weaker, estimating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) along with a barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E
5|$|Early in {{his tenure}} Norreis {{appears to have}} <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> circumspect and did not greatly annoy his monks. The change appears to have {{happened}} around 1195, when the monks are first recorded as appealing to higher authority. Because Evesham had traditionally claimed to be exempt from episcopal oversight by the see of Worcester, {{in which it was}} located, the monks could only appeal to the papacy or to a papal legate. Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury after Baldwin, held a legateship for England until July 1195 and so the monks appealed to him. Walter forced Norreis to make some compromises with his subordinates, but the truce did not last long, and the monks once again complained of their treatment. They were visited by the new Bishop of Worcester John of Coutances some time between 1196 and 1198, but Norreis succeeded in avoiding any severe sanctions by offering gifts to the bishop. The monks again appealed to Walter in about 1200, but between the archbishop's preoccupation with political affairs and Norreis's promises to reform, no solid changes occurred.|$|E
5|$|In several Western {{countries}} it {{has been}} seen that absences due to sickness for women are far greater than men. When investigating the reasons behind this, a study done in Sweden published in 1996 found {{that half of the}} difference between genders can be dismissed if you take out the days missed by pregnant women. When taking into account the health effects of double burden, child birth is always a possibility for mothers who already are faced with taking care of children and having a career and effects them and their health. In many studies people have tried to relate the difference in sickness absences directly to the double burden effect. It has <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> successful as women who are faced with work and child care have been known to request more sick days than men in the same situation. Additionally, working wives with children have twice the absence rate as men who are placed in the same position in work family conflicts.|$|E

5|$|The term in Athens {{seems to}} have always <b>been</b> <b>somewhat</b> loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian {{politician}} and litigant from the 4th century BCE, {{in one of his}} speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, a brother who shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, {{seems to have}} disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter, rests on the claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether the legal authorities recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with a brother who died after their father was considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.|$|E
