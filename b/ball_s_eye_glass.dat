50|$|Cat <b>eye</b> <b>glasses</b> are a {{shape of}} women's and {{sometimes}} men's eyewear. They have an upsweep at the outer edges where the temples (commonly {{referred to as the}} arms) join the frame front. They were mainly popular in the 1950s and 1960s among fashionable women and are usually associated with the Beehive hairstyle. They preceded the large bug-eye glasses of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Notable wearers of cat <b>eye</b> <b>glasses</b> include: Audrey Hepburn, Barry Humphries as Dame Edna Everage, Jane Jacobs, Amy Lame, Lisa Loeb, Dinah Manoff, Elizabeth Taylor, Marilyn Monroe, Mary Whitehouse, and Barbara Windsor.|$|R

Features like hair, <b>eye</b> <b>glasses,</b> and jeweleries could be changed from time to time. Ear and neck features are not reliably identifiable for different head poses. These features could be misleading to the current state-of-the-art 3 D face recognition algorithms and therefore should be removed before feature extraction.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Fluoroscopic {{guidance}} is {{a routine}} practice in endourology; both the physician and the assistances {{are exposed to}} some radiation via radiation scatter. Measurement of radiation doses in staff is important, but often these data are not reported. Materials and Methods: We measured radiation exposure during 100 cases of percutaneous nephrolithotomy using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosimeters placed at the head, <b>eye</b> <b>glasses,</b> the fingers, and {{the legs of the}} operating surgeon, the assistant, and the circulating nurse. Results: The mean screening time was 4. 5 minutes (range, 1 to 8 minutes) with mean fluoroscopy tube potential of 73 kVp, and mean tube current of 2. 8 mA. The estimated scatter exposure rate at 40 cm from the x-ray beam was 0. 47, 0. 04, 0. 21, and 4. 1 μGy to the head, <b>eye</b> <b>glasses,</b> the fingers, and thelegs of the operating surgeon, respectively. The estimated scatter exposure rate at different points from the x-ray beam was 0. 05, 0. 01, 0. 025, and 0. 1 μGy to the head, <b>eye</b> <b>glasses,</b> the fingers, and the legs of the assistant, respectively and the estimated scatter exposure rate at all different points from the x-raybeam for circulating nurse was 0 μGy. Conclusion: Fluoroscopic screening results in radiation exposure of the medical staff. The surgeon received the maximum radiation exposure, mostly to the legs and very least to the eyes. The assistant received less radiation exposure than the surgeon and the nurse did not receive significant amountof radiation...|$|R
40|$|Although Tennessee Williams {{does not}} openly {{champion}} {{the rights of}} women in his plays, he presents strong cases against their social alienation in a harsh and brutal world governed by men. Williams 2 ̆ 7 emotional leanings, sensitivity, and intuition enable him to see life through women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>eyes.</b> In The <b>Glass</b> Menagerie, A Streetcar Named Desire, and Summer and Smoke, Williams astutely sounds the battle cry for women to fight against male oppression. He shows how Amanda Wingfield, Laura Wingfield, Blanche Dubois, Stella Kowalski, and Alma Winemiller are held hostage to the rules governing patriarchal society and become unhappy marginalized victims. The self-contained and self-sufficient prewar South is the epitome of patriarchal society, and the setting for many of Williams 2 ̆ 7 plays. In patriarchal society, gender relations are based on male domination where men control money, power, and even women. In this environment women learn to be dependent on men both economically and psychologically, and to play passive, unessential, and subordinate roles to their male counterparts. Women have to look beautiful, behave graciously, and be flirtatious in order to survive. Williams understood the plight of marginalized women through his close relationships with many females, including his sister, mother, grandmother, agent, actresses, and friends. His leanings toward effeminacy enable him to empathize with the female psyche and to object to society 2 ̆ 7 s demands that require women to appear younger, better looking, more innocent and less savvy than men in order to succeed. Williams capsulizes the plight of victimized women through Blanche 2 ̆ 7 s famous line, 2 ̆ 2 Men don 2 ̆ 7 t even admit you exist unless they 2 ̆ 7 re making love to you. 2 ̆ 2 Williams 2 ̆ 7 plays are relevant to the predicament of women in western society today, and will endure in their portrayal of women as victims until we put an end to patriarchy...|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the ability of}} dental students to correctly match tooth shades and examined the influence of clinical practice years, gender, eye color, {{and the use of}} <b>eye</b> <b>glasses</b> or contact lenses on the ability to match tooth shades. Materials and methods: In total, 244 dental students (138 females and 106 males, {{with a mean age of}} 22 years) in their 1 st to 5 th years of education were included in the study. Students were asked to match the color of artificial teeth (Vitapan acrylic denture teeth) using the Vita Toothguide 3 D-Master. Three predefined test colors were used: 2 L 1. 5, 1 M 2, and 2 R 1. 5. Exact matching rates of all three color components (value, hue, and chroma) were calculated and analyzed by a Chi-squared test. Results: Students in the 3 rd, 4 th, and 5 th clinical years performed better with regard to exactly matching the three shades, compared to students in the 1 st and 2 nd preclinical years (29. 4 % vs. 22. 5 %, P =  0. 034). On the other hand, gender, eye color, and use of <b>eye</b> <b>glasses</b> or contact lenses had no effect on the ability to correctly match the color. Higher rates of exact matches were found for 1 M 2, compared to 2 L 1. 5 (31. 1 % vs. 20. 5 %, P =  0. 007). Conclusions: The shade-matching ability of dental students seemed to improve with more education because of the inclusion of clinical practice in the educational program.
