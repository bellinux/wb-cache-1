40|$|In {{this article}} we {{make a case for}} a {{systematic}} application of complex network science to study art market history and more general collection dynamics. We reveal social, temporal, spatial, and conceptual network dimensions, i. e. network node and link types, previously implicit in the Getty Provenance Index (GPI). As a pioneering art history database active since the 1980 s, the GPI provides online access to source material relevant for research in the history of collecting and art markets. Based on a subset of the GPI, we characterize an aggregate of more than 267, 000 sales transactions connected to roughly 22, 000 actors in four countries over 20 years at daily resolution from 1801 to 1820. Striving towards a deeper understanding on multiple levels we disambiguate social dynamics of <b>buying,</b> <b>brokering,</b> and selling, while observing a general broadening of the market, where large collections are split into smaller lots. Temporally, we find annual market cycles that are shifted by country and obviously favor international exchange. Spatially, we differentiate near-monopolies from regions driven by competing sub-centers, while uncovering asymmetries of international market flux. Conceptually, we track dynamics of artist attribution that clearly behave like product categories in a very slow supermarket. Taken together, we introduce a number of meaningful network perspectives dealing with historical art auction data, beyond the analysis of social networks within a single market region. The results presented here have inspired a Linked Open Data conversion of the GPI, which is currently in process and will allow further analysis by a broad set of researchers. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

40|$|The Regional Clean Air Incentives Market is an {{emissions}} trading programme, {{which is expected}} to help in reducing oxides of nitrogen and sulphur from stationary sources in the Los Angeles area. This paper uses econometric techniques to determine the factors that can explain the development of the price of emission permits. By controlling for various characteristics of the trades, the regression results allow one to isolate the impact of each factor and conduct a detailed analysis of the implications of this factor on price. The results show that the price of permits is affected by institutional factors such as the trading rules and regulations governing the permit programme. The permits are priced higher in the coastal zone, higher for trades recorded in 1997 as compared to 1994 or 1995 and are affected by the trader category. Brokers are involved in well over half of the trades and have acquired a substantial inventory of permits. Facilities <b>buying</b> from <b>brokers</b> pay higher prices than if they buy from another facility. The price of trades beyond 2003 is higher than for current trades, which could be indicative of expectations of high growth rates in the Los Angeles region or due to expectation of more stringent regulations in the future. ...|$|R

If MRU ≥ θ then the <b>broker</b> <b>buys</b> a new RI, estimating that it will be utilised enough to make a profit. Conversely, if MRU < θ, the broker does not purchase a new RI, estimating that it will be under-utilised. For each new purchase, the broker’s future capacity, F, is incremented (Algorithm 1, line 7) and the while loop restarts. However, if MRU < θ, then no more RIs are purchased and the while loop is exited (Algorithm 1, line 10).|$|R
50|$|The first type of {{relationship}} between a website and an advertiser was a straightforward, direct partnership. This partnership model implies that the advertiser promoting a product or service pays the website (also known as a publisher) directly for {{a certain amount of}} ad impressions. As time went on, publishers began creating thousands of websites, leading to millions of pages with unsold ad space. This gave rise to a new set of companies called Ad Networks. The ad network acted as a <b>broker,</b> <b>buying</b> unsold ad space from multiple publishers and packaged them into audiences to be sold to advertisers. This second wave of advertiser-publisher relationships rapidly gained popularity as it was convenient and useful for buyers who often found themselves paying a lower price yet receiving enhanced targeting capabilities through ad networks.|$|R
50|$|Consolidators, customs brokers, freight forwarders, and NVOCC’s can be {{a factor}} in {{determining}} freight rate because of their experience, business relationships, and the volume at which they operate. These factors help keep the freight rate down for small businesses and the individual with a shipping need. In the commercial trucking industry, many shippers tender loads to freight brokers {{whose job it is to}} find qualified carriers to move the freight at an acceptable price for all parties. Brokers have access to a suite of technological tools to help determine the most cost-effective way to move cargo, including access to load boards. The best load boards provide rate analysis tools based on actual transactions on every lane in North America, since their databases hold a wealth of pricing information. For example, DAT Solutions offers RateView for carriers, brokers and shippers, providing access to shippers’ contract rates and spot market (<b>broker</b> <b>buy)</b> rates. This allows brokers to analyze market demand and capacity to assure competitive pricing.|$|R

40|$|In Nasdaq IPOs from 1997 to 2002, {{clients of}} the lead {{underwriter}} bought shares worth $ 35. 36 billion {{on the first day}} of public trading but sold shares worth only $ 21. 45 billion, leading to a net buy imbalance of $ 13. 91 billion or 8. 79 percent of the shares issued. We investigate several explanations for this buy imbalance through the lead underwriter. First, contrary to clientele demand-based explanations, brokerage houses with large client <b>buying</b> when the <b>broker</b> is the lead underwriter experience net client selling when the broker is a comanager or another syndicate member. Second, inconsistent with the hypothesis that underwriter clients obtain superior information on certain IPOs, we find that the strong buying activity from lead underwriter clients is present in 85 percent of all IPOs. Third, we find that large block trades receive worse execution through the bookrunner than through non-syndicate market makers, so differential execution quality cannot explain the net buy imbalances. Fourth, inconsistent with initial client buying being driven by long-term shareholders, IPOs with large first-day net buying through the lead underwriter experienc...|$|R
40|$|Traders buy {{and sell}} {{financial}} instruments in hopes of making profit, and brokers {{are responsible for the}} transaction. Some brokers, known as market-makers, take the position opposite to the trader's. If the trader buys, they sell; if the trader sells, they <b>buy.</b> Said differently, <b>brokers</b> make money whenever their traders lose money. From this somewhat strange mechanism emerge various conspiracy theories, notably that brokers manipulate prices in order to maximize their traders' losses. In this paper, our goal is to perform this evil task optimally. Assuming total control over the price of an asset (ignoring the usual aspects of finance such as market conditions, external influence or stochasticity), we show how in cubic time, given a set of trades specified by a stop-loss and a take-profit price, a broker can find a maximum loss price movement. We also study the same problem under a model of probabilistic trades. We finally look at the online trade setting, where broker and trader exchange turns, each trying to make a profit. We show that the best option for the trader is to never trade...|$|R

40|$|Access to China and its {{wealth of}} {{manufactured}} goods was long {{sought by the}} European ‘monopoly Companies’, yet a direct and regular trade between Europe and the South China coast was only established {{around the turn of}} the eighteenth century. By focusing on the private trade and interloping activities of British-born China traders, this thesis shows how this branch of commerce took root and expanded within a transnational European trading arena between c. 1720 to 1750. Interlopers, or free agents, I argue, played a highly integrative role for the development of European markets for Chinese goods and the networks of supply and capital that underpinned the trade. British-born Canton traders, who were operating in the smaller interloping East India Companies established close connections between Britain and the continent and between the different ‘national’ East India Companies. Private trade records, merchant letters, and East India Company materials form the large source base of this study and are used to analyse the ways in which cross-border mobility encouraged the transfer of expertise, capital, and information between different East India ventures. Methodologically, this work draws on, and builds upon the extensive scholarship on networks and the transnational. It is not biographical, yet follows a number of key individuals and their largely overlapping networks in order to shed light on the question how Canton traders (and British-born interlopers in particular) operated in the European market place – not merely as collective importers of foreign consumer goods, but as independent merchants, whose trade in Chinese goods ranged from wholesale <b>buying</b> and selling, <b>brokering,</b> smuggling, and the fulfilment of special commissions for clients across Europe...|$|R
