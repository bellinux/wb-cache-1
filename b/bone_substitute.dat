40|$|Abstract <b>Bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> – In {{trauma and}} {{orthopedic}} surgery {{the use of}} autograft is a first choice therapy for filling bone defects. Due to drawbacks {{in the use of}} autografts (for example donor site morbidity and limited amount of bone tissue) there is an increasing interest in the use of (artificial) <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes.</b> This article provides an overview of the basic science of bone substitution. For optimal ingrowth of bone a transplant should have osteogenic, osteoinductive and osteoconductive characteristics. <b>Bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> are mostly osteoconductive and provide a scaffold for bone regeneration. Osteoconductivity is mainly determined by pore size, porosity and cristallinity. Calcium phosphates represent a group of <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> that is being used mostly, and this group of products has been extensively studied. In addition, calcium sulphates and bioactive glass are used also. New developments such as the addition of growth factors to <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> are under extensive research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spine fusion is the {{surgical}} procedure to obtain bony union between two vertebrae, {{required in the}} treatment of many pathologies. The necessity for this procedure is increasing, and complications such as non-union remain high in spite of the great progress that has been made in recent years. Many surgical techniques have improved the effectiveness of this procedure in the past, involving very sophisticated techniques. <b>Bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> may enhance <b>bone</b> healing, though many are not especially effective. Bone grafts still remain the best option, but many concerns are raised about their safety, stockage, availability and properties. Synthetic <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> were proposed as a resolution to this problem, but none of them have achieved the ideal standard. Growth factors are the ‘new’ expected ideal <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes,</b> but little is known about their function, and results are contradictory, except for BMP- 2 and BMP- 7 in spine fusion. This chapter will discuss these problems and evaluate the options and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> that are available in spine fusion...|$|R
30|$|Our {{study is}} the first to {{describe}} correction osteotomies of the distal radius for dorsal malunion, with double dorsal plating, without filling of the osteotomy defect. With the latter, surgical—and tourniquet time was reduced. The patient did not have to undergo a bone-grafting procedure. Nor were <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> or bioactive materials, which increase the costs for this procedure substantially, used. Despite this, our functional and radiological results were similar if not better than comparable series where bone grafting or <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> were used.|$|R
50|$|Bone tissue {{engineering}} presents a versatile response to treat bone injuries and deformations. Nanofibers produced via electrospinning mimics the architecture {{and characteristics of}} natural extracellular matrix particularly well. These scaffolds {{can be used to}} deliver bioactive agents that promote tissue regeneration. These bioactive materials should ideally be osteoinductive, osteoconductive, and osseointegratable. <b>Bone</b> <b>substitute</b> materials intended to replace autologous or allogeneic bone consist of bioactive ceramics, bioactive glasses, and biological and synthetic polymers. The basis of bone {{tissue engineering}} is that the materials will be resorbed and replaced over time by the body’s own newly regenerated biological tissue.|$|E
50|$|Calcium phosphate-based {{ceramics}} constitute, at present, {{the preferred}} <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> in orthopaedic and maxillofacial surgery. They {{are similar to}} the mineral phase of the bone in structure and/or chemical composition. The material is typically porous, which provide a good bone-implant interface due to the increase of surface area that encourages cell colonisation and revascularisation. Additionally, it has lower mechanical strength compared to bone, making highly porous implants very delicate. Since Young's modulus of ceramics is generally much higher than that of the bone tissue, the implant can cause mechanical stresses at the bone interface. Calcium phosphates usually found in bioceramics include hydroxyapatite (HAP) Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2; tricalcium phosphate β (β TCP): Ca3 (PO4)2; and mixtures of HAP and β TCP.|$|E
50|$|Nanophase {{ceramics}} {{have great}} potential for use in orthopedic medicine. Bone and collagen have structures on the nanoscale. Nanomaterials can be manufactured to simulate these structures which is necessary for grafts and implants to successfully adapt to and handle varying stresses. The surface properties of nanophase ceramics is also very important for bone substitution and regeneration. Nanophase ceramics have much rougher surfaces than larger materials and also have increased surface area. This promotes reactivity and absorption of proteins that assist tissue development. Nano-hydroxyapatite is one nanophase ceramic that {{is used as a}} <b>bone</b> <b>substitute.</b> Nano grain size increases the bonding, growth, and differentiation of osteoblasts onto the ceramic. The surfaces of nanophase ceramics can also be modified to be porous allowing osteoblasts to create bone within the structure. The degradation of the ceramic is also important because the rate can be changed by changing the crystallinity. This way as bone grows the substitute can diminish at a similar rate.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{it has to}} be kept in {{mind that}} equal {{alternatives}} to autologous bone grafts in sinus floor augmentation are proven. It seems that the use of <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> finally leads to implant survival rates that are comparable to those that can be achieved with implants placed in sinuses grafted with autologous bone [74]. In this respect, assessment of the defect should be carefully performed in order to provide the patient with the least invasive technique providing excellent long-term results. Our technique of using autologous bone scrapes from the anterior facial wall harvested during window preparation has proven to be equal to the use of <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes.</b> This technique combines augmentation with autologous material and the absence of comorbidity at the donor site. Surgeons therefore should consider using this technique in order to minimize the use of <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> without additional harvesting morbidity.|$|R
40|$|Literature {{regarding}} {{the outcome of}} maxillary sinus floor elevation to create sufficient bone fraction to enable implant placement was systematically reviewed. Bone fraction and implant survival rate were assessed to determine whether grafting material or applied growth factor affected bone fraction. Trials where sinus floor elevations with autogenous bone (controls) were compared with autogenous bone combined with growth factors or <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes,</b> or solely with <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> (test groups) were identified; 12 of 1124 fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses comparing the bone fraction after applying: autogenous bone; autologous bone with growth factors (platelet rich plasma); or autogenous <b>bone</b> and <b>bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> (bovine hydroxyapatite, bioactive glass, corticocancellous pig bone) revealed {{no significant differences in}} bone formation after 5 months. A significantly higher bone fraction was found in the autogenous bone group compared to the sole use of beta-tricalciumphosphate (P = 0. 036). The one-year overall implant survival rate showed no significant difference between implants. <b>Bone</b> <b>substitutes</b> combined with autogenous bone provide a reliable alternative for autogenous bone as sole grafting material to reconstruct maxillary sinus bony deficiencies, for supporting dental implants after 5 months. Adding growth factors (platelet rich plasma) to grafting material and the sole use of beta-tricalciumphosphate did not promote bone formation...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} types of spinal fusion {{technique}}s. Each technique varies depending {{on the level of}} the spine and the location of the compressed spinal cord/nerves. [...] After the spine is decompressed, bone graft or artificial <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> is packed between the vertebrae to help them heal together. [...] In general, fusions are done either on the anterior (stomach), posterior (back), or both sides of the spine. [...] Today, most fusions are supplemented with hardware (screws, plates, rods) because they have been shown to have higher union rates than non-instrumented fusions. [...] Minimally invasive techniques are also becoming more popular. [...] These techniques use advanced image guidance systems to insert rods/screws into the spine through smaller incisions, allowing for less muscle damage, blood loss, infections, pain, and length of stay in the hospital.

5000|$|Xenograft <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> has {{its origin}} from a species other than human, such as bovine bone (or {{recently}} porcine bone) {{which can be}} freeze dried or demineralized and deproteinized. Xenografts are usually only distributed as a calcified matrix. Madrepore and or millepore type of corals are harvested and treated to become 'coral derived granules' (CDG) {{and other types of}} coralline xenografts. [...] Coral based xenografts are mainly calcium carbonate (and an important proportion of fluorides, useful in the context of grafting to promote bone development) while natural human bone is made of hydroxyapatite along with calcium phosphate and carbonate: the coral material is thus either transformed industrially into hydroxyapatite through a hydrothermal process, yielding a non-resorbable xenograft, or simply the process is omitted and the coralline material remains in its calcium carbonate state for better resorption of the graft by the natural bone. The coral xenograft is then saturated with growth enhancing gels and solutions.|$|E
30|$|The tissue reaction, however, did {{not only}} differ in <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> {{materials}} of different origin {{but also in}} <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> materials of the same origin. In an in vivo trial, two xenogeneic <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> materials processed with different techniques were implanted subcutaneously in CD- 1 mice for up to 60  days. Both <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> materials showed good integration within the peri-implant tissue with no signs of adverse inflammatory effects. However, within the implantation bed of the <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> of low sintering temperature, few MNGCs were obvious {{on the surface of}} small <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> granules in the early integration period, while the tissue reaction to the larger granules at later stages consisted mainly of mononuclear cells. In contrast, the tissue reaction to the <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> material of high sintering temperature consisted mainly of biomaterial surface-associated MNGCs. Previous in vivo and clinical investigations indicated that MNGCs, which are widely known to be an expression of an ongoing foreign body reaction, are expressed especially on the surface of synthetic biomaterial granules, trying to degrade the biomaterial, but without really reducing the ratio of the biomaterial. In fact, multinucleated giant cells, which do not have the ability of degrading synthetic <b>bone</b> <b>substitute</b> materials, can be characterized more as foreign body giant cells than as osteoclastic cells [17 – 19].|$|E
