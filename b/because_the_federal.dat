5|$|In 2012, {{the federal}} {{government}} accounted for about 29% of the jobs in Washington, D.C. This is thought to immunize Washington to national economic downturns <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government continues operations even during recessions. Many organizations such as law firms, independent contractors (both defense and civilian), non-profit organizations, lobbying firms, trade unions, industry trade groups, and professional associations have their headquarters in or near D.C. {{to be close to}} {{the federal government}}.|$|E
5|$|Only twice did the Marshall Court hear {{criminal}} cases under § 25. In Cohens v. Virginia (1821), the Court upheld a state lottery law conviction <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> lottery was authorized {{only in the}} District of Columbia. In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the Court reversed Worcester's conviction for being present in Cherokee country as inconsistent with federal law.|$|E
5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information sharing, and clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
50|$|Dual {{chartering}} {{refers to}} the system by which credit unions in the United States can be chartered under either of two governmental authorities; by either <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government or by the state government. This system exists <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Credit Union Act, which Congress passed in 1934.|$|R
50|$|Regan {{was first}} elected to the House of Commons {{as part of the}} Liberal {{landslide}} victory in <b>the</b> 1993 <b>federal</b> election under Jean Chrétien. He was defeated in the 1997 election by NDP candidate Gordon Earle, mainly <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government's changes to employment insurance.|$|R

25|$|Some economists believe income {{taxation}} offers {{the federal government}} a technique to diminish {{the power of the}} states, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government is then able to distribute funding to states with conditions attached, often giving the states no choice but to submit to federal demands.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 2014, Stinney's {{conviction}} was posthumously vacated 70 {{years after}} his execution, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> court judge ruled {{that he had not}} been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense and therefore his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated.|$|E
25|$|In June 1999 the High Court {{held that}} the {{constitution}} did not allow State judicial power to be vested in the Federal Court (Re Wakim). As a result, the Adsteam proceedings, which had been brought in the Federal Court, could not proceed <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Court did not have jurisdiction to hear them.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted, and {{prohibition}} {{took effect}} throughout the United States. Canada {{became a major}} port for running alcohol products <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Canadian <b>federal</b> government approved and licensed distilleries and breweries to manufacture, distribute, and export alcohol.|$|R
2500|$|The {{party has}} adopted its own [...] "Contemporary Marxist–Leninist Thought". Its Eighth Party Congress {{was to be}} held in 2005 with the theme [...] "Laying the Foundations for the Mass Communist Party", but the {{congress}} was delayed <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> election. <b>The</b> congress was held in September 2008.|$|R

25|$|The white Democrats in the South {{agreed to}} accept Hayes's victory if he withdrew the last Federal troops. By this point, the North was weary of insurgency. White Democrats {{controlled}} {{most of the}} Southern legislatures and armed militias controlled small towns and rural areas. Blacks considered Reconstruction a failure <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> government withdrew from enforcing their ability to exercise their rights as citizens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) {{controls}} most {{employee benefits}} provided by private employers, DOMA removed some {{tax breaks for}} employers and employees {{in the private sector}} when it comes to health care, pension, and disability benefits to same-sex spouses on an equal footing with opposite-sex spouses. ERISA does not affect employees of state and local government or churches, nor does it extend to such benefits as employee leave and vacation.|$|E
25|$|A truck breaks down. Three fugitives from justice get out {{and find}} {{themselves}} in the city of Mahagonny: Fatty the Bookkeeper, Trinity Moses, and Leocadia Begbick. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> agents pursuing them will not search this far north, and they are in a good location to attract ships coming south from the Alaskan gold fields, Begbick decides that they can profit by staying where they are and founding a pleasure city, where men can have fun, because there is nothing else in the world to rely on.|$|E
5|$|Lattimer's Lessee v. Poteet (1840) was {{an appeal}} from a {{judgment}} for the defendant in an ejectment {{action in the}} United States circuit court of North Carolina. It was undisputed that the plaintiff's title arose from a North Carolina state land grant to Cherokee lands within the boundaries demarcated by <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> Cherokee treaties. <b>The</b> sole defense was that the state grant was void <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> Cherokee treaties.|$|R
50|$|The Swiss President is not - as are, for example, the Presidents in Austria or Germany - {{the head}} of state of the country: under <b>the</b> Swiss <b>Federal</b> Constitution, <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Council doubles as a {{collective}} head of state and head of government. When a tied vote occurs in the council (which sometimes happens, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> six <b>Federal</b> Councillors who are not President vote first), the President - as the chair of the council - casts the deciding vote (or may abstain).|$|R
5000|$|On January 4, 2009, Richardson {{withdrew his}} name as Commerce Secretary nominee <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> grand jury {{investigation}} into pay-to-play allegations. The New York Times had reported in late December that the grand jury investigation issue would be raised at Richardson's confirmation hearings. [...] Later, in August 2009, Justice Department officials decided not to seek indictments.|$|R
25|$|The Supreme Court of Canada {{ruled that}} the Government has the {{authority}} to amend the definition of marriage, but did not rule on whether or not such a change is required by the equality provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court stated that such a ruling is not necessary <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Government had accepted the rulings of provincial courts to the effect that the change was required. The Court also ruled that given freedom of religion in the Charter of Rights, and wording of provincial human rights codes, it was highly unlikely that religious institutions could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages, though because solemnization of marriage is a matter for provincial governments, the proposed bill could not actually guarantee such protections.|$|E
25|$|A United Nations Special Rapporteur {{undertook}} {{a mission to}} Mexico in 2002 to investigate reports by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the country's judiciary and administration of law was not independent. During {{the course of his}} visit to a number of cities, the rapporteur observed that corruption in the judiciary had not been reduced significantly. One of the principal issues is that, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> courts operate at a relatively high level, most citizens are compelled to seek justice in the inadequate state courts. Additionally, the rapporteur expressed concerns about such issues as disorganization in the legal profession, difficulties and harassment faced by lawyers, poor trial procedures, poor access to the justice system for indigenous peoples and minors, and lacklustre investigation of many crimes.|$|E
25|$|On August 17, 2006, Anderson again {{refused to}} testify before the grand jury {{investigating}} Bonds. Judge Alsup ordered Anderson to return to court August 28 for a contempt hearing. In requesting the hearing, prosecutors for the first time publicly acknowledged they were targeting Bonds. Anderson was held in contempt of court at the August 28 hearing and sent to federal prison for a second time. Judge Alsup said Anderson had provided no legal justification for refusing to tell the grand jury on August 17 whether he had supplied steroids to Bonds or other athletes, or even whether he knew Bonds. Geragos said he would file an appeal with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Anderson was released from prison on October 5, after serving 37 days. Judge Alsup ordered his release <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> appeals court hadn't affirmed the contempt order within the required 30 days after Anderson was jailed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal had sent the contempt order back to Judge Alsup, thus delaying any ruling.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, the {{relatively}} high minimum wage in Puerto Rico has been blamed by various politicians and commentators as a highly significant factor in the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis. One study concluded that [...] "Employers are disinclined to hire workers <b>because</b> <b>the</b> US <b>federal</b> minimum wage is very high relative to the local average".|$|R
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> 2013 <b>federal</b> {{election}} was <b>the</b> first fought by the party, the AfD {{had not received}} any <b>federal</b> funds in <b>the</b> run-up to it, but after receiving 2 million votes it crossed the threshold for party funding and was expected to receive an estimated 1.3 to 1.5 million Euro per year of state subsidies.|$|R

500|$|Another {{argument}} raised is that <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{income tax}} is progressive, the discriminations and inequalities {{created by the}} tax should render the tax unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. Such arguments have been ruled without merit under contemporary jurisprudence. [...] Notably, some tax protesters contend that the Fourteenth Amendment itself was never properly ratified, under {{the theory that the}} governments of southern states that supported the post-Civil War constitutional amendments were not representative of the people.|$|E
500|$|One {{argument}} {{that has been}} raised is that <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> income tax is progressive (i.e., because the marginal tax rates increase, or progress, {{as the level of}} taxable income increases), the discriminations and inequalities created by the tax should render the tax unconstitutional. This argument was rejected by the United States Supreme Court in two companion cases [...] with respect to the income tax on individuals in Thorne v. Anderson, and with respect to the income tax on corporations in Tyee Realty Co. v. Anderson.|$|E
500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{government}} {{had been unable}} to raise any significant number of troops and Bowdoin could no longer trust local militias in the western counties, he proposed in early January 1787 the creation of a private militia to be funded by eastern merchants. [...] Revolutionary War General Benjamin Lincoln raised funds and men for the effort, and had 3,000 men in Worcester by January 19. [...] A standoff at the Springfield Armory on January 25 resulted in the death of several rebels, and Lincoln broke the main rebel force on February 4 in Petersham, ending large-scale resistance.|$|E
50|$|Puerto Rico is {{the only}} current U.S. {{possession}} whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish. <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>federal</b> government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts, and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.|$|R
5000|$|The team changed QBs almost weekly, with {{different}} QBs finishing {{a number of}} games. In part, it was <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federals</b> were bitten repeatedly by the injury bug. Jauch's biggest mistake was probably giving the opening day starter, NFL veteran Kim McQuilken, the quick hook for rookie QB Mike Hohensee. From there the team never seemed to settle with a QB {{for more than a}} few games in a row and when McQuilken did play, he often pressed, forcing his throws into coverage. The team alternated between McQuilken and Hohensee, with occasional appearances by former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback [...] "Jefferson Street" [...] Joe Gilliam. He was way past his prime and only threw for 673 yards. The only other quarterback on the team was rookie Mike Forslund, who never got into a game.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, Stewart {{reasoned}} that dismissal of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> suit was unnecessary <b>because</b> <b>the</b> rights <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government sought to uphold {{were different from}} those being litigated in the state courts. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> suit was about rights <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government had previously reserved, rather than rights based on the prior appropriation doctrine. Finally, Stewart gave two more reasons not to dismiss <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> suit: issues of federal law were involved, as were the rights of Native American tribes (who were typically free of state jurisdiction).|$|R
500|$|On December 17, Shumlin {{announced}} that he was dropping his plan to implement single-payer healthcare. The reforms, which required business and personal tax increases, had never advanced beyond the framework stage. Shumlin, who had missed two earlier financing deadlines, said that [...] "this is not the right time" [...] <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government had offered less funding than expected and [...] "the potential economic disruption and risks would be too great to small businesses, working families and the state's economy." [...] The media also cited controversy surrounding comments made by economist Jonathan Gruber, who was involved in crafting and advocating for the plan, and Shumlin's failure to win a majority in the election as reasons for the cancellation. The decision, which Shumlin called the [...] "biggest disappointment" [...] of his career, drew a mixed response. Business groups lauded his [...] "pragmatic" [...] move but supporters of health care reform organized protests and said that it would end his political career.|$|E
500|$|Other Credit Suisse First Boston brands {{were later}} created in Switzerland, Asia, London, New York and Tokyo. According {{to an article}} in The New York Times, First Boston became [...] "the superstar of the Euromarkets" [...] by buying stakes in American {{companies}} that wanted to issue bonds. In 1988 First Boston loaned $487 million to Gibbons and Green {{for the purchase of}} the Ohio Mattress Company, which was purchased at twenty times its annual revenue. Gibbons had also borrowed $475 million in junk bonds. When the junk bonds market crashed the following year, Gibbons couldn't repay First Boston. Credit Suisse injected $725 million to keep First Boston in business, which ultimately led to the company being taken over by Credit Suisse. This became known as the [...] "burning bed" [...] deal, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve overlooked the Glass–Steagall Act that requires separation between commercial and investment banks in order to preserve the stability of the financial markets.|$|E
500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> budget {{legislation}} {{was not expected}} to be enacted by the September 30, 2011 deadline, work began on a continuing resolution to fund the government temporarily through November 18, 2011 with an across-the-board reduction of 1.503% below the 2011 budget levels. [...] However, a dispute arose between the Republican-led House and the Democrat-led Senate over the amount of additional funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for costs associated with relief from Hurricane Irene, and whether this extra funding should be partially offset with cuts elsewhere. [...] FEMA's disaster relief fund had $792 million remaining in it just prior to the hurricane's landfall in August 2011, which was below the $1 billion threshold that caused FEMA to act under [...] "immediate-needs status," [...] delaying long-term projects in favor of urgent tasks. [...] The proposed cuts targeted a program to fund development of fuel-efficient automobiles as well as the program that had guaranteed a loan to the recently bankrupt Solyndra corporation. [...] The Senate rejection of the House bill on September 23, 2011 raised the possibility of a government shutdown on October 1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, {{signed into}} law by President Bill Clinton on October 9, 1996, after the death of Jessica Dubroff, it is no longer legal in the United States (under 49 USC § 44724) to attempt to set records as a student pilot, which {{effectively}} means that some of the records set by Van Meter will never be broken.|$|R
