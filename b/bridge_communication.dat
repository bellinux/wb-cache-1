50|$|The HJ-Story {{name was}} coined with the {{combination}} of the initials from the name of the illustrator’s wife. It all began in 2011 as a series of rough sketches, sent through SMS by Andrew Hou to his then girlfriend (now wife), Kate, as an attempt to <b>bridge</b> <b>communication</b> barrier between them as he was not fluent in Korean then. At that time, Andrew admitted that he does not express well with words on his love towards her but began to draw instead.|$|E

50|$|The use of CHWs is {{not limited}} to {{developing}} countries. In New York, CHWs have been deployed across the state to provide care to patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes that require sustained, comprehensive care. They work in both rural communities where access to primary care is sparse, and in urban communities where they are better able to <b>bridge</b> <b>communication</b> gaps that may arise between patients and doctors. They are seen {{to play an important role}} in assisting patients with navigating a complex, uncoordinated health care system.|$|E

50|$|In {{cases where}} the causes are environmental, the {{treatment}} is to eliminate or reduce these causes first of all, and then to fit patients with a hearing aid, {{especially if they are}} elderly. When the loss is due to heredity, total deafness is often the end result. On the one hand, persons who experience gradual deterioration of their hearing are fortunate in that they have learned to speak. Ultimately the affected person may <b>bridge</b> <b>communication</b> problems by becoming skilled in sign language, speech-reading, using a hearing aid, or accepting elective surgery to use a prosthetic devices such as a cochlear implant.|$|E

The study is largely based on archival materials and oral interviews of some former African employees. Notably, British colonial authorities adopted pidgin as a language of government in Northern Nigeria, as they lacked a wider medium for inter-ethnic communication. African political agents were employed as intermediaries, based on their knowledge of pidgin and other local languages, enabling them <b>bridge</b> <b>communication</b> between government and chiefs.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the systems}} on chip (SoC) design, the {{synthesis}} of communication architecture constitutes the bottleneck which can affect the performances of the system.

To reduce {{the complexity of the}} communications refinement, we present in this study a model and a synthesis approach for multibus communication architecture containing centralized bridge. The automation of the arbiter synthesis step profited from a detailed attention. This stage generates a hierarchical arbiter integrating various priority arbitration modules. The proposed approach was integrated in a toolbox based environment. Key words: SoC, adaptation <b>bridge,</b> <b>communication</b> synthesis, arbiter synthesi...|$|E

Perhaps, along with deaf people's experience with <b>bridging</b> <b>communication</b> barriers, the use of classifiers is a key reason.|$|R
40|$|The Green Highways Initiative (GHI) is a voluntary, public/private {{initiative}} {{seeking to}} embed both environmental streamlining and stewardship throughout the planning, design, construction, and maintenance phases of linear highway projects.

40|$|Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) have {{attracted}} significant {{attention in the}} RF and communication communities. Despite the rapid progress, the problem of waveform design to enhance the output DC power of wireless energy harvester has received limited attention so far. In this paper, we <b>bridge</b> <b>communication</b> and RF design and derive novel multisine waveforms for multi-antenna wireless power transfer. The waveforms are adaptive to the channel state information and result from a posynomial maximization problem that originates from the non-linearity of the energy harvester. They are shown through realistic simulations to provide significant gains (in terms of harvested DC power) over state-of-the-art waveforms under a fixed transmit power constraint.

40|$|Recruiting {{elderly people}} for studies is a {{challenge}} for researchers. This paper discusses experiences and insights into recruitment of elderly Chinese participants for a restraint reduction clinical trial. Areas addressed include obtaining informed consent; factors affecting data collection; involvement of ward staff and relatives; and clinical research personal attributes. Insights suggest research personnel must appreciate and attend to cultural differences. Giving written consent is a serious matter for Chinese elderly; thorough and repeated explanation, plus family involvement is crucial to subject recruitment and retention. Researchers must recognize values, beliefs and perceptions, and external and internal factors that might distract elderly subjects during recruitment and data collection. Older Chinese patients are often accommodating and tend not to voice concerns despite doubts or when not well enough to continue an interview or assessment. Ward staff involvement is also recommended at each stage to <b>bridge</b> <b>communication</b> between patients, their relatives and the research team.

40|$|Can {{citizens}} in an authoritarian country like China influence policy implementation? Two types of scholarship indicate {{ways that they}} can: The first proposes that policy implementation is carried out through a fragmented authoritarian system that requires consultation and cooperation among various government units, and this system is amenable to pressure from outside groups. The second examines institutional channels designed to handle grievances and <b>bridge</b> <b>communication</b> between citizens and the authorities. In this paper, I emphasize a link between these two bodies of scholarship, showing how protest channels {{are connected to the}} fragmented authoritarian system and how the imperative to maintain social stability leads higher-level authorities to resolve depart-mental conflicts in favour of protesters. I do this by examining a struggle against the privatization of a hospital in North China, a case that illustrates how protesters successfully employed both the petition system and the opportunities offered by the fragmented authoritarian system to develop powerful alliances, to peacefully pressure top local authorities to intervene and to overcome opposition in the local government, leading to finalizing the municipalization of the hospital...|$|E
