5|$|Following {{constitutional}} {{reforms in}} 1991, {{the office of}} President was transformed from an appointed to an elected post. Thus, <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> MPs are elected to their posts by the citizens of Singapore in separate elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he was pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E

Hastings and French donated their services.|$|E
25|$|Resentment also rose {{within the}} Greek Cypriot {{community}} because Turkish Cypriots {{had been given}} a larger share of governmental posts than the size of their population warranted. In accordance with the constitution 30% of civil service jobs were allocated to the Turkish community despite being only 18.3% of the population. Additionally, the position of vice president was reserved for the Turkish population, and <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> vice president were given veto power over crucial issues.|$|E

25|$|The new {{military}} regime {{went to great}} lengths to destroy <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> <b>and</b> Eva Perón's reputation, putting up public exhibits of what they maintained was the Peróns' scandalously sumptuous taste for antiques, jewelry, roadsters, yachts and other luxuries. They also accused other Peronist leaders of corruption; but, ultimately, though many were prosecuted, none were convicted. The junta's first leader, Eduardo Lonardi, appointed a Civilian Advisory Board. However, its preference for a gradual approach to de-Perónization helped lead to Lonardi's ousting, though most of the board's recommendations stood <b>the</b> new <b>president's</b> scrutiny.|$|R

25|$|The President of the Czech Republic is {{the elected}} {{head of state}} of the Czech Republic and the {{commander-in-chief}} of the Military of the Czech Republic. Unlike counterparts in other Central European countries such as Austria and Hungary, who are generally considered figureheads, the Czech president has a considerable role in political affairs. Because many powers can only be exercised with the signatures of <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, responsibility over some political issues is effectively shared between the two offices.|$|E

While candidates usually run in tandem for the offices of President and Vice President, under their own political parties, it is possible and not unusual for candidates from different parties to be elected as President and Vice President.|$|E

25|$|The {{biggest concern}} for the yes {{campaign}} was whether turnout would reach the 50% required for the referendum to be valid. After {{the first day of}} voting turnout was only 30% and <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> Prime Minister appeared on TV to urge Lithuanians to vote. There was a surge in voting on the Sunday with many people voting after church services. Lithuanian supermarkets also had a campaign {{on the second day of}} voting, offering cheaper beer, chocolate and soap to those who showed they had voted. In the end there were queues outside some voting booths and turnout was over 60%, safely over the required level.|$|E

500|$|Eisenhower's {{official}} {{nomination for}} Radford came in mid-1953. Eisenhower was initially cautious about {{him because of}} his involvement in the inter-service rivalry and [...] "revolt" [...] in 1949. Radford's anticommunist views, however, as well as his knowledge of Asia and his support of Eisenhower's [...] "New Look" [...] defense policy, made him an attractive nominee, particularly among Republicans, to replace Omar Bradley. Eisenhower was also impressed with his [...] "intelligence, dedication, tenacity, and courage to speak his mind." [...] During his nomination, Radford indicated a changed outlook from the positions he had taken during the [...] "Revolt of the Admirals". As chairman, he was eventually popular with <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>and</b> Congress.|$|E

[...] In fact, President Eisenhower himself in January 1954 said that nobody understood the Bricker Amendment, but his position [...] "was clear; he opposed any amendment that would reduce the President's power to conduct foreign policy." [...] In {{his opposition to the}} Amendment, Eisenhower obtained the help of Senate Minority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, who persuaded Senator Walter F.

The George Substitute introduced on January 27, 1954, especially infuriated Bricker since George also wanted limits on treaties.|$|E

It has been called Angelou's [...] "autobiographical poem", and has received mixed reviews. The popular press praised Clinton's choice of Angelou as inaugural poet, and her [...] "representiveness" [...] of the American people and its President. Critic Mary Jane Lupton said that [...] "Angelou's ultimate greatness will be attributed" [...] to the poem, and that Angelou's [...] "theatrical" [...] performance of it, using skills she learned as an actor and speaker, marked {{a return to the}} African-American oral tradition of speakers such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Poetry critics, despite praising Angelou's recitation and performance, gave mostly negative reviews of the poem.|$|E

500|$|In 1983 Reagan's Secretary of the Interior James G.

[...] Watt's social conservativism made him the target of public outcry and denouncements from <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>and</b> the First Lady who declared themselves Beach Boys fans. Days after Watt's announcement, Reagan presented the Secretary with a plaster boot {{with a hole in}} it to indicate that Watt had [...] "shot himself in the foot."

This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, United States Department of State, published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days.
