5|$|Although Blake {{was himself}} {{a member of}} the Spanish Regency, he was junior to Castaños in the {{military}} hierarchy (but senior to Ballasteros). He consequently did not protest when General Castaños agreed that Marshal Beresford, who was also junior to Castaños in rank, should command the combined Allied armies in any battle <b>because</b> <b>there</b> were more men in the Anglo-Portuguese force.|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E

5|$|As {{we already}} saw above, the nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{are composed of}} rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector n called the director, is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules {{in the neighborhood of}} any point. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> is no physical polarity along the director axis, n and -n are fully equivalent.|$|E
5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> are no curtains on the stage, the performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the stage. The house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> are 26 letters (2×13) in {{the basic}} Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same {{algorithm}} is applied, so the same action {{can be used for}} encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> are {{no other}} large cities in the Republic of Macedonia, and because of {{political}} and economical centralisation, {{a large number of}} Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city.

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> is a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way}} from Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The only exception to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> were no {{deaths and}} only 65 {{people had been}} {{directly}} affected by Cyclone Daman, the Fijian government, {{with the help of}} the Red Cross, decided not to request any International Aid or any external assistance. The Fijian Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia. By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone Daman had been completed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>there</b> {{would be}} only one chance {{to carry out the}} test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a {{rehearsal}} should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated.

5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better.

5|$|During {{construction}} in 1998, Lyn {{and the national}} team played their games at Bislett Stadion—the home venue for Vålerenga—while Ullevaal was being rebuilt. Prior to the 1999 season, where Lyn would have {{to play in the}} First Division, Lyn applied to play all their matches at Bislett to cut rental costs at Ullevaal. However, this was rejected by the municipality, who owned Bislett, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was not vacant capacity at Bislett.|$|E
