25|$|Proponents of the Bimini Road being a manmade feature {{argue that}} these {{radiocarbon}} dates are invalid because they were obtained entirely from whole-rock samples and subject to contamination from younger carbon. The <b>background</b> <b>data</b> reported by Calvert and others concerning the radiocarbon dates from the Bimini Road demonstrate {{that not all of}} these dates come entirely from whole-rock samples. That the dates from the shells and the clearly younger cement holding them together as beachrock are temporally consistent argues against any signification alteration of their radiocarbon content. In addition, other studies using radiocarbon dating to study sea level and the age of sediment and beachrock within the Bahamas have not reported any significant problems with contamination by younger radiocarbon. In their detailed research, Davaud and Strasser accepted the radiocarbon dates obtained from the beachrock composing the Bimini Road from the radiocarbon laboratory at the University of Miami as valid indicators of its age.|$|E

[...] ReFS supports many existing Windows and NTFS features such as BitLocker encryption, Access Control Lists, USN Journal, change notifications, symbolic links, junction points, mount points, reparse points, volume snapshots, file IDs, and oplock. ReFS seamlessly integrates with Storage Spaces, a storage virtualization layer that allows data mirroring and striping, as well as sharing storage pools between machines. ReFS resiliency features enhance the mirroring feature provided by Storage Spaces and can detect whether any mirrored copies of files become corrupt using <b>background</b> <b>data</b> scrubbing process, which periodically reads all mirror copies and verifies their checksums then replaces bad copies with good ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of large geophysical and celestial data bases is now, more than ever, {{the most critical}} path to timely data analysis. With today's large volume data sets from multiple satellite missions, analysts face the task of defining useful data bases from which data and metadata (information about data) can be extracted readily in a meaningful way. Visualization, following an object-oriented design, is a fundamental method of organizing and handling data. Humans, by nature, easily accept pictorial representations of data. Therefore graphically oriented user interfaces are appealing, {{as long as they}} remain simple to produce and use. The Visual Interface for Space and Terrestrial Analysis (VISTA) system, currently under development at the Naval Research Laboratory's <b>Backgrounds</b> <b>Data</b> Center (BDC), has been designed with these goals in mind.
