The act folded the coroner's office into the Health Department and the treasurer's office into the Finance Department, with informal arrangements for both incumbents to retain jobs in their respective departments as employees. In the general election, Pastorius was reelected to the abolished office, leading the entire ticket with 288,707 votes, nearly 20,000 more than Jones.

However, where Estes {{planned to use}} the network of conservative churches in the city, many members were discouraged from working with {{him because he was}} a Mormon. The tone of the advertising for the campaign was more dire than in Miami; ads claimed homosexuals were responsible for half the murders and suicides in major cities and half the cases of syphilis. Perhaps the most significant factor of the campaign was Estes' co-chair, a police officer named Dennis Falk. Two months <b>before</b> <b>election</b> day, Falk shot and killed a suspect {{who turned out to be}} a black, mentally retarded, young boy. The black community was furious with Falk, and transferred their anger to Initiative Thirteen.|$|E

In the Senate he served for 30years, and now holds the record for longest tenure of any Senator from Oregon.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} plenty of {{research}} and publications on Political Business Cycles (PBC), aimed at analysing and explaining the use of fiscal and monetary instruments to stimulate economic growth <b>before</b> <b>elections,</b> {{with the intention of}} impressing potential voters. Previous research on PBC in Albania reveals clear evidence of fiscal expansion <b>before</b> <b>elections,</b> but no significant changes in GDP and inflation as theory predicts. One possible explanation of this result could be economic agents’ expectations, which {{is the subject of this}} paper. We analyse consumers’ expectations <b>before</b> <b>elections,</b> the main factors underlying expectations, and the way in which these expectations influence their behaviour toward spending, and consequently the macroeconomic outcomes, deploying standard econometric methods widely applied in PBC related research. According to our research results, households’ consumption spending decreases <b>before</b> <b>elections</b> because of the higher uncertainty about their future economic situation due to the highly politicised public employment. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of {{manipulation of the}} economy by the incumbent for electoral purpose is called Political Business Cycles (PBC). Using policy control economic instruments, such as fiscal and monetary instruments, governments may manipulate the economy to gain electoral advantage by producing growth and decreasing unemployment <b>before</b> <b>elections.</b> Earlier research on PBC in Albania found clear evidence of fiscal expansion <b>before</b> <b>elections.</b> In addition to increased income from taxes and borrowing, another source of financing the increased fiscal expansion in transition countries may be income from privatization, {{which is also the}} object of the analysis of this paper. In our analysis we apply standard econometric approach, used widely for research related to PBC. We test if income from privatization increases <b>before</b> <b>elections.</b> We find statistically significant increase of income from privatization <b>before</b> general (parliamentary) <b>elections,</b> which may lead us to conclude {{that one of the reasons}} may be to finance increased expenditures <b>before</b> <b>elections.</b> Another motivation, behind this behavior of the incumbent, may be rent - seeking.

40|$|In Latin America {{there is}} ample {{evidence}} of exchange rate depreciations after elections. Hence, we turn to the behavior of international reserves over the 1980 - 2005 period to investigate if exchange rates are temporarily stabilized <b>before</b> <b>elections.</b> Using annual, quarterly, and monthly data to define the election year, we find that international reserves fall significantly <b>before</b> <b>elections,</b> which indeed suggests a policy of stabilizing exchange rates. The patterns observed in the region are not replicated in OECD countries. However, once we control for legislative checks and balances on executive discretion in countries with strong compliance with the law, the behavior of both regions becomes remarkably similar. We find that lower effective checks and balances can explain why reserves fall <b>before</b> <b>elections</b> in Latin America. The electoral cycles in reserves and exchange rates in Latin America can be interpreted in terms of the fiscal dominance of monetary policy...|$|R
