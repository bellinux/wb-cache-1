Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E

Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his potential and knowing the Yankees were looking for Jewish players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined it because he knew his opportunities would <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the presence of Gehrig as first baseman. Subsequently, he signed with the Detroit Tigers.|$|E

In May, the White Sox removed Ruffing from their active roster after he was hit in his bad knee with another line drive. He rejoined the White Sox' active roster in July. He pitched to a 3–5 win–loss record and a 6.11 ERA in nine games pitched on the season. Ruffing retired after the 1947 season.|$|E
5|$|The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards {{legislation}} as {{an indispensable}} means for realising the rights which {{is unlikely to}} <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> resource constraints.

Norway may not discriminate—based on nationality—the rights to fish, hunt and conduct mining, trade, industry and maritime activity. However, these activities may <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> non-discriminatory legislation. Thus Norway is permitted to place regulations and prohibitions on basis of other objective criteria, or ban certain activities altogether or in certain geographic areas. The non-discrimination clause also does not ban nationality discrimination elsewhere than in economic activity. Specifically, research and scientific activities do not fall under the non-discrimination clause.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall, an {{employee}} at Bohemia working on ARMA 3, released a massively popular mod for Arma II named DayZ, which includes zombies as the game's main enemies. Its popularity led to a resurgence in ARMA 2s sales, with registered players count being raised from 500,000 to one million. Impressed {{with the success of}} DayZ, Bohemia appointed Hall to fully capitalize on it by leading the development of a standalone DayZ video game, which ensured that he would not <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> the restraints of Arma 2. While the main goal is to transit the mod into an entirely new game, the team also intended to add more content such as base-building and improved crafting. Hall eventually left Bohemia in 2014, and the game remained in early access more than four years after its release in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In total hip arthroplasty, {{determining}} the impingement free {{range of motion}} requirement is a complex task. This is because in the native hip, motion is restricted by both impingement as well as soft tissue restraint. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine a range of motion bench-mark which can identify motions which are at risk from impingement and those which are constrained due to soft tissue. Two experimental methodologies were used to determine motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> impingement and those motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> both impingement and soft tissue restraint. By comparing these two experimental results, motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> impingement <b>were</b> able to be separated from those motions which <b>were</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> soft tissue restraint. The results show motions in exten-sion as well as flexion combined with adduction <b>are</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> soft tissue restraint. Motions in flexion, flexion combined with abduction and adduction are at risk from osseous impingement. Consequently, these motions represent where the maximum likely damage will occur in femoroacetabular impingement or at most risk of prosthetic impingement in total hip arthroplasty...|$|R

5|$|For {{those who}} are single when injured or who become single, SCI causes {{difficulties}} and insecurities with respect to one's ability to meet new partners and start relationships. In some settings, beauty standards cause people to view disabled bodies as less attractive, limiting the options for sexual and romantic partners {{of people with disabilities}} like SCI. Furthermore, physical disabilities are stigmatized, causing people to avoid contact with disabled people, particularly those with highly visible conditions like SCI. The stigma may cause people with SCI to experience self-consciousness and embarrassment in public. They can increase their social success by using impression management techniques to change how they are perceived and create a more positive image of themselves in others' eyes. Physical limitations create difficulties; with lowered independence comes reduced social interaction and fewer opportunities to find partners. Difficulties with mobility and the lack of disabled accessibility of social spaces (e.g. lack of wheelchair ramps) create a further barrier to social activity and limit the ability to meet partners. Isolation and its associated risk of depression can <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>by</b> participating in physical activities, social gatherings, clubs, and online chat and dating.|$|E
