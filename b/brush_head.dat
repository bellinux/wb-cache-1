50|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of an electric}} toothbrush depends not only on its type of action and on correct use, {{but also on the}} condition of the <b>brush</b> <b>head.</b> Most manufacturers recommend that heads be changed every three to six months at minimum, or as soon as the <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> has visibly deteriorated.|$|E
50|$|A kabuki brush (sometimes called {{mushroom}} brush) is {{a makeup}} brush {{with a short}} stem and dense bristles. The <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> is most often rounded, though {{it can also be}} flat. Traditionally, the bristles are made of natural materials like animal hair (e.g., goat or horse hair), but most brushes available now on the market have synthetic bristles.|$|E

50|$|The <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> vibrates at {{hundreds}} of times per second, with the latest models at 31,000 strokes per minute or 62,000 movements per minute (258 Hz). Rather than connecting to its charger with conductors, it uses inductive charging - the charger includes the primary winding of the voltage-reducing transformer and the fat handle of the brush includes the secondary winding. The replaceable head is also driven magnetically.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} toothbrush is {{a toothbrush}} that makes rapid, automatic bristle motions, either back-and-forth oscillation or rotation-oscillation (where the <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> alternates clockwise and counterclockwise rotation), {{in order to}} clean teeth. Motions at sonic speeds or below are made by a motor. In the case of ultrasonic toothbrushes, ultrasonic motions are produced by a piezoelectric crystal. A modern electric toothbrush is usually powered by a rechargeable battery charged through inductive charging when the brush sits in the charging base between uses.|$|E

50|$|A {{scrubber}} (Schrubber), {{is a type}} of wide {{brush with}} a long shaft used for cleaning hard floors or surfaces. Unlike a broom, which has soft bristles to sweep dirt away, a scrubber has hard bristles for brushing. It may therefore be used wet, with water or cleaning fluids. Around the <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> there may also be a removable floorcloth or mop, either soaked in water for cleaning or dry for wiping dry. However, these days other cleaning implements tend to be used for such purposes.|$|E

5000|$|Once activated, a small CPU in {{the handle}} plays the {{featured}} {{song on the}} chip by transferring vibrations through the bristles, which act as transducers, into the front teeth, through the jawbone, and into the inner ear. The user hears a mix between a natural vocal hum and the song being played. [...] The intended result was for the music only to be audible to its user, however the music emanating from the toothbrush can be heard by those nearby, with increasing volume as pressure {{is applied to the}} <b>brush</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{the stone}} is delivered, its {{trajectory}} is still {{influenced by the}} two sweepers under instruction from the skip. Sweeping is done for several reasons: to reduce friction underneath the stone, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone's path. The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance. When sweeping, pressure and speed of the <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> are key in slightly increasing the layer of moisture that builds up under the stone.|$|E

5000|$|In 1991 Frain, {{guided by}} the retail success of Akira, founded Manga Entertainment Ltd and within five years (1991 to 1995), the company had popularised Japanese {{animation}} in western markets and Frain’s relationships with Japanese animation directors, producers, studios, distributors and publishers led to the first ever animated feature co-production between Japanese and Western companies. The film Ghost in the Shell (on which Frain also acted as executive producer) {{has become one of}} the most successful films of the “anime” medium. During Frain's tenure as the CEO of Manga Entertainment, he established a US distribution division (Manga Entertainment Inc), a comic book division (Manga Publishing), and a CGI animation studio (Manga Studios). During that time, the company also developed and produced other animated features and TV series including Dave Borthwick’s award-winning film The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb, and Cobra directed by Japanese comic book artist Buichi Terasawa. At the end of 1995, Frain left Manga Entertainment to start his own animation production company Touchwood Animation. Some claim he was fired for the heavy investment in Ghost in the Shell, (which was nicknamed Frain's Folly at one point) but it turned out to be one of the most successful films in the company's history. Following his departure from Manga Entertainment, Frain retained a minority share in the company which he sold back to Blackwell prior to the sale to IDT. Since 1996 Andy Frain has been involved in the development and production of several animation TV series including Backpackers, an adult animation series for Tinopolis, Yazzoo Wazzoo, a pre-school series for Granada, Spheriks a 26 x ½ hour CGI TV series for FIFA and Tractor Tom a 52 x 11 minute pre-school series for Contender & CITV and Free Jimmy a CGI Feature Film for Sarah Radclyffe Productions. His company also produced the animation for <b>Brush</b> <b>Head</b> a series of shorts made for The Disney Channel & Dandy Productions and which won The BAFTA Animation Award in 2004. [...] The company has also produced a series of commercials and a short film for Nestle (via HRA and Ogilvy & Mather) and their Munch Bunch brand as well as a series of animated shorts based on BBC’s popular comedy series Little Britain.|$|E
40|$|This {{in vitro}} study {{assessed}} the cleaning efficacy of different electric toothbrushes around upper incisor brackets. Standard and Mini Diamond™ brackets were fixed on black-stained teeth. The teeth were coated with white titanium oxide and brushed in a machine twice for 1 minute each. Twelve different brush heads {{with either a}} wiping or an oscillating-rotating action were tested. After brushing, the teeth were scanned, the black surfaces were assessed planimetrically and a modified plaque index for orthodontic patients (PIOP) was introduced. Tooth areas, which were black again after brushing indicated tooth surface contact of the filaments and were expressed {{as a percentage of}} total area. The remaining white areas around the brackets indicated 'plaque-retentive' niches. Analysis of variance was used for individual comparison of the brush types. Bonferroni/Dunn adjustment was applied for multiple testing. The Sonicare® toothbrush handle with the <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> 'Compact ProResults' (81. 7 per cent) and the <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> 'Standard ProResults' (80. 8 per cent), as well as the sonic Waterpik® toothbrush SR 800 E with the standard <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> (78. 2 per cent), showed statistically significantly better cleaning efficacy than all others. The poorest cleaning efficacy was observed for the oscillating-rotating Braun Oral-B Professional Care with the <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> 'Ortho' (less than 50 per cent). The planimetric findings were in correspondence with the results of the PIOP assessment. Cleaning efficacy of electric toothbrushes around brackets on upper incisors was different between the tested brushes. The PIOP was practicable, effective, and easy to use, although it has to be verified in a clinical stud...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Toothbrushes play an {{essential}} role in oral hygiene. However, toothbrushes can become contaminated through contact with the environment, from the oral cavity, and by toothbrush storage containers. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of vinegar, lime, and salt water as potential household decontaminants for toothbrushes. Materials and Methods: In an in vitro study, 120 used toothbrushes were collected and divided into four groups comprising 30 samples each. Group I was treated with plain water alone after use. Group II was treated with salt water. Group III was treated with a solution which contained lime juice. Group IV was treated with vinegar. Treatment duration for the groups was set to be 12 [*]h. After the treatment, the <b>brush</b> <b>heads</b> of the four groups were incubated in brain-heart infusion agar at 37 °C for 24 [*]h. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20. 0 software. One-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc analysis were performed for multiple comparisons. Results: Vinegar group showed statistically significant result for decontamination of toothbrushes when compared to other test and control agents. Conclusion: Commonly used household materials can be potential decontaminants for toothbrushes. The results of this study showed that vinegar was the most effective decontamination agent followed by lime and salt water...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the susceptibility of dentin to brushing abrasion using four different toothbrushes (rotating-oscillating, sonic and two types of manual toothbrushes) with the same brushing forces. Dentin samples (n = 72) were selected from 72 impacted third molars. Half of the surface of dentin samples was covered with an adhesive tape, creating a protected and a freely exposed area in the same specimen. Brushing was performed with either a: sonic (Sonicare PowerUp, Philips GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), b: oscillating-rotating (Oral B Vitality Precisions Clean, Procter & Gamble, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany) or two different manual toothbrushes c: flat trim <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> toothbrush (Dr. Best: Original, Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Bühl, Germany) and d: rippled-shaped <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> toothbrush (Blend-a-Dent, Complete V-Interdental, Blend-a-med, Schwalbach, Germany) in a custom made automatic brushing machine. The brushing force was set to 2 N and a whitening toothpaste (RDA = 150) was used. The simulation period was performed over a calculated period to mimic a brushing behavior of two times a day brushing for eight years and six months. Dentin loss was quantitatively determined by profilometry and statistically analyzed by Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney-U Test (p < 0. 05). The mean (standard deviation) surface loss was 21. 03 (± 1. 26) μm for the sonic toothbrush, 15. 71 (± 0. 85) μm for the oscillating-rotating toothbrush, 6. 13 (± 1. 24) μm for the manual toothbrush with flat trim <b>brush</b> <b>head</b> and 2. 50 (± 0. 43) μm for the manual toothbrush with rippled-shaped <b>brush</b> <b>head.</b> Differences between all groups were statistically significant at p< 0. 05.
