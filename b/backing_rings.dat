40|$|Compliant {{contacting}} filament seals such as {{brush seals}} {{are well known}} to give improved leakage performance and hence specific fuel consumption benefit compared to labyrinth seals. The design of the brush seal must be robust {{across a range of}} operating pressures, rotor speeds, and radial build-offset tolerances. Importantly the wear characteristics of the seal must be well understood to allow a secondary air system suitable for operation over the entire engine life to be designed. A test rig at the University of Oxford is described which was developed for the testing of brush seals at engine-representative speeds, pressures, and seal housing eccentricities. The test rig allows the leakage, torque, and temperature rise in the rotor to be characterized as functions of the differential pressure(s) across the seal and the speed of rotation. Tests were run on two different geometries of bristle pack with conventional, passive, and active pressure-balanced backing ring configurations. Comparison of the experimental results indicates that the hysteresis inherent in conventional brush seal design could compromise performance (due to increased leakage) or life (due to exacerbated wear) as a result of reduced compliance. The inclusion of active pressure-balanced <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> in the seal designs are shown to alleviate the problem of bristle–backing ring friction, but this is associated with increased blow-down forces which could result in a significant seal-life penalty. The best performing seal was concluded to be the passive pressure-balanced configuration, which achieves the best compromise between leakage and seal torque. Seals incorporating passive pressure-balanced <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> are also shown to have improved heat transfer performance in comparison to other design...|$|E
40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes –Part 1 Numerical simulations Leaks occasionally occur in flange joints in plastic pipelines, predominantly large dimension ones. Such pipelines are normally {{of importance for}} e g water supply, and repair is expensive. A better understanding is vital since a clear background is missing for the existing design and mounting recommendations, which also are differing. Analysis of plastic flanges {{is more complicated than}} for metal ones since the material is time dependent, and much softer than the <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> and bolts. The aim of this work was to be able to assess on one hand if presently standardized flange geometries mean smaller safety margins when the size of the pipe is increased, {{and on the other hand}} if the instructions for mounting have to be improved. First, an analysis was made by manual calculations, without consideration of the time dependent properties of the material, in order to assess the stresses just after tightening of the joint but before pressurizing and start of service time of the pipeline. The manualanalysis is of course misleading for assessment of the compression stresses in the flange surfaces over time, although it seems that such calculations often are used for design. The value of the manual analysis was mainly that it showed that the nominal stresses aresimilar for different sizes, except for the 630 mm pipe where they are significantly higher. Further it was established that pressurizing of the pipe means a moderate influence on the flange stresses and bolt forces, 10 - 15 %, and that the bolt and backing ring are much stiffer than the plastic flange, meaning that it is mainly relaxation that is responsible forunloading of the joint over time. Computer simulations (FEM) were then made of both the tightening and the service phase for a set of geometries, and with a material model including time dependent properties of the plastic parts of the joint using material data from in-house experiments. Although the computer simulations are approximate too, they give a much better impression both of the principal function of the joint and of the magnitude of the stresses over time. It appears that the geometry of the flange joint means that the contact is lost over large parts of the flange surfaces already at pressurizing and that a triangulardistribution of pressure covering a part of the flange surface corresponding to the width of the backing ring is developed over time which should be sufficient to keep the joint tight. The effects of gaskets and profiled, softer, <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> are clarified, and it is indicated that re-tightening is an efficient way to improve the function of the joint over time. Further, it seems that there is no significant difference in behaviour, as regards flange pressure, between SDR 11 and SDR 17 geometries. So, the FEM investigation has revealed that intuitive thoughts about reasons for inferior functioning of large size flange joints in plastic pipes are not well founded. The most efficient way to improve the joint is to increase the bolt force and to keep it up,by re-tightening or by flexible <b>backing</b> <b>rings.</b> Gaskets, soft ones, may be beneficial for reducing unevenness of the plastic joint surfaces...|$|E

Tests were conducted on two commercial elastomeric seals: a "T" seal (76 mm O. D. and 3. 8 mm between <b>backing</b> <b>rings)</b> and an "O" ring (76 mm O. D. and 5. 3 mm diameter). Testing conditions included seal durometers of 70 and 90, sliding velocities of 0. 8, 2. 0, and 3. 6 m/s, and no pressure gradient across the seal. Both acrylic and aluminum cylinders were used. Measured oil film thickness profiles were compared to results of the elastohydrodynamic analysis. The comparison shows an overall qualitative agreement. Friction and oil leakage measurements were also made at these sliding speeds. The fluid used was a typical synthetic base automotive lubricant. It is concluded that this first time experimental analytical comparison for oil film thickness indicates the need for some improvements in the analytical model and in the experimental technique...|$|E
40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes – Part 2 Full scale experimental investigationsLeakage that sometimes occurs in flange joints in large size plastic pipelines for water supply {{is a serious}} problem. Research was undertaken {{in order to improve}} the knowledge about the function of such flange joints. The objectives were partly to find out the degree of sensitivity of the design, i e if small deviations from recommended practise is critical, partly to be able to suggest improved design and mounting procedures. One part of the investigation was a numerical (FEM) study of several geometries, which was reported in [2]. Use of a time-dependent material model made it possible to follow the development of deformations and flange surface pressures for long times. Although several important principal findings were made, the tightening procedure and exact material behaviour could not be modelled. Therefore a series of full-scale experiments were made on 630 mm pipes, for a number of combinations of flange dimension and gasket type. This second part of the research is reported here. Since four of the twenty bolts were instrumented, the bolt forces could be monitored and be related to the torque and to the pressure in the pipe over time. This resulted in novel, important information about the functioning of plastic flange joints. In short, the experiments were performed in the following way. First, the bolts were tightened in the recommended criss-cross fashion to pre-determined torque levels. Then the pressure in the pipe was increased until leakage occurred. For combinations of flanges, gaskets and torques where the joint was tight for pressures above 13 bars, the 13 bar pressure level was maintained for up to one week. The relationship between bolt force and torque does not agree at all with the frequently used rule of thumb formula, for the galvanized bolts used here. The bolt force was typically less than half the value obtained by the formula. Hence it is critical to verify the friction for the used combination of bolt material, surface treatment, and lubrication. The bolt forces also appear to be unevenly distributed, which is partly due to successive creep during the tightening procedure. For the high stresses in the flange creep is significant already for so short times as a few minutes, and the effect is increased {{by the fact that the}} bolts and <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> are much stiffer than the plastic flange. For both the wide and the narrow (ISO) flange type used it appears that rubber gaskets perform better, in the sense that the joint is tight for lower applied torques. The hyper- elastic material properties help to smooth unevenness in the flange surface and to compensate for creep in the plastic. Use of SDR 17 pipes at pressure levels of 13 bars means considerable creep expansion of the pipe, although it is possible to obtain a tight joint. The expansion gives a wringing effect at the flange, also observed in [2], which contributes to concentrate the flange pressure to the outer parts of the flange surface. In summary, flange joints are possible to mount so that they are tight, also for 630 mm pipes. Since the design is a sensitive one it is vital to follow recommendations for 4 mounting of different combinations of flanges and gaskets. In particular, knowledge about the relationship between torque and bolt force is important...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} programme and a CFD based mathematical model using a brush seal at two bristle to rotor clearances (0, 27 mm. and 0, 75 mm.), are presented. The experimental programme examined the radial pressure distributions along the <b>backing</b> <b>ring,</b> the axial pressure distribution along the rotor, {{and the mass}} flow through the seal, through a range of pressure ratios while exhausting to atmosphere. The results from this experimental programme {{have been used to}} further calibrate a CFD based model. This model treats the bristle pack as an axisymmetric, anisotropic porous region, and is calibrated by the definition of non-linear resistance coefficients in three orthogonal directions. The CFD analysis calculates the aerodynamic forces on the bristles, which are subsequently used in a separate program to estimate the bristle movements, stresses and bristle and rotor loads. The analysis shows that a brush seal with a build clearance produces a very different flow field within the bristle pack to one with an interference, and the need to understand the bulk movements of the bristles. These are shown to be affected by the level of friction between the bristles and the <b>backing</b> <b>ring,</b> which has an important effect on the bristles wear and seal leakage characteristics...|$|R
