500|$|The song, if not {{the title}} alone, {{was a source of}} {{irritation}} for those critics who deemed Living in the Material World overly preachy and didactic. In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: [...] "One gets this feeling of George, somewhat remote and rarefied, indicting the world for <b>being</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, although if anybody could change the world it would be an old Beatle." [...] While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's [...] "struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind", Watts wrote: [...] "He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup." ...|$|E

In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office <b>being</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is, I still think there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.'
