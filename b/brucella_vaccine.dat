40|$|Abstract Background Brucella spp. are Gram-negative, facultative {{intracellular}} {{bacteria that}} cause brucellosis, {{one of the}} commonest zoonotic diseases found worldwide in humans {{and a variety of}} animal species. While several animal vaccines are available, there is no effective and safe vaccine for prevention of brucellosis in humans. VIOLIN ([URL] is a web-based vaccine database and analysis system that curates, stores, and analyzes published data of commercialized vaccines, and vaccines in clinical trials or in research. VIOLIN contains information for 454 vaccines or vaccine candidates for 73 pathogens. VIOLIN also contains many bioinformatics tools for vaccine data analysis, data integration, and vaccine target prediction. To demonstrate the applicability of VIOLIN for vaccine research, VIOLIN was used for bioinformatics analysis of existing Brucella vaccines and prediction of new <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> targets. Results VIOLIN contains many literature mining programs (e. g., Vaxmesh) that provide in-depth analysis of <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> literature. As a result of manual literature curation, VIOLIN contains information for 38 Brucella vaccines or vaccine candidates, 14 protective Brucella antigens, and 68 host response studies to Brucella vaccines from 97 peer-reviewed articles. These Brucella vaccines are classified in the Vaccine Ontology (VO) system and used for different ontological applications. The web-based VIOLIN vaccine target prediction program Vaxign was used to predict new <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> targets. Vaxign identified 14 outer membrane proteins that are conserved in six virulent strains from B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis that are pathogenic in humans. Of the 14 membrane proteins, two proteins (Omp 2 b and Omp 31 - 1) are not present in B. ovis, a Brucella species that is not pathogenic in humans. <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> data stored in VIOLIN were compared and analyzed using the VIOLIN query system. Conclusions Bioinformatics curation and ontological representation of Brucella vaccines promotes classification and analysis of existing Brucella vaccines and vaccine candidates. Computational prediction of <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> targets provides more candidates for rational vaccine development. The use of VIOLIN provides a general approach that can be applied for analyses of vaccines against other pathogens and infection diseases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Vaccine {{protection}} investigation {{includes three}} processes: vaccination, pathogen challenge, and vaccine protection efficacy assessment. Many variables {{can affect the}} results of vaccine protection. Brucella, a genus of facultative intracellular bacteria, is the etiologic agent of brucellosis in humans and multiple animal species. Extensive {{research has been conducted}} in developing effective live attenuated Brucella vaccines. We hypothesized that some variables play a more important role than others in determining vaccine protective efficacy. Using Brucella vaccines and vaccine candidates as study models, this hypothesis was tested by meta-analysis of <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> studies reported in the literature. Results Nineteen variables related to vaccine-induced protection of mice against infection with virulent brucellae were selected based on modeling investigation of the vaccine protection processes. The variable "vaccine protection efficacy" was set as a dependent variable while the other eighteen were set as independent variables. Discrete or continuous values were collected from papers for each variable of each data set. In total, 401 experimental groups were manually annotated from 74 peer-reviewed publications containing mouse protection data for live attenuated Brucella vaccines or vaccine candidates. Our ANOVA analysis indicated that nine variables contributed significantly (P-value 0. 05). The protection level of RB 51 was sacrificed when the values of several variables (e. g., vaccination route, vaccine viability, and challenge pathogen strain) change. It is suggestive {{that it is difficult to}} protect against aerosol challenge. Somewhat counter-intuitively, our results indicate that intraperitoneal and subcutaneous vaccinations are much more effective to protect against aerosol Brucella challenge than intranasal vaccination. Conclusions Literature meta-analysis identified variables that significantly contribute to <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> protection efficacy. The results obtained provide critical information for rational vaccine study design.

40|$|Research for novel <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccines</b> {{has focused}} upon the {{development}} of live vaccine strains, which have proven more efficacious than killed or subunit vaccines. In an effort to develop improved vaccines, signature-tagged mutant banks were screened to identify mutants attenuated for survival. Mutants selected from these screens exhibited various degrees of attenuation characterized by the rate of clearance, ranging from a failure to grow in macrophages after 24 h of infection to a failure to persist in the mouse model beyond 8 weeks. Ideal vaccine candidates should be safe to the host, while evoking protective immunity. In the present work, we constructed unmarked deletion mutants of three gene candidates, manBA, virB 2, and asp 24, in both Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis. The Δasp 24 mutants, which persist for extended periods in vivo, are superior to current vaccine strains and to other deletion strains tested in the mouse model against homologous challenge infection after 12, 16, and 20 weeks postvaccination. The Δasp 24 mutants also display superior protection compared to ΔmanBA and ΔvirB 2 mutants against heterologous challenge in mice. From this study, a direct association between protection against infection and cytokine response was not apparent between all vaccine groups and, therefore, correlates of protective immunity {{will need to be}} considered further.

40|$|Abstract Background Vaccine {{literature}} indexing {{is poorly}} performed in PubMed due to limited hierarchy of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) annotation in the vaccine field. Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a community-based biomedical ontology that represents various vaccines and their relations. SciMiner is an in-house literature mining system that supports literature indexing and gene name tagging. We hypothesize that application of VO in SciMiner will aid vaccine literature indexing and mining of vaccine-gene interaction networks. As a test case, we have examined vaccines for Brucella, the causative agent of brucellosis in humans and animals. Results The VO-based SciMiner (VO-SciMiner) {{was developed to}} incorporate a total of 67 <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> terms. A set of rules for term expansion of VO terms were learned from training data, consisting of 90 biomedical articles related to <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> terms. VO-SciMiner demonstrated high recall (91 %) and precision (99 %) from testing a separate set of 100 manually selected biomedical articles. VO-SciMiner indexing exhibited superior performance in retrieving Brucella vaccine-related papers over that obtained with MeSH-based PubMed literature search. For example, a VO-SciMiner search of "live attenuated Brucella vaccine" returned 922 hits as of April 20, 2011, while a PubMed search of the same query resulted in only 74 hits. Using the abstracts of 14, 947 Brucella -related papers, VO-SciMiner identified 140 Brucella genes associated with Brucella vaccines. These genes included known protective antigens, virulence factors, and genes closely related to Brucella vaccines. These VO-interacting Brucella genes were significantly over-represented in biological functional categories, including metabolite transport and metabolism, replication and repair, cell wall biogenesis, intracellular trafficking and secretion, posttranslational modification, and chaperones. Furthermore, a comprehensive interaction network of Brucella vaccines and genes were identified. The asserted and inferred VO hierarchies provide semantic support for inferring novel knowledge of association of vaccines and genes from the retrieved data. New hypotheses were generated based on this analysis approach. Conclusion VO-SciMiner {{can be used to}} improve the efficiency for PubMed searching in the vaccine domain. </p...|$|E

40|$|One {{health is}} an {{emerging}} conceptual approach geared to harmonize {{the activities of}} the public health, veterinary services, and extension services within a single operative structure. Brucellosis is an important zoonosis worldwide, mostly involving nomadic populations but may often affect transboundary animal management and exotic domesticated animal farming such as camels and buffalo. Here, we provide contemporary knowledge on the disease and its causative agent, a Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genus Brucella. Further, because of the zoonotic importance, we emphasize the need to assign a national reference laboratory for the disease and discuss how this would integrate into a “One Health” system. <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccines</b> are live attenuated strains possessing the smooth phenotype, and vaccination, therefore, hampers the ability to maintain a national surveillance program due to concerns regarding the false positive vaccine-induced responses. In order to overcome these failings, we developed a combined approach based on rapid screening of mass numbers of serum samples by the fluorescence polarization assay, a cost-effective and accurate method, and confirmation of the true positive reactors by the complement fixation test, a highly specific method that is less sensitive to vaccine-induced antibodies. We demonstrate how, despite the high vaccination coverage of the small ruminant population in Israel, our results proved to be effective in discriminating between vaccinated and infected animals.

40|$|Brucella abortus rough {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) mutants {{were obtained}} by transposon insertion into two wbk genes (wbkA [putative glycosyltransferase; formerly rfbU] and per [perosamine synthetase]), into manB (pmm [phosphomannomutase; formerly rfbK]), and into an unassigned gene. Consistent with gene-predicted roles, electrophoretic analysis, 2 -keto- 3 -manno-D-octulosonate measurements, and immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies to O-polysaccharide, outer and inner core epitopes showed no O-polysaccharide expression and no LPS core defects in the wbk mutants. The rough LPS of manB mutant lacked the outer core epitope and the gene was designated manB(core) to distinguish it from the wbk manB(O-Ag). The fourth gene (provisionally designated wa**) coded for a putative glycosyltransferase involved in inner core synthesis, but the mutant kept the outer core epitope. Differences in phage and polymyxin sensitivity, exposure or expression of outer membrane protein, core and lipid A epitopes, and lipid A acylation demonstrated that small changes in LPS core caused significant differences in B. abortus outer membrane topology. In mice, the mutants showed different degrees of attenuation and induced antibodies to rough LPS and outer membrane proteins. Core-defective mutants and strain RB 51 were ineffective vaccines against B. abortus in mice. The mutants per and wbkA induced protection but less than the standard smooth vaccine S 19, and controls suggested that anti O-polysaccharide antibodies accounted largely for the difference.

40|$|The {{reliable}} {{differentiation of}} live <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine</b> strains from field isolates {{is an important}} element in brucellosis control programs. We describe the design, validation, and implementation of a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -based typing platform that offers a rapid, reliable, and robust tool to achieve this with improved diagnostic accuracy compared to existing molecular tests.

40|$|Objective(s) :Brucellosis, {{especially}} {{caused by}} Brucella melitensis, {{remains one of}} the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide with more than 500, 000 human cases reported annually. The commonly used live attenuated vaccine in ovine brucellosis prophylaxis is B. melitensis Rev 1. But due to different problems caused by the administration of this vaccine, a protective subunit vaccine against B. melitensis is strongly demanded. Brucella BP 26, Omp 31 and TF proteins have shown a considerable potential as protective antigens for brucellosis. Chimeric proteins carrying epitopes or adjuvant sequences increase the possibility of eliciting a broad cellular or humoral immune response. In silico tools are highly suited to study, design and evaluate vaccine strategies.

40|$|In vivo {{bioluminescence}} imaging is {{a persuasive}} approach {{to investigate a}} number of issues in microbial pathogenesis. Previously, we have applied bioluminescence imaging to gain greater insight into Brucella melitensis pathogenesis. Endowing Brucella with bioluminescence allowed direct visualization of bacterial dissemination, pattern of tissue localization, and the contribution of Brucella genes to virulence. In this report, we describe the pathogenicity of three attenuated bioluminescent B. melitensis mutants, GR 019 (virB 4), GR 024 (galE), and GR 026 (BMEI 1090 -BMEI 1091), and the dynamics of bioluminescent virulent bacterial infection following vaccination with these mutants. The virB 4, galE, and BMEI 1090 -BMEI 1091 mutants were attenuated in interferon regulatory factor 1 -deficient (IRF- 1 −/−) mice; however, only the GR 019 (virB 4) mutant was attenuated in cultured macrophages. Therefore, in vivo imaging provides a comprehensive approach to identify virulence genes that are relevant to in vivo pathogenesis. Our results provide greater insights into the role of galE in virulence and also suggest that BMEI 1090 and downstream genes constitute a novel set of genes involved in Brucella virulence. Survival of the vaccine strain in the host for a critical period is important for effective <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccines.</b> The galE mutant induced no changes in liver and spleen but localized chronically in the tail and protected IRF- 1 −/− and wild-type mice from virulent challenge, implying that this mutant may serve as a potential vaccine candidate in future studies and that the direct visualization of Brucella may provide insight into selection of improved vaccine candidates...|$|R
40|$|Brucella spp. are facultative {{intracellular}} Gram negative bacteria {{with specific}} tropism for monocytes/macrophages. Clinical manifestations of brucellosis are primarily immune-mediated and not {{thought to be}} due to bacterial virulence factors. Acquired immunity to brucellosis has been studied through observations of naturally infected hosts (cattle, goats), laboratory mouse models, and human infection. Cell-mediated immunity drives the clinical manifestations of human disease after exposure to Brucella species but high antibody responses are not associated with protective immunity. The precise mechanisms by which cell-mediated immune responses confer protection or lead to disease manifestations remain poorly understood. Descriptive studies of immune responses in human brucellosis show that TH 1 (interferon-gamma) are associated with dominant immune responses, findings consistent with animal studies. Whether these T cell responses are protective, or determine the different clinical responses associated with brucellosis is unknown, especially with regard to undulant fever manifestations, relapsing disease, or are associated with responses to distinct sets of Brucella spp. antigens are unknown. Few data regarding T cell responses in terms of specific recognition of Brucella spp. protein antigens and peptidic epitopes, either by CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cells, have been identified in human brucellosis patients. Additionally because current attenuated <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccines</b> used in animals cause human disease, there is a true need for a recombinant protein subunit vaccine for human brucellosis, as well as for improved diagnostics in terms of prognosis and identification of unusual forms of brucellosis.

In this study, subunit vaccines were developed {{that consisted of}} a recombinant outer membrane protein (rOmp 31) and the trigger factor chaperone protein (rTF) of Brucella melitensis, either alone or in combination. BALB/c mice that were immunized with rOmp 31 + rTF showed comparable but slightly higher TF-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 a antibodies as compared to mice with rTF alone. Indeed, mice given this combination had titers of rOmp 31 -specific antibodies similar to those immunized with rOmp 31 alone. In lymphocyte reactivation experiments, the splenocytes of immunized mice, whether given either of these antigens alone or as a cocktail, exhibited a strong antigen-specific recall proliferative response and expressed high amounts of IFN-Î³, IL- 12, IL- 10 and IL- 6. Both rTF and rTF + rOmp 31 vaccinated mice exhibited significantly higher CD 4 and CD 8 levels compared to the PBS group. The combination of rOmp 31 and rTF provided protection against B. melitensis infection {{comparable to that of}} vaccine strain Rev. 1. In comparison to rTF alone, combination of rTF and rOmp 31 caused only a slight increase in protection level. Although combination of rTF and rOmp 31 caused a non-significant increase in IFN-Î³ induction, antibody level, proliferation index and CD 4 and CD 8 frequencies compared to rTF alone, its cumulative effects on aforesaid parameters may be viewed as a better efficacy.

40|$|Brucellosis {{caused by}} Brucella spp. {{is a major}} {{zoonotic}} disease. Control of brucellosis in agricultural animals {{is a prerequisite for}} the prevention of this disease in human beings. Recently, Brucella melitensis was declared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be one of three major bioterrorist agents due to the expense required for the treatment of human brucellosis patients. Also, the economic agricultural loss due to bovine brucellosis emphasizes the financial impact of brucellosis in society. Thus, vaccination might efficiently solve this disease. Currently, B. abortus RB 51 and B. melitensis REV. 1 are used to immunize cattle and to immunize goats and sheep, respectively, in many countries. However, these genetically undefined strains still induce abortion and persistent infection, raising questions of safety and efficiency. In fact, the REV. 1 vaccine is quite virulent and apparently unstable, creating the need for improved vaccines for B. melitensis.

Exploiting this feature, we developed a PCR assay that distinguishes strain RB 51 from all other Brucella species and strains tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of chronically protein-deficient mice to an optimal diet {{a few days}} before immunization with sheep erythrocytes, tetanus toxoid or <b>Brucella</b> abortus <b>vaccine</b> either failed to increase antibody production above the level produced by deficient mice, or suppressed the responses to below those produced by deficient mice or normally-fed controls. Transfer to high protein diet on the day of immunization or feeding deficient mice the normal diet for just 2 days at the time of injection produced higher titres than did transfer {{a few days before}} immunization. Secondary responses to TT were affected by transfer to the normal diet at priming, rather than at rechallenge. Some mechanisms which may explain these findings and their implications for immunization schedules in malnourished humans are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Available <b>vaccines</b> against <b>Brucella</b> spp. {{are live}} {{attenuated}} Brucella strains. In order to engineer a better vaccine {{to be used}} in animals and humans, our laboratory aims to develop an innocuous subunit vaccine. Particularly, we are interested in the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of B. abortus: Omp 16 and Omp 19. In this study, we assessed the use of these proteins as <b>vaccines</b> against <b>Brucella</b> in BALB/c mice. Immunization with lipidated Omp 16 (L-Omp 16) or L-Omp 19 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) conferred significant protection against B. abortus infection. Vaccination with unlipidated Omp 16 (U-Omp 16) or U-Omp 19 in IFA induced a higher degree of protection than the respective lipidated versions. Moreover, the level of protection induced after U-Omp 16 or U-Omp 19 immunization in IFA was similar to that elicited by live B. abortus S 19 immunization. Flow cytometric analysis showed that immunization with U-Omp 16 or U-Omp 19 induced antigen-specific CD 4 + as well as CD 8 + T cells producing gamma interferon. In vivo depletion of CD 4 + or CD 8 + T cells in mice immunized with U-Omp 16 or U-Omp 19 plus IFA resulted in a loss of the elicited protection, indicating that both cell types are mediating immune protection. U-Omp 16 or U-Omp 19 vaccination induced a T helper 1 response, systemic protection in aluminum hydroxide formulation, and oral protection with cholera toxin adjuvant against B. abortus infection. Both immunization routes exhibited a similar degree of protection to attenuated <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccines</b> (S 19 and RB 51, respectively). Overall these results indicate that U-Omp 16 or U-Omp 19 would be a useful candidate for a subunit vaccine against human and animal brucellosis...|$|R
40|$|Immunological {{and genetic}} studies were {{performed}} in Sudanese camels. The {{aims of the}} former were to determine the optimum concentration of Ficoll for separation of camel lymphocytes, and to measure the cellular immune response of Sudanese camels which were vaccinated with <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The genetic studies were performed to analyze the genetic diversity and relationships between a five Sudanese camels breeds i. e. Anaffi, Arabi, Rashidi, Bishari, and Kenanni. The immunological results revealed that 10 % Ficoll concentration was efficient for separation of camel lymphocytes. The colorimetric assay which was used for measuring the degree of the proliferative response of lymphocytes to various stimulations revealed the mitogenic effect of the PHA on the camel lymphocytes. Also low stimulation indices were calculated from lymphocytes isolated from non vaccinated camels, whereas lymphocytes isolated from vaccinated camels showed high values of stimulation indices, indicating the high magnititute of cellular immunity produced in camel followed vaccination with <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> The genetic studies were performed in the above mentioned five Sudanese camel breeds. Genomic DNA was extracted from 128 individuals representing the five breeds. Two types of polymorphic DNAThe first type was Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) marker. RAPD analysis was performed by using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with one random primer to amplify the genomic DNA of different camel breeds. The primer resulted in amplification of 18 polymorphic bands in the five breeds ranged in size from 150 – 1700 bp. The mean number of bands that were produced in the five breeds ranged from 5. 3 – 6. 9 in Anaffi and Kenanni breeds respectively. The average value of bands sharing within a breed ranged from 0. 54 – 0. 87 between Kenanni and Bishari individuals respectively. The values of average bands sharing between breeds ranged from 0. 212 – 0. 359 between Anaffi- Kenanni, and Arabi – Rashidi, respectively. The studies with eight labeled microastellite primers indicated that seven of these primers {{were found to be}} polymorphic in the five camel breeds. The eighth primer was polymorphic in four breed and monomorphic in Kenanni breed. The number of alleles generated by the eight primers in the five camel breeds ranged from 1 – 19 alleles per locus. The observed hetrozygosity ranged from 45 % - 53 % in Bishari and Anaffi respectively. Four of the microsatellite loci were found to show significant deviation from HWE in some breeds. When F statistics test was done to measure the genetic diversity among breeds, {{it was found that the}} value FIS, which measures inbreeding in subpopulation, was found to be 17. 4 %. The value of FIT, which measures inbreeding in the total population, was 20. 2 %, while the value of FST, which is an indication of differentiation between breeds, indicated that the five breeds were poorly differentiated with FST value of only 3. 3 %...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Brucellosis {{is a major}} {{bacterial}} zoonosis {{of global}} importance affecting a range of animal species and man worldwide. It has economic, public health, and bio-risk importance. Control and prevention of animal brucellosis mainly depend on accurate diagnostic tools and implementation of effective and safe animal vaccination program. There are three types of animal Brucella live vaccines - Brucella melitensis Rev- 1 vaccine, Brucella abortus S 19, and B. abortus RB 51. Evaluation of these vaccines depends mainly on enumeration of Brucella viable count. At present, used colony count method is time consuming, costly and requires especial skills. Hence, {{the aim of this}} study is to use and standardize real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as an alternative, quantitative, sensitive, and rapid method to detect the colony count of Brucella in live <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Materials and Methods: Four batches of different live Brucella vaccines were evaluated using of conventional bacterial count and RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) using BSCP 31 gene specific primers and probe. Standard curve was generated from DNA template extracted from 10 -fold serial dilution of living B. abortus RB 51 vaccine to evaluate the sensitivity of RT-qPCR. Results: Results revealed that three batches of living Brucella vaccines were acceptable for Brucella colony count when traditional bacterial enumeration method was used. Results of RT-qPCR were identical to that of conventional bacterial count. Conclusion: Results concluded that RT-qPCR was relatively sensitive compared to traditional bacterial colony count of these vaccines...|$|E
40|$|The chronicity of Brucella abortus {{infection}} in {{humans and animals}} depends on the organism's ability to escape host defenses by gaining entry and surviving inside the macrophage. Although no human vaccine exists for <b>Brucella,</b> <b>vaccine</b> development in other bacteria {{has been based on}} deletions of selective nutritional as well as regulatory systems. Our goal is to develop a vaccine for Brucella. To further this aim, we have used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter system to identify constitutively and intracellularly induced B. abortus genes. Constitutively producing gfp clones exhibited sequence homology with genes associated with protein synthesis and metabolism (initiation factor- 1 and tRNA ribotransferase) and detoxification (organic hydroperoxidase resistance). Of greater interest, clones negative for constitutively produced gfp in agar were examined by fluorescence microscopy to detect promoter activity induced within macrophages 4 and 24 h following infection. Bacterial genes activated in macrophages 4 h postinfection appear to be involved in adapting to intracellular environmental conditions. Included in this group were genes for detoxification (lactoglyglutathione lyase gene), repair (formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase gene), osmotic protection (K+ transport gene), and site-specific recombination (xerD gene). A gene involved in metabolism and biosynthesis (deoxyxylulose 5 ′ phosphate synthase gene) was also identified. Genes activated 24 h following infection were biosynthesis- and metabolism-associated genes (iron binding protein and rhizopine catabolism). Identification of B. abortus genes that are activated following macrophage invasion provides insight into Brucella pathogenesis and thus is valuable in vaccine design utilizing selective targeted deletions of newly identified Brucella genes...|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} Brucella infection status of a feral swine herd which was previously known to be enzootically infected with Brucella and to assess potential <b>Brucella</b> <b>vaccines</b> in both domestic and feral swine populations. Eighty feral swine were trapped in South Carolina. The Brucella culture positivity rate was 77. 5 %. Both B. suis and B. abortus were cultured from infected feral swine. Of the B. abortus isolates, B. abortus biovar 1 field isolates and B. abortus S 19 were identified. The serological positivity rate was 48. 8 %, and the sensitivity of individual serological assays ranged from 13. 1 %- 44. 6 %. Histological lesions compatible with Brucella infection were also noted. The natural, rough mutant vaccine B. abortus RB 51 was evaluated in domestic and feral swine. Domestic swine failed to develop significant cell-mediated or humoral immune responses following parenteral vaccination with 2. 0 X 1010 CFU. Also, vaccination with RB 51 provided no protection from challenge with virulent B. suis in gravid gilts. RB 51 failed to reduce the seroconversion rate or culture recovery rate of vaccinated feral swine. A natural rough mutant of B. suis, B. suis 353 - 1, was evaluated in domestic swine. B. suis 353 - 1 induced significant cell-mediated responses in domestic swine parenterally and orally vaccinated with a live preparation as well as domestic swine parenterally vaccinated with a heat-killed, adjuvanted preparation. The vaccine was nonpathogenic and was not shed from animals vaccinated with live preparations. The rough phenotype was stable {{for the duration of}} the studies. Domestic swine vaccinated with all preparations of 353 - 1 had some level of protection from challenge with virulent B. suis...|$|R
40|$|Background and objectives: Brucella melitensis {{infection}} {{is still a}} major health problem for human and cattle in developing countries and the Middle East. Materials and Methods: In this study, in order to screen immunogenic candidate antigens {{for the development of}} a <b>Brucella</b> subunit <b>vaccine,</b> a cytoplasmic protein (DnaK) and an outer membrane protein (Omp 31) of B. melitensis were cloned, expressed in E. coli BL 21 and then purified using Ni-NTA agarose. Immunized serum was prepared from a rabbit inoculated with attenuated B. melitensis. Results and Conclusion: It was proved that immunized serum contains antibodies against recombinant Omp 31 (rOmp 31) and DnaK (rDnaK) by Western blot and ELISA assays. The results may suggest the importance of these proteins as subunit vaccines against B. melitensis as well as targets for immunotherapy...|$|R

Antisera from rabbits hyperimmunized with selected precipitation lines were used for purification by affinity chromatography of two precipitating and one non-precipitating antigen from crude bacterial extracts. A passive hemagglutination test using these antigens was developed. A number of characterized bovine sera were screened by passive hemagglutination and conventional bacterial tube agglutination test. A considerable improvement in discrimination between sera from infected and vaccinated cattle was obtained with the hemagglutination test compared with bacterial tube agglutination...|$|R
