2500|$|Ibrahimović {{was born}} to a Bosnian Muslim father, Šefik Ibrahimović, and a Croatian Catholic mother, Jurka Gravić; his parents were {{immigrants}} to Sweden from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and {{met for the first}} time in Sweden. Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: 'I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father.' He has said in an 2012 interview with PSG that: [...] "My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> has anything to do with football. I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome..." [...] In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was [...] "not a factor" [...] in fans' perception of him: [...] "For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic... For me it is all about respect. That's how I grew up and the way I learned to be. This is what I am." ...|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{its first}} year, the {{magazine}} changed its name for La Ilustración del Pacífico (Pacific Ocean Illustration). In the first issue of its second year, the editors wrote about all the issues they had to endure in the first year, and explained that they changed names because they were aimed for a broader audience since they were promised a lot of help and contributions when they first appeared, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> materialized and eventually the lost several sponsors due to the increasing costs generated by the economic crisis the country was undergoing at the time. The magazine was also criticized for its report about archbishop Ricardo Casanova y Estrada return -given the Positivism that ruled over the intellectuals at the time- and for publishing the financial situation of the country in 1897, which scared their readers. [...] The economic crisis affected the publisher as well, as the paper costs increased and some special paper needed for the photographs was heavily taxed by the government. [...] In spite of all these problems, they decided to continue because the magazine was used abroad to portray what was happening in Guatemala. [...] Ramón A. Salazar, a well known Guatemalan writer and politician, was the new editor in chief.|$|E

60|$|A {{step or two}} {{beyond the}} window there was nothing at all, except the {{enclosing}} buildings--chimneys upright, roofs horizontal; too much brick and building for a May night, perhaps. And then before one's eyes would come the bare hills of Turkey--sharp lines, dry earth, coloured flowers, and colour {{on the shoulders of}} the women, standing naked-legged in the stream to beat linen on the stones. The stream made loops of water round their ankles. <b>But</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> could show clearly through the swaddlings and blanketings of the Cambridge night. The stroke of the clock even was muffled; as if intoned by somebody reverent from a pulpit; as if generations of learned men heard the last hour go rolling through their ranks and issued it, already smooth and time-worn, with their blessing, {{for the use of the}} living.|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> gentle concern {{which usually}} characterises {{the daughters of}} Eve in their tending of each other; none of that freemasonry in fainting, by which they are {{generally}} bound together In a mysterious bond of sisterhood; was visible in Mrs Chick's demeanour. Rather like the executioner who restores the victim to sensation previous to proceeding with the torture (or was wont to do so, {{in the good old}} times for which all true men wear perpetual mourning), did Mrs Chick administer the smelling-bottle, the slapping on the hands, the dashing of cold water on the face, and the other proved remedies. And when, at length, Miss Tox opened her eyes, and gradually became restored to animation and consciousness, Mrs Chick drew off as from a criminal, and reversing the precedent of the murdered king of Denmark, regarded her more in anger than In sorrow.' ...|$|E

50|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that strategic systems are those information systems {{that may be}} used gaining competitive advantage. How is competitive advantage gained?.

50|$|Before Michael, {{finding a}} usable cadaver had been difficult, as indiscreet {{inquiries}} would cause talk, {{and it was}} impossible to tell a dead mans next of kin what the body was wanted for. The dead mans parents had died and no known relatives were found. The body was released on the condition that the mans real identity would never be revealed. Ewen Montagu later claimed the man died from pneumonia, and that the family had been contacted and permission obtained, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was true.|$|E
50|$|Other musicians {{performing}} at the concerts included Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, James Taylor, Carly Simon, Chaka Khan, The Doobie Brothers, Jesse Colin Young, Gil Scott-Heron, Tom Petty, Dan Fogelberg, Poco and others. The album No Nukes, and a film, also titled No Nukes, were both released in 1980 {{to document the}} performances. A full No Nukes concert featuring Browne and Crosby, Stills & Nash was also filmed near the beach in Ventura, California, at the Ventura County Fairgrounds, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> footage {{made it into the}} final cut.|$|E

2500|$|Minister for Justice and Law Reform Dermot Ahern, {{himself from}} Louth, made known his {{condemnation}} of the violence. He attended the match. Taoiseach Brian Cowen also made known his disapproval later from New York: [...] "I didn't see what happened as the ref was leaving the pitch. <b>But</b> obviously <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> is justified. It was an exciting match obviously. But it doesn't justify anyone engaging in <b>that</b> sort <b>of</b> activity. So I wouldn't {{like to see it}} repeated anywhere".

5000|$|Ganote {{had some}} trouble making {{contact with the}} bat in her rookie season, as she {{led the league in}} most strikeouts (60). She batted a low [...]133 average, but {{collected}} a [...]229 on-base percentage and stole 24 bases, while posting a pitching record of 4-6 with a solid 3.26 ERA. <b>But</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> really mattered, as she committed only 10 errors in 847 fielding chances at first base for a [...]988 fielding average to set a league single-season record. Her record remained intact until 1949, when Rockford Peaches' Dorothy Kamenshek set an all-time record with a [...]995 mark.|$|E
50|$|He {{attracted}} {{attention with}} the publication of his Evangelische Gespräch, a set of dialogue cantatas for the liturgical year in varied forms made up of solos, choruses and chorales. Another set of his works, the Evangelischer Blumengarten, is a group of motets and meditative choral songs. Among his solo songs are settings of odes by Andreas Gryphius, perhaps the only set of German Baroque songs that might be regarded as a cycle. At Darmstadt he produced several stage works, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> music has survived. His writing for voices is clear and eloquent, and his contrapuntal choruses are direct forerunners of those by Bach. His music enjoys an extraordinarily wide circulation throughout Germany and in Scandinavia, but is rarely heard outside of Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Bodacious has {{definitely}} become a legend to bull riding fans. His retirement was precipitated by {{his willingness to}} do anything to rid a rider from his back, including injuring them and sending them to the ER. He is the bull that rearranged Tuff Hedeman's face in 1995. He sent many riders to the emergency room. Some of these riders wore masks and helmets, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> helped. At 1,800 to 1,900 pounds, this bull is genuinely in the running for the most dangerous bull of all time. Tuff Hedeman once said [...] "even top-ranked guys who weren’t afraid of anything were definitely afraid of Bodacious." [...] Any ride that ended without an injury was a good ride, or a ride on Bodacious that ended injury free was a successful ride.|$|E
60|$|After supper {{they all}} {{gathered}} around the open fireplace of the hall, hung with its berries and evergreens in honour of the morrow. It was their unwritten law to form a fireside circle on Christmas Eve and tell each other what the year had brought them of good and ill, sorrow and joy. The circle was smaller by one {{than it had been}} the year before, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> spoke <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> There was a smile on every face and happiness in every voice.|$|R

50|$|Due to Washington, D.C.'s {{education}} system being built along neighborhood lines {{much of the}} segregation found in housing spills over into education. Another key influence for the city's racial segregation {{is a form of}} white flight where after the integration of schools in 1954 white parents pulled their kids out of district schools in favor of private schooling for their children. Boiling points were reached in 1967 on the issue of educational inequity in the district when multiple town hall meetings in low income black neighborhood turned into screaming matches between frustrated black parents and government representatives. Inequity was so bad that although two thirds of D.C.'s population was black, 92% of public school children were black. Striking statistics such as one out of three ninth grade public school students ending up graduating gave way to rising frustration from the black majority towards the white government and only gave way to louder and louder cries for home rule. The federal government granted $5.5 million under Title 1 of the American Secondary and Elementary Schools act <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> money went to majority black schools.|$|E
50|$|The Steelers and Vikings both {{finished}} 12-2, the Oilers {{just missed}} the playoffs at 10-4 and the 11-3 Raiders lost to Pittsburgh in the AFC Championship Game, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> was of any consolation to a franchise as proud as the Browns. After 1974, the Browns were hoping that '75, {{in which the}} team went to orange pants and altered its basic uniform design {{for the first time}} since that inaugural season of 1946, would usher in a new era of success. But it didn't work out that way. The problem for the Browns was that they were in the middle of a major rebuilding phase, trying to replace old-line, grizzled veterans from the team's glory days of the 1960s with free agents from other teams, or young players. Another problem was at the QB position; Mike Phipps, the Browns' No. 3 overall pick in the 1970 NFL Draft, threw just four touchdown passes with 19 INTs on the year. More and more, Browns fans were calling for Brian Sipe, who started in two victories in the final five games in 1974, to permanently secure the starting QB job in what became a major quarterback controversy.|$|E

The success of these franchises varies, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> matched <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the original SimCity. Maxis' hit The Sims is the only notable exception.|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Stupid Dream" [...] is {{actually}} only a short, 28 second instrumental {{piece of a}} tuning orchestra and sound effects. [...] "Slave Called Shiver", and [...] "Don't Hate Me", according to Wilson, are about feelings of [...] "unreturned love". He said of them, [...] "Slave Called Shiver's a very perverse love song, yeah. I mean, it's an unrequited love song. It's a love song with somebody who's obsessed with someone else, <b>but</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> affection is returned. It relates very closely to 'Don't Hate Me', which is a song again about someone who's obsessed with someone from afar. 'Don't Hate Me' is an even more extreme version, because here this person actually begins to follow and make phone calls and, you know, it becomes very unhealthy. 'Slave Called Shiver' is slightly less extreme. It's about someone who's {{very much in love}} and obsessed with somebody else. That love is not returned and so there's a slightly violent perverse undercurrent. 'Pure Narcotic' also is very much the same subject". [...] "Don't Hate Me" [...] featured the first use of saxophone in the music of Porcupine Tree, courtesy of Theo Travis. During live performances, the flute and saxophone solos are replaced by Barbieri's keyboard and Wilson guitar solos respectively.|$|E

[...] Critic Taran Adarsh gave a {{four out of}} five stars and noted [...] "On the whole, Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap is a must-watch for Bachchan fans. Even if you're not a fan of this iconic actor, watch it for a simple reason: They don't make them like Amitabh Bachchan anymore. A masala entertainer all the way. Bachchan is truly the Baap and this film reiterates this fact yet again. His character, his attitude and the dialogue he delivers will remain etched in your memory for a long, long time. Prakash Raj is super. In fact, it's a treat to watch powerful actors like Bachchan and Prakash Raj embroiled in a confrontation." ...|$|E
