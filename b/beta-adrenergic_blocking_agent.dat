40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} {{effects of}} the <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agent,</b> sotalol, have been assessed {{in a group of}} patients with heart disease. There was a significant reduction in heart rate and cardiac output, but stroke volume was unchanged. Systemic arterial andpulmonary artery pressures were not significantly altered. Indices of mryocardial function (dp/dt max and V max) were also significantly reduced. Though previous studies have reported that sotalol is devoid of myocardial depression associ-ated with other beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, these results suggest that sotalol has both a nega-tive chronotropic and a lesser negative inotropic action. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs are now widely used in clinical cardiology.

40|$|<b>Beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents</b> differ {{considerably}} in {{their effects on}} myocardial excitable properties. The possibility that intrinsic sympathomimetic activity might contribute to such differences has not been adequately explored. This study examined the influence of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity on the electrophysiologic effects of three agents {{with varying degrees of}} such activity. Intravenous propranolol (0. 5 mg/kg), oxprenolol (0. 5 mg/kg) and pindolol (0. 05 mg/kg) were administered in 16 anesthetized dogs. The effects of the drugs on ventricular vulnerability were studied over a 2 hour period. Propranolol and oxprenolol raised the ventricular fibrillation threshold by 42 and 56 %, respectively. In contrast, pindolol resulted in an elevation of only 25 %. After depletion of endogenous norepinephrine stores using reserpine, pindolol led to a decrease of the ventricular fibrillation threshold, which was reversed by propranolol.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Heart {{failure is}} {{associated}} with high mortality and hospital readmissions. <b>Beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents,</b> angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can improve survival and reduce hospital readmissions and are recommended as first-line therapy {{in the treatment of}} heart failure. Evidence has also shown that there is a dose-dependent relationship of these medications with patient outcomes. Despite this evidence, primary care physicians are reluctant to up-titrate these medications. New strategies aimed at facilitating this up-titration are warranted. Nurse-led titration (NLT) is one such strategy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of NLT of <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents,</b> ACEIs, and ARBs in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in terms of safety and patient outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL Issue 11 of 12, 19 / 12 / 2014), MEDLINE OVID (1946 to November week 3 2014), and EMBASE Classic and EMBASE OVID (1947 to 2014 week 50). We also searched reference lists of relevant primary studies, systematic reviews, clinical trial registries, and unpublished theses sources. We used no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NLT of <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents,</b> ACEIs, and/or ARBs comparing the optimisation of these medications by a nurse to optimisation by another health professional in patients with HFrEF.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{analysis}} was performed to assess whether <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> use is associated with reduced mortality in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) and to determine if this relationship is altered by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor use. BACKGROUNDThe ability of beta-blockers to alter mortality in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction is not well defined. Furthermore, the effect of beta-blocker use, {{in addition to an}} ACE inhibitor, on these patients has not been fully addressed. METHODSThis retrospective analysis evaluated the association of baseline beta-blocker use with mortality in 4, 223 mostly asymptomatic Prevention trial patients, and 2, 567 symptomatic Treatment trial patients. RESULTSThe 1, 015 (24 %) Prevention trial patients and 197 (8 %) Treatment trial patients receiving beta-blockers had fewer symptoms, higher ejection fractions and different use of medications than patients not receiving beta-blockers. On univariate analysis, beta-blocker use was associated with significantly lower mortality than nonuse in both trials. Moreover, a synergistic reduction in mortality with use of both a beta-blocker and enalapril was suggested in the Prevention trial. After adjusting for important prognostic variables with Cox multivariate analysis, the association of <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> use with reduced mortality remained significant for Prevention trial patients receiving enalapril. Lower rates of arrhythmic and pump failure death and risk of death or hospitalization for heart failure were observed.

This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the long-term effects of combination therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agent</b> on the relation between the decrease in arterial pressure at rest and during exercise and the decrease in left ventricular mass. Background. A variety of antihypertensive drugs including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce ventricular hypertrophy, although little is known about combination therapy and the time course of such a reduction. Methods. Twenty-one patients with previously untreated essential hypertension were treated with a low dose combination of 50 mg of atenolol and 10 mg of enalapril once daily for 39 months. Cardiovascular findings were assessed by two-dimensionally guided M-mode echocardiography in the pretreatment phase and after 6 and 39 months of combination therapy. Results.

40|$|Acute {{hypoxemia}} {{produced by}} the inhalation of 8 % and 5 % oxygen increased cardiac output in intact anesthetized dogs by 38 % and 62 %, respectively. Although practolol, a cardioselective <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agent,</b> reduced the increase in cardiac output in dogs subjected to severe hypoxemia (5 % O 2 breathing) from 62 % to 43 %, it only slightly reduced the cardiac output rise in dogs subjected to moderate hypoxemia (8 % O 2 breathing). Splenectomy, on the other hand, abolished the increase in cardiac output produced by moderate hypoxemia except for a small initial rise, but it reduced the increase in cardiac output during severe hypoxemia only to 37 %. The entire increase, except for a small initial rise, disappeared only when splenectomized dogs were pretreated with practolol. Sham operation {{did not affect the}} cardiac output response to hypoxemia.

40|$|The {{role played}} by postsynaptic alpha-adrenergic receptors in the {{stimulation}} of pineal N-acetyltransferase (EC 2. 3. 1. 5) and [3 H]melatonin production was investigated in the rat. In vivo studies indicated that phenylephrine, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, potentiated and prolonged the effects of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist. Similar observations were made in organ culture with glands devoid of functional nerve endings. In addition, a combination of 1 microM prazosin, an alpha 1 -adrenergic blocking agent, and 1 microM propranolol, a <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agent,</b> was many times more potent then either agent alone in blocking the stimulatory effects of norepinephrine on N-acetyltransferase activity and [3 H]melatonin production. These findings establish that norepinephrine acting through alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors stimulates rat pineal N-acetyltransferase activity and, as a result, the production of melatonin. Apparently, beta-adrenergic activation is an absolute requirement, and an alpha-adrenergic receptor mechanism potentiates beta-adrenergic activation. These findings are significant because they demonstrate alpha-adrenergic potentiation of beta-adrenergic effects. In addition, they indicate that the widely held belief that melatonin production is regulated exclusively by a postsynaptic beta-adrenergic mechanism must be revised...|$|E

Continued advances in medical and surgical techniques, combined with effective and focused programs in cardiac rehabilitation, are critical to reduce the overall incidence of coronary artery diseases. Now it is recommended that all survivors of acute myocardial infarction receive antiplatelet drugs, <b>beta-adrenergic</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>agents,</b> ACE inhibitors and statins. However, studies show that the ratio of prescribing these drugs is far lower than ideal. This study has been designed to evaluate these ratios in Iran. Methods- In a descriptive, cross-sectional retrograde study, the ratio of prescribing the above-mentioned drugs in 912 randomly selected patients from Shiraz University hospitals who met WHO criteria for myocardial infarction from March 2000 to March 2001 were studied. Trained medical students recorded demographical data, location of infarction, risk factors and pharmacologic therapy at the time of the discharge of the patients from the medical recording files in a standardized questionnaire.
