5|$|Gilbert Pinfold is an English novelist of repute {{who at the}} age of 50 {{can look}} <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> varied life that has {{included}} a dozen reasonably successful books, wide travel, and honourable service in the Second World War.

5|$|The Buccaneers almost {{exceeded}} their worst-ever loss, a 42–0 {{loss to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers, on its 10th anniversary. They {{were shut}} out until the fourth quarter, and only scored when Chicago Bears safety Todd Bell intercepted a Steve Young pass and lateraled it to Mike Richardson, who attempted to lateral it to Shaun Gayle, only to have Tampa Bay receiver Vince Heflin intercept the lateral and run it in for a score. Mike Tomczak ran for the Bears' first score. Later, a Walter Payton touchdown was called <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> holding penalty. The Buccaneers stopped the Bears on fourth-and-1, but an offside penalty on Craig Swoope gave the Bears another chance. Tomczak fumbled, however, causing him to be benched in favor of Doug Flutie. Flutie scored two touchdowns, one passing and one running, before Tomczak returned in the second half. Tampa Bay scored a second time on Young's 14-yard pass to Calvin Magee, but Lew Barnes returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. Magee's 143 receiving yards remain (as of 2009) the Buccaneers' single-game record for a tight end.|$|E

The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} {{thirteen}} weeks {{as a professional}} football player, Hester recorded six return touchdowns, including a punt return in his NFL debut, and a then-record tying 108-yard touchdown from a missed field goal against the New York Giants. He also returned a punt for a clutch 83-yard game-winning touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals to give the Bears the lead in a comeback win, and two kickoff returns in one game against the St. Louis Rams. Following his record-breaking game during Week 14, opposing teams exercised additional caution when allowing Hester to return kicks. During the postseason Hester ran back a punt at a critical moment against the Seattle Seahawks, but it was called <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> blocking penalty. Regardless, the Bears won both NFC playoffs rounds, and advanced to Super Bowl XLI to play the Indianapolis Colts. He started the game on a high note for the Bears by returning the game’s opening kick for a touchdown. The feat was the first touchdown return of an opening kickoff in Super Bowl history. It also marked the quickest touchdown scored in Super Bowl history {{as well as the}} quickest lead ever taken by any team, though the latter record has since been surpassed by the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII. Following the kick, the Colts did not kick the ball directly to Hester, significantly limiting the Bears’ return efforts.|$|E
