5|$|The {{unpressurized}} rotodome is 30feet (9.1m) in diameter, {{six feet}} (1.8m) thick at the center, and is held 11feet (3.4m) above the fuselage by two struts. It is tilted {{down at the}} front to reduce its aerodynamic drag, which lessens its detrimental effect on take-offs and endurance (which is corrected electronically by both the radar and secondary surveillance radar antenna phase shifters). The rotodome uses <b>bleed</b> <b>air,</b> outside cooling doors, and fluorocarbon based cold plate cooling to maintain the electronic and mechanical equipment temperatures. The hydraulically rotated antenna system permits the Westinghouse Corporation's AN/APY-1 and AN/APY-2 passive electronically scanned array radar system to provide surveillance from the Earth's surface up into the stratosphere, over land or water.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf Air Force Base crashed, {{killing the}} pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were {{restricted}} to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash {{was attributed to}} a <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> system malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system. Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement handle of the emergency oxygen system was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bleed</b> <b>air</b> {{is used on}} many {{aircraft}} systems {{because it}} is easily available, reliable, and a potent source of power. For example, <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> from an airplane engine is used to start the remaining engines.

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} has been developed for a fully hydrated and isothermal PEM fuel cell. Mass transport in the gas flow channels, electrode backing and catalyst layers is accounted for, along with the adsorption, desorption and electro-oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Additionally, the heterogeneous catalysis of hydrogen and carbon monoxide with oxygen is included for the simulation of oxygen or <b>air</b> <b>bleeding.</b> The model prediction agrees well with published, experimental data at various temperatures, pressures and carbon monoxide concentrations. Simulations with oxygen and <b>air</b> <b>bleeding</b> indicate that a threshold amount of oxygen or <b>air</b> <b>bleeding</b> exists; any increase {{in the amount of}} bleeding above the threshold amount results in no further mitigation of CO poisoning. The threshold amount of oxygen or <b>air</b> <b>bleeding</b> is a function of cell current density, with a greater cell current density demanding a larger threshold amount of oxygen or <b>air</b> <b>bleeding.</b> <b>air</b> bleeding; carbon monoxide poisoning; mathematical model; oxygen bleeding; PEM fuel cell. ...|$|R

Although these may be rare, <b>bleeding,</b> <b>air</b> obstruction, damage to the larynx, change of voice, infection, impaired swallowing and permanent scars may occur. This is why the procedure is only performed in case of emergency.Vessels such as the carotid arteries or internal jugular veins could also be damaged if the incision and penetration of the blade is not accurate, with a higher risk in children and obese patients.|$|R

25|$|In some engines, <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is also {{tapped to}} provide power for accessories, {{as well as}} a {{mechanical}} shaft drive. <b>Bleed</b> <b>air</b> is particularly useful when a source of compressed air is specifically needed, either to pressurise cabin air, or as a supply of cooling air to other components (to avoid excess heat, this is taken for a low-pressure tapping, or from the LP compressor of a two-shaft engine). One important use for <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is for cross-starting of other engines in a multi-engine aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The APU (auxiliary power unit) {{does not}} need to supply <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> when the main engines are not operating. Aerodynamics are {{improved}} {{due to the lack of}} <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> vent holes on the wings. By driving cabin air supply compressors at the minimum required speed, no energy wasting modulating valves are required. High-temperature, high-pressure air cycle machine (ACM) packs can be replaced with low temperature, low-pressure packs to increase efficiency. At cruise altitude, where most aircraft spend the majority of their time and burn the majority of their fuel, the ACM packs can be bypassed entirely, saving even more energy. Since no <b>bleed</b> <b>air</b> is taken from the engines for the cabin, the potential of engine oil contamination of the cabin air supply is eliminated.|$|E
50|$|Compressor types used in {{turbojets}} {{were typically}} axial or centrifugal. Early turbojet compressors had low pressure ratios {{up to about}} 5:1. Aerodynamic improvements including splitting the compressor into two separately rotating parts, incorporating variable blade angles for entry guide vanes and stators, and <b>bleeding</b> <b>air</b> from the compressor enabled later turbojets to have overall pressure ratios of 15:1 or more. For comparison, modern civil turbofan engines have overall pressure ratios of 44:1 or more. After leaving the compressor, the air enters the combustion chamber.|$|R
50|$|During a slam-acceleration from a mid-throttle setting, the {{compressor}} working line will move rapidly towards surge {{and then slowly}} approach the steady state operating point, further up the map. The reverse effect occurs during a slam-deceleration. These effects are caused by the sluggish response of the spool (i.e. inertia effects) to rapid changes in engine fuel flow. Compressor surge is a particular problem during slam-accelerations and can be overcome by suitable adjustments to the fueling schedule and/or use of blow-off (<b>bleeding</b> <b>air</b> off {{the compressor}}, for handling purposes).|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of polymer {{electrolyte}} {{fuel cell}} tolerance to CO impurities {{would allow the}} use of lower quality hydrogen, thus reducing the costs without compromising fuel cell performance. In this work, the effect of carbon monoxide is mitigated by combining different methods, including <b>air</b> <b>bleed,</b> varying the anode flow rate and using a state-of-the-art Pt-Ru catalyst at two operating temperatures. The tolerance was investigated by feeding a novel arrangement of segmented cells with hydrogen containing carbon monoxide less than 20 ppm. Anode exhaust gas was constantly analysed using a gas chromatograph. It was discovered that increasing the volumetric flow rate of hydrogen and especially utilising ruthenium in the catalyst enhance the carbon monoxide tolerance. When applying the <b>air</b> <b>bleed,</b> an oxygen/CO molar ratio of at least 117 was required to stop the poisoning with a platinum catalyst. Approximately {{a fifth of the}} <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> needed with platinum was enough with Pt-Ru. The results also suggest that when applying <b>air</b> <b>bleed</b> at elevated temperatures, it is beneficial to lower the cell temperature {{for the duration of the}} <b>air</b> <b>bleed...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Bleed</b> <b>air</b> {{systems have}} been in use for several decades in {{passenger}} jets.

50|$|Although most {{patients}} tolerate bronchoscopy well, {{a brief period}} of observation is required after the procedure. Most complications occur early and are readily apparent {{at the time of the}} procedure. The patient is assessed for respiratory difficulty (stridor and dyspnea resulting from laryngeal edema, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm). Monitoring continues until the effects of sedative drugs wear off and gag reflex has returned. If the patient has had a transbronchial biopsy, doctors may take a chest x-ray to rule out any air leakage in the lungs (pneumothorax) after the procedure. The patient will be hospitalized if there occurs any <b>bleeding,</b> <b>air</b> leakage (pneumothorax), or respiratory distress.|$|R
50|$|Remote vehicle {{disabling}} systems provide users at remote locations {{the ability}} to prevent an engine from starting, prevent movement of a vehicle, and to stop or slow an operating vehicle.
