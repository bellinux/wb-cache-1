40|$|Seated {{work has}} been shown to be a risk factor for low-back pain. This is {{attributed}} to the prolonged and monotonous low-level mechanical load imposed by a seated posture. To evaluate the potential health effects with respect to the low back of office chairs with a movable seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest,</b> trunk kinematics, erector spinae EMG, spinal shrinkage and local discomfort were assessed in 10 subjects performing simulated office work (word processing, computer-aided design and reading). Three chairs were used, one with a fixed seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> and two dynamic chairs, one with a seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> movable in a fixed ratio with respect to each other, and one with a freely movable seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest.</b> Spinal shrinkage measurements showed a larger stature gain when working on the two dynamic chairs as compared with working on the chair with fixed seat and <b>back</b> <b>rest.</b> Trunk kinematics and erector spinae EMG were strongly affected by the task performed but not by the chair type. The results imply that dynamic office chairs offer a potential advantage over fixed chairs, but the effects of the task on the indicators of trunk load investigated were more pronounced than the effects of the chair...|$|R
50|$|First {{assembled}} in Australia August 1965, the model prefix was YHGN8 model, with assembly numbering continuing {{on from the}} Mk3 series. 800 Mk3a Sprites were assembled. Australian Sprites had a chrome waist line strip that was only applied to Midgets overseas. Wire wheels were supplied as standard equipment in Australia. Car seats changed from the earlier curved <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> to the flat <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> (Mk3 Midget style) some time during the Mk3a Sprite production run.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} two seats {{were used by}} workers having shared and workers having owned work spaces. 51 {{subjects}} (22 female, 29 male) participated in a six week experiment in a naturalistic setting. The chairs were different with respect to adjustability options, design of controls and external design. Most of the subjects adjusted the office chairs {{the first time for}} seat height, arm <b>rest</b> height and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> inclination. Adjustment times of seat height and armrest height were shorter for chair A. <b>Back</b> <b>rest</b> pressure adjustment takes much time {{and it is difficult to}} adjust this without instruction. The workers having shared desks adjust their chair more often and are faster in the adjustment of the backrest pressure compared with workers with an owned work space. The quality of adjustments of seat height, arm <b>rest</b> and <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> pressure was improved by an instruction for 32 % of the subjects...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of four methods of {{stabilization}} on maximal reciprocal isokinetic knee extension and flexion. Left knee extension/flexion was tested at 60 °/s in 20 subjects. Warm-up consisted of five submaximal and one maximal effort followed by three maximal efforts in each of four randomized stabilization conditions: 1) Hands and back stabilization; the trunk was strapped to the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> and the hands grasped the seat. 2) Back stabilization; the trunk was strapped to the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> and the hands were folded across the chest. 3) Hand stabilization; the hands grasped the seat and the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> was removed. 4) No stabilization; the hands were folded across the chest and the <b>back</b> <b>rest</b> was removed. One-way repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of stabilization for knee extension (F(3, 57) = 17. 44, p=. 0001) and knee flexion (F(3, 57) = 5. 37, p=. 002). Paired, two-tailed student's t-tests with Bonferroni correction showed that, in knee extension, no stabilization was significantly less than all others, p<. 001. In addition, back stabilization was less than hands and back stabilization, p<. 005. In knee flexion, no stabilization was significantly less than all others, p<. 01. In conclusion, the method of trunk stabilization significantly affected maximal reciprocal isokinetic knee extension/flexion strength measurements. Maximal knee extension/flexion torque production was achieved when the trunk was strapped to the back support and when the hands grasped the seat...|$|R

40|$|Background: Hemodynamic {{control was}} {{compared}} {{in patients with}} mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild Alzheimer's dementia (AD) {{as well as in}} healthy elderly subjects. Methods: Noninvasive, continuous hemodynamic recordings were obtained from 14 patients and 48 controls during supine <b>rest</b> (<b>tilt</b> of 30 and 70 °). Cardiac output, end-diastolic volume, total peripheral resistance, heart rate variability (HRV), systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV), and baroreceptor sensitivity were calculated. Results: At 70 ° tilt, the HRV indices differed significantly, with higher high-frequency (HF) variability as well as lower low-frequency (LF) variability and LF/HF ratios in the patients. The patients had significantly lower SBPV in the LF range at 30 ° tilt. Conclusions: The results indicate a poorer sympathetic response to orthostatic stress in MCI and mild AD...|$|R
