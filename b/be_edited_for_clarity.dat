The {{exhibition}} was a survey of contemporary Indigenous art from Australia, exploring {{the ways in which}} time is embedded within Indigenous artistic, social, historical, and philosophical life. The exhibition included more than seventy works drawn from public and private collections in Australia and the United States, and featured many works that have never been seen outside Australia. Everywhen is Gilchrist’s second major exhibition in the United States, following Crossing Cultures: The Owen and Wagner Collection of Contemporary Aboriginal Australian Art at the Hood Museum of Art in 2012. Conducted on April 22, 2016, this conversation considers the position of Indigenous art in the museum, and the active ways in which curators and institutions can work to “indigenize” their institutions.

For a uniformly random sorting network, we establish {{existence of a}} local limit {{of the process of}} space-time locations of transpositions in a neighbourhood of an for a∈[0, 1] as n→∞. Here time is scaled by a factor of 1 /n and space is not scaled. The limit is a swap process U on Z. We show that U is stationary and mixing with respect to the spatial shift and has time-stationary increments. Moreover, the only dependence on a is through time scaling by a factor of √(a(1 -a)).

In 2012, a panel debated the following topic: “Resolved: Health Information Exchange Organizations Should Shift Their Principal Focus to Consumer-Mediated Exchange in Order to Facilitate the Rapid Development of Effective, Scalable, and Sustainable Health Information Infrastructure. ” Those supporting the proposition {{emphasized the need}} for consumer-controlled community repositories of electronic health records (health record banks) to address privacy, stakeholder cooperation, scalability, and sustainability.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{interview}} with Donald Super focuses on life stages, determinants, role of career counselors, matching vs. developmental emphasis, multicultural and women's issues, current applications of theory, and {{a comment on}} future directions. SF: Dr. Super, could you start out talking about how you see career development today and your perspective on your past work in career development? DS: Part of my perspective is that the term "career development" did not even exist 40 years ago. Then {{the focus was on}} vocational choice almost {{as though it were a}} one-shot thing. You know, you get married (to an occupation) and live happily ever after. Well, that's not true of career development any more than it is of other things. So what we've been learning is the fact that careers really evolve over the years—they emerge from a person's experience. That obviously has demanded a lot of research time. It has created controversies. It has been a rather exciting field. And today I think we're reaching a consensus point. SF: In the past some have commented that your theory was seg-mental. Do you feel that is something that is progressing more to-ward a synthesis? DS: I called it segmental myself, I think, before anyone else did. Others may have called it fragmented, not quite as favorable a term. But the notion was that a theory of anything as complex as career development has to have many aspects, many facets or many seg-ments, which are parts of a whole.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} Participant-driven Group Support System (PD-GSS) framework. This framework presents an approach for Group Support System (GSS) designers to accommodate distributed or asynchronous groups {{through the use}} ofdifferent technologies and processes than traditional GSS. The goal of the PD-GSS framework is to further involve the collaborativeparticipants during the workflow {{in an effort to}} reduce the load on the meetingfacilitator. As the name implies, it is the participants that are increasingly responsiblefor conducting and executing the required actions during a collaborative processes. Thesystem empowers the participants in the meeting to conduct the meeting themselves,reducing the need for a dedicated facilitator to guide the process. One of the modules from the PD-GSS framework, Peer-reviewed Brainstorming,was developed into a prototype and tested experimentally. This module requires eachbrainstorming idea to be routed through a peer-review process whereby the originalbrainstorming idea <b>is</b> <b>edited</b> <b>for</b> <b>clarity</b> and completeness. The goal of this new moduleis {{to reduce the number of}} low quality, noisy comments while increasing the quantity ofhigh quality comments. Ten six-person groups participated in the first experiment. Five groups wereplaced in a traditional electronic brainstorming GSS while the other five groups wereplaced in the peer-review treatment. The results indicate that the peer-review processdid control the brainstorming process, yielding a higher percentage of validbrainstorming ideas. The second module examined was the categorization module, allowing groups towork autonomously to identify similar ideas that should be grouped together in the samecategory or bucket. This new approach to the categorization of brainstorming ideasenables groups to work independently, asynchronously, and anonymously to organizethe brainstorming input. An existing GSS, ThinkTank by GroupSystems, was utilized. Eighty-one groupswere used in the second experiment to test the ability of groups to work independently,without a facilitator, in an attempt to organize brainstorming ideas. The groups workingsynchronously outperformed the groups working in a mock asynchronous setting. Likewise, the groups that had to categorize the fewest number of brainstorming ideasreceived the highest performance measures...|$|R

40|$|In Pope Francis’ Encyclical on the environment, Laudato Si’, {{the leader}} of the Catholic church {{presents}} a moral argument for combating climate change and other environmental harm. As he has done throughout his papacy, the Pope highlights concerns about economic disparity, arguing that climate change disproportionally impacts developing nations and the world’s poor. Along with critiques of “consumerism” and the modern economic system, the Pope expressed deep skepticism about the motives and impacts of market mechanisms as emissions reduction tools. The Pope is not the first to challenge the ethics of market-based systems of environmental protection. Critics have argued that buying and selling pollution rights removes the moral stigma of pollution and that inequity is built into the system by allowing the rich to buy their way out of pollution reduction regimes. Others have worried that market systems can create pollution hotspots. But many others in the environmental community, particularly in the United States, have come to see market-based mechanisms as a potent, cost-effective, and morally and legally defensible way to achieve pollution reduction goals. On October 1, 2015, the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) convened an expert panel to discuss the Pope’s position, its bearing on global efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and how market-based methods of pollution control serve, or fail to serve, sustainability goals.

40|$|Writing {{is one of}} the macro-skills {{that can}} be {{developed}} through practice and enough exposures of individuals to the field of their interests. This skill can also be identified in the so-called theses as outputs presented by the authors—either students or practitioners of any field. According to Bitchener [1], “Writing an empirically based thesis requires a clear understanding of what is expected or required for each part or section” (p. 1). However, there are still some unpublished theses under criticism as manifested in the negative feedback or reactions of both general and specialized audience based on the quality in general, and on the clarity of thoughts in particular. In thesis, a good facility of the English language is indeed significant which makes the individual reader easily understand the flow of the ideas of any topic covered in the study. This paper aims to determine and analyze the linguistic features frequently used in theses of teacher education students at Batangas State University-JPLPC Campus, Malvar, Batangas in the academic year 2013 - 2014. The linguistic features used in any of the parts of theses have been observed to determine its clarity in terms of form, use, and meaning, namely: present and past tenses, present perfect tense, passive and active voices, citations and qualifications, and commentary have been the main focus of this study. Based on the analysis and interpretation of the data coded and classified, results reveal that almost all of the concepts in the introduction of theses are certainly lifted and copied as indicated in the authors’ incorrect and improper citations. Theses read and coded appear {{to be a little more}} one percent use of qualifications which denotes discredits of points regarding the issue or concepts reviewed as reflected in the students’ strong claim for the said concepts.
