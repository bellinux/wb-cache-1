40|$|The {{nature and}} source of {{evolutionary}} trends in complexity {{is difficult to}} assess from the fossil record, and the driven vs. passive nature of such trends has been debated for decades. There are also questions about how effectively artificial life software can evolve increasing levels of complexity. We extend our previous work demonstrating an evolutionary increase in an information theoretic measure of neural complexity in an artificial life system (Polyworld), and introduce a new technique for distinguishing driven from passive trends in complexity. Our experiments show that evolution can and does select for complexity increases in a driven fashion, in some circumstances, but under other conditions it can also select for complexity stability. It is suggested that the evolution of complexity is entirely driven [...] -just not in a single direction [...] -at the scale of species. This leaves open the question of evolutionary trends at larger scales. Comment: 8 pages; In <b>Bullock,</b> <b>S.</b> et al. eds.

Various attempts at such games have been made, both commercially and as research projects, but the set of studied game mechanics that are both entertaining and provide beneficial exercise are relatively small. In our work, a game mechanic was designed for a floor-based input controller (DDR Pad). Rather than the standard mechanic usually employed for this device, our approach allows the player to explore a virtual world, requiring exertive movements on the input device in order to progress.
