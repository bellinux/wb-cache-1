The United States, a member of the U.N., subsequently committed ground forces to the Korean Peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing.|$|E
5|$|The {{resolution}} {{called on}} the North to immediately halt its invasion and to move its troops back to the 38th parallel.

5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of the South Korea <b>by</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> on June 25, 1950, the UN voted to use force to defend South Korea. The United States, a member of the UN, simultaneously committed ground forces to the Korean peninsula with the goal of pushing back the North Korean invasion and preventing South Korea from collapsing. But US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest force was the 24th Infantry Division, headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Nevertheless, the 24th was ordered to South Korea.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of similar balloon propaganda campaigns launched <b>by</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> to South Korea; however, campaigns on the Korean Peninsula primarily target North Korea.

Iran and <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> pledge cooperation in educational, scientific, and cultural spheres, as well as cooperating in the nuclear program of Iran. The United States has been greatly concerned <b>by</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> arms deals with Iran, which started during the 1980s with <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> acting as a third party in arms deals between the Communist bloc and Iran, as well as selling domestically produced weapons to Iran, and <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> continues selling missile and nuclear technology to Iran. <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> and Iran are the remaining two members of George W.

25|$|A 13-year-old {{junior high}} school student from Niigata, Megumi Yokota, was kidnapped <b>by</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> on November 15, 1977.

In 2002, North Korea admitted to kidnapping 13 Japanese citizens during the 1970s and 1980s, {{in order to train}} spies to infiltrate U.S. military installations in Japan. Five people have been released, but the North Korean government claimed that there were eight dead. Japan has pressed for the return of the bodies. However, the Japanese government believes that there are still kidnapped Japanese citizens being held captive in North Korea. North Korea's official statement is that the issue has been settled. Because of the overwhelming number of South Koreans also kidnapped <b>by</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> there have been some joint efforts by South Korea and Japan to retrieve their citizens. The issue remains unresolved, however Japan has insisted on an explanation of what happened to their citizens as a precondition for normalizing relations with North Korea.|$|E

However, Pulgasari does not feature Choi, and it was the last film directed by Shin before he and Choi escaped to the United States.|$|R
