The main aim of this research study is an increasing of the adaptive control quality <b>by</b> <b>using</b> of <b>the</b> factorable methods {{which are based on}} the fact that many nonlinear systems can be factorized into the linear and the nonlinear parts. The factorization of the nonlinear system into the nonlinear static part and the linear dynamic part is assumed in this paper. The transfer function of the linear dynamic part of the nonlinear system is assumed in the time-discrete second-order Z-model form. Its parameters are estimated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>using</b> of <b>the</b> time-discrete leastsquares method with the directive forgetting. The estimated parameters of the linear dynamic part are <b>used</b> for <b>the</b> design of the linear time-discrete control system, which is represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> two-degree of freedom control system configuration (2 DOF). The resulting controller is derived <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>using</b> of <b>the</b> polynomial approach and the characteristic polynomial of the closed control loop is chosen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>using</b> of <b>the</b> optimal LQ approach and Pole Placemen Method (PPM).

When utilized, color fixation using CO occurs prior to the vacuum sealing of tuna steaks for storage. In Japan, color fixation using CO is prohibited.|$|E
