40|$|Quality Function Deployment (QFD), as a customer-driven tool, is {{generally}} {{used in the}} early phase of new or improved products/services design process, and therefore most of the input parameters are highly subjective in nature. The five major input components of the QFD, which are laid in the House of Quality (HOQ), namely, the customer requirement, the technical attribute, the relationship matrix, the correlation matrix, and the <b>benchmarking</b> <b>information,</b> {{play a central role}} in determining the success of QFD team. Accurate numerical judgment representations are of high importance for the QFD team to fill in the values of each of those components.

In particular, with respect to a rapidly changing market, the incorporation of the new product development risk, the competitors’ <b>benchmarking</b> <b>information,</b> and the feedback information into the network model may be considered as a novel contribution in QFD literature.

40|$|Abstract. Although {{regarded}} as one of the most successful algorithm to identify predictive features, Relief is quite vulnerable to outliers and noisy features. The recently proposed I-Relief algorithm addresses such deficiencies by using an iterative optimization scheme. Effective as it is, I-Relief is rather time-consuming. This paper presents an efficient alter-native that significantly enhances the ability of Relief to handle outliers and strongly redundant noisy features. Our method can achieve compara-ble performance as I-Relief and has a close-form solution, hence requires much less running time. Results on <b>benchmark</b> <b>information</b> retrieval tasks confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. ...|$|E
