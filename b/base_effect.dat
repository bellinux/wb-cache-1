50|$|Low <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> in {{business}} and economics is the tendency of a small absolute change from a low initial amount to be translated into a large percentage change.|$|E
50|$|An {{illustration}} of the <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> would be like: Price Index 100 goes to 150, and then to 200. The initial increase of 50, gives the percentage increase as 50% but the subsequent increase of 50 gives the percentage increase as 33.33%. This happens arithmetically as the base on which the percentage is calculated has increased from 100 to 150.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Base</b> <b>effect</b> {{relates to}} {{inflation}} in the corresponding {{period of the}} previous year, if the inflation rate was too low in the corresponding period of the previous year, even a smaller rise in the Price Index will arithmetically give {{a high rate of}} inflation now. On the other hand, if the price index had risen at a high rate in the corresponding period of the previous year and recorded high inflation rate, a similar absolute increase in the Price index now will show a lower inflation rate now.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} revenue and <b>base</b> <b>effects</b> of local {{property}} and business tax hikes using a natural {{experiment in the}} German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). Due to a reform of the local equalization scheme in 2003, a set of municipalities in NRW increased their local tax rates by one to two percentage points while the remaining municipalities kept their rates constant. Using this variation across municipalities and over time to implement a difference-in-differences design covering the period 1995 - 2010, I find that property tax hikes have a revenue elasticity of unity and no adverse <b>base</b> <b>effects.</b> Business tax hikes have no discernible <b>base</b> <b>effects</b> but also no statistically significant effect on revenues. Furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} the tax hikes have no effect on broader economic outcomes such as local employment, firms 4 wage bill, and property prices. Overall, increasing local tax rates by one to two percentage points does not seem to affect the local economy adversely...|$|R

5000|$|Measuring {{inflation}} {{in an economy}} requires objective means of differentiating changes in nominal prices on {{a common set of}} goods and services, and distinguishing them from those price shifts resulting from changes in value such as volume, quality, or performance. For example, if the price of a 10 oz. can of corn changes from $0.90 to $1.00 {{over the course of a}} year, with no change in quality, then this price difference represents inflation. This single price change would not, however, represent general {{inflation in}} an overall economy. To measure overall inflation, the price change of a large [...] "basket" [...] of representative goods and services is measured. This is the purpose of a price index, which is the combined price of a [...] "basket" [...] of many goods and services. The combined price is the sum of the weighted prices of items in the [...] "basket". A weighted price is calculated by multiplying the unit price of an item by the number of that item the average consumer purchases. Weighted pricing is a necessary means to measuring the impact of individual unit price changes on the economy's overall inflation. The Consumer Price Index, for example, uses data collected by surveying households to determine what proportion of the typical consumer's overall spending is spent on specific goods and services, and weights the average prices of those items accordingly. Those weighted average prices are combined to calculate the overall price. To better relate price changes over time, indexes typically choose a [...] "base year" [...] price and assign it a value of 100. Index prices in subsequent years are then expressed in relation to the base year price. While comparing inflation measures for various periods one has to take into consideration the <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> as well.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the {{fairness}} of performance evaluation procedure on job satisfaction. In particular, the study examined the following aspects: (1) the direct and indirect effects of fairness procedure on job satisfaction through outcome <b>based</b> <b>effect</b> (distributive fairness); and (2) direct and indirect effects of fairness procedure on job satisfaction through non-outcome <b>based</b> <b>effect</b> (trust in superior and organizational commitment). The study applied a survey method with the survey subject of regent and municipal civil servants of Lampung Province. Samples determination {{was based on a}} purposive sampling technique. The study collected 241 respondents, consisting of structural officers of Satuan Kerja Perangkat Daerah (SKPD) with service term at least one year at their office. Analysis on the data used a Structural Equation Model (SEM) operated under AMOS version 16. 0 application program. Results of the study concluded as the followings: a direct effect of fairness of performance evaluation procedure (KP) on distributive fairness (KD), trust in superior (KPP), and organizational commitment (KO). Such condition affected job satisfaction (KK). However, the direct effect of fairness performance evaluation procedure (KP) on job satisfaction (KK); and trust in superior (KPP) on job satisfaction (KK) proved insignificant. The results also showed an indirect effect fairness of performance evaluation procedure (KP) on job performance (KK) through two different processes, outcome <b>based</b> <b>effect</b> (distributive fairness) and non- outcome <b>based</b> <b>effect</b> (organizational commitment), but through trust in superior proved insignificant.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that dogs display a secure <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> similar to that found in human children (i. e., using the owner as a secure base for interacting with the environment). In children, this effect influences their daily lives and importantly also their performance in cognitive testing. Here, we investigate the importance of the secure <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> for dogs in a problem-solving task. Using a manipulative task, we tested dogs in three conditions, in which we varied the owner's presence and behavior (Experiment 1 : "Absent owner", "Silent owner", "Encouraging owner") and in one additional condition, in which the owner was replaced by an unfamiliar human (Experiment 2 : "Replaced owner"). We found that the dogs' duration of manipulating the apparatus was longer when their owner was present than absent, irrespective of the owner's behavior. The presence of an unfamiliar human however did not increase their manipulation. Furthermore, the reduced manipulation during the absence of the owner was not correlated with the dog's degree of separation distress scored in a preceding attachment experiment. Our study is the first to provide evidence for an owner-specific secure <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> in dogs that extends from attachment tests to other areas of dogs' lives and also manifests itself in cognitive testing - thereby confirming the remarkable similarity between the secure <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> in dogs and in human children.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{measurement}} of progressivity and the distributional effect of the Norwegian tax reform of 1992. Progressivity {{is measured by the}} degree of disproportionality, which implies that the burden of taxes is estimated when income units are ranked according to pre-tax incomes. The measure of disproportionality is decomposed to estimate the influence from different pa rts of the tax system on total disproportionality. For instance, the measure of the cont ribution from net taxes can be decomposed into a tax <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> and a tax rate effect. The results show that the degree of progressivity in the overall tax system, as measured here, has not been altered from 1991 to 1992, but the decomposition analysis reveals that the tax <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> is more dominant and the tax rate effect is less dominant after the reform...|$|E
40|$|Several recent {{papers on}} the {{political}} economy of growth have argued that increased income inequality induces more redistribution or public spending, which in turn chokes off private investment and growth. We show that public spending is not necessarily increasing in inequality when there is a class of individuals who cannot invest beyond the state-financed education, possibly due to the imperfection in capital market. We show that as inequality rises taxation can be less efficient in the sense that a given tax rate produces a smaller tax base. If this tax <b>base</b> <b>effect</b> outweighs the conventional political effect, then increasing inequality can induce less public spending and increase private investment.
