Antón was named {{as the leader of}} the squad, which included Nieve, Oroz, Isasi, Aramendía, Azanza, Cazaux, Sesma and Minguez to ride in support.

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{conflict}} resolution, the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons: the technique is recognized as clear, nice, provocable, and forgiving. Firstly, It is a clear and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it is considered to <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> as it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move. The strategy is also provocable because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is forgiving as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move.|$|E

25|$|British writer Arthur C. Benson felt shyness is {{not mere}} self-consciousness, but a {{primitive}} suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which {{needs to be}} uprooted. He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{the city}} of Amsterdam started a project to improve the red light {{district}} in the old city centre.

Noten called the project <b>Be</b> <b>nice</b> to a girl, buy her a ring and hoped it would improve the mutual respect between prostitutes and clients, and that it might even introduce a more romantic atmosphere in the red light district. Afterwards he offered the red rings, cased and numbered in a limited edition of 250 pieces, as true art objects for €310.00 each.|$|E
25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised that it would <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> {{if there was some}} way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, {{in a manner similar to}} the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E
