Players who bought {{this version of}} the game could gain early access to operators offered in the DLCs and receive several weapon skins. The game was also released alongside its Collector's Edition, which included the game's season pass, a hat, a compass and <b>bottle</b> <b>opener,</b> a backpack, and a 120-page guide. A Starter Edition was released on PC in June 2016, featuring all the maps, modes and weapons of the standard edition, and included two operators plus enough Rainbow 6 Credits to purchase two more of the player's choice (players could purchase the rest of the operators with Renown or Rainbow 6 Credits).

25|$|The {{weapon is}} {{fitted with a}} high-impact plastic {{handguard}} and pistol grip and a side-folding (folds to the right side) tubular steel skeleton stock. The rifle {{can be used with}} a sound suppressor. The weapon features a <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> in the front handguard and wire cutter built into the bipod. The <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> feature was included to prevent damage to magazines being used to open bottles, due to the large civilian reservist components of the IDF. Use of magazines to open bottles was a common source of magazine lip damage with Uzi submachine guns. Wire cutters were included to reduce the time necessary for IDF troops to cut down wire fences common to rural areas in Israel.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{distinct}} designs of such <b>bottle</b> <b>openers.</b> Wall mounted openers are typically found behind bars in pubs, whilst hand-tool <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> {{tend to be}} found and used in domestic environments. Whereas the functional elements of <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> (a tooth or lip to catch {{the underside of the}} cap, a fulcrum across which to exert the force that will remove the cap, and usually a lever for mechanical advantage) tend to be consistent (sometimes the lever is the bottle itself), their aesthetic design is subject to very great variety, and a great many decorative types are available.|$|R

25|$|Class 2: Resistance (or load) in the middle: {{the effort}} is applied {{on one side of}} the {{resistance}} and the fulcrum is located on the other side, for example, a wheelbarrow, a nutcracker, a <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> or the brake pedal of a car. Load arm is smaller than the effort arm. Mechanical advantage is always greater than 1. It is also called force multiplier lever.|$|E
25|$|Like {{most other}} things in Wolfe's life, his beer {{drinking}} is bound by ritual. Seated at his desk, Wolfe presses the button twice to ring for beer, and Fritz delivers the bottles unopened; Wolfe uncaps the bottles himself, using an 18-carat gold <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> {{given to him by}} a satisfied client. He never drinks directly from the bottle, but instead pours the beer into a glass and lets the foam settle to an appropriate level before drinking. He keeps the gold opener in the center drawer of his desk, where he also keeps the bottlecaps as a means of tracking his daily/weekly consumption.|$|E

A Bob and Doug McKenzie <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> was included in every DVD.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the films}} start with Egon coming out of jail and being enthusiastically welcomed by Benny and Kjeld. The three men will then have a beer {{together}} {{in the living room}} of Kjeld's dilapidated home in a run-down Valby neighbourhood, where Egon will inform his friends of his latest plan, usually (but not always) for making them millionaires. Plans are often two-step plans, where the first heist will get the equipment for the real, second plan. The plans usually feature everyday artefacts such as Lego, party balloons, cigarettes etc., which are then brought together in surprising ways in elaborate and well-timed plans, often including clever social engineering. Bennys main function in the heists, besides get-away-driver, is often as keeper of [...] "The Thing", a metal <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> used for manipulating most any machinery.|$|E

50|$|In {{recent years}} the <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> has taken many forms to appeal to young professionals. A few {{examples}} of the designer <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> include a surfboard shaped <b>bottle</b> <b>opener,</b> baseball cap with <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> in the visor, {{the inclusion of a}} <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> in the sole of a flip flop,in the form of a ring that can be worn, as part of a belt buckle, or in the different shapes for sports, a guitar, cowboy boot or car key. Recent improvements come with the invent of High Definition graphics with epoxy dome on chrome plated versions of the <b>bottle</b> <b>opener.</b> Novelty bottle openers became a popular promotional product for many beer brands {{with the advent of the}} surfboard <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> by Jim Wysopal from Openers Plus in California 1990.|$|E
50|$|Under most use, a <b>bottle</b> <b>opener</b> {{functions}} as a second-class lever: the fulcrum is {{the far end of}} the <b>bottle</b> <b>opener,</b> placed on the top of the crown, with the output at the near end of the <b>bottle</b> <b>opener,</b> on the crown edge, between the fulcrum and the hand: in these cases, one pushes up on the lever.|$|E

50|$|It {{is played}} as a rhythm {{instrument}} by stroking either <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> or spoons down it. Many of these instruments are home-made, but Don Landry of Louisiana is a renowned maker of frottoirs - or rub-boards {{as they are}} also known - making them for Clifton Chenier's band and Elvis Fontenot and the Sugar Bees, amongst others.|$|R
50|$|Chenier is {{credited}} with redesigning the wood and crimped tin washboard into the vest frottoir, an instrument that would easily hang from the shoulders. Cleveland Chenier, Clifton's older brother, also played in the Red Hot Louisiana Band. He found popularity {{for his ability to}} manipulate the distinctive sound of the frottoir by rubbing several <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> (held in each hand) along its ridges.|$|R
50|$|Today's bayonets {{are often}} {{multi-purpose}} knives {{such as the}} American M9 which is also an effective fighting knife or the Soviet AKM bayonet which was also a ground breaking survival knife {{that can be used}} as a wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. Some bayonets can also be used as utility knives, <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> or throwing knives. Also, issuing one modern multi-purpose bayonet/knife is obviously more cost effective than issuing separate specialty bayonets, field knives and combat knives.|$|R

50|$|While most lever-type <b>bottle</b> <b>openers</b> {{can be used}} {{in either}} configuration, the {{designed}} use can be determined if one of the edges is curved, in which case this edge is designed to sit {{in the middle of the}} crown, as the curve concentrates pressure, deforming the crown, and a curved edge does not connect with as much of the crown edge, hence being suboptimal and slipping more frequently if used to connect with the crown edge. This difference can be seen in comparing the traditional opener and contemporary bar blade at right.|$|R
