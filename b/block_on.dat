The team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 years. This 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City {{on the last day of}} the 2010–11 season, Hull losing the match 3–0.|$|E

5|$|Fifth Avenue roughly bisects Manhattan Island {{and acts}} as the {{demarcation}} line for east/west designations (e.g., East 27th Street, West 42nd Street); street addresses start at Fifth Avenue and increase heading away from Fifth Avenue, {{at a rate of}} 100 per <b>block</b> <b>on</b> most streets. South of Waverly Place, Fifth Avenue terminates and Broadway becomes the east/west demarcation line. Though the grid does start with 1st Street, just north of Houston Street (the southernmost street divided in west and east portions; pronounced HOW-stin), the grid does not fully take hold until north of 14th Street, where nearly all east-west streets are numerically identified, which increase from south to north to 220th Street, the highest numbered street on the island. Streets in Midtown are usually one-way, with the few exceptions generally being the busiest cross-town thoroughfares (14th, 23rd, 34th, and 42nd Streets, for example), which are bidirectional across the width of Manhattan Island. The rule of thumb is that odd-numbered streets run west, while even-numbered streets run east.|$|E

5|$|Leeds Dock was {{originally}} a large timber dock, situated {{between the city}} centre and Hunslet. Decades of industrial decline left the dock obsolete. The opening of the Royal Armouries Museum in 1996 began the regeneration of the area, however little else was undertaken, until the wider redevelopment began in 2001. This was completed in 2007 (at a cost of £260million) and includes flats, offices, bars, restaurants, a hotel and a casino. The development centres on the dock itself as well as around 'Armouries Boulevard' and 'Armouries Square', two pedestrianised thoroughfares. The main office <b>block</b> <b>on</b> the development is Livingston House which has not yet attracted a tenant. The smaller dock incorporates six residential berths for house boats, while a passenger boat service to Granary Wharf runs from here.|$|E

5|$|With {{the rapid}} {{advances}} in theatre technology made during this period, the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still {{held by the}} Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891. The Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues (forerunners of the Crown Estate) desired the entire <b>block</b> <b>on</b> which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892. Plans were commissioned from architect Charles J. Phipps for a theatre and a hotel. In February 1896 an agreement was reached with Herbert Beerbohm Tree for the erection of the theatre {{at a cost of}} £55,000. The plans were approved in February 1897, and on 16 July 1896, the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid. Phipps died in 1897, and the theatre was his last work.|$|E
5|$|Dorada {{returned}} to New Japan on April 16, teaming with Tama Tonga to defeat Liger and King Fale in a tag team match. Dorada worked {{a majority of}} the tour as a rudo, teaming with members of the Chaos stable. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2011, Dorada unsuccessfully challenged Liger for the CMLL World Middleweight Championship. Dorada's extended tour of New Japan also included participation in the 2011 Best of the Super Juniors tournament in late May-early June. Dorada managed to win four out of his eight matches in the round robin stage of the tournament, which included wins over Liger and CMLL World Welterweight Champion Ryusuke Taguchi, and finished sixth out of the nine wrestlers in his <b>block.</b> <b>On</b> June 18 at New Japan's Dominion 6.18 show, Dorada defeated Taguchi to regain the CMLL World Welterweight Championship. Three days later Dorada entered the J Sports Crown Openweight 6 Man Tag Tournament, teaming with IWGP Heavyweight Champion Hiroshi Tanahashi and KUSHIDA, with the team defeating Brian Kendrick, Gedo and Jado in their first round match. The following day the trio was eliminated from the tournament in the second round by Giant Bernard, Jushin Thunder Liger and Karl Anderson. Dorada's tour of New Japan ended the following day, when he, Tanahashi, Hiroyoshi Tenzan, Tiger Mask and Wataru Inoue were defeated in a ten-man tag team match by Chaos (Dick Togo, Gedo, Jado, Masato Tanaka and Yujiro Takahashi).|$|E
5|$|During the 2015–16 season, James {{was criticized}} {{for his role in}} several off-court controversies, {{including}} the midseason firing of Cavaliers' head coach David Blatt. Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and {{the best record in the}} East. James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors, who were coming off a record-setting 73 win season. To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses. James responded by registering back-to-back 41 point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination. In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a memorable chase-down <b>block</b> <b>on</b> Andre Iguodala in the final two minutes, as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals. James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7, and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game, he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.|$|E

Funimation made the series available with the launch of the Funimation Channel in November 2005; it was temporary available on Colours TV during its syndication with the Funimation Channel. A separate English adaptation of the series by Animax Asia premiered in the Philippines on January 18, 2006, under the name Detective Conan. Because Animax were unable to obtain further TV broadcast rights, their version comprised only 52 episodes. The series continued with reruns until August 7, 2006, when it was removed from the station. The California based channel UTB aired Detective Conan with English subtitles from 2011 until 2014, until episode 421.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a <b>block</b> <b>on</b> Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E
5|$|In {{his senior}} season for the 2002 Wolverines, one of June's notable {{performances}} was his individual effort to stop a bootleg play against Notre Dame on September 14, which forced a change of possession to give Michigan the ball with just over two minutes remaining.

In the October 12 victory over Penn State, he made a key defensive play that almost resulted in an interception {{as part of an}} overtime goal line stand to hold Penn State to a field goal. In the 2321 victory over Purdue on October 19, he recovered the final onside kick by Purdue. A collision on October 26 in a game with Iowa halted play for ten minutes while June received medical attention after leaving the game on a stretcher. At the time, he had movement in his extremities. He was hospitalized after the incident, but was released from the hospital the following morning. June was sidelined for the Michigan – Michigan State Paul Bunyan Trophy game against Michigan State on November 2, but participated in two plays during the subsequent Michigan–Minnesota Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota on November 9.
