5000|$|The Artemis {{has been}} named the world’s first Super-SUV, {{extensively}} modifying the Porsche Cayenne with new carbon composite body panels and ultra-low profile 315/25 tyres that sit on large 23" [...] super-lightweight forged alloy rims. The standard specification features twin electric reclining seats in the rear, a choice of starlight roof lining or panoramic glass roof, quilted undercarpets and <b>boot</b> <b>trim,</b> lambswool rugs, electronic-reveal iPads, and a drinks chiller.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a special}} version of the Rolls-Royce Phantom, Phantom Coupé, and Phantom Drophead Coupé for the Abu Dhabi market, built by Abu Dhabi Motors. It {{included}} Yas Eagle White and Yas Eagle Blue body colours, Cobalto Blue & Mugello Red interior upholstery, Fleet Blue stained ash veneer, instrument cluster in white dials, Cobalto Blue & Mugello Red instrument panel, Mugello Red steering wheel, Navy Blue <b>boot</b> <b>trim</b> and carpets, Navy Blue lambswool foot mats, checkerboard applied on the fascia, illuminated Spirit of Ecstasy, thicker steering wheel, RR logo on the headrests in Mugello Red, seat piping in Mugello Red, 21-inch forged Star alloy wheels, chrome plated visible exhausts, and theatre configuration lounge seat.|$|E
50|$|Muamman Duathal (Moo-AM-man Doo-AH-thuhl) is {{the dwarf}} deity of wanderers and expatriates. He {{is also the}} dwarven god of lightning, which he uses as an omen. His symbol is an upright mace over a single leather <b>boot</b> <b>trimmed</b> with fur, or a mace {{clutched}} {{by a pair of}} gauntleted fists. He is a lesser deity of the Neutral Good alignment and has the domains of Good, Protection, Travel Muamman appears as a weathered, nondescript dwarf dressed in plain clothes, usually green. He is thin, with a beard of deep black. He wields Glowhammer, a mace that glows as if were still cooling from being forged. Often, he carries a weathered staff. Muamman's realm is the Cavern of Rest in the ever-shifting subterranean layer of Nidavellir on the plane of Ysgard.|$|R
2500|$|Other Yupik and Cup'ik skin boots are, atallgaq (ankle-high skin boot), ayagcuun (thigh-high skin boot with fur out, {{any other}} item used in traveling), catquk (skin boot made of dyed sealskin), nanilnguaraq [...] (short skin boot), qulip'ak ~ qulip'agaq [...] (skin <b>boot</b> with beaver <b>trimming),</b> qaliruaq (ankle-high skin boot for dress wear; also means slipper; sock).|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure the}} Cenci will haunt me all my days, {{and so will}} many other famous things,' said Matilda, while her eye roved fondly from a very brown Capuchin monk to a squad of Bersaglieri {{trotting}} by with jaunty cocks' feathers dancing in the wind, muskets gleaming, and <b>trim</b> <b>boots</b> skipping through the mud with martial regularity.|$|R
5000|$|For {{her final}} Golden Age appearance, in All Select Comics #1, the costume morphs into a blue {{bodysuit}} that, unlike {{any of her}} previous outfits, covers her legs as well as torso and arms, and a yellow cape. The <b>boots</b> with flame <b>trim</b> return, however both the boots and [...] "flames" [...] are yellow. The Black Widow is now a redhead.|$|R
60|$|The quick light shower {{had drawn}} off, tarrying in {{clusters}} of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed {{forth by the}} blackened earth. Their <b>trim</b> <b>boots</b> prattled as they stood {{on the steps of}} the colonnade, talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, closing them again, holding their skirts demurely.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} more {{aggressive}} styling, it was larger than the previous two generations, with room for five adults, and a spacious (if rather short) <b>boot.</b> The standard <b>trim</b> level on this model is noticeably higher than previous models. This is regarded by some magazines {{to be the best}} supermini, with What Car? magazine calling it [...] "Car of the Year" [...] in 2003, and their best [...] "Supermini of the Year" [...] for three years in a row.|$|R
50|$|In the second, Washington {{finally was}} able to sustain a drive. The Redskins drive stalled at the Vikings' 33-yard line, however, and new Redskins kicker Kai Forbath got his first NFL opportunity, having {{replaced}} Billy Cundiff, who was cut earlier in the week, and delivered a 50-yard <b>boot</b> to <b>trim</b> the deficit to 9-3. After a Vikings three-and-out, Washington {{was able to}} run an 11-play drive that gave it its first advantage of the game, as Alfred Morris scored on a 1-yard run and gave Washington a 10-9 lead. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, Vikings quarterback Christian Ponder was sacked, fumbled, and the fumble was subsequently recovered by Lorenzo Alexander of Washington, setting the Redskins up at the Vikings 6. Robert Griffin III then found fullback Darrel Young for a 6-yard touchdown pass, extending the Redskins advantage to 17-9.|$|R
50|$|Ford New Zealand {{built the}} Zephyr 4 and 6 {{as well as}} the Zodiac locally from CKD kits, {{offering}} only the bench front seat option finished in vinyl. Automatic transmission, introduced late {{in the life of the}} Mk II, was again available but was a rare factory option as most buyers chose manual. As well as the 'Zephyr 6', Ford NZ built a six-cylinder 'Zephyr Special' with a lower equipment level and deletion of the <b>boot</b> lid <b>trim</b> strip and other exterior brightwork which was sold to fleet operators such as the government. The big Fords were unusual in having four-speed manual gearboxes when rivals, including Ford's own Falcon, had only three speeds. Building the top luxury Zodiac model locally again also gave Ford a supply advantage over key rivals such as Vauxhall whose upmarket Cresta was only ever sold fully imported and much harder to obtain than the locally assembled Velox.|$|R
5000|$|For the exterior, GAZ {{developed}} a simplified project repeating the 3102's silhouette {{but in a}} much simplified trim, with many chrome details, notably the [...] "baleen" [...] grille and the bumpers replaced by black plastic. Given that the car was to serve a temporary role, it was chosen to avoid replacing the body panels on grounds of cost, {{with the exception of}} the doors. To somehow improve the car's aesthetics, a novel decision was chosen to simplify the look. Thus most of the chrome details were removed: the <b>boot</b> lip <b>trim,</b> the cursive [...] "Волга" [...] name on the front fenders, mirrors and wipers were now painted black. The bumper overriders were also removed, as was the comfort light on the c-pillar ornament. Marker lights were integrated into the headlamp, and rectangular fog lamps replaced the circular ones. As a final touch, the Baleen radiator grille was replaced by a black plastic one (originally developed for export models to Benelux countries that were retrofitted with local diesels). Introduced in April 1986, this completed the transition (the estate's upgrade would linger on until 1987).|$|R
25|$|Trim (naqyutkaun in Cup'ig) on parka, hat, and <b>boot</b> is {{decorative}} <b>trimming</b> {{elements such}} as patchwork pieces or tassel. Parka trim pieces made primarily of white and black skin of caribou or reindeer, also now largely replaced by calfskin. The fur of the wolf and wolverine are utilized by the Alaska Natives for parka trimming. Wolverines have a somewhat higher basal metabolic rate than other animals their size, which means their internal fire burns a little hotter. To help hold in heat, they wear a long, luxuriously thick coat. Trappers prize this fur because the texture of wolverine hair also keeps it from absorbing moisture. Used widely as trim on parka hoods, cuffs and collars, it readily sheds frost that would otherwise build up from steaming breath.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{adventitious}} roots developing on mung bean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] seedling stem cuttings varied from cutting to cutting, but individual seed weight, fresh {{weight of the}} cutting, hypocotyl length or leaf area did not affect rooting. Generally all cuttings rooted, when the log transformation stabilized the variance in <b>‘roots</b> per cutting’. <b>Trimming</b> the hypocotyl to a standard length at setting either {{had little effect on}} the coefficient of variation of root counts (in robust cuttings) or increased it (in spindly cuttings). Spacings which gave areas per plant of about 1 cm 2 (parent plants) and 3 cm 2 (cuttings) did not result in an increase in variation, even though leaf area per plant was about 10 cm 2. Rooting was increased by temporary dehydration after severance but was not affected by the depth of water in which the cutting bases were placed...|$|R
60|$|A lad {{was at work}} near by, and {{wondering}} what new inmate the house had gained, the neglected guest waited {{to catch a glimpse}} of the unknown face. A slender boy, in a foreign-looking blouse of grey linen; a white collar lay over a ribbon at the throat, stout half <b>boots</b> covered a <b>trim</b> pair of feet, and a broad-brimmed hat flapped low on the forehead. Whistling softly he dug with active gestures; and, having made the necessary cavity, set a shrub, filled up the hole, trod it down scientifically, and then fell back to survey the success of his labors. But something was amiss, something had been forgotten, for suddenly up came the shrub, and seizing a wheelbarrow that stood near by, away rattled the boy round the corner out of sight. Moor smiled at his impetuosity, and awaited his return with interest, suspecting from appearances that this was some protégé of Mark's employed as a model as well as gardener's boy.|$|R
60|$|A brisk, blithe-faced girl {{passed in}} a gray walking suit with a distracting pair of high-heeled boots and glimpses of scarlet at the ankle. Modest, {{perfectly}} so, I assure you, were the glimpses; but the feet were so decidedly pretty that one forgot {{to look at the}} face appertaining thereunto. It wasn't a remarkably lovely face, but it was a happy, wholesome one, with all sorts of good little dimples in cheek and chin, sunshiny twinkles in the black eyes, and a decided yet lovable look about the mouth that was quite satisfactory. A busy, bustling little body she seemed to be, for sack-pockets and muff were full of bundles, and the <b>trim</b> <b>boots</b> tripped briskly over the ground, as if the girl's heart were as light as her heels. Somehow this active, pleasant figure seemed to wake up the whole street, and leave a streak of sunshine behind it, for every one nodded as it passed, and the primmest faces relaxed into smiles, which lingered when the girl had gone.|$|R
50|$|After a {{controversy}} in AJPW over {{the direction and}} management, he left the company with Mitsuharu Misawa, and half the roster, for Misawa's newly created Pro Wrestling Noah in mid-2000. Like many other members who made the jump, Akiyama gave himself a makeover, dropping his trademark blue and white <b>trimmed</b> <b>boots</b> and blue trunks for white boots and trunks and dyed his hair brown. He was quickly established as a top star of the company, winning both falls in the main event of NOAH's first show, choking out Kenta Kobashi in the second Noah show the night after he turned heel for this {{first time in his}} career, and becoming the second GHC Heavyweight Champion, He had stellar title defenses in New Japan Pro Wrestling against Yuji Nagata and Hiroshi Tanahashi. But a lack of worthy contenders eventually forced Noah to abandon his push, using Yoshinari Ogawa to transition the title back to Misawa. He continued work in Noah as a tag team competitor again to critical acclaim, winning the GHC Tag Team Championship with Akitoshi Saito.|$|R
50|$|In Street Fighter IV, in {{addition}} to the Delta Red attire, her default, Cammy has an alternate appearance which is reminiscent of the Shadaloo version. This consists of her wearing a blue zipped-up fleece thong leotard with matching knee-high <b>boots</b> with woolen <b>trim,</b> a Delta Red garrison cap, midnight blue gloves and armbraces, and blue camouflage on her legs. In the consecutive Super Street Fighter IV, she gains an additional alternate costume based on M.Bison's, mostly by its red color and the similarly-shaped hat and accessories. However, she still wears a thong leotard and camouflage paint on her legs. Her fourth alternative costume in the game has her in a catgirl-type costume, with metal gauntlets and leg coverings. In Street Fighter X Tekken, Cammy gains an additional two alternate costumes: one is based on King from Tekken, and the second is an all-original design inspired by a punk rock type of look, with her sporting a huge red bow, a black vest with a pink top, a red skirt with leather straps and black leather knee-high boots; she also got a leopard motif costume in an update.|$|R
60|$|From St. Paul {{there are}} two waterfalls to be seen, which we, of course, visited. We crossed the river at Fort Snelling, a rickety, ill-conditioned {{building}} standing at {{the confluence of the}} Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, built there to repress the Indians. It is, I take it, very necessary, especially at the present moment, as the Indians seem to require repressing. They have learned that the attention of the Federal government has been called to the war, and have become bold in consequence. When I was at St. Paul I heard of a party of Englishmen who had been robbed of everything they possessed, and was informed that the farmers in the distant parts of the State were by no means secure. The Indians are more to be pitied than the farmers. They are turning against enemies who will neither forgive nor forget any injuries done. When the war is over they will be improved, and polished, and annexed, till no Indian will hold an acre of land in Minnesota. At present Fort Snelling is the nucleus of a recruiting camp. On the point between the bluffs of the two rivers there is a plain, immediately in front of the fort, and there we saw the newly-joined Minnesota recruits going through their first military exercises. They were in detachments of twenties, and were rude enough at their goose step. The matter which struck me most in looking at them was the difference of condition which I observed in the men. There were the country lads, fresh from the farms, such as we see following the recruiting sergeant through English towns; but there were also men in black coats and black trowsers, with thin <b>boots,</b> and <b>trimmed</b> beards--beards which had been trimmed till very lately; and some of them with beards which showed that they were no longer young. It was inexpressibly melancholy to see such men as these twisting and turning about at the corporal's word, each handling some stick in his hand in lieu of weapon. Of course, they were more awkward than the boys, even though they were twice more assiduous in their efforts. Of course, they were sad and wretched. I saw men there that were very wretched--all but heart-broken, if one might judge from their faces. They should not have been there handling sticks, and moving their unaccustomed legs in cramped paces. They were as razors, for which no better purpose could be found than the cutting of blocks. When such attempts are made the block is not cut, but the razor is spoiled. Most unfit for the commencement of a soldier's life were some that I saw there, but I do not doubt that they had been attracted to the work by the one idea of doing something for their country in its trouble.|$|R
60|$|If {{that young}} buck and flower of Baker Street, Percy Sibwright, {{could have known}} who was the {{occupant}} of his bedroom, how proud {{he would have been}} of that apartment:--what poems he would have written about Laura! (several of his things have appeared in the annuals, and in manuscript in the nobility's albums)--he was a Camford man and very nearly got the English Prize Poem, it was said--Sibwright, however, was absent and his bed given up to Miss Bell. It was the prettiest little brass bed in the world, with chintz curtains lined with pink--he had a mignonette-box in his bedroom window, and the mere sight of his little exhibition of shiny <b>boots,</b> arranged in <b>trim</b> rows over his wardrobe, was a gratification to the beholder. He had a museum of scent, pomatum, and bear's-grease pots, quite curious to examine, too; and a choice selection of portraits of females, almost always in sadness and generally in disguise or deshabille, glittered round the neat walls of his elegant little bower of repose. Medora with dishevelled hair was consoling herself over her banjo for the absence of her Conrad--the Princesse Fleur de Marie (of Rudolstein and the Mysteres de Paris) was sadly ogling out of the bars of her convent cage, in which, poor prisoned bird, she was moulting away,--Dorothea of Don Quixote was washing her eternal feet:--in fine, it was such an elegant gallery as became a gallant lover of the sex. And in Sibwright's sitting-room, while there was quite an infantine law library clad in skins of fresh new-born calf, there was a tolerably large collection of classical books which he could not read, and of English and French works of poetry and fiction which he read a great deal too much. His invitation cards of the past season still decorated his looking-glass: and scarce anything told of the lawyer but the wig-box beside the Venus upon the middle shelf of the bookcase, on which the name of P. Sibwright, Esquire, was gilded.|$|R
