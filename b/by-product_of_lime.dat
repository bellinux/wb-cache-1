40|$|Lime oil, as a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> processing, has {{a variety}} of food and {{industrial}} uses. Mexico is currently the world’s leading producer of lime oil, and has an interest in possible expansion of the industry. The primary market is the U. S., with lesser potential in the EU based on past trends. Expansion of this industry, if feasible, would increase producer revenue and add jobs in lime processing and allied and secondary sectors of the economy, spurring economic development in affected rural areas of Mexico. Juice for human consumption and pulp for animal feed are also products of lime processing but are fraught with commodity characteristics. Lime oil, on the other hand, is an ingredient in differentiated food and cosmetic products and appears to be associated with fairly stable prices over time {{even in the face of}} competition from Brazil and Peru. This study determines the economic feasibility and potential extent of expanding lime-oil production in Mexico. Agribusiness,...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLime Kiln Dust (LKD) is the <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> Quick <b>Lime</b> (QL) {{production}} {{which is}} mostly disposed off into landfills globally. Therefore, LKD {{needs to be}} reused to reduce environmental problems and promote sustainability. This paper presents preliminary investigations {{on the use of}} LKD as a cementitious material in mortar. LKD was added to mortar mixtures to study its effect on the strength by replacing ordinary Portland cement (OPC) up to 60 % by weight with LKD. Experimental results on physical and engineering properties, and compressive strengths of mortar samples containing LKD are reported. Results indicated that the initial and final setting time of the LKD mortar tested ranged from 1. 08 to 2. 3 h and 4. 58 to 5. 8 h respectively, and the strength values from 36. 35 to 68. 08 MPa for 90 days strength. Furthermore, addition of LKD reduced the strength of the mortar but with a faster setting time. It can be concluded that there is a good potential for the use of LKD as a cementitious material with accelerated hydration rates...|$|R
50|$|Industrially, a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> {{the burning}} of coal, sulfur dioxide gas, may combine with water vapor {{in the air to}} {{eventually}} produce sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain. To prevent the sulfur dioxide from being released, a device known as a scrubber gleans the gas from smoke stacks. This device first blows calcium carbonate into the combustion chamber where it decomposes into calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide. This lime then reacts with the sulfur dioxide produced forming calcium sulfite. A suspension <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> is then injected into the mixture to produce a slurry, which removes the calcium sulfite and any remaining unreacted sulfur dioxide.|$|R

It {{has been}} reused as a {{material}} for civil engineering, pavement construction etc. For such applications, {{it is extremely}} important to evaluate the amount <b>of</b> free <b>lime,</b> which has the chemical form of calcium monoxide (CaO) and can cause the failure of mechanical properties by volume expansion through absorption of water or carbon dioxide gas. So far, various chem-ical analyses <b>of</b> the free <b>lime</b> content have been employed that are frequently combined with ethylene gly-col extraction. Unfortunately the method does not always distinguish the chemical form of calcium. In the present paper, we propose the use of X-ray diffraction. The technique can clearly show the existence of different chemical forms of calcium, such as CaO, Ca(OH) 2, CaCO 3, and calcium silicates such as Ca 2 SiO 4 and other forms as different peaks.

40|$|The loess {{deposits}} of the Port Hills, Canterbury, {{are subject to}} erosion by natural processes. Urban development of the Port Hills has encountered difficulties due to loess erosion, and in some instances, contributed to erosion. Lime stabilisation is one remedial method {{that can be used}} to reduce erosion problems. This necessitates investigation of the changes to soil properties and strength gains that occur to the loess with the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> An erodible loess colluvium, from a subdivision with a history of erosion problems, was stabilised with 1 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 % hydrated lime, and cured under various laboratory conditions. Pinhole erodibility, uniaxial swelling strain, Atterberg limits, grainsize analysis, Proctor compaction testing and a slaking test were used to determine the improvements to soil properties with the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Unconfined compressive strength was tested to determine strength gains <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stabilised soil. The addition <b>of</b> 1 % <b>lime</b> to the soil produced a non-erodible, non-dispersive material. Slaking and swelling were minimised with the addition of higher percent ages <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> (5 %- 7. 5 % respectively). The effective grainsize of the soil was increased on the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> and plasticity was increased with the addition of up to 5 % lime. Optimum moisture content increases, and dry density decreases with increasing amounts <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Strength gains <b>of</b> the <b>lime</b> stabilised loess, varied from 3 – 14 times the strength of the untreated soil depending on the curing method. Strength gains were greatest for air dried samples, although the untreated soil cured in the same manner had a higher dry strength than the lime stabilised soil. Strength gains are optimised at and above 7. 5 % lime with significant strength losses recorded between 2 % and 5 % lime. Strain deformation is reduced with the addition <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> and the modulus of deformation is increased significantly indicating that lime stabilised loess acts as a brittle material on deformation. The addition <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> to loess in low percentages (1 %), has the effect of producing a non-erodible, non-dispersive material that resists erosion. However, it would appear that to achieve maximum strength <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> stabilised loess, 7. 5 % lime or more must be added to the soil...|$|R

Moreover, applying geogrids led to increasing deformability and failure strain. Based on SEM tests, an addition <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> caused fewer voids led to increasing UCS and Es.
