5|$|Audaciously, Peter confiscated Queen Giselle's {{property}} {{and took her}} into custody. She sought help from Hungarian lords, who blamed one of Peter's favorites (Budo) for the monarch's misdeeds and demanded that Budo <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> trial. When the King refused, the lords seized and murdered his unpopular advisor and deposed the monarch in 1041. They elected a new king, Samuel Aba, who was a brother-in-law or another nephew of King Stephen I.|$|E
5|$|I {{was anxious}} that such details should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> record {{because some of}} these {{regional}} cooking pots are already becoming {{very hard to find}} in France, so that in some sense Juliet Renny's drawings constitute a little historical record in their own right.|$|E
5|$|In 1398 Richard summoned {{a packed}} Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which {{declared}} all {{the acts of}} the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.|$|E

A {{few hours}} before he was to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a ventilator, he was {{planning}} on writing his next novel, {{a story about a}} grandfather.

"Laths are {{the thin}} split boards which are nailed upon {{the sides of}} a room before the {{plastering}} <b>is</b> <b>put</b> <b>on.</b> Sometimes laths <b>are</b> made very narrow, and are nailed on at a little distance from each other, so as to leave a crack between them. Then the plastering, being soft when it <b>is</b> <b>put</b> <b>on,</b> works into the cracks, and thus clings to the wood when it is dry and hard. If plastering <b>was</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> to smooth boards, or a smooth wall, it would all fall off again very easily." ...|$|R
5|$|A trophy {{handover}} {{ceremony was}} held in Rome on 21 April 2009, at which Ole Gunnar Solskjær, representing Manchester United as the previous season's champions, returned the trophy to UEFA president Michel Platini. Platini then presented the trophy to Gianni Alemanno, the Mayor of Rome, that it might <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> display {{in and around the}} city until the day of the final. Also present at the ceremony were the president and vice-president of the Italian Football Federation, Giancarlo Abete and Demetrio Albertini, the ambassador for the final, Bruno Conti, and Emilio Di Toro on behalf of the Italian National Olympic Committee.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he had {{voted in favor}} of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E

5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1990, after the first {{democratic}} elections in Croatia, the municipal government finally approved the project. An architectural competition was planned for January 1991. Political turmoil in the country, followed by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995), caused the project to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold again. In 1994 President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman said to Jakov Bienenfeld, Council member of the Zagreb Jewish community, that they should build the new synagogue {{at the site of}} the former synagogue, which will be funded by the Croatian government. Bienenfeld declined the offer believing to be inappropriate when 1800 Catholic churches are left destroyed at the time, during Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{occurred}} at York Park when, {{in a game}} between St Kilda and Fremantle, the final siren was too quiet to be heard {{by any of the}} umpires; play was restarted in error, and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores. After a protest, the AFL Commission convened and overturned the result, awarding Fremantle the victory. The stadium's sirens have since been replaced, and the old ones will <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans {{for the next six}} years, {{due to a lack of}} funding and a shift in priorities from new roads to maintenance. The water subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E

5|$|The Irish Republican Army, that {{controlled}} {{much of the}} southern part of the country during the Irish civil war, issued a 1d, 2d and 6d label, mainly because of a stamp shortage.

5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him into the trunk of a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> trial for appearance's sake.|$|E
5|$|Banza soon {{decided to}} stage a coup d'état. He confided in a few {{military}} officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of {{the date of the}} coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented his case to a military tribunal, which quickly sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in Time and Le Monde. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators.|$|E
