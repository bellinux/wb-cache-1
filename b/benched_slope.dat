40|$|The {{compressive}} stress trajectory in a slope {{is parallel to}} the slope face. In a <b>benched</b> <b>slope</b> the {{compressive stress}} trajectory approximates the down-dip line of the overall slope. In steep, high slopes where compressive stress magnitude is high, slope-parallel compressive stress can {{play a major role in}} controlling instability related to movement on geological structures such as bedding, foliation and joints. A stereographic approach can be used for kinematic analysis of stress-induced structural instability. The proposed stereographic approach is based on identification of structural orientations relative to the local stress trajectories. Structures oriented obliquely to the principal compressive stress in a slope can become unstable leading to sliding and toppling mechanisms which can differ in orientation from those recognised in conventional gravity-based kinematic analysis...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, slope {{stability}} analysis {{is fundamental to}} satisfy the increa singly societal demand for safe infrastructures and natural resources. W ith the increase in computational power and the advance in the developme nt of numerical methods, new techniques for {{slope stability}} analysis hav e become very attractive to engineers. The finite element method (FEM) p resents many advantages over classic methods, e. g., no a-priori failure mechanism is necessary to assess the stability of slopes. Furthermore, n umerical techniques provide information about stresses and displacements, what contributes {{to the understanding of}} slope processes. Despite thes e advantages to become the state-of-the-practice method, FEM should be c apable of handling different aspects of slope stability analysis. The aim of this research is twofold. The first objective is to investiga te the application of finite element analysis techniques in slope stabil ity studies and to define ways to enhance its use in practical geotechni cal applications. The second objective is exploring the use of FEM to de tect the precursors to slope failure and to assist in defining the optim al positioning of sensors for slope stability monitoring. The research i n these areas will contribute to a safe and a more economic design of sl opes. The thesis presents a comprehensive and critical literature review on th e state-of-the-art in finite element slope stability analysis, in partic ularly with focus on the strength reduction technique. Static, pseudosta tic and dynamic finite element analyses are conducted to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} method and to demonstrate practical applications. The applications of FEM, that have been developed and validated in this research, encompass: a process to detect different sliding surfaces from performing a finite element analysis, the computation of the critical s lip surface from shear strain contours, and the coupling of FEM with opt imisation algorithms for the back-analysis of soil parameters. Additiona lly, a broad comparative analysis between the classical limit equilibriu m method (LEM) and the FEM with focus on the differences between both me thods is presented. The use of the finite element stress field in a limi t equilibrium context, including the effects of the tensile strength and dilatancy is also investigated. The results, in terms of the factor of safety and the location of the critical slip surface have been compared against the output of classical slope stability methods. The FEM is a ro bust method, giving values for the factor of safety lower than classical methods and determining the location of the critical slip surface accur ately. Prior to the dynamic finite element analysis an overview of the pseudost atic method is given. The determination of the critical seismic coeffici ent by finite elements has been presented and a terminology for this pro cess is introduced namely stress increase method. The finite element res ults of the seismic coefficient are compared to those obtained by the li mit equilibrium and the limit analysis method. For the dynamic finite element analysis, a parametric analysis, using a harmonic motion, is performed to detect the effect of the frequency, pea k ground acceleration, duration, soil properties, and slope geometry. Th e effect on the slope stability of each parameter is assessed by identif ying the vertical displacement of the top of the slope. Actual earthquak e records are also used to assess the stability of the slope and the res ults are compared against those calculated by the Newmark method. Two ap proaches to enhance the Newmark displacements are suggested. The first o ne is based on the modification of the input acceleration and the second on the change of the acceleration coefficient. Potential unstable zones are evaluated and possible locations to install monitoring sensors are proposed. The FEM is used to predict the critica l displacements (total, horizontal and vertical) in a case study and the results are used to guide the instrumentation setup. This procedure has been used to detect early signs of failure and a better understanding o f the mechanism of movement. The proposed methodologies to use the FEM for practical problems have be en validated, demonstrating the applicability of finite elements to asse ss the stability of slopes for several situations and conditions. 1 General introduction 1 1. 1 The importance of slope stability assessment 1 1. 2 General aspects in landslide analysis 2 1. 3 Scope of Research 5 1. 3. 1 Solution strategy and original contributions 7 1. 4 Organisation of the dissertation 8 2 Methods for slope stability analysis 11 2. 1 Introduction 11 2. 2 Methods of analysis 12 2. 3 Limit equilibrium method 14 2. 3. 1 General considerations of LEM 15 2. 3. 2 Unified formulation for LEM. 16 2. 3. 3 Bishopâ€™s simplified method 17 2. 3. 4 Limit equilibrium variational calculus 19 2. 4 Limit analysis method 20 2. 5 Numerical methods for slope stability 23 2. 6 Limitations and advantages of LEM compared to FEM 25 2. 6. 1 Limitations of the LEM 25 2. 6. 2 Limitations of FEM for slope stability analysis 25 2. 6. 3 Advantages of FEM over conventional methods 26 2. 7 Other slope stability methods 26 2. 8 Location of the critical slip surface 27 2. 8. 1 Slip surface optimisation 28 2. 8. 2 Physical admissibility of the solution 28 2. 9 Important aspects in slope stability analysis 29 2. 9. 1 Factor of safety 29 2. 9. 2 Criteria for the selection of the design factor of safety 30 2. 9. 3 Reliability analysis in slope stability 36 2. 9. 4 Safety map 36 2. 9. 5 Stability number 37 2. 9. 6 Effect of dilatancy on slope stability 38 2. 10 Conclusions 39 3 Finite element method for slope stability analysis 41 3. 1 Introduction 41 3. 2 Considerations in finite element analysis 42 3. 3 Literature review 43 3. 4 Mathematical formulation 57 3. 4. 1 Finite element discretisation 58 3. 4. 2 Implicit integration of differential plasticity models 59 3. 5 Strength reduction technique 61 3. 5. 1 Factor of safety definition in FE-SRM 61 3. 5. 2 Mathematical formulation for SRM 62 3. 6 Finite element slope stability analysis 63 3. 6. 1 Discretisation of the model 64 3. 6. 2 Initial state of stress 64 3. 6. 3 Strength reduction process 66 3. 6. 4 Failure mechanisms detection 67 3. 7 Comparative analysis between FEM and LEM 69 3. 7. 1 Numerical model and results 69 3. 8 Detection of local failures by FE-SRM 81 3. 8. 1 Example 1, <b>benched</b> <b>slope</b> 81 3. 8. 2 Example 2, two-slope-angles 84 3. 8. 3 Example 3, complex slope configuration 86 3. 8. 4 Discussion on determination of local failures 87 3. 9 Determination of the CSS from FE-SRM 88 3. 9. 1 Numerical examples and verification 89 3. 9. 2 Discussion on the determination of the CSS 95 3. 10 Conclusions 96 4 Enhanced limit method for slope stability analysis 99 4. 1 Introduction 99 4. 2 Enhanced limit method 100 4. 2. 1 Factor of safety definition in ELM 100 4. 2. 2 Scheme of enhanced limit method 102 4. 2. 3 Search for the critical slip surface 103 4. 3 Applications of the enhanced limit method 103 4. 3. 1 Application 2 H: 1 V slope 103 4. 3. 2 Discussion on the applicability of the results 105 4. 3. 3 Reduced strength cases, 2 H: 1 V slope 108 4. 3. 4 Application 1 H: 2 V slope 109 4. 4 Conclusions 112 5 Dynamic finite element analysis for slope stability 115 5. 1 Introduction 115 5. 2 Seismic instability in soil slopes 116 5. 3 Pseudostatic analysis 117 5. 3. 1 Selection of the design seismic coefficient 118 5. 3. 2 Critical seismic coefficient 120 5. 3. 3 Comments on pseudostatic approach 124 5. 3. 4 Determination of kc by different methods 125 5. 4 Displacement based analysis 128 5. 4. 1 Newmark method 129 5. 5 Time integration FEM 131 5. 5. 1 Boundary and initial conditions 131 5. 6 Parametric study for dynamic assessment 135 5. 6. 1 Effect of ground motion input 136 5. 6. 2 Effect of soil properties 143 5. 6. 3 Effect of slope geometry 147 5. 6. 4 Discussion on parametric study 152 5. 7 Dynamic earthquake analysis 153 5. 7. 1 Elastic response spectrum analysis 153 5. 7. 2 Newmark and FE displacements 159 5. 8 Conclusions 166 6 Slope stability monitoring 169 6. 1 Introduction 169 6. 2 Slope stability monitoring 169 6. 3 Slope monitoring sensors 171 6. 4 Presentation of case study 176 6. 4. 1 Site description 176 6. 4. 2 Geology and geotechnical characteristics 176 6. 4. 3 Finite element model 178 6. 4. 4 Location of the critical displacements 180 6. 4. 5 Slope stability analysis of case study 180 6. 4. 6 Comparison between FEM and LEM results 193 6. 4. 7 Parametric study on cohesion and friction angle, Case 1 194 6. 5 Conclusions 196 7 Back analysis of soil parameters 197 7. 1 Introduction 197 7. 2 Back analysis of strength parameters 198 7. 2. 1 Conventional procedure for back analysis 200 7. 2. 2 Optimisation problem 202 7. 2. 3 Numerical examples 203 7. 3 Back analysis of soil parameters for seepage problem 221 7. 3. 1 Groundwater flow formulation 221 7. 3. 2 Site description Fosso S.

40|$|Coal {{is a prime}} {{source of}} energy in India and its demand is {{increasing}} every day due to faster rate of development and consumption of energy per capita. To {{bridge the gap between}} demand and supply of energy sector, {{there is a need for}} huge quantity of coal. The open cast mines are helpful to fulfill the demand to a large extent because of their higher productivity rate. Large quantity of overburden material is required to be removed to reach the underlying coal seams. Higher stripping ratio and increased depth of mines pose serious problem to the stability of mine slope due to variation in rock mass as well as mining method adopted. These problems are more chronic, where soft layers of black cotton soil occur in the slope, which behaves erratically in different environments. The <b>bench</b> <b>slopes</b> in Wardha Coal Field, face such kind of conditions, which are delicate when it comes to the safe mining activity. In this paper, an attempt has been made to simulate the condition of a black cotton soil bench imbedded in mine slope using two dimensional numerical tools.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of rock mechanical data {{is a fundamental}} {{step in the process}} of evaluating the profitability of an open pit mine. The steepness of bench, interramp and resulting overall slope angles have a direct effect on the stripping ratio, therefore on the profitability of the mining operation. With the recently challenging metal prices in mind, the maximization of slope angles is even more important nowadays, prompting detailed investigations in the topic. The primary goal of this master thesis is to provide updated rock mechanical design criteria for the Liikavaara Ã–stra open pit in Northern Sweden, by collecting and assessing the already available information from the area, as well as evaluating the raw data of the drilling campaign undertaken in 2016. After the compilation of the rock mechanical and geological data of the site, the <b>bench</b> scale <b>slope</b> stability was assessed with probabilistic and deterministic approach. During the process, two failure criteria (Mohr-Coulomb and Barton-Bandis) and two groundwater conditions (drained and undrained) were tested. Based on the gained experience in the neighboring Aitik mine, the drained Barton-Bandis scenario was used both in probabilistic and deterministic approach to recommend bench face angles. Based on the findings of the <b>bench</b> <b>slope</b> analysis, an increase of the bench and interramp angles (compared to the previous design study) is possible, with the presumption of improved smooth blasting techniques and minimized back break. In identified areas with excessively poor rock quality, the application of external rock support was assessed in order to maintain reasonable bench angles and avoid mining of additional waste rock. The application of external slope support practices deemed feasible in the footwall domains of the pit, where with the utilization of support methods, the possible relocation of the E 10 road can be avoided. The overall slope stability was also assessed in the footwall with limit equilibrium analysis methods. The footwall of the pit was found to be stable with the new design criteria, although it is sensitive to the presence of groundwater pressures...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Sediments {{deposited}} in transitional settings between shoreface and offshore lacustrine environments in the Pliocene Glenns Ferry Formation of the southwestern Snake River Plain include extensive nearshore oolitic sequences similar to wave-built terraces along Lake Bonneville described by Gilbert (1885). These sequences record both constructional and destructional phases. Constructional units formed during basinward progradation and avalanching of oolitic sediment from a shallow bench platform down a steeply-dipping <b>bench</b> <b>slope.</b> Reversed grading seen in proximal foresets and normal grading seen in distal foresets {{may have resulted}} from sediment transport by grain flow on {{the upper reaches of}} the slope and fluidized sediment flow on the lower slope surface. Foreset beds dip basinward to the northeast at 26 degrees, and foreset units attain thicknesses of 18 meters. Destructional episodes are recorded by missing sections within the tops of constructional units. Massive beds of thickly coated ooids overlie constructional units and record ooid formalion on the bench platform during transgressions which preceded progradation of subsequent foresets. The inlerpretation of these lacustrine bench sequences in terms of water depths during their formation demonstrates that rates of subsidence and absolute positions of lake level fluctuated greatly during their deposition. Such instability. probably related to tectonic movements. has had a significant influenc...|$|R

40|$|Relatively pure {{lacustrine}} carbonates {{referred to}} as marl are being deposited in Littlefield Lake, central Michigan, a hard-water lake with little terrigenous clastic influx. Thick accumulations of marl form both progradational marl benches along lake margins, and islands or lakemounts in the lake centre. Marl benches develop flat platforms up to 20 m wide in very shallow water and steeply inclined slopes, up to 30 Â°, extending into deep water. The flat landward platform is frequently covered by algal pisoliths while the upper portion of the lakeward-sloping bottom is overgrown by Chara which in the summertime becomes thickly encrusted with low-magnesian calcite. Marl islands are flat-topped features that formed over relict highs on Pleistocene drift which underlies the lake basin. These are fringed by marl benches identical to those found along lake margins.

Unlike trapezoidal ditches, two-stage ditches have a vegetated bench {{that acts as a}} floodplain, which helps to prevent erosion and to increase the processing of nutrients to improve water quality. Converting a trapezoidal ditch to a two-stage ditch is expensive, due to the large volumes of soil that need to be excavated. Since ditch geometries vary significantly and surveying each potential site by hand would be time consuming and expensive, a tool based upon online Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data would be useful to estimate the volume. The excavation volume for two ditches was calculated using two methods: the LiDAR digital elevation model, gridded to 3 m resolution, and a ground survey using an RTK GPS unit. ArcGIS was used to create profiles of the trapezoidal streams.

In {{open cast mining}} method, {{since it is the}} main focus as it {{contributes}} major portion of production, stability of the slope is of utmost importance. To avoid a slope from failure, working is to be carried out in accordance with the guidelines and safety standards. The factor of safety of the working slope has to be calculated and monitored from time to time so that safe working environment can be created and the slope can be avoided from failure. Factor of safety often calculated by the traditional deterministic analysis methods cannot exactly represent the stability of the slope. Case of Rajpardi Lignite Mine (GMDC) has been considered for this project. The working benches with height 3 m are very steep with individual <b>bench</b> <b>slope</b> angle varying from 80 o to almost 90 o.

60|$|Majesty surmounted {{the last}} few steps and, snorting, halted beside Stewart's black. To Madeline the scene {{was as if the}} world had changed. The ridge was a mountain-top. It dropped before her into a black, stone-ridged, shrub-patched, many-canyoned gulf. Eastward, beyond the gulf, round, bare mountain-heads loomed up. Upward, on the right, led giant steps of cliff and <b>bench</b> and {{weathered}} <b>slope</b> to the fir-bordered and pine-fringed crags standing dark and bare against the stormy sky. Massed inky clouds were piling across the peaks, obscuring the highest ones. A fork of white lightning flashed, and, like the booming of an avalanche, thunder followed.|$|R
60|$|The stones rattled, {{the dust}} rose, the cedar twigs snapped, the little {{avalanches}} of red earth slid down, the iron-shod hoofs rang on the rocks. This slope had been narrow {{at the apex}} in the Rim where the trail led down a crack, and it widened in fan shape as Jean descended. He zigzagged down a thousand feet before the <b>slope</b> <b>benched</b> into dividing ridges. Here the cedars and junipers failed and pines once more hid the sun. Deep ravines were black with brush. From somewhere rose a roar of running water, most pleasant to Jean's ears. Fresh deer and bear tracks covered old ones made in the trail.|$|R
50|$|Hondo (Spanish for deep) Creek {{begins in}} the Texas Hill Country. The {{initially}} broken waters of the stream travels through limestone <b>benches</b> and steep <b>slopes</b> until the land flattens near Tarpley. This section of the creek is generally shallow with a bottom of clay loam, {{which serves as a}} habitat for Ashe juniper and live oak woods. As it runs south, the creek grows in depth in the surrounding rolling plain, and a mixture of clay with a large concentration of sand is found in its bed. As the tributary approaches its mouth, the environment changes to fertile crop lands with Mesquite trees growing along its bank.|$|R
60|$|So {{stern and}} {{determined}} were Harry's words, so fierce and haughty his tone, that the planter and his overseer both turned pale and shrank back. They saw {{at once the}} manner of men with whom they had to deal, and felt that the threat would be carried out to the fullest. Muttering some inarticulate reply, the planter turned and entered the house, and the overseer, with a dogged, crestfallen look, {{led the way to}} the slave quarters. The place assigned to them was a long hut, the sides lightly constructed of woven boughs, with a thick thatch overhead. Along one side extended a long <b>sloping</b> <b>bench,</b> six feet wide. This was the bed of the slaves.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of study of the soils, soil parent material, and {{relevant}} bedrock along the excavation for a pipeline, which extended for five miles from {{the northeast corner of}} section 12, St. Clair Township, to the center of sec-tion 27, Middleton Township, Columbiana County, Ohio. These results are correlated with some pedologic and geologic generalizations gathered during the soil survey of Columbiana County. The study area is in the upper Ohio Basin and is drained by Little Beaver Creek, which flows into the Ohio River at Smiths Ferry, Pennsylvania. Little Beaver Creek has a composite drainage basin. A northern basin, formerly draining to the northeast, was ponded by a very early Pleistocene glacier (Lessig, 1963) andjoined with a southern basin to form the present basin of Little Beaver Creek (Stout and Lamborn, 1924 : 23 - 33). Detailed descriptions of 6 soil profiles, representing soils developed from materials on several subdivisions of the Allegheny Plateau in Ohio, are given. Local subdivisions are the ridgetops, <b>benches,</b> steep <b>slopes,</b> high glacial out wash terraces, and drainage ways. The soils and materials were studied as a continuum...|$|R
40|$|This type {{typically}} {{occurs on}} upland flats, <b>benches,</b> gentle <b>slopes</b> or well drained valley and draw bottoms {{in areas with}} less than 12 inches precipitation. Vegetation Description Vegetation is shrubland dominated by creosote bush, bur sage, opuntia, and palo verde, saguaro, with intermingled forbs. Blackbrush, ephedra, spiny hopsage, and fringed sage would {{be found in the}} Colorado Plateau areas.

Disturbance Description Fire regime group III, infrequent mixed. The mean fire interval is generally greater than 75 years with high variation due to year to year variation in drying of shrub foliage, shrub mortality, grass, and forb production related to drought and moisture cycles combined with variation in ignitions and associated fire weather. Fire years are typically correlated with high spring moisture years in geographic areas dominated by cool season moisture and high summer moisture in areas dominated by monsoon season rains. Fire intervals would have been much longer in the dry ends of this PNV with return intervals on the order of 200 + years. Fire size would have been small because of the discontinuous fuels...|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} {{road in the}} county is Interstate 15, which runs north-south {{through the center of}} the county. US-89 enters parallel to I-15 from Salt Lake County to the south and runs north through North Salt Lake and Bountiful as a city road before merging with I-15. It re-emerges again in Farmington near the Lagoon Amusement Park, heading along the eastern <b>benches</b> on the <b>slopes</b> of the Wasatch Range, entering Weber County near South Weber. US-89 is planned to eventually be upgraded to a freeway through eastern Layton north to its interchange with I-84 near the Weber County border. Congestion is a significant problem in the county, as east-west transportation is restricted by the narrow urban corridor and many of its citizens commute south to Salt Lake County.|$|R
