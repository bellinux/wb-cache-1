5|$|Lace {{confessed to}} the murder on 17 September 1983. He gave a {{statement}} to police that he had stolen a rucksack and cash on 4December 1979 from the care home in Portsmouth {{where he had been}} living and then walked to Southampton. He was present {{at the rear of the}} Tom Tackle pub when DeSimone was dropped off by Savage, and then approached DeSimone when she got into her own vehicle. He first knocked on the window and asked the time but then forced his way into the driver's seat <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> locked the doors to prevent her escaping. Once inside he sexually assaulted her and strangled her using the passenger seatbelt in the car. He then took her handbag and jewellery, and hid for approximately 10minutes before heading to Southampton Central station and catching a train back to Portsmouth.|$|E
5|$|At 16, {{the aging}} Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father {{works at the}} Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her and closes the door. Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of the third plate, Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder. Having {{encouraged}} his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and index finger are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words [...] "God's Revenge against Murder" [...] written on a book that, along with the Book of Common Prayer, has fallen from the box. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness), [...] and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{this window}} Whall takes his {{inspiration}} from the Creation Story from the Old Testament (Genesis iii) and in the centre light he draws the serpent wound around the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden. [...] The inscription reads-"I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed". [...] In the left hand light Whall depicts Eve with a child <b>beside</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> in the right hand light an angel in red bars {{the entrance to the}} garden. An image of this window is shown above. The memorial note was designed by Veronica Whall and inserted into the window in 1928 recording that the window was given in memory of Henry Bruton, J.P.(1813–1894).|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the family's refusal to consent to the marriage, there was another event that {{may have led to}} her suicide. A month earlier, Sophie traveled to France with her mother, Princess Gerda, and von Bleichröder, and the Princess's chauffeur, Walter Palmer. Enjoying taking long drives in the Fontainbleu Forest, on one night while driving at high speed, their vehicle hit a little gypsy girl and mortally injured her. The following day, von Bleichröder visited the girl's house and paid them the equivalent of $3000 in compensation. At the time of the accident, Walter Palmer, her chauffeur, claimed to be driving. But at the trial of Palmer and the Baron a month later (very shortly after her suicide) - Palmer was charged with homicide and von Bleichröder with civil responsibility, as the owner of the car - sworn statements by the occupants of the car established that at the time, the Princess, [...] "a keen motorist and expert driver", was at the wheel, Palmer was sitting <b>beside</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> her mother and the Baron were in the back seats. Palmer admitted he had falsely claimed responsibility {{at the time of the}} accident to spare the Princess, and had done so without any promise or expectation. At the time, the Princess and her mother were registered at the hotel incognito as Madame and Mlle Deroda, and identified themselves similarly to police at the time of the accident. The court was satisfied that the deceased Princess had been the driver, and dismissed the charges against Palmer and von Bleichröder. [...] Some newspapers hinted that the stress or guilt of this tragedy may have instrumental in her suicide a month later, saying [...] "Every effort was made to hush up the affair, owing to fear that the Princess's movements would become known to her father." ...|$|E
