The initial damages of MDG locate at grating ridges while the damages with micro-holes and cracks appear in the <b>groove</b> <b>bottom.</b> Compared with the melted-hole damages of grating ridges, the <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> crack damages indicate they are the major promoting role of causing the catastrophic damage for MDG.

The profile of <b>groove</b> <b>bottom</b> of MDG was explored by atomic force microscope (AFM) in detail. It is found that the bottom shape is arched with the maximum height of 30 nm. Based on these measuring grating parameters, NEFI of MDG was numerically calculated with finite difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to explain the damage phenomenon. The arched bottom makes an enhancement of NEFI maximum in <b>groove</b> <b>bottom,</b> thereby increasing the risk of catastrophic damage for MDG.

With 30 to go, however, the entire race would change. Nextel Cup Series regular Kyle Busch and Kvapil battled for the lead, but Busch's loose truck caused him to slide into Kvapil, sending them both spinning.

50|$|As Gordon {{struggled}} with multiple pit stops, {{the battle for}} the lead was heating up. With two laps to go, Craven caught Busch. He made his bid for the lead on the inside of turn three, after they met at a virtual dead heat at the start-finish line. They made light contact in turn one, making both cars slide up to the wall, with Craven's car leaning on Busch's. However, Craven pushed as soon as he cleared Busch, allowing the 97 car to execute the bump n' run to reclaim the lead. Busch ran away down the backstretch, but Craven's car was clearly faster as they ran through turns three and four, and went bumper-to-bumper at the white flag. This time, Craven made no attempt to pass Busch through turns one and two. Busch entered turn three somewhat low and Craven high, but Busch slid high as Craven managed to cut to the <b>bottom</b> <b>groove</b> to draw even with Busch at the exit of turn four. At that moment Busch and Craven each got loose and corrected into each other (Busch up high, Craven down low), and the ill-handling cars continued to slam into each other as they sped towards the checkered flag, with Craven narrowly defeating Busch by a record margin of victory of 0.002 seconds which has been tied only once in the 2011 Aaron's 499.|$|E

40|$|Authors: Blanche Capel and Jordan Batchvarov Corresponding author ([b. capel@cellbio. duke. edu](b. capel@cellbio. duke. edu)) ### INTRODUCTION It can {{be useful}} to assay {{migration}} between any two adjacent tissues during development. This protocol assays cell migration between the gonad and mesonephros using tissue recombination between genetically marked and unmarked tissue, combined with an organ culture technique. First, agar blocks are prepared in a custom-built mold. The {{size and shape of}} the wells are important to maintain the authentic three-dimensional morphology of the organ; the molds here are designed specifically to accommodate the gonad/mesonephros complex. Freshly dissected organs are then transferred to grooves within the agar blocks, where they are allowed to grow over 24 - 48 h. Using this protocol, organs develop with good morphology, and show only an ~ 12 -h delay relative to in vivo development. ### RELATED INFORMATION Details on the techniques used in this procedure have been described previously (Martineau et al. 1997; Tilmann and Capel 1999; Brennan et al. 2002, 2003). An overview of the preparation of recombinant organ cultures is presented in Figure 1. The sex of the embryos can be determined by [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. Overview of experimental plan. The gonad/mesonephros complex is dissected from wild-type (CD 1) and genetically marked mice (ROSA 26). Gonads and mesonephroi are separated, and wild-type gonads are recombined with transgenically marked mesonephroi and cultured for 24 - 48 h in agar blocks. ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Bacto Agar - Buffer for DNA extraction - DMEM containing 10 % fetal calf serum and 50 μg/mL ampicillin (organ culture medium) - Dulbecco’s Minimal Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), prewarmed to 37 °C for Step 17 - Embryos, mouse, 11. 5 - 16. 5 days post-coitum (dpc) - *Obtain embryos from pregnant mice of both a wild-type strain and a transgenic strain expressing a constitutive marker in all of its cells (e. g., β-gal [Gt(ROSA) 26 Sor/J] or EGFP [Cg-Tg(CAG-EGFP) B 5 Nagy/J]; both lines are available from the Jackson Laboratory.) * - Ethanol (optional; see Step 8) ### Equipment ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. (A) Dimensions of machined mold for casting agar blocks (in.). (B) Finished mold. This mold has three ridges of slightly different dimensions. 1. Agar-block molds - *The dimensions of the wells are important to maintain the morphology of the organ. Design wells specifically for the organ under study, and have them custom-made in a good machine shop. For the recombinant gonad culture presented here, use the dimensions in Figure 2 *. - Autoclave - Beaker - Dishes (tissue culture; 30 -, 60 -, and 100 -mm) - Erlenmeyer flask (500 -mL) - Forceps (# 5; see Step 16) - Hood (tissue culture) - Incubator (tissue culture) preset to 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 - Micropipettor with tips (20 -μL, 200 -μL) - Microscope (dissecting) - Needles (30 -gauge) - Pipettes (glass, hand-pulled) - *The diameters of the openings should be slightly larger than the mesonephroi or gonads, as appropriate; see Steps 21 and 24 *. - Pipettes (plastic, transfer) - *Trim tips to accommodate the urogenital complex comfortably*. - Plates (tissue culture; four-, 12 - or 24 -well) - Razor blade (sterile) - Soap for washing agar-block molds - Stir bar - Stirrer/heater - Tubes (heatproof, 15 mL) - Tubes (microcentrifuge, 1. 5 -mL) (for 11. 5 dpc wild-type embryos; see Step 15. i) ### METHOD **Preparation of the Agar** 1. Add 1. 5 g of Bacto Agar to 100 mL of DMEM in a 500 -mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add a stir bar. - Place the flask into a beaker of H 2 O to make a double boiler. Heat while stirring on a stirrer/heater until the agar is dissolved completely. - *Do not microwave; it will overflow*. - Transfer the flask directly to the heat. Boil the agar for 3 - 5 min. - *Monitor carefully; this boils over easily*. - Aliquot the agar into 15 -mL heatproof tubes in convenient quantities. - *Use 5 - 9 mL, depending on the number of blocks needed for an experiment. Each block requires 1. 5 mL*. - Store the agar aliquots at 4 °C. **Preparation of the Agar Blocks** 6. Wash the agar-block molds with soap and water. Rinse 10 times with tap H 2 O and 10 times with distilled H 2 O. 7. Autoclave the molds. - *Alternatively, just before use, dip the blocks in ethanol and flame them*. 8. Reheat an aliquot of agar in a beaker of H 2 O until it melts completely, then remove from heat and keep in a beaker of warm H 2 O. 9. Working in a tissue culture hood, place a mold with the trench side up into a 100 -mm tissue culture dish. 10. Slowly pipet 1. 5 mL of melted agar onto the top of the mold (surface tension will keep the agar on the block). 11. Cover the tissue culture dish to avoid dehydration. Allow the agar to set for ~ 10 min. 12. Using a sterile razor blade, loosen the agar around the edges. Peel the agar off of the block, inverting it into a 30 -mm tissue culture dish. - *Peel the agar from the block {{in the same direction as}} the trenches are running or the agar will break along the trenches*. 13. Cover the agar with 1. 5 mL of organ culture medium. Allow the agar to equilibrate for at least 2 h (or overnight) in the incubator. **Assembling Recombinant Gonad Organ Cultures** 14. Collect embryos from wild-type or transgenic mice at the developmental stage of interest. Place each embryo in a single well of a tissue culture plate (four-, 12 - or 24 -well). 15. For 11. 5 -dpc wild-type embryos, follow these additional steps: - i. Collect the amnions into 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice. - ii. Catalog each amnion with the well number containing the associated urogenital complex (see Step 17). - iii. Determine the sex of the embryos using the protocol [Sex Chromatin Staining in Amnion Cells]([URL] (Capel and Batchvarov 2008). - *This is a quick method for identifying XX samples by the presence of cells with a condensed chromatin body*. - iv. Reserve a bit of each embryo’s tail for confirmation of the sex by PCR. - *Tail tips are stable in a dry tube on ice for several hours during dissection. Alternatively, they can be processed immediately for DNA extraction or stored at - 20 °C in buffer for DNA extraction*. 16. Using # 5 forceps, dissect the entire bilateral urogenital complex (see Fig. 3) along with the dorsal aorta from all of the embryos. ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. The entire urogenital complex at 11. 5 dpc contains the left and right gonad (G) /mesonephroi (M) and the dorsal aorta (DA), which lies at the midline. Separate the left and right gonad/mesonephros from the complex when you are ready to assemble to avoid tissue curling. Separate the gonad and mesonephros using a 30 -gauge needle. 17. Place each complex back into the individual well of the tissue culture plate containing prewarmed DMEM. Keep tissues at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2. - *Four-well plates are preferred: You can remove one plate at a time from the incubator for fine dissection while the rest of the samples stay at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 *. 18. After determining the sex of the wild-type embryos, transfer each urogenital complex to a 60 -mm dish using a plastic transfer pipette (trimmed to accommodate the urogenital complex). 19. Using a 30 -gauge needle, separate the mesonephroi from the urogenital complexes of the embryos carrying a transgenic label. 20. Using a micropipettor with a 200 -μL tip, remove all but 100 - 200 μL of medium from the dish holding the agar block (from Step 13). - *It is much easier to assemble the recombination tissues in a dry well*. 21. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the mesonephros, transfer the transgenic mesonephroi into the grooves of the agar blocks. - *Each groove can hold approximately three mesonephroi*. - *Dissect one pair of mesonephroi at a time and transfer them to an agar block to prevent curling of the organ*. - *See Troubleshooting*. 22. Position mesonephroi into the groove under a dissecting microscope (see Fig. 3). - *Do not crowd samples; they are easier to work with if they are positioned far apart*. 23. Using a fresh 30 -gauge needle, separate the gonads from the wild-type urogenital complexes. - *To prevent curling, dissect only one or two wild-type gonads before transferring them to the agar and immediately assembling with a mesonephros*. 24. Using a pulled glass pipette that has a diameter slightly larger than the gonads, transfer gonads to an agar groove containing a mesonephros. - *When drawing the gonads into the pipette, keep track of the “cut” side, so that you can deposit the cut side toward the cut side of the mesonephros in the well*. *See Troubleshooting*. 25. Assemble the cut edges of the gonad and mesonephros together (Fig. 4). ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. (A) Agar block with three trenches, equilibrated, medium removed, and ready for loading samples with pulled glass mouth-pipette. (B) Four gonad/mesonephros cocultures are loaded in the top trench, and one is loaded in the middle left. (C) Higher magnification of coculture positioned in trenches; (left) gonad oriented downward; (right) gonad facing up. - *See Troubleshooting*. 26. Once all the samples are assembled completely, use a micropipettor with a 20 -μL tip to remove the remainder of the DMEM. - *Removing medium from the grooves will promote adhesion between the mesonephroi and gonads once you are satisfied with their position*. 27. Add 350 - 400 μL of fresh organ culture medium to the bottom of the 30 -mm tissue culture dish. Incubate for 1 - 2 h in the incubator. - *Do not disturb the samples until they have had time to adhere*. 28. Incubate the agar blocks in closed tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in 5 % CO 2. - *Placing the 30 -mm dishes inside 100 -mm culture dishes makes them easier to handle when transferring in and out of the incubator*. 29. Change the organ culture medium in the bottom of the dish daily. - *Cultures maintain good morphology for at least 48 h. See Troubleshooting*. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: The gonads or mesonephroi stick to the inside of the glass pipette **[Steps 21 and 24]** - **Solution**: Be sure to pick up a small volume of liquid in your pipette before you pick up the organ. - **Problem**: The gonads and mesonephroi are not properly aligned. [Step 25] - **Solution**: The organs are very sticky. Consider the following: - 1. Use pulled glass pipettes that are just slightly larger than the organ. This will provide better control as you pick up and orient the two tissues. - 2. Make sure that the cut sides of the organs are facing one another. - 3. If organs fail to align properly, add some DMEM to the trough and allow the organs to float apart. Then remove most of the medium (i. e., all but 100 - 200 μL) and use a pulled glass pipette or a needle to reassemble the gonads and mesonephroi. - **Problem**: Cultures are not growing optimally. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Cultures can be improved by pipetting a drop of medium atop each organ to wash it each time you change the medium. Remove the excess washing medium from the well before returning samples to the incubator. - 2. There are differences in serum batches that affect viability and migation efficiency. When changing serum, test three or four batches to determine the best lot. - **Problem**: Mixed organ cultures become contaminated. **[Step 29]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Replace the medium each day to help control contamination. - 2. In general, additional antibiotics and fungicides take a toll on the tissue, but they might be required under some conditions. - 3. Spread the samples among multiple plates so that all the work is not lost if one plate becomes contaminated. - **Problem**: Labeling of plate is lost and it is not possible to distinguish the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>groove</b> on the plate - **Solution**: Always load the plate asymmetrically (e. g., four samples in the top groove, two in the middle, and three on the bottom). Document the location and details of each sample in a diagram in your notebook for reference in case labels on the plates are smudged or lost. ### REFERENCES 1. Brennan J., Karl J., Capel B.

30|$|According to the STM images {{displayed}} in Fig. 5, {{at the higher}} growth temperature, Ge islands nucleate exclusively at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> and they rapidly transform from pyramids to domes as growth proceeds. On the contrary, at low-temperature Ge islands form predominantly {{on the top of}} the ridges and retain their pyramidal shape even up to 7 ML coverage and only slowly grow in size. At 520 °C, also the size of the sidewall ripple progressively increases with Ge coverage up to 7 ML, whereas the ripple amplitude quickly saturates at 600 °C. These observations indicate a large lateral mass transport and material redistribution at the higher growth temperature, whereas it is only very small at 520 °C, where lateral mass transport obviously only occurs on a very limited length scale. Indeed, at 520 °C, the average island distance is only around 40 nm, compared to more than 350 nm (=lateral stripe period) at 600 °C. The kinetically limited adatom diffusion at 520 °C leads to nearly conformal wetting layer growth up to 4 ML Ge coverage. Thus, the critical coverage for island formation is reached simultaneously at the ridges and the sidewall surfaces, where 3 D islands also form (see Fig. 5 b). At 600 °C, however, due to the higher adatom mobility, the capillary force arising from the high curvature at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> [18] invokes a significant Ge downward mass transport. As a result, a flattening, i.e., filling of the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> occurs during Ge wetting layer growth as seen by STM in Fig. 5 d and thus, also ripple formation is delayed. The Ge transfer to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> leads to a local thickening of the Ge layer and thus to an exclusive Ge island nucleation at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves.</b> Once formed, nearly all additionally deposited Ge is sucked into these islands due to the large energy gain associated with the elastic strain relaxation. Therefore, STM images recorded at higher coverages show that even up to 11 ML, no new islands are formed on any other surface location.|$|R

40|$|Titanium-sapphire laser {{ablation}} of silicon {{was investigated in}} atmospheric air, water and 20 % KOH solution. The number of overlapping pulses was tuned between 3 and 1000 by changing the processing time. The ablated surfaces were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray microanalysis and stylus profilometry. In each ambient, plasma formation was observed during ab-lation. X-ray microanalysis indicated that the process starts with surface oxidation in case of air and water ambient. With increasing pulse number the surface was roughened, resulting in larger struc-tures. Crater formation was observed in air and in water, with higher etching rate in the latter case. The depth profile of the ablation holes and grooves is rather different for this two ambient. Narrow conical grooves were observed in case of ablation in air, while flat <b>bottom</b> <b>grooves</b> were produced in water. Laser processing in KOH solution {{did not result in}} etching, only the native oxide layer was removed. Etching occurred in these areas, if the samples were left in KOH solution for a longer time. Based on these observations the material removal by fs laser pulses is attributed to evaporation and reactions of Si with radicals in the laser induced plasma, such as atomic or ionic oxygen. The appli-cation of KOH introduces K ions or atoms into the laser induced plasma, which may react faster with oxygen than with Si, thus resulting in decrease in etching rate during laser processing...|$|R

The other distinguishing {{characteristics of a}} [...] "Keith-style" [...] SWC are a double radius ogive, beveled crimp groove, three equal width driving bands, wide square bottomed grease groove, and a plain base with sharp corners. The wide forward driving band helps keep the bullet aligned as it jumps across the cylinder gap. Because of the three wide equal width driving bands, the total bearing surface is greater than half the overall length of the bullet. This large bearing surface helps the Keith-style SWC to be an inherently accurate bullet, and minimizes leading from gas blow-by.

40|$|Semiconductor quantum wires (QWRs) are {{promising}} structures for optoelectronics applications, since {{they can provide}} quantum confinement for charge carriers in two dimensions. The advantage that they offer over conventional quantum wells (QWs) {{is due to the}} sharper density of states characteristic of these structures, yielding narrower spectral lines and higher optical gain. However, to exhibit clear confinement characteristics, QWRs must meet stringent requirements in terms of size, uniformity and interfacial quality. Different methods have been explored for QWR fabrication. Techniques based on etching and regrowth suffer from defect incorporation into the lateral interfaces, since they are not formed in situ, and are limited in size by the lithographic features. On the other hand, growth of fractions of monolayers on vicinal substrates, although overcoming the above limitations, gives rise to size nonuniformities and graded interfaces. In this project, (In) GaAs/AlxGa 1 -xAs QWRs are obtained by organometallic chemical vapor deposition (OMCVD) growth of quantum wells on patterned, V-grooved substrates. In this way, the lithographically defined pattern serves as a seed for QWR formation. The self-ordering properties of OMCVD on nonplanar surfaces ensure the creation of a self-limiting profile at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves,</b> on which the wires are grown. This method overcomes the size limitations imposed by lithography, allows the in situ formation of interfaces and, thanks to the self-ordering mechanism, yields structures with high uniformity, whose characteristics are determined solely by the growth conditions. Although nonplanar growth has been employed for more than ten years for QWR fabrication, the understanding of the self-ordering mechanisms originating the profiles at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> has been until now only phenomenological. The attainment of self-limiting profiles takes place via transients of the growth rates at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove.</b> Current models of nonplanar growth can predict the formation, evolution or disappearance of facets at the 100 nm-μm size. However, they cannot describe the transient behaviors at the nm scale that lead to self-limiting growth. This thesis project has been aimed at elucidating the physical mechanisms of this self-organized growth. A fundamental part of the project has been the creation of a wide experimental database to understand the dependence of the self-limiting profiles on the materials and growth conditions. The profiles at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove</b> exhibit a faceted structure, consisting of a central (100) plane, surrounded by two { 311 }A ones. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the bottom facets become wider as the growth temperature increases and as the Al mole fraction x of AlxGa 1 -xAs layers decreases. It appears therefore that surface diffusion is a key element in determining self-limiting growth. TEM cross sections show also that the establishment of self-limiting profiles takes place via self-adjusting growth rates on these facets. In addition to this geometrical self-ordering, AlxGa 1 -xAs alloys exhibit also a compositional self-ordering at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove.</b> Due to the higher mobility of Ga species, with respect to the Al ones, the facets at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove</b> are Ga rich, with respect to the sidewall planes, giving rise to so-called vertical quantum wells (VQWs). To determine the composition of the VQWs, we have developed a technique employing cross-sectional atomic force microscopy (AFM) in air. This method is based on the dependence of the AlxGa 1 -xAs oxidation rates on the Al content x. Through a calibration on a reference sample, we were able to measure compositions with an accuracy of ± 0. 02. The enhanced Ga content of the VQWs follows classical models of segregation, and reaches a maximum of Δx ≅ 0. 15 for x ≅ 0. 55 at a growth temperature of 700 °C. We also studied the three dimensional structure of the self-limiting surface profiles by top-surface AFM in air of the nonplanar samples after cool-down and removal from the OMCVD reactor. Each of the planes composing the groove presents a monolayer step structure that reflects directly the morphology of surfaces of the same orientation found in planar epitaxy. However, on the facets forming on corrugated substrates the step structure exhibits a higher degree of ordering, with respect to planar epitaxy. This is due to a modification of surface diffusion, when the trench width becomes comparable to or lower than the adatom surface diffusion length. In {{the last part of the}} project, we have developed a model ascribing the self-ordering phenomena observed above to local variations of the surface chemical potential μ. Since μ becomes lower as the concavity of the surface increases, it induces a curvature-dependent capillarity flux towards the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove.</b> In the absence of capillarity, if the growth rate is higher on the sidewall planes than on the bottom facets, the capillarity-enhanced growth rate at the bottom can balance exactly the sidewall growth rate, thus leading to self-limiting growth. The different behavior of nonplanar OMCVD (where self-ordering is usually observed at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves)</b> and molecular beam epitaxy (where self-ordering rather takes place at the top of the corrugations) can be explained by the different growth rate anisotropies of the two techniques. In a ternary alloy, the composition is locally different at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>groove,</b> due to the different diffusion lengths of Ga and Al. The resulting entropy of mixing, which is lower than the one for a uniform composition, tends however to oppose this segregation, thus affecting the alloy self-limiting profiles. The predictions of the model have been successfully verified on our OMCVD-grown profiles. They can be used to design and optimize a variety of nanostructures, including VQWs, QWRs and QWR superlattices in the GaAs/A 1 GaAs system, and can be further extended to the strained InGaAs/AlGaAs system...|$|R

30|$|In this work, in situ RHEED {{monitoring}} of Si and Ge growth on stripe-patterned Si substrates was demonstrated as a sensitive tool for controlling {{the changes in}} the pattern structure {{as well as of the}} island formation process. This allowed to observe the transformation of the pattern geometry from multifaceted “U” to single-faceted “V” stripes. For subsequent Ge growth, ripple and island formation was observed by RHEED and STM, from which the onset of 3 D islanding and sidewall roughening was precisely deduced. It was revealed that these processes significantly differ as a function of growth temperature, such that at 600 °C ripple formation is significantly delayed compared to low-temperature growth at 520 °C, whereas 3 D islands starts slightly earlier. This is explained by the higher adatom mobility at the higher growth temperature, which leads to a substantial downward mass transport to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves.</b> As a result, site-controlled growth of Ge islands aligned in the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves</b> can be obtained only at 600 °C, whereas for lower temperatures islands nucleate randomly on the ridges as well as sidewalls of the stripes.|$|R

Straight grooves with a semicircular cross section are cut with different tool inclination and tilt angles, and the resulting surfaces are characterized using an optical profilometer and microscope. Micro-milling cutting forces are recorded synchronously with spindle electric current and cutting motions in order to investigate {{the correlation between the}} tool orientation and the achieved surface quality. Results of various cutting experiments and analysis of the final surface geometry show that varying the tool orientation reduces rubbing of the material at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves,</b> which often occurs in ball-end milling of brass, and improves the final surface quality. The experimental analysis for surface roughness shows that applying a tool inclination angle of 150 can considerably improve the surface roughness at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>grooves.</b> Analysis of static and averaged peak-to-valley (P-to-V) values of the cutting forces show that the static cutting force values are reduced by half when the tool inclination was increased from 0 to 150.
