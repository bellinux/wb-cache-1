25|$|Bound or {{hygroscopic}} water: <b>Bound</b> <b>water</b> {{is bound}} to the wood via hydrogen bonds. The attraction of wood for water arises from the presence of free hydroxyl (OH) groups in the cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin molecules in the cell wall. The hydroxyl groups are negatively charged. Because water is a polar liquid, the free hydroxyl groups in cellulose attract and hold water by hydrogen bonding.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a {{continuum}} model for high frequency poroelastic longitudinal waves in hydrogels is presented. A viscoelastic force describing {{the interaction between}} the polymer network and the <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> present in such materials is introduced. The model is tested by means of ultrasound wave speed and attenuation measurements in polyvinylalcohol hydrogel samples. The theory and experiments show that ultrasound attenuation decreases linearly with the increase in the water volume fraction of the hydrogel. The introduction of the viscoelastic force between the <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> and the polymer network leads to a bi-phasic theory, showing an ultrasonic fast wave attenuation that can vary {{as a function of the}} frequency with a non-integer exponent in agreement with the experimental data in literature. When tends to 1 100 % of interstitial water due to the presence of <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> in the hydrogel, the ultrasound phase velocity acquires higher value than that of pure water. The ultrasound speed gap at = 1 is confirmed by the experimental results, showing that it increases in less cross-linked gel samples which own a higher concentration of <b>bounded</b> <b>water...</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel cryopreservation method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable <b>bound</b> <b>water</b> does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable <b>bound</b> <b>water</b> protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary wet {{chemistry}} lab results showed the surface soil is moderately alkaline, between pH 8 and 9.

40|$|Abstract. The physically-chemically <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> is an {{important}} parameter {{directly related to the}} gain of mechanical strength during the hydration of cements. In this work, quantitative determinations of the physically- chemically <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> of two types of belite cements, called FABC- 2 -W and FABC- 2 -N, were carried out by means of thermogravimetry analyses during a period of 180 days of hydration. The hydrated products were characterized by X-ray diffraction and BET surface area. Important direct quantitative correlations were obtained between the combined water and technological characteristics of cements such as the compressive mechanical strength or the BET surface area. TG measurements for hydrated FABC- 2 -W and FABC- 2 -N cements were carried out in flowing nitrogen on a TGA/SDTA 851 (Mettler) in the temperature range from 25 to 1100 °C with heating rate of 10 ºC min- 1 and nitrogen flow rate of 25 mL min- 1.

25|$|A lithium-tourmaline elbaite was one {{of three}} pegmatitic {{minerals}} from Utö, Sweden, in which the new alkali element lithium (Li) was determined in 1818 by Johan August Arfwedson for the first time. Elba Island, Italy, {{was one of}} the first localities where colored and colorless Li-tourmalines were extensively chemically analysed. In 1850 Karl Friedrich August Rammelsberg described fluorine (F) in tourmaline for the first time. In 1870 he proved that all varieties of tourmaline contain chemically <b>bound</b> <b>water.</b> In 1889 Scharitzer proposed the substitution of (OH) by F in red Li-tourmaline from Sušice, Czech Republic. In 1914 Vladimir Vernadsky proposed the name Elbait for lithium-, sodium-, and aluminum-rich tourmaline from Elba Island, Italy, with the simplified formula (Li,Na)HAl6B2Si4O21. Most likely the type material for elbaite was found at Fonte del Prete, San Piero in Campo, Campo nell'Elba, Elba Island, Province of Livorno, Tuscany, Italy. In 1933 Winchell published an updated formula for elbaite, H8Na2Li3Al3B6Al12Si12O62, which is commonly used to date written as Na(Li1.5Al1.5)Al6(BO3)3(OH)3(OH). The first crystal structure determination of a Li-rich tourmaline was published in 1972 by Donnay and Barton, performed on a pink elbaite from San Diego County, California, United States.|$|E
25|$|Several {{reactions}} {{occur between}} {{the concrete and}} the corium melt. Free and chemically <b>bound</b> <b>water</b> is released from the concrete as steam. Calcium carbonate is decomposed, producing carbon dioxide and calcium oxide. Water and carbon dioxide penetrate the corium mass, exothermically oxidizing the non-oxidized metals present in the corium and producing gaseous hydrogen and carbon monoxide; large amounts of hydrogen can be produced. The calcium oxide, silica, and silicates melt and are mixed into the corium. The oxide phase, in which the nonvolatile fission products are concentrated, can stabilize at temperatures of 1300–1500°C for a considerable period of time. An eventually present layer of more dense molten metal, containing fewer radioisotopes (Ru, Tc, Pd, etc., initially composed of molten zircaloy, iron, chromium, nickel, manganese, silver, and other construction materials and metallic fission products and tellurium bound as zirconium telluride) than the oxide layer (which concentrates Sr, Ba, La, Sb, Sn, Nb, Mo, etc. and is initially composed primarily of zirconium dioxide and uranium dioxide, possibly with iron oxide and boron oxides), can form an interface between the oxides and the concrete farther below, slowing down the corium penetration and solidifying within a few hours. The oxide layer produces heat primarily by decay heat, while the principal heat source in the metal layer is exothermic reaction with the water released from the concrete. Decomposition of concrete and volatilization of the alkali metal compounds consumes {{a substantial amount of}} heat.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by a quasi-chemical view {{of protein}} hydration, we define {{specific}} hydration {{sites on the}} surface of globular proteins in terms of the local water density at each site relative to bulk water density. The corresponding kinetic definition invokes the average residence time for a water molecule at each site and the average time that site remains unoccupied. <b>Bound</b> <b>waters</b> are identified by high site occupancies using either definition. In agreement with previous molecular dynamics simulation studies, we find only a weak correlation between local water densities and water residence times for hydration sites {{on the surface of}} two globular proteins, lysozyme and staphylococcal nuclease. However, a strong correlation is obtained when both the average residence and vacancy times are appropriately taken into account. In addition, two distinct kinetic regimes are observed for hydration sites with high occupancies: long residence times relative to vacancy times for a single water molecule, and short residence times with high turnover involving multiple water molecules. We also correlate water dynamics, characterized by average occupancy and vacancy times, with local heterogeneities in surface charge and surface roughness, and show that both features are necessary to obtain sites corresponding to kinetically <b>bound</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the addition of commercial lipase in various forms on the acceleration of the ripening of UF-Feta cheese. Commercial lipase from Aspergillus niger was encapsulated by using silica composition based on Sol-Gel method. Lipase was then added to cheeses in three forms, namely, free lipase, encapsulated lipase, and encapsulated lipase with Arabic gum. Lipase was added to the retentate in the ratio of 4 g: 100 kg. The effects of free lipase, encapsulated lipase, and encapsulated lipase with Arabic gum on lipolysis, quantity of free <b>water,</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>water,</b> and chemical compounds were studied during the 60 days of ripening.

Thermal analysis of all treatments indicated that lipolysis could affect the free and <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> content by decreasing both of them from the 15 th to 60 th days of ripening. The amount of salt, moisture, and fat changed during the first 15 days of ripening significantly (P< 0. 05).

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a {{continuum}} poroelastic model for high frequency acoustic waves in hydrogels has been developed. The model {{has been used to}} obtain the acoustic longitudinal wave equation for ultrasound. In order to obtain a satisfactory model for hydrogels, a viscoelastic force describing the interaction between the polymer network of the matrix and the <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> is introduced. The model is validated by means of ultrasound (US) wave speed and attenuation measurements in polyvinylalcohol (PVA) hydrogel samples {{as a function of the}}ir water volume fraction "β" and polymer matrix cross-linking. The model predicts that the law ∝ ν(1 + δ) for ultrasound attenuation can be applied as a function of the frequency ν, where δ is the frequency exponent of the polymer-bounded water viscosity. This outcome can well explain the attenuation of the US frequency in natural gels where δ is typically about 0. 25 ÷ 0. 50 while the value for pure water is 1. The theory and experiments show that US attenuation in hydrogels decreases steadily with the increase of its water volume fraction β in a linear. The new proposed dissipative mechanism leads to a US wave speed c that follows the law: c = cw(β - φsymbol) - 3 / 2, where cw is the US wave speed in water and φsymbol is the volume fraction of the <b>bounded</b> <b>water.</b> Since 0 0, the hydrogel US velocity is always higher than that of pure water. If β tends to 1 (100 % water), then the US speed in hydrogels converges to a higher value than that of pure water. The US speed gap at β = 1, between hydrogels and water, is the direct consequence of the introduction of the polymer network-bounded water interaction. This is in line with the experimental results that show that the US speed gap at β = 1 decreases in the gel samples with a more cross-linked polymer matrix that has a lower <b>bounded</b> <b>water</b> volume fraction. On the contrary, if the water content is very low (i. e., β < 0. 4), the measured US speed converges to that of the dry hydrogel matrix which increases in the samples with a higher degree of network cross-linking with greater elastic moduli. © 2008 Elsevier B.
