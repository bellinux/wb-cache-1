40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of phonetic fit between {{spokesperson}} name and product attributes on perceived source credibility, namely, spokesperson expertise, attractiveness and trustworthiness. We manipulate phonetic fit through a 2 (spokesperson name: front vs. back) × 2 (product attribute: crisp vs. smooth) factorial design whilst controlling for spokesperson and product attractiveness. Results show that a phonetic fit between the name <b>of</b> the <b>spokesperson</b> and product attributes encourages positive perceptions <b>of</b> <b>spokesperson</b> credibility, irrespective <b>of</b> whether a <b>spokesperson</b> is visually presented in an advertisement. Finally, results demonstrate that phonetic fit (front (back) vowel spokesperson name with crisp (smooth) product attributes) can promote positive attitudes towards an advertisement and product, as well as purchase intention, with these relationships mediated by perceptions <b>of</b> <b>spokesperson</b> credibility.
