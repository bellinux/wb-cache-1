50|$|SATRA {{played a}} role in the {{successful}} expedition to the top of Mount Everest in 1953 in which Sir Edmund Hillary, along with Tenzing Norgay, became the first person to 'stand on top of the world'. In 1952, SATRA was approached by The British Expedition to produce 34 pairs of boots to meet the challenge of climbing in one of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. The boots were designed to provide a high level of thermal insulation for use in high altitude and saw a combination of inner vapour <b>barrier,</b> <b>mesh</b> insoles and an integrated rubber outer gaiter: the water resistant vapour barrier’s inner layer stopped the boots becoming soaked with sweat then freezing; the mesh insole allowed sweat to disperse from the socks; the outer gaiter prevented melting snow soaking in to the boot itself. In addition, there were five layers of kapok, a natural hollow fibre and a forerunner of synthetic versions. The boot lasting technique helped prevent compression of the vital insulation material and microcellular resin soles further improved insulation and decreased weight. The end result was boots that weighed only 4 lb 4oz and a successful expedition in which no-one who wore the boots got frostbite - a remarkable achievement.|$|E
40|$|Fuel-water {{filters are}} a {{promising}} {{solution for the}} removal of water from diesel fuel and frequently rely on a depth coalescing nonwoven medium and a <b>barrier</b> <b>mesh.</b> Water is a fuel contaminant that can cause severe damage to engine injectors by promoting corrosion and microbial growth. Coalescing water out of diesel fuel has become challenging because of the increasing amount of bio-diesel and performance enhancing additives that are present to meet emission control regulations. High water content and the reduction in interfacial tension (IFT) between the water and diesel are associated with formation of more stable emulsions and the generation of smaller water droplets that are harder to remove. This research systematically investigates the characteristics of bio-diesel and surfactant (monoolein) blends with standard diesel fuel, and explores the factors affecting the efficient removal of water from fuel by means of depth coalescing media composed of poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) meltblown fabrics. It was established that bio-diesel and monoolein do not influence the IFT of water in fuel in a comparable manner and the resulting water droplet size distributions (DSD) are substantially different, which has implications in terms of the interpretation of results from commonly used ISO and SAE standard test methods. Fuels blended with bio-diesel exhibited higher viscosity and water content than fuel freshly blended with monoolein. Online measurement of water droplet sizes revealed substantially smaller water droplets in bio-diesel blends compared to monoolien blends at the same IFT measured using offline tensiometry. The surface wetting characteristics of PBT meltblown media were modified by alkaline hydrolysis independently of fabric geometric configuration and treated fabrics exhibited greater coalescence efficiencies (up to a 150...|$|E
40|$|The {{tripartite}} symbiosis between legumes, rhizobia and mycorrhizal fungi {{are generally}} considered to be beneficial for the nitrogen (N) uptake of legumes, but the facilitation of symbiosis in legume/non-legume intercropping systems is not clear. Therefore, the aims of the research are as follows: 1) to verify if the dual inoculation can facilitate the N uptake and N transfer in maize/soybean intercropping systems and 2) to calculate how much N will be transferred from soybean to maize. A pot experiment with different root separations (solid <b>barrier,</b> <b>mesh</b> (30 µm) barrier and no barrier) was conducted, and the 15 N isotopic tracing method was used to calculate how much N transferred from soybean to maize inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and rhizobium in a soybean (Glycine max L. cv. Dongnong No. 42) /maize (Zea mays L. cv. Dongnong No. 48) intercropping system. Compared with the Glomus mosseae inoculation (G. m.), Rhizobium SH 212 inoculation (SH 212), no inoculation (NI), the dual inoculation (SH 212 +G. m.) increased the N uptake of soybean by 28. 69 %, 39. 58 % and 93. 07 % in a solid barrier system. N uptake of maize inoculated with both Glomus mosseae and rhizobium was 1. 20, 1. 28 and 1. 68 times more than that of G. m., SH 212 and NI, respectively, in solid barrier treatments. In addition, the amount of N transferred from soybean to maize in a dual inoculation system with a mesh barrier was 7. 25 mg, 7. 01 mg and 11. 45 mg more than that of G. m., SH 212 and NI and similarly, 6. 40 mg, 7. 58 mg and 12. 46 mg increased in no barrier treatments. Inoculating with both AMF and rhizobium in the soybean/maize intercropping system improved the N fixation efficiency of soybean and promoted N transfer from soybean to maize, resulting in the improvement of yield advantages of legume/non-legume intercropping...|$|E

The type of adhesions, the percentage of mash covered with adhesions, and the rupture strength of the adhesions were evaluated. RESULTS: The type 2 and 3 adhesions were more frequent in group 1 (polypropylene mesh) and group 3 (Polypropylene+PAF), while type 0 and 1 adhesions were more frequent in group 2 (SIS). The mean rupture strength was 1, 58 N (± 0, 719 N) in group 1, 0, 42 N (± 0, 432 N) in group 2 and 1, 23 N (± 0, 432 N) in group 3. Over 50 % of the mash was covered with adhesions in 12 (80 %) cases of the group 1, in 4 (20 %) cases of the group 2 and in 16 (84, 2 %) cases of the group 3. Group 2 differed significantly (p< 0. 001) from the other groups.

We show that the finite element method (FEM) with standard unstructured meshing techniques can lead to significant efficiency gains over structured meshes with a comparable number of vertices.

40|$|Inhibitory control {{refers to}} the ability to stop impulses in favor of more {{appropriate}} behavior, and it constitutes one of the underlying cognitive functions associated with cognitive flexibility. Much attention has been given to cross-species comparisons of inhibitory control; however, less is known about how and when these abilities develop. Mapping the ontogeny of inhibitory control in different species may therefore reveal foundational elements behind cognitive processes and their evolution. In this study, we tested the development of motor self-regulation in raven chicks (Corvus corax), using two detour tasks that required inhibition of motor impulses to directly reach for a visible reward behind a barrier. One task included a <b>mesh</b> <b>barrier,</b> which partly occluded the reward, and the other task used a completely transparent barrier, the cylinder task. The results suggest that the more visible a reward is, the more difficult it is to inhibit motor impulses toward it, and further, that this inhibitory challenge gradually decreases during development. The <b>mesh</b> <b>barrier</b> is reliably detoured before the animals pass the task with the wholly transparent cylinder. As the majority of the birds begun testing as nestlings, and as we provided them with experiences they normally would not receive in a nest, it is likely that they showed the earliest possible onset of these skills. A control subject, tested at a later age, showed that the mesh detours required no particular training, but that tasks including complete transparency likely require more specific experiences. Adult ravens without explicit training are highly proficient in inhibitory detour tasks, and, together with chimpanzees, they are the best performers of all tested species in the cylinder task. Our results suggest that their skills develop early in life, around their third month. Their developmental pattern of inhibitory skills for detours resembles that of children and rhesus macaques, albeit the pace of development is markedly faster in ravens.

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates, {{by means}} of a {{numerical}} model, the possibility of using an active noise barrier to virtually reduce the acoustic transparency of a partition wall inside an enclosure. The room is modeled with the image method as a rectangular enclosure with a stationary point source; the active barrier is set up by an array of loudspeakers and error microphones and is meant to minimize the squared sound pressure on a wall {{with the use of a}} decentralized control. Simulations investigate the effects of the enclosure characteristics and of the barrier geometric parameters on the sound pressure attenuation on the controlled partition, on the whole enclosure potential energy and on the diagonal control stability. Performances are analyzed in a frequency range of 25 – 300 Hz at discrete 25 Hz steps. Influencing parameters and their effects on the system performances are identified with a statistical inference procedure. Simulation results have shown that it is possible to averagely reduce the sound pressure on the controlled partition. In the investigated configuration, the surface attenuation and the diagonal control stability are mainly driven by the distance between the loudspeakers and the error microphones and by the loudspeakers directivity; minor effects are due to the distance between the error microphones and the wall, by the wall reflectivity and by the active <b>barrier</b> grid <b>meshing.</b> Room dimensions and source position have negligible effects. Experimental results point out the validity of the model and the efficiency of the barrier in the reduction of the wall acoustic transparency...|$|R

Cohabitation with a castrated male for the same length of time resulted in no uterine growth. Simultaneous exposure to intact male urine and the presence of a castrated male, on the other hand, yielded uterine growth of a magnitude similar to that obtained by cohabitation with an intact male.

It was predicted that higher aggression would translate into experimental males winning significantly more fights than their control counterparts. However, results were rather ambiguous. A significant testosterone surge in males was only found after exposure to diestrus females. Males exposed to estrous females exhibited nearly significant testosterone surges, whereas males exposed to other males showed no significant changes in testosterone. The significant testosterone rise in males exposed to diestrus females did seem to increase aggression during fights compared to males with only male exposure.

To assess the role of the rhizosphere interactions, we intercropped a P-inefficient wheat genotype (Janz) with either the P-efficient wheat genotype (Goldmark) or chickpea in a soil with low P availability amended with 100 mg P kg− 1 as FePO 4 (FeP) or phytate. The plants were grown for 10 weeks in pots where the roots of the genotypes could intermingle (no barrier, NB), were separated by a 30 μm <b>mesh</b> (<b>mesh</b> <b>barrier,</b> MB), preventing direct root contact but allowing exchange of diffusible compounds and microorganisms, or were completely separated by a solid barrier (SB). When supplied with FeP, Janz intercropped with chickpea had higher shoot and grain dry weight (dw) and greater plant P uptake in NB and MB than in SB. Contact with roots of Janz increased shoot, grain and root dw, root length, shoot P concentration and shoot P uptake of chickpea compared to SB. Root contact between the two wheat genotypes, Janz and Goldmark, had no effect on growth and P uptake of Janz. Shoot and total P uptake by Goldmark were significantly increased in NB compared to MB or SB. In both crop combinations, root contact significantly increased total plant dw and P uptake per pot. Plant growth and P uptake were lower with phytate and not significantly affected by barrier treatment. Differences in microbial P, available P and phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere among genotypes and barrier treatments were generally small. Root contact changed microbial community structure (assessed by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis) and all crops had similar rhizosphere microbial community structure when their roots intermingled.

Continuous conventional cultivation {{has been observed}} to deplete soil organic matter, degrade soil structure, reduce water drainage and water holding capacity, increase nitrate leaching, damage the ecosystem engineer earthworm and mycorrhiza populations and increase the susceptibility of soil and crops to the impacts of climatic stress through decreased resilience to flood and drought conditions. The SoilBioHedge project aims to determine the effectiveness of using grass-clover leys linking hedgerows to arable fields in restoring functional biodiversity, soil quality and resilience to drought and excess rainfall in arable farming. Paired 70 m long ley strips have been inserted in to 4 fields. Within each field one ley {{is connected to the}} margin while in the other a small 1 m fallow area and a steel <b>mesh</b> <b>barrier</b> inserted to bedrock is being used to disconnect the ley and margin and prevent macrofaunal movement from the margin to the ley. As part of the SoilBioHedge project we are undertaking a range of analyses to establish the impacts of arable to ley conversion on key hydrological properties of agricultural soils. Soil moisture is being continuously monitored at three depths at 48 separate locations, in addition monthly manual measurements are being taken at 1158 locations. Arable-to-ley conversion is expected to increase soil macrofaunal activity especially in locations closer to hedgerows, enhancing macropore development. Therefore the proportion of water percolating into macropores, mesopores and micropores is being measured using tension infiltrometers which also allow the calculation of saturated hydraulic conductivity. Soil cores have been extracted to examine impacts on bulk and particle density and subsequently porosity, with hydraulic conductivity being measured using a lab permeameter. Here we present the results of these analyses over the first 24 months of the project. This includes the im- pacts of this arable ley conversion on soil moisture dynamics and functional macroporosit...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bacterial virulence-associated type III {{secretion}} system (T 3 SS) assembly {{requires a}} dedicated enzyme to penetrate peptidoglycan (PG). Results: We structurally characterized a T 3 SS PG-lytic enzyme, identified catalytically important residues, and characterized its activity. Conclusion: The active site {{is similar to}} lysozymes and lytic transglycosylases and interaction with the T 3 SS enhances activity. Significance: Structural information is critical for development of drugs targeting T 3 SS PG-lytic enzymes. The Gram-negative bacterium enteropathogenic Escherichia coli uses a syringe-like type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to inject virulence or “effector” proteins into the cytoplasm of host intestinal epithelial cells. To assemble, the T 3 SS must traverse both bacterial membranes, {{as well as the}} peptidoglycan layer. Peptidoglycan is made of repeating N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides cross-linked by pentapeptides to form a tight <b>mesh</b> <b>barrier.</b> Assembly of many macromolecular machines requires a dedicated peptidoglycan lytic enzyme (PG-lytic enzyme) to locally clear peptidoglycan. Here we have solved the first structure of a T 3 SS-associated PG-lytic enzyme, EtgA from enteropathogenic E. coli. Unexpectedly, the active site of EtgA has features in common with both lytic transglycosylases and hen egg white lysozyme. Most notably, the β-hairpin region resembles that of lysozyme and contains an aspartate that aligns with lysozyme Asp- 52 (a residue critical for catalysis), a conservation not observed in other previously characterized lytic transglycosylase families to which the conserved T 3 SS enzymes had been presumed to belong. Mutation of the EtgA catalytic glutamate, Glu- 42, conserved across lytic transglycosylases and hen egg white lysozyme, and this differentiating aspartate diminishes type III secretion in vivo, supporting its essential role in clearing the peptidoglycan for T 3 SS assembly. Finally, we show that EtgA forms a 1 : 1 complex with the building block of the polymerized T 3 SS inner rod component, EscI, and that this interaction enhances PG-lytic activity of EtgA in vitro, collectively providing the necessary strict localization and regulation of the lytic activity to prevent overall cell lysis...|$|R
40|$|An {{exhibition}} and public events programme, ‘Getting Rid of Ourselves’ explored the aesthetic and political possibilities of obscuring, delegating, withdrawing or complicating the conventional signs of authorship and artistic subjectivity. Through the various tactics of anonymity, collectivity, shared authorship, appropriated identities, delegated production, and financial speculation that it presented, the exhibition questioned {{the link between}} art and self-expression. Highlighting how subjectivity is treated {{as a form of}} living currency to exploit, market and sell to, the exhibition argued for the diffusion and distribution of artistic agency and intellectual property. 'Getting Rid of Ourselves' brought together practices that refuse to engage in the tireless self-promotional cycle inherent to artistic and art world labour. Instead of submitting to being exploited as forms of living currency, the exhibition posited collective creative endeavours as alternatives to individualized pursuits. Rather than presenting a series of discrete works, the exhibition attempted to perform some of the conditions that it delineated. A key tactic was to blur curatorial and artistic gestures. The installation design by Kernel, for instance, created a series of simultaneously controlling and permeable <b>mesh</b> <b>barriers</b> or cages, while the sculptural installation of Adrian Blackwell, which doubled as gallery seating for public events. Claire Fontaine’s tennis ball sculptures containing contraband, sprawling out over the floor, also added to the sensory experience of the installation, while introducing an element of instability. The title of another of their works directed viewers to instructions on how to pick locks. Another example of how artistic and curatorial gestures were blurred was Goldin+Senneby’s investment of artists’ and curatorial fees {{over the course of the}} show according to a secret algorithm. As Sam Cotter described in his review of the exhibition in C Magazine: “The exhibition is not so much an inventory of artistic strategies as a holistic alternative to these systems, functioning more as a model of self-mobilization than a collection of autonomous artworks. ” Artists participating in the exhibition were Becky Beasley, Adrian Blackwell, Heath Bunting, Jesse Darling, Kajsa Dahlberg, Claire Fontaine, Goldin + Senneby, Janez Janša Janez Janša Janez Janša, and Kernel...|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{fragmentation}} in Europe Landscape fragmentation {{caused by}} transportation infrastructure and built-up areas {{has a number}} of ecological effects. It contributes significantly to the decline and loss of wildlife populations and to the increasing endangerment of species in Europe, for example through the dissection and isolation of populations, and affects the water regime and the recreational quality of landscapes. In spite of the planning concept of preserving large unfragmented areas, fragmentation has continued to increase during the last 20 years, and many more new transportation infrastructure projects are planned, in particular in eastern Europe, which will further increase the level of landscape fragmentation significantly. Therefore, data on the degree of landscape fragmentation are needed that are suitable for comparing different regions, especially in relation to different natural landscape types and different socioeconomic conditions. This report quantitatively investigates the degree of landscape fragmentation in 28 countries in Europe for the first time for three different fragmentation geometries at three levels. The three levels include countries, regions (NUTS-X, according to the Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units), and a grid of 1 km 2 cells (LEAC grid, which is used for Land and Ecosystem Accounting activities). The report applies the method of 'effective mesh density' which quantifies {{the degree to which the}} possibilities for movement of wildlife in the landscape are interrupted by <b>barriers.</b> The effective <b>mesh</b> density values across the 28 investigated countries cover a large range, from low values in large parts of Scandinavia to very high values in western and central Europe. Many highly fragmented regions are located in Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France, Poland and the Czech Republic. High fragmentation values are mostly found in the vicinity of large urban areas and along major transportation corridors. The lowest levels of fragmentation are usually associated with mountain ranges or remoteness. Fragmentation geometry B 2 'Fragmentation of non-mountainous land areas' which includes highways up to class 4, railways and urban areas, is the most important fragmentation geometry, as it is suitable for comparing regions with differing geographical conditions like different amounts of mountains or lakes; it also encompasses the most complete set of physical barriers that may affect a large number of species. Predictive models of landscape fragmentation In the second part, this report investigates potential causes that contribute to an increased or decreased degree of landscape fragmentation and determines their relative importance. The density of the transportation network and the extent of landscape fragmentation are largely a function of interacting socioeconomic drivers such as population density and geophysical factors such as topography. Current levels of landscape fragmentation need to be interpreted within the context of these regional socioeconomic and geophysical conditions. Therefore, this report applies a set of statistical models to determine which of these factors drive the process of landscape fragmentation in Europe. We analysed the statistical relationships between landscape fragmentation and a range of predictive variables, applied these relationships to predict the likely fragmentation values for all regions in our study area, and compared actual values with predicted values. In general, the most relevant variables affecting landscape fragmentation were population density, gross domestic product per capita, volume passenger density, and the quantity of goods loaded and unloaded per capita. The amount of variation in the level of fragmentation that was explained by the predictor variables was high, ranging from 46...|$|R
40|$|For {{many species}} sexually {{selected}} signals {{are essential for}} communication between conspecifics. These signals produced by males are attractive to females and may reliably reflect competitive ability, health status and genetic identity. There is high diversity {{in the types of}} auditory, visual and olfactory signals that males produce, and males of many species invest in multiple signals. In mice, adult males invest in scent-marks and ultrasonic calls as sexual signals. Ultrasonic calls are emitted during encounters with female conspecifics, primarily during pre-copulatory sniffing and investigation. As a result, this sexually dimorphic and individually variable behaviour has been suggested to serve a specific courtship function in mice. Scent marks are also important for communication with conspecifics and provide long lasting signals of identity, health status and competitive ability to potential mates. Both male signals are therefore important in sexual communication, but it is unclear whether scent marking and calling serve separate functions. To address this, male scent marking and calling was recorded in response to female odours, a female behind a <b>mesh</b> <b>barrier,</b> a direct interaction with a female or no female cues. Male signalling investment varied according to female cue type. Further, cues that elicited a high rate of calling differed from those that elicited a high rate of scent marking. Ultrasonic calls were primarily emitted in interactions suggesting an important role in direct courtship. By contrast, the greatest number of scent marks was deposited when males were not in direct contact with female conspecifics. Consistent with the results obtained in the first experiment, scent marks are known to provide information to females {{in the absence of a}} male through long lasting cues present in urine. The distribution of scent marks also provides an honest signal of a male’s competitive ability to defend its territory. Females are highly attracted to spend time near male scent marks and are subsequently more attracted to the owners of these familiar scent marks than to equivalent unfamiliar males. Male scent can also condition a preference for its location, stimulated by a specific sex pheromone present in male urine. These acquired memories of male scent mark locations and individual scent signatures are likely to be important in allowing females to be selective and approach preferred males when ready to mate. In a natural context, females investigate multiple scent marks when territories of competing males are encountered. To reflect the complexity of scents encountered in a natural context and to assess how differences in male expression of specific scent components influence female spatial learning, conditioned place preference tests comprising multiple scents and locations were used. When multiple scents were presented simultaneously, females formed a learned preference for multiple locations of male but not female scents; darcin, a male-specific pheromone, was also required for male scent to condition a preference for its remembered location. Further, the relative amount of darcin influenced the strength of a remembered preference. The comparative composition of individual scents may therefore be important in determining female learned preferences for locations scent marked by competing males. Male scent from dominant territory owners also stimulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs of female mice, areas of the mammalian brain associated with spatial learning and olfactory processing. In hippocampal neurogenesis, neurons are generated and remain in their mature form within this same structure; by contrast, the germinal area for olfactory neurons is present in the forebrain and newly generated cells must migrate over long distances before being incorporated into existing circuits. To investigate whether scent components that stimulate spatial learning also stimulate neurogenesis in females, immature hippocampal neurons and proliferating cells in the forebrain were quantified in female mice exposed to different male scents or scent components. The results suggest darcin, a male specific MUP that stimulates spatial learning, also stimulates hippocampal and olfactory neurogenesis in females. This male pheromone therefore appears to play a role in the immediate behavioural response and the long-term neurological change associated with exposure to male scents...|$|R
