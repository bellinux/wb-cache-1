50|$|The gulf {{sedimentary}} basin stratigraphic section consists of prerift Paleozoic to Oligocene clastic rocks and carbonates, and synrift and postrift Miocene to Holocene clastics and evaporites.Three large oil fields {{are in the}} gulf: the El Morgan discovered in 1964, <b>Belayim</b> discovered in 1955, and the October Field discovered in 1977. The October Field produces from the Cretaceous Nubia Formation, the Upper Cretaceous Nezzazat Formation, the Miocene Nukhul Formation, and the Miocene Asl Member of the Upper Rudeis Formation.|$|E
50|$|This zone, {{also known}} as the Galala-Abu Zenima Accommodation Zone, marks a change in fault {{polarity}} from NE-dipping in the Darag Basin to the north to SE-dipping to the south in the <b>Belayim</b> province. It coincides with the location of the Cretaceous inversion structure, the Wadi Araba anticline. It has been suggested that the presence of this structure acted as a barrier to northward propagation of the rift. Its location may also be partly controlled by the Rehba Shear Zone in the underlying basement.|$|E
50|$|The {{deepening}} of {{the rift}} is {{recorded by the}} lower Miocene Rudeis Formation. The lower part, consisting of marls and sandstones, is overlain by coarse sandstones and conglomerates reflecting a rapid increase in rift topography at that time. The Kareem Formation saw the first development of evaporites, indicating basin restriction, followed by open marine shales, as coarse clastic deposition began to reduce in the middle Miocene. Shales, anhydrite, halite and reefal limestones of the uppermost middle Miocene <b>Belayim</b> lie unconformably on the Kareem. More restricted basin conditions continued with the upper Miocene South Gharib and Zeit Formations with deposition of halite with some anhydrite and mudstone, representing the last syn-rift deposits.|$|E
30|$|Figure  8 b {{displays}} {{the sum of}} gravity effects due to the evaporite group (Kareem, <b>Belayim,</b> South Gharib, and Zeit). This sequence exerts {{a positive effect on}} the observed gravity field because of the high density of the anhydrite (<b>Belayim)</b> rocks. The gravity effect of these rock units seems to be in opposite direction to the former one (Fig.  8 a). It decreases gradually from northeast to southwest, where the contour values range from −[*] 2  mGal at RB B- 1 well to about 1  mGal at RB-A 1 well. The data derived from the drilled wells indicate that the evaporite rocks are generally deposited in a large thickness throughout the study area and increases in the northeast direction. The positive gravity effect of the evaporites seriously distorts the effect of the underlying clastic rocks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGeochemical {{evaluation}} of <b>Belayim</b> Marine Oil Field using TOC and Rock Eval Pyrolysis investigations {{for a total}} of 19 cutting samples (9 samples covering (Nubia-B Formation) from well BM- 57, and 10 samples covering (Nubia-A, B Formations) from well BM- 65) was performed. Furthermore, geochemistry analyses of two crude oil samples from Wells BM- 29 and BM- 70, which are recovered from the Upper Rudeis Formation were performed. The BM- 70 oil sample is recovered by Drill Steam Testing, while the BM- 29 oil sample is taken from the flow output. Moreover, the oil samples were subjected to GC/GC-MS analysis (Biomarker) by StratoChem Company. In general, TOC analyses showed that the Nubia-A and B formation sediments are fairly immature compared to good source rocks with very high Hydrogen Index indicative of kerogen type II. The geochemical investigations of two oil samples indicate that the Upper Rudeis oil of <b>Belayim</b> Marine was derived from a marine carbonate rich source, which is relatively rich in algal organic matter and has moderate sulfur content. The maturity of the analyzed oils (about 0. 75 % R 0) falls short from the stage of peak hydrocarbon generation which is known to be reached at about 0. 85 % R 0...|$|E
30|$|Renewed rifting and {{subsidence}} {{took place}} in the southern Gulf of Suez in the late Miocene-Pliocene, resulting in deposition of the <b>Belayim,</b> South Gharib, and Zeit formations (Figs.  1, 2). Late Pleistocene-Holocene deformation at Gebel el Zeit is demonstrated by faulting within the Pleistocene successions, where outcrops of Pleistocene reefs and ooid sand are found up to 150  m above the present sea level (Bosworth and Taviani 1996). The late Pleistocene-Holocene uplift appears associated with tilting since very young Pleistocene reefal deposits are present {{on the east side of}} Gebel el Zeit 10 – 18  m (32.8 – 59.04  ft) above sea level but are not raised at Zeit Bay to the southwest (Evans 1990). Modern earthquakes in the area reflect active faulting (Jackson et al. 1988).|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on the planktonic and benthonic foraminiferal content {{the lower}} and middle Miocene {{successions}} at the Gulf of Suez in Egypt {{have been identified}} (30 planktonic species and 101 benthonic species), seven paleoecologic parameters are studied, which include; foraminiferal frequency; predominance of the planktonic foraminiferal groups; predominance of benthonic foraminiferal groups, diversity of the foraminiferal species, P/B foraminiferal ratio, A/C foraminiferal ratio and benthonic genus/genera predominance. According to this study, the studied successions are divided into five ecozones. The paleoenvironment of each ecozone is deduced. The deduced paleoenvironments point to outer neritic for the Nukhul formation, middle neritic to inner neritic for the Rudeis formation, inner neritic to littoral for the Kareem formation and littoral neritic for the <b>Belayim</b> formation. A proposed paleobathymetric curve is presented. The interpretation of this curve helped to deduce the tectonic history of the early and middle Miocene in the studied areas...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThirteen 2 D seismic {{lines were}} {{interpreted}} {{with the help}} of well velocity and time-depth trace conversion to construct the structure-tectonic maps. This is to characterize the different stratigraphic tops of Al-Amal area, as well as to confirm the validity of the proposed structural model. Most of the available seismic data in Al-Amal area were investigated and reviewed to select the best quality set. In order to study the detailed structural elements based on the 3 D seismic lines; six depth structure contour maps were constructed on the tops of Zeit, South Gharib, <b>Belayim,</b> Kareem, Nukhul and Matulla formations from top downward. Interpretation was aided by the missing sections detected from the available well tops and dip-meter data as well. These maps indicate that, both of Miocene and Pre-Miocene formations in Al-Amal field were affected by elongated tilted graben blocks trending in the NW–SE directions and bounded by two sets of faults, which are down throwing toward the west and eastern directions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{assesses the}} {{hydrocarbon}} source rocks of the <b>Belayim</b> oilfields, central Gulf of Suez, Egypt. Detailed geochemical methods, including liquid chromatography, gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, {{are used to}} characterize organic-rich facies of the Turonian–Eocene deposits. Crude oil samples are analyzed using C 7 and stable carbon isotopes, in addition to analysis of the extracts, in order to throw light on the organic matter source, composition, and thermal maturity. The source rocks are mainly derived from algae and bacteria deposited under normal saline and reducing palaeoenvironmental conditions, with a minimal contribution from terrestrial organic and mainly clay-poor source rocks. This {{is evidenced by the}} n-alkane distribution, the pristane/phytane, homohopane, gammacerane index, the high concentration of cholestane, the presence of the C 30 n-propylcholestanes and low diasteranes ratios. The source rock extracts range from immature to marginally mature, based on biomarker maturity-related parameters. A similar scenario is envisaged from the crude oil samples which showed a partial positive correlation with the source rocks of the Eocene Thebes Formation, and the Upper Cretaceous Brown Limestone. Our data suggest that Turonian–Santonian Matulla Formation samples may signify the presence of some oil in the study area...|$|E
30|$|The gravity {{effect is}} very {{sensitive}} to density contrast among different rock units, which significantly affect the results. Therefore, to calculate and remove {{the effect of the}} sedimentary succession from the gravity data, it must carefully determine the density of various layers above the datum. Figure  7 a shows the density against depth as measured in RB A- 1 and RB B- 1 wells. It is evident that the distribution of the formation density shows a great similarity for both two wells. The plot shows that the density does not linearly correlate with depth, but varies with the lithology. The upper sequence (post-Zeit) has the lowest density values (~[*] 2  g/cm 3 at 2000  ft), as determined at RB A- 1 well. The density of evaporites that exist in Kareem, <b>Belayim,</b> South Gharib, and Zeit formations is very variable according to lithology (facies change to clastics). The evaporite rocks consists mainly of anhydrite (high density is about[*]>[*] 2.85  g/cm 3), salt rocks of low density (about 2.1  g/cm 3), and interbeds of sands/shale of medium density (is ~[*] 2.4  g/cm 3). The density of the evaporite may differ from layer to anther depending on the percentage of these volatiles into the sequence.|$|E
30|$|The stratigraphic {{units in}} Ras Budran oil field {{range in age}} from Precambrian to recent (Chowdhary and Taha 1987). The {{available}} data (GR, DT, Nphi, RHOB, LLD, and LLM) of RB-A 1 well, drilled {{in the northern part of}} the study area has been interpreted as a stratigraphic sequence (Fig.  6). Three main phases have been shown in the geologic section of this region: the first one ranging in age from Paleozoic to Eocene and interval from 12, 170 to 8675  ft. It is lithologically consists mainly of sandstone intercalated with thin beds of shale. The pre-Miocene interval represents that Nubia (A and B), Raha, Matulla, Watt, Sudr, and Thebes formations are considered as reservoir rock units in the study area, while Paleozoic Nubia (C and D) acts as source rock. The second phase is represented by Early Miocene which ranges in depth from 8675 to 6650  ft, containing Nukhul, lower Rudeis and Upper Rudeis formations. The interval is lithologically characterized by sandy shale which acts as a source rock and sometimes considered as reservoir rock. The third phase of Middle–Late Miocene age consists of evaporite group (Kareem, <b>Belayim,</b> South Gharib, and Zeit formations). It acts essentially as a cap rock or seal of the oil accumulation with no importance as source or reservoir (Hassouba et al. 1994; Zein El-Din et al. 1995; Zein El-Din et al. 1997). The sandstone intervals of Thebes, Raha, and Nubia (A and B) formations represent the most important reservoir intervals. Meanwhile, the evaporate group is the most significant cap rock in Ras Budran oil field.|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via [URL] and biomarker characteristics of organic facies recovered from Cretaceous?Miocene well samples in the Ras El Bahar Oilfield, southwest Gulf of Suez, and their correlation with lithologies, environments of deposition and thermal maturity have provided a sound basis for determining their source potential for hydrocarbons. In addition to palynofacies analysis, TOC/Rock-Eval pyrolysis, kerogen concentrates, bitumen extraction, carbon isotopes and saturated and aromatic biomarkers enable qualitative and quantitative assessments of sedimentary organic matter to be made. The results obtained from Rock-Eval pyrolysis and molecular biomarker data indicate {{that most of the}} samples come from horizons that have fair to good hydrocarbon generation potential in the study area. The Upper Cretaceous?Paleocene-Lower Eocene samples contain mostly Type-II to Type-III organic matter with the capability of generating oil and gas. The sediments concerned accumulated in dysoxic?anoxic marine environments. By contrast, the Miocene rocks yielded mainly Type-III and Type-II/III organic matter with mainly gas-generating potential. These rocks reflect deposition in a marine environment into which there was significant terrigenous input. Three palynofacies types have been recognized. The first (A) consists of Type-III gas-prone kerogen and is typical of the Early?Middle Miocene <b>Belayim,</b> Kareem and upper Rudeis formations. The second (B) has mixed oil and gas features and characterizes the remainder of the Rudeis Formation. The third association (C) is dominated by amorphous organic matter, classified as borderline Type-II oil-prone kerogen, and is typical of the Matulla (Turonian?Santonian) and Wata (Turonian) formations. Rock-Eval Tmax, PI, hopane and sterane biomarkers consistently indicate an immature to early mature stage of thermal maturity for the whole of the studied successionauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
