40|$|Human milk is {{the natural}} {{creation}} of a food that contains everything a newborn child needs. Therefore, breast-feeding is regarded as gold standard for the infant‘s nutrition. It is associated with various beneficial effects on the newborn’s health. In breast-fed children, the incidence of allergic and inflammatory conditions is decreased. The question that is intensely investigated but still not fully answered is which components of human milk influence the <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child,</b> so that it develops advantages in growth, health status and immunity over formula-fed children...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine if 6 weeks of probiotic intake would be able to modulate the immune system in women who had recently delivered and were breast-feeding. The design consisted of a randomised, controlled and double-blind nutritional intervention study with parallel groups with a sample size of 104 women. The main variable is the T helper type 1 /T helper type 2 (Th 1 /Th 2) profile determined by measuring interferon-gamma (Th 1) and IL- 4 (Th 2) values in peripheral blood by flow cytometry. The modifications of cytokines were evaluated in maternal milk by cytometric bead array in a flow cytometer and ELISA at three stages of breast-feeding: colostrum, early milk (10 d) and mature milk (45 d). Additionally, the anthropometry and infectious and allergic episodes in the newborn were followed up throughout the first 6 months of life. After the consumption of milk fermented with Lactobacillus casei during the puerperium, we observed a nonsignificant increase in T and B lymphocytes and a significant increase in natural killer cells. A decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha in maternal milk and fewer gastrointestinal disturbances were also observed in the <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child</b> of the mothers who consumed L. casei. The intake of milk fermented with L. casei during the lactation period modestly contributes to the modulation of the mother's immunological response after delivery and decreases the incidence of gastrointestinal episodes in the <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{literature}} {{regarding the}} association between breast-feeding and atopic diseases has been contradictory. Objective: We have assessed the relationship between breast-feeding and atopic disorders in a cohort followed into middle age. Methods: The Tasmanian Asthma Study is a population-based prospective cohort study that has followed participants {{from the age of}} 7 to 44 years. Exclusive breast-feeding in the first 3 months of life was examined as a risk factor for atopic diseases by using multiple logistic regression and generalized estimating equation analyses. Results: At age 7 years, exclusively <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> with a maternal history of atopy had a marginally lesser risk of current asthma than those not exclusively breast-fed (odds ratio [OR], 0. 8; 95 % CI, 0. 6 - 1. 0). However, after age 7 years, the risk reversed, and exclusively <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> had an increased risk of current asthma at 14 (OR, 1. 46; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 2. 07), 32 (OR, 1. 84; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 3. 3), and 44 (OR, 1. 57; 95 % CI, 1. 15 - 2. 14) years. Exclusively <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> also had a reduced risk of food allergy at age 7 years but an increased risk of food allergy (OR, 1. 26; 95 % CI, 1. 1 - 1. 5) and allergic rhinitis (OR, 1. 2; 95 % CI, 1. 0 - 1. 3) at 44 years. Conclusion: Exclusively breast-fed babies with a maternal history of atopy were less likely to develop asthma before the age of 7 years, but more likely to develop asthma after the age of 7 years. Clinical implications: The current recommendation to breast-feed high-risk infants for protection against early wheezing illness can be confirmed.

40|$|A {{woman was}} treated for atopic {{dermatitis}} with coal tar containing ointments. Coal tar containing ointments contain genotoxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Over a period of 50 days the accumulated dose of different coal tar containing ointments treatments corresponded to 993 mg of pyrene and 464 mg of benz[a]pyrene. During this treatment she gave breast milk to her 3 -month-old daughter. Analysis of urine samples from the <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child</b> showed elevated levels of urinary excretion of a metabolite of pyrene (1 -hydroxypyrene, 1 -OHP). These levels {{were in the same}} range as urinary excretion levels of this metabolite observed in the mother's urine. As no pyrene was observed in breast milk at a limit of determination of 0. 0035 micromol/L, transfer of pyrene from mother to child via breast milk is not likely. Also, a low level of 1 -hydroxypyrene observed in the mother's milk did not account for the observed urinary excretion levels in the child. It must therefore be assumed that pyrene was transferred from mother to child via another route, presumably direct skin-to-skin or skin-to-mouth contact. Dermatologists should inform their patients who receive treatment with coal tar containing ointments of the risk of transfer of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by skin-to-skin or skin-to-mouth contact...|$|E
40|$|Breast cancer ranks {{second or}} third to uterine cervix cancer and stomach cancer {{as a cause of}} death in women, and as a common site of primary cancer. The large {{difference}} in its incidence between Westernized and non-Westernized countries is remarkable. There is a linear increase with age that is observed in Western countries, which are high-incidence areas, on the contrary to the inverted V shape curve seen in Asian countries. Epidemiologic studies conducted in Korea have shown that an older age, a family history of breast cancer, early menarche, late menopause, late full-term pregnancy, and never having had a <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child</b> are primary risk factors in the development of breast cancer. The estrogen-augmented-by-progesterone hypothesis explains the roles of these factors to some extent.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{issues of}} concern for protecting foetuses and breast-fed children of occupationally exposed women in nuclear medicine from unnecessary exposure of ionising radiation. The protection principle is to ensure {{the same level of}} protection for the foetus and child as for the general public. Therefore international radiation protection standards recommend a dose constraint of 1. mSv to a foetus during the remaining time of pregnancy after it is known/declared and a yearly dose constraint of 1. mSv to a <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child.</b> It is not self-evident how to guarantee this level of radiation protection. The exposure situation in nuclear medicine is complex. Exploring existing reported occupational exposure levels suggests great variability between work tasks and facilities. The standards and guidelines found give no detailed advice. Therefore each facility needs to systematically review external and internal exposure levels in order to plan appropriate protection measures and issue their own guidelines and rules. One strategy might be that each facility defines tasks that do not require any restrictions and lists such duties that are not suitable to do when pregnant or breastfeeding, taking also potential exposure levels into consideration. This paper gives examples of such types of work. Information to the staff about the necessity of declaring pregnancy or breastfeeding is of fundamental importance. The internal policies issued by the hospital management should make clear the basis for taking care of pregnant and breastfeeding employees...|$|E

The aims of this study were to determine the concentrations of salivary IgA and IgE levels in <b>breast-fed</b> and formula-fed <b>children</b> in infancy period. Methods and Materials: Totally, 80 healthy 5 years old children were included in the study. According to type of feeding in infancy period, the children divided into two groups: 50 breast-fed and 30 formula-fed. One milliliter of saliva was collected from each participant, centrifuged, and stored at - 70) C. The salivary IgA and IgE concentrations were measured, using ELISA technique. Results: In <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children,</b> the salivary IgA level (39. 6 mg/l ± 17. 3) was significantly higher than that in formula-fed children (26. 9 mg/l ± 14) (P= 0. 0001). However, the salivary IgE level was significantly lower in <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children,</b> comparing with formula fed ones (5. 01 IU/ml ± 19. 70 vs. 11. 74 IU/ml ± 39. 40) (P= 0. 047). Discussion: These results suggest that breast feeding enhances salivary IgA level in the early period of life which may contribute in oral cavity immunity. Higher salivary IgE level observed in formula-fed subjects may have a potential role in development of allergic or inflammatory reactions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the {{long-term}} safety of infant feeding interventions aimed at reducing breast milk HIV transmission in Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 2001 - 2005, HIV-infected pregnant women having received in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, a peripartum antiretroviral prophylaxis were presented antenatally with infant feeding interventions: either artificial feeding, or exclusive breast-feeding and then early cessation from 4 mo of age. Nutritional counseling and clinical management were provided for 2 y. Breast-milk substitutes were provided for free. The primary outcome was the occurrence of adverse health outcomes in children, defined as validated morbid events (diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, or malnutrition) or severe events (hospitalization or death). Hazards ratios to compare formula-fed versus short-term <b>breast-fed</b> (reference) <b>children</b> were adjusted for confounders (baseline covariates and pediatric HIV status as a time-dependant covariate). The 18 -mo mortality rates were also compared to those observed in the Ditrame historical trial, which was conducted at the same sites in 1995 - 1998, and in which long-term breast-feeding was practiced {{in the absence of any}} specific infant feeding intervention. Of the 557 live-born children, 262 (47 %) were breast-fed for a median of 4 mo, whereas 295 were formula-fed. Over the 2 -y follow-up period, 37 % of the formula-fed and 34 % of the short-term <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> remained free from any adverse health outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1. 10; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 87 - 1. 38; p = 0. 43). The 2 -y probability of presenting with a severe event was the same among formula-fed (14 %) and short-term <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> (15 %) (adjusted HR, 1. 19; 95 % CI, 0. 75 - 1. 91; p = 0. 44). An overall 18 -mo probability of survival of 96 % was observed among both HIV-uninfected short-term and formula-fed children, which was similar to the 95 % probability observed in the long-term breast-fed ones of the Ditrame trial. CONCLUSIONS: The 2 -y rates of adverse health outcomes were similar among short-term <b>breast-fed</b> and formula-fed <b>children.</b> Mortality rates did not differ significantly between these two groups and, after adjustment for pediatric HIV status, were similar to those observed among long-term <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children.</b> Given appropriate nutritional counseling and care, access to clean water, and a supply of breast-milk substitutes, these alternatives to prolonged breast-feeding can be safe interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in urban African settings...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Nutrition during fetal {{life and}} early {{childhood}} {{is thought to}} {{play a crucial role}} in the risk for developing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases in the future adult and branched chain amino acids (BCAA) intake may play a role in the development of obesity. The aim of this study was to compare the breast milk amino acid profiles of obese and normal weight (control) breast-feeding mothers. Methods: Fifty obese and 50 control breast-feeding mothers were enrolled. Age and parity were similar in both groups. Breast milk samples were collected at the end of the first month of lactation. Free amino acid (FAA) concentrations in breast milk were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Comparisons between groups were performed using a two-tailed paired t test. Results: We analyzed 45 breast milk samples from each group. Body mass index was 34. 3 +/- 3. 9 kg/m(2) in the obese group and 21. 6 +/- 1. 4 kg/m(2) in the control group (P < 10 (- 4)). BCAA concentrations were higher in breast milk of obese mothers (95. 5 +/- 38. 2 mu M versus 79. 8 +/- 30. 9 mu M; P = 0. 037), as was tyrosine concentration (13. 8 +/- 7. 1 mu M versus 10. 6 +/- 5. 2 mu M; P = 0. 016). Conclusion: The mature breast milk of obese mothers contained 20 % more BCAA and 30 % more tyrosine than breast milk of control mothers.

40|$|HAMLET (human α-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells) is a protein-lipid {{complex that}} induces apoptosis-like death in tumor cells, but leaves fully {{differentiated}} cells unaffected. This review summarizes {{the information on}} the in vivo effects of HAMLET in patients and tumor models, on the tumor cell biology, and on the molecular characteristics of the complex. HAMLET limits the progression of human glioblastomas in a xenograft model and removes skin papillomas in patients. This broad anti-tumor activity includes > 40 different lymphomas and carcinomas and apoptosis is independent of p 53 or bcl- 2. In tumor cells, HAMLET enters the cytoplasm, translocates to the perinuclear area, and enters the nuclei, where it accumulates. HAMLET binds strongly to histones and disrupts the chromatin organization. In the cytoplasm, HAMLET targets ribosomes and activates caspases. The formation of HAMLET relies on the propensity of α-lactalbumin to alter its conformation when the strongly bound Ca 2 + ion is released and the protein adopts the apo-conformation that exposes a new fatty acid binding site. Oleic acid (C 18 : 1, 9 cis) fits this site with high specificity, and stabilizes the altered protein conformation. The results illustrate how protein folding variants may be beneficial, and how their formation in peripheral tissues may depend on the folding change and the availability of the lipid cofactor. One example is the acid pH in the stomach of the <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child</b> that promotes the formation of HAMLET This mechanism may contribute to the protective effect of breastfeeding against childhood tumors. We propose that HAMLET should be explored as a novel approach to tumor therapy...|$|E

At approximately 2 h after oral administration, a maximum concentration of 5. 6 mg/liter was determined in plasma; the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) amounted to 70. 3 mg. h/liter, and the elimination half-life in the postdistributive phase was 8 h. Total systemic clearance was 97. 3 ml/min, and urinary excretion was 38 % of the dose within 48 h. In addition, 8. 6 % of the N-demethyl metabolite and 4. 4 % of the N-oxide metabolite were recovered from urine. In comparison with previous results obtained with healthy male volunteers, the time to reach maximum concentrations in plasma was twice as long in the nursing women, and total clearance as well as urinary elimination were reduced by 25 %. In breast milk, the mean maximum concentration was 3. 5 mg/liter, which was reached 2. 6 h after drug administration. The elimination half-life of fleroxacin in milk was identical to that in plasma, and the AUC reached 43. 3 mg. h/liter. On the basis of the comparison of the AUC in milk versus the AUC in plasma, the proportion of fleroxacin penetration into milk was 62 %. The cumulative excretion in milk amounted to only 0. 219 mg within 48 h. On the basis of an average daily intake of milk of a <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child</b> of 150 ml/kg of body weight, the maximum daily ingested fleroxacin dose would not exceed 10 mg.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of interventions, 20 % of infants born to women {{infected}} with HIV acquire infection from their mother at or before delivery. A further 15 % are infected through breast feeding. Prenatal testing for HIV allows infected women to be reliably identified {{so that they can}} receive antiretroviral therapy and, in countries with safe water supplies, be advised not to breast feed. These and other interventions can reduce the risk of transmission to 5 % or less. Economic evaluations of prenatal testing for HIV are reviewed and compared in this article, and future research priorities outlined. These studies set the costs of testing and intervention against the averted lifetime costs of paediatric infection, and generate estimates of the HIV prevalence threshold above which there would be a net cost saving, or calculate the cost per life-year saved given a particular prevalence. In the developed world, prenatal testing has been adopted in many countries, and recent economic analyses broadly support this. Future research is likely to focus on the incremental benefits of different antiretroviral regimens in lowering transmission rates still further, with or without elective caesarean section, and the possibility that some may lead to adverse effects in uninfected infants exposed to them in utero. Some earlier assessments in resource-poor settings concluded that prenatal testing was unaffordable or of doubtful cost effectiveness. This negative conclusion appears {{to be the result of}} very low estimates of the lifetime costs of paediatric HIV infection, together with developed world conceptions of pre-test counselling. The demonstration that nevirapine reduces transmission risk at a low cost has transformed the outlook, and there is hope that antiretrovirals can act prophylactically to prevent infection of the <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child.</b> However, to achieve a sustained reduction in vertical transmission there may be a need to evaluate the need for a strengthened infrastructure to deliver prenatal HIV testing and treatment, as well as programmes to reduce HIV incidence in adults.

As compared to food, other sources and pathways are of minor importance. Food of animal origin contributes most, although human exposure begins with atmospheric emissions depositing these compounds on plant surfaces. In the meantime, a possible additional body burden from cardboard containers for cow's milk and coffee filters has been practically excluded. Of the 210 existing PCDDs and PCDFs, only 15 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted isomers with a characteristic congener pattern {{can be found in}} samples of human origin.

Human data revealed a dependency of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins/polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) levels on age. In human milk, levels became reduced with the number of children born to mothers and duration of breast-feeding period. The average daily intake for a <b>breast-fed</b> <b>child</b> has been calculated to be 17 pg 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD/kg body weight per day and 142 pg TEqs/kg body weight per day, respectively.

Methods: The Tasmanian Asthma Study is a population-based prospective cohort study that has followed participants {{from the age of}} 7 to 44 years. Exclusive breast-feeding in the first 3 months of life was examined as a risk factor for atopic diseases by using multiple logistic regression and generalized estimating equation analyses. Results: At age 7 years, exclusively <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> with a maternal history of atopy had a marginally lesser risk of current asthma than those not exclusively breast-fed (odds ratio [OR], 0. 8; 95...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that central nervous system is well {{protected}} in <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children,</b> recognized in decreased incidence of multiple sclerosis, infectious and malignant diseases of the central nervous system, sudden infant death syndrome, 5 th day convulsion, and botulism {{as well as an}} increase in IQ rates. In this retrospective study we have found also an indirect correlation between in incidence of febrile convulsion and length of breast-feeding. Among 270 cases of febrile convulsion 144 (53. 3 %) were fed with non-human milk, 93 (34. 4 %) had a history of breast feeding for less than 12 months and only 33 (12. 2 %) were breast fed for more than 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{persistent}} diarrhea {{were evaluated}} for predisposing factors and following characteristics found: 1 -There was a reverse {{relation between the}} age of the patient and persistent diarrhea, especially under the age one year. 2 -Patient diarrhea is more infrequent in <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> that in non breast-fed. 3 -Children who received antibiotics in the last 14 days were more prone to persistent diarrhea. 4 -Children whose diarrhea contained mucus or blood at the beginning were more prone to persistent diarrhea than those who had watery diarrhea. 5 -There was a reverse relation between the mothers’ education and developing persistent diarrhea in children. Thus, to prevent developing of persistent diarrhea, breast-feeding, avoiding unnecessary and uncritical antibiotic administration in diarrhea and appropriate teaching of the mothers, is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Coeliac disease (CD) {{development}} involves genetic (HLA-DQ 2 /DQ 8) {{and environmental}} factors. Herein, {{the influence of}} the HLA-DQ genotype on the gut colonization process of <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> was determined. Twenty newborns, with at least one first-degree relative with CD, were classified according to their HLA-DQ genotype into high, intermediate and low genetic risk groups, showing 24 - 28 %, 7 - 8 % and less than 1 % probability to develop CD, respectively. Faecal microbiota was analysed at 7 days, 1 and 4 months of children’s age by fluorescence in situ hybridization. When considering all data, Bacteroides-Prevotella group proportions were higher (P< 0. 05) in the high than in the intermediate and low genetic risk groups. Gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Streptococcus-Lactococcus, E. rectale-C...|$|R
40|$|On hundred milk or {{colostrum}} {{samples from}} 78 mothers with chronic Chagas' disease were parasitologically studied for Trypanosoma cruzi infection {{by means of}} direct examination and inoculation of mice. The mice were submitted to direct bllod examination three times a week. At the end of 45 days, xenodiagnosis and indirect immunofluorescent test (IFAT) for T. cruzi antibodies were {{carried out in the}} animals. No parasitized sample was observed even though five mothers had parasitemia at milk collection. In addition, 97 <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> of chronic chagasic mothers, born free of infection, were tested for IgG antibodies to T. cruzi using IFAT. No case of T. cruzi infection was detected. The authors conclude that breast-feeding should not be avoided for children for chronic chagasic women. However, as these mothers had intermittent parasitemia, they should avoid nursing when there is nipple bleeding...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Data were {{analyzed}} from a cross-sectional nu trition surveillance survey {{to determine the}} association between extended breast-feeding and growth. The sample consisted of 2148 initially <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> between 12 and 47 mo of age. Breast-feeding for> 24 mo {{was associated with a}} greater height for-age Z score, and breast-feeding for> 18 mo was associated with greater weight-for-age and weight-for-height Z scores. These results remained significant after the number of food groups being consumed at 12 mo of age, age when the selected food items were first given to a child, the consumption of pow dered milk, recent infections, age, sex, birth order, birth weight, county of residence, father's occupation, and mother's education were controlled for. These results suggest that extended breast feeding in this population, in which food was introduced late in infancy, was associated with improved nutritional status as mea sured by standard anthropometric indicators.

40|$|Human {{health is}} {{to a large}} extent a {{reflection}} of the nature of his diet. Eating habits of the Roma community is a result of different ethno-culture, higher degree of poverty, lack of education, unemployment and lack of knowledge about nutrition. Nutrition of the Roma children in many ways replicates the deficiencies and errors at their parents – mainly inadequate intake of fruit and vegetables, relatively low intake of milk and milk products, and in contrast, the diet is dominated by inappropriate consumption of meat, white bread, sugary drinks and sweets. Wrong is also low number of daily meals. A positive phenomenon is the higher proportion of <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children</b> in the comparison of the majority population, as well as its longer duration. Inadequacy of the diet, of course, along with other factors, reflects the different anthropometric parameters of Roma children, blood pressure and serum lipids...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{evidence}} for using breast-milk vitamin A {{as an indicator of}} vitamin A status and provides technical information for researchers who want to use this indicator to assess the vitamin A status of women and <b>breast-fed</b> <b>children.</b> Breast-milk vitamin A is a unique indicator for assessing the vitamin A status of lactating women and their breast-fed infants, and has recently been recommended by WHO for use in monitoring global elimination of vitamin A deficiency. Assessing breast-milk vitamin A is less invasive than alternative approaches for assessing a mother's vitamin A status and not at all invasive for her infant. Collection of milk samples in the field is generally feasible and acceptable. Breast-milk vitamin A appears to be an especially good indicator for measuring the impact of vitamin A interventions on women and infants, and for this purpose, it is more responsive than other indicators...|$|R
