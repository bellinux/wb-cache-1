5|$|Hines led sixty {{men from}} Toronto, Ontario, on August 25, 1864. They arrived during the Democratic Party National Convention held in Chicago that year. The Copperheads had told Hines {{to wait until}} that time, as they said that 50,000 Copperheads would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> event. However, encountering Copperhead {{hesitation}} to assist Hines and his force, and with Federal authorities apparently knowledgeable of the plot, Hines and his men were forced to flee Chicago on August 30, 1864. Many of the men thought Anderson {{may have been a}} double agent, forcing him to leave the group. A second attempt to free the Camp Douglas Confederate prisoners occurred during the United States Presidential Election of 1864, but that plan was also foiled.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms he is going to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins kissing her and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E

500|$|Apart from Lana, Clark had {{a growing}} {{relationship}} with Lois. Season five saw the melting {{of the ice}} between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, {{and the fact that}} both would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life. His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time.|$|E
500|$|One of Lois's key {{relationships}} is with Clark, who is {{her husband in}} the comics. For Smallville, the characters' relationship is in constant development. Darren Swimmer describes the relationship between Lois and Clark in season five as [...] "a bit of a melting of the ice". The two characters continue to [...] "butt heads", but the audience can see where there is a growing attraction and that either would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other in a time of need. According to Erica Durance, in season five it is not yet clear if either character realizes the attraction, but the joking between the two characters represents a foreshadowing of a greater relationship. Durance believes that because of Lois's self-imposed walls, even if she thought about Clark in a romantic notion for just an instant she would immediately make it out to be a joke because she is not ready for that type of closeness, yet. The actress sees season five as being too soon for the characters to be [...] "in-love" [...] because they are still getting to know each other. Writer Brian Peterson describes Lois's relationship with Oliver Queen in season six as a precursor to her future relationship with Clark. As Peterson sees it, it is the dynamic between her and Oliver, with her willingness to accept Oliver's secret identity as Green Arrow as mirroring the relationship she will have with Clark. As far as season six is concerned, the relationship between Lois and Clark is still undefined for the audience. As Durance describes it, neither character is willing to put an official label on their relationship. The pair has learned to deal with each other's [...] "quirks", but there are still moments that both feel uncomfortable with. Instead at this point, Durance believes that Clark and Lois are satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother-sister friendship" [...] label, than trying to discover how they both truly feel about each other.|$|E

2500|$|His {{appointment}} {{as head of}} the United States Information Agency was seen as a vote of confidence in the agency, which provided the official views of the government to the public in other nations. The USIA had been under fire during the McCarthy era, and Murrow reappointed at least one of McCarthy's targets, Reed Harris. Murrow insisted on a high level of presidential access, telling Kennedy, [...] "If you want me in on the landings, I'd better <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> takeoffs." [...] However, the early effects of cancer kept him from taking {{an active role in the}} Bay of Pigs Invasion planning. He did advise the president during the Cuban Missile Crisis but was ill at the time the president was assassinated. Murrow was drawn into Vietnam because the USIA was assigned to convince reporters in Saigon that the government of Ngo Dinh Diem embodied the hopes and dreams of the Vietnamese people. Murrow knew the Diem government did no such thing. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Murrow did so but resigned in early 1964, citing illness. Before his departure, his last recommendation was of Barry Zorthian to be chief spokesman for the U.S. government in Saigon, Vietnam.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 February 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that Westbrook would reprise the role {{for a few}} episodes. Her return will coincide with Kemp's return as Sam's brother Grant and Windsor's final appearance as Sam's mother Peggy. Of her return Westbrook said, 'I'm really excited to be going back to EastEnders". Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen. Sam will only be back for a few episodes, but these scenes are bound to go down in the soap's history." [...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock. It's obviously {{been a long time since}} anyone has seen her and she is trouble through and through. But Peggy is her mum, so of course she had to <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't be going back to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do what they tell me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what they always do use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab. I wish @bbceastenders would listen to the public more. But either way I'm grateful of the 4 episodes I got to film." [...] Her return scenes aired on 30 June with her final scenes aired on 8 July 2016. In March 2017, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising her role as Sam but feared the show would just use her for publicity. On 11 May 2017, Westbrook claimed during an interview on Loose Women that she would be reprising her role as Sam later in the year, however an EastEnders source denied this, saying, [...] "There are no plans for Danniella to return, it's just not going to happen. It's very odd that she keeps harping on about her return to the soap cause it has plainly never been discussed." ...|$|E
