5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex.

5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> another potential confounder.|$|E

25|$|Many psychometricians {{are also}} {{concerned}} with finding and eliminating test bias from their psychological tests. Test <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> {{a form of}} systematic (i.e., non-random) error which leads to examinees from one demographic group having an unwarranted advantage over examinees from another demographic group. According to leading experts, test bias may cause differences in average scores across demographic groups, but differences in group scores are not sufficient evidence that test <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> actually present because the test could be measuring real differences among groups. Psychometricians use sophisticated scientific methods to search for test bias and eliminate it. Research shows that it is usually impossible for people reading a test item to accurately determine whether it is biased or not.|$|E

25|$|Optimism bias (also {{known as}} {{unrealistic}} or comparative optimism) is a cognitive bias that causes {{a person to}} believe that they are at a lesser risk of experiencing a negative event compared to others. Optimism <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> quite common and transcends gender, race, nationality and age.|$|E
25|$|Hostile {{attribution}} <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> typically conceptualized {{within a}} social information processing framework, in which social information (e.g., during an interaction) is processed {{in a series}} of steps that leads to a behavioral reaction.

25|$|The {{opposite}} of optimism <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> pessimism bias (or pessimistic bias), because {{the principles of}} the optimistic bias continue to be in effect in situations where individuals regard themselves as worse off than others. Optimism may occur from either a distortion of personal estimates, representing personal optimism, or a distortion for others, representing personal pessimism.|$|E

25|$|Heuristics are {{cognitive}} short cuts. Instead of weighing all {{the evidence}} when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The availability heuristic occurs when people estimate the probability of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias. The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of. Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The hindsight <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> a false memory of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The confirmation <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information {{in a way that}} confirms one's preconceptions.|$|E
25|$|Optimism <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} measured {{through two}} determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood of experiencing a negative event compared to their actual chance of experiencing a negative event (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing a negative event (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk of experiencing an event is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk of experiencing an event and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|E
25|$|One form of imputed <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} the {{decision-maker}} being a party to a suit, or having a pecuniary or proprietary interest {{in the outcome of}} the decision. Once this fact has been established, the <b>bias</b> <b>is</b> irrebuttable and disqualification is automatic – the decision-maker will be barred from adjudicating the matter without the need for any investigation into the likelihood or suspicion of bias. A classic case is Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), which involved an action between Dimes, a local landowner, and the proprietors of the Grand Junction Canal, in which the Lord Chancellor, Lord Cottenham, had affirmed decrees made to the proprietors. However, it was discovered by Dimes that Lord Cottenham in fact owned several pounds worth of shares in the Grand Junction Canal. This eventually led to the judge being disqualified from deciding the case. There was no inquiry as to whether a reasonable person would consider Lord Cottenham to be biased, or as to the circumstances which led Lord Cottenham to hear the case.|$|E
