30|$|GL {{pretreatment}} {{was developed}} for semi-chemical and kraft cookings in 1970 s. It was reported that southern pine is cooked by GL containing about 29  % total alkali charge to give a pulp with a yield of about 70  % [1]. After the concept of extended delignification was developed [2], GL pretreatment was reported to improve its selectivity and pulp quality [3, 4]. Later, GL pretreatment of wood chip for bioethanol production was developed and reported that enzymatic saccharification of wood chip pretreated with GL is much more efficient than that pretreated with kraft cooking when compared at the same lignin content [5, 6]. Because lots of kraft pulp mills have recently been closed, it has become attractive to repurpose the mills into <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plants</b> [5, 6]. It is the special advantage in this repurposing that the mills already have equipments sufficient and proper as <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plants</b> [5, 6]. Moreover, an enzymatic hydrolysis subsequent to a GL pretreatment was reported to saccharify more efficiently and be freer from inhibitive substances than that subsequent to an acid pretreatment [5 – 8].|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} whether the potential transformation of the existing sugar plants of Northern Greece to modern <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plants,</b> using the existing cultivations of sugar beet, would be an environmentally sustainable decision. Using Life Cycle Inventory and Impact Assessment, all processes for bioethanol production from sugar beets were analyzed, quantitative data were collected and the environmental loads of the final product (bioethanol) and of each process were estimated. The final results of the environmental impact assessment are encouraging since bioethanol production gives better results than sugar production for the use of the same quantity of sugar beets. If the old sugar plants were transformed into modern <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plants,</b> the total reduction of the environmental load would be, at least, 32. 6 % and a reduction of more than 2 tons of CO 2 e/sugar beet of ha cultivation could be reached.

5000|$|China has 45 listed {{companies}} doing biofuels-related businesses {{and is expected}} to grow even more because of China’s booming economy. Among the major foreign investors are Biolux Energy, Bright BioFuels (BBF), Sunshine Technology Group, and Asia Energy. As of 2008, China ranked No. 8 in Biofuels Country Attractiveness Indices commissioned by Ernst & Young. Since the late 1990s, China has set up major policies supporting the development and utilization of biofuels. In 2001, the government initially formulated the First Five-Year Plan for Bioethanol and the Special Development Plan for Denatured Fuel Ethanol and Bioethanol Gasoline for Automobiles. In early 2002, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and seven other ministries jointly issued two policy documents: the Pilot Testing Program of Bioethanol for Automobiles, and the Detail Regulations for Implementing the Pilot Testing Program of Bioethanol Gasoline for Automobiles. In 2003, a 10% ethanol (E10) blending for its automobile sector was initiated in three cities in Henan Province and in two cities in Heilongjiang Province. The following major support policies were provided to carry out the terms of the two policy documents: (i) a 5% consumption tax on all bioethanol under the E10 program was waived for all bioethanol plants; (ii) the value-added tax (normally 17%) on bioethanol production was refunded {{at the end of each}} year; (iii) all bioethanol plants received subsidized “old grain” (grains reserved in national stocks that are not suitable for human consumption) for feedstock. This subsidy was jointly provided by the central and local governments; and (iv) the government offered a subsidy to ensure a minimum profit for the bioethanol plants. This means that in the event that a <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant</b> declares loss in production and marketing, the government will provide a subsidy equal to the gap between marketing revenues and production costs plus a reasonable profit that the firm could have obtained from an alternative investment. There are five licensed ethanol fuel producers and over 12 operational biodiesel plants and roughly 28 more under construction in China. Among the licensed ethanol producers, the Jilin Fuel Alcohol Company is the largest, located in an industrial complex in the northern part of China near Jilin City, Jilin Province. The largest ethanol production facility was established in 2001 as a joint venture between PetroChina, Cofoco, and the Jilin Food Company. It has its own power station, water treatment facility, and employs about 430 employees of which 10% are at management level. All ethanol produced at this facility is blended by PetroChina, which has 20 ethanol blending stations in Jilin Province. Bioethanol plants are required by the government to sell their produced fuel ethanol only to appointed oil companies, such as PetroChina or Sinopec at a price of 0.91 or about $0.82/liter. The government subsidizes the gap between the sale price and production cost. China’s potential marginal arable lands are limited and most are fragmented. In a 2003-2004 survey conducted by the Ministry of Land and Resources, potential arable lands that are not fragmented amounted only to 7.3 million hectares, accounting for 8.28% of total reserved land.|$|E

40|$|Background. Bacterial {{contamination}} is {{an ongoing}} problem for commercial <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plants.</b> It concerns factories using grain and also other raw materials for ethanol fermentation. Bacteria compete with precious yeasts for sugar substrates and micronutrients, secrete lactic and acetic acids, which are toxic for yeast and this competition leads to significant decrease of bioethanol productivity. For this study, bacterial contamination of corn grain was examined. Then the grain was treated by ammonia solution to reduce microbial pollution and after that the microbiological purity of grain was tested one more time. Disinfected and non-disinfected corn grains were ground and fermentation process was performed. Microbiological purity of this process and ethanol yield was checked out. |$|R

Thus, we propose a strategy based on mathematical programming techniques to model and optimize the structure of the processes, and perform heat integration including the use of multi-effect distillation columns and integrated water networks to show that the energy efficiency and water consumption in <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plants</b> can be significantly improved.

40|$|While in a {{conventional}} kraft pulp mill, most of the hemicellulose and lignin fraction of the wood is burned in the recovery boiler to produce steam, in a biorefinery it can partially be used to produce added-value products. In this paper, the most important consequences of integrating a bioethanol production plant with a model pulp mill are presented in terms of steam and Na/S balances. The model mill represents an average Scandinavian hardwood kraft pulp mill, and the <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant</b> {{is based on the}} "near-neutral" hemicellulose pre-extraction method. Regarding the steam balance, a comprehensive heat integration study is performed. Implementing hemicellulose extraction increases the net steam demand by 48 MW. However, process integration at the mill and the <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant</b> individually leads to significant steam savings, and a corresponding net increase of steam by only 3 MW. Additional steam savings can be achieved if the total integration of the two processes (between the pulp mill and the <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant)</b> is considered (3 MW), resulting in a biorefinery with no increase of steam demand. As regards the Na/S balance, it is shown that green liquor export from the mill to the <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant</b> results in severe disruptions in the sodium and sulphur balance of the mill. Different attempts to solve this problem are discussed, but are very costly and/or negatively affect the water and steam balance of the mill...|$|E

Scope of life cycle assessment is “cradle to gate” and the functional unit {{of this study is}} 1 liter of anhydrous ethanol produced. The use of biogas from wastewater treatment system for steam production greatly affects the GHG reduction. The GHG emissions of <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant</b> that uses biogas from wastewater for steam production is 0. 548 kg-CO 2 -eq/L-ethanol, while the <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant</b> without biogas utilization is 1. 031 kg-CO 2 -eq/L-ethanol. From the result, the utilization of biogas in steam production insignificantly reduce the GHG emission, if primary fuel in steam production is biomass. In contrast, using biomass such as wood chip and rice husk substitutes for fossil fuel as primary fuel in steam production greatly affects to GHG emission reduction (approximately 96 % reduction compared to literature) ...|$|E

The European Union (EU) Renewable Energy Directive's target of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission saving of 60 % in comparison to an equivalent fossil-based system by 2020 seems to be very challenging for stand-alone wheat bioethanol system. However, the whole-wheat integrated system, wherein the CHP from the excess straw grown in the same season and from the same land is utilised in the wheat <b>bioethanol</b> <b>plant,</b> can be demonstrated for potential sustainability improvement, achieving 85 % emission reduction and 97 % CPE saving compared to reference fossil systems.
