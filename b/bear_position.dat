40|$|The master's thesis "Lower {{extremity}} stabilization function assessment using inertial {{sensors and}} functional tests in women's american football players" adresses postural control assessment {{in terms of}} functional joint stability using inertial sensors. The theoretical part is devoted to matters of functional joint stability, its control and it provides review of assessment options. Also inertial measurement unit function and application for human motion tracking are discussed. The last chapter covers American football considering the research group in the study. The experimental part is in form of study, which uses inertial sensor-based parameters to evaluate functional joint stability that are placed on four body segments {{and the results are}} compared with functional test results. We evaluated one-legged stance and single-leg hop test. One-legged stance, <b>bear</b> <b>position</b> and squat were chosen for the functional tests. Obtained data were also discussed in the context of history of injury in the last two years. Results confirm applicability of inertial measurement units for lower extremity stabilization objectification. We proved correlation of thight, shin and instep time to stabilization (TTS) with one-legged stance score and similarly thight and shin TTS with <b>bear</b> <b>position</b> score...|$|E
40|$|According to Hicks (1937), {{the novel}} idea in Keynes's theory was {{the notion that}} an {{increase}} in expenditures and income did not necessarily put an upward pressure on the interest rate. This was in Hicks ' view what was unique about what he called Keynes's "special theory. " Hicks however made a distinction between this and {{what he thought was}} implicit in the General Theory. The latter he thought was closer to orthodoxy since it implied that [...] as his IS/LM formulation made evident [...] an increase in expenditure led to a rise in the interest rate, all other things being equal (p. 152). If this is indeed the right yardstick by which to judge, Keynes argument in his Treatise on Money was perhaps more "Keynesian " than his argument in the General Theory. In this earlier work, Keynes relied on two different themes to argue that the interest rate need not rise with rising levels of expenditure. One of these was the elasticity of the money supply, which in his view depended on the policy of the banking sector as a whole and that of the central bank. The other was the interaction between financial and industrial circulation. A decrease (increase) in what Keynes called the <b>bear</b> <b>position,</b> i. e., a fall (rise) in the financial circulation, was similar in its impact to that of a policy-induced increase (decrease) in the money supply. In the early phases of a business cycle expansion, the expectation of rising asset prices lowered the magnitude of the <b>bear</b> <b>position,</b> and typically tended to compensate the upward pressure put on the interest rate by the rising level of expenditure and income, quite independently of the policy stance of banking sector. Likewise, the period of late expansion was associated with the rising preponderance of market opinion according to which asset prices were seen as excessive in relation to the actual performance of profits. That, in turn, gave momentum to the rise in the <b>bear</b> <b>position,</b> making the interest rat...|$|E

In his General Theory, this second line of argument lost much of its force as it became reformulated under the rubric of Keynes's liquidity preference theory of interest. Assuming that the interest rate sets the return on capital, Keynes dismissed the effect of bull or bear sentiment in equity markets as a second-order complication that can be ignored in analyzing the equilibrium level of investment and output. The objective {{of this paper is to}} go back to this old theme from the Treatise and underscore its importance for the Keynesian theory of the business cycle. ...|$|E

40|$|Despite his {{emphasis}} on the speculative character of investment decisions, Minsky {{paid little attention to}} asset price speculation per se, ignoring asset price bubbles and their macroeconomic effects. That is perhaps because his views were formed during the era of financial regulation, when speculation "could do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. " Clearly, times have since changed. Keynes's old warning that the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation√ì has begun to ring true again. To deepen our understanding of financial fragility under present-day conditions, the paper builds on Keynes's insights in his General Theory on the stock exchange by going back to his Treatise, where asset price expectations and speculation play an integral part in his analysis of the business cycle. More specifically, it develops the macroeconomic implications of some of his arguments that have mainly been eclipsed by his GT. These can be summarized in three related propositions: (1) asset price expectations systematically exhibit self-sustained biases in one direction or another over the business cycle; (2) once an asset price bubble emerges no automatic mechanism exists to check the deviation of prices from their true values; and, (3) mean reversion in asset prices over time plays itself out through a rise in inactive money balances in the banking system, which Keynes called the <b>bear</b> <b>position,</b> as more and more people begin to think that asset prices have reached levels that are unreasonable. This early picture of how financial variables interact with output determination over the business cycle is contrasted with Keynes's better known analysis in the GT, which, it is argued, does not lend itself as readily to analyzing asset price misalignments. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: A small {{proportion}} of patients with Mobile unicompartmental knee replacement (UKR) report poor functional outcomes in spite of optimal component alignment on post-operative radiographs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if there was a correlation between functional outcome and knee kinematics. Methods: From a cohort of consecutive cases of 150 Oxford medial UKR, patients with fair/poor functional outcome at one year post surgery (OKS < 34, n= 15) were identified and matched for age, sex, pre-operative clinical scores, and follow-up period with a cohort of patients with good/excellent outcome (OKS ‚â• 34, n= 15). In vivo kinematic assessment was done using step-up and deep knee bend exercises under fluoroscopic imaging. The fluoroscopic videos were analyzed using MATLAB software to measure the variation in time taken to complete the exercises, Patellar Tendon Angle (PTA) and <b>Bearing</b> <b>Position</b> (BP) with Knee Flexion Angle (KFA). Results: Mean OKS in the fair/poor group was 29. 9 and the mean OKS in the good/excellent group was 41. 1. The tibial slope, time taken to complete the exercises and the PTA trend over the flexion range was similar in both the groups; however, BP as well as extent of bearing excursion differed significantly. The total bearing excursion in the OKS< 34 group was significantly smaller than the OKS‚â• 34 group (35 %). Furthermore, on average the bearing was positioned 1. 7 mm more posterior on the tibia in the OKS< 34 group. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that abnormal knee kinematics, in particular bearing excursion and positioning, are associated with worse functional outcome after mobile UKR...|$|R
