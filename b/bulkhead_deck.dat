50|$|Rescue tugs {{and landing}} craft {{moved in to}} assist in fire fighting, but the flames {{continued}} for another three hours, by which time USS Pinkney had lost 18 of her crew and {{had taken on a}} heavy list to port. A jagged hole, 30 feet in diameter, extended from the bridge deck to the <b>bulkhead</b> <b>deck.</b> All wards in the amidships hospital area were burned out.|$|E
50|$|The Titanic was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} Grade 1 subdivision proposed by the 1891 Bulkhead Committee, meaning that it could stay afloat with any 2 adjoining out of its 16 main compartments open to the sea. The height of the <b>bulkhead</b> <b>deck</b> above the water line in flooded condition was well above the requirements, and the vessel {{would have been able to}} float with 3 adjoining compartments flooded in 11 of 14 possible combinations. The subdivisions could be sealed from communication with each other with cast iron watertight doors. To somewhat lower the chance of a sailor's being caught in them, a geared system dropped the doors gradually, over 25 to 30 seconds, by sliding them vertically on hydraulic cataract cylinders.|$|E

40|$|The {{propagation}} of fire-generated smoke with a counter-flow air supply in, a horizontal arrangement of shipboard compartments and passageways was modeled using a {{computational fluid dynamics}} program generated by Computational Fluid Dynamics Research Corporation. This study {{was based on a}} large-scale live fire experiment performed by Naval Research Laboratory on the ex-USS SHADWELL. All simulations were evaluated at steady state conditions. A constant velocity counter-flow air supply was introduced into the model structure. The counter-flow air velocities used were 0. 5, 1, and 2 m/s. This study used a computational fluid dynamics combustion module to simulate a 620 kW fire generated by the complete combustion of propene gas from a burn pan in the space. : Carbon dioxide from the fire was tracked throughout the structure to model smoke propagation. Seven simulations were performed with adiabatic and isothermal <b>bulkhead,</b> <b>deck</b> and overhead boundary conditions. Simulation smoke propagation results were consistent with experimental observations. Figures depicting temperature' distribution, carbon dioxide distribution and mixture flow patterns at specified locations are provided in the report The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effectiveness of computational fluid dynamics modeling of smoke propagation in a shipboard space with a counter-flow air supply...|$|E
25|$|Honeycomb {{structures}} were developed as flat sandwich sheets used for <b>bulkheads</b> and <b>decking.</b> These were long established with {{wood and paper}} board construction, but required a more robust material for aerospace use.

50|$|A {{cofferdam}} {{may also}} refer to an insulating space between two watertight <b>bulkheads</b> or <b>decks</b> within a ship. A cofferdam {{may be a}} void (empty) space or a ballast space. Cofferdams are usually employed to ensure oil or other chemicals do not leak into machinery spaces. If two different cargoes that react dangerously with each other are carried on the same vessel, one or more cofferdams are usually required between the cargo spaces.|$|R
50|$|Openings in fire-resistance rated <b>bulkheads</b> and <b>decks</b> must be firestopped {{to restore}} the fire-resistance ratings that would {{otherwise}} be compromised, if the openings were left unsealed. The authority having jurisdiction for such measures varies depending upon the flag of the ship. Merchant vessels are typically subject to the regulations and inspections of the Coast Guards of the flag country. Combat ships are subject to the regulations set out by the navy of the country that owns the ship.|$|R

25|$|The {{trip was}} a trying {{experience}} but perhaps more valuable {{in some ways}} than formal training. The soldiers quickly turned sea-men. Between Mobile and Key West the crew learned to spit to leeward and talk in terms of <b>decks,</b> <b>bulkheads,</b> and ladders. Morale was not so high, however, among the more experienced officers who knew ships and had to run this one.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{cause of}} bulk carrier loss is ingress of sea water owing to {{cracks in the}} side shell {{as a consequence of}} main frame deterioration and the subsequent failure of transverse bulkheads adjacent to the flooded hold. When the hold is flooded the stresses in the bulkhead are known to exceed yield and the bulkhead to have undergone slight distortion. The vertical bulkheads are corrugated and have upper support from cross deck strips. Typical initial damages are cracks in the joint between <b>bulkhead</b> corrugations and <b>deck</b> plating due partly to corrosion. These can lead to portions of the cross deck strip becoming detached from the bulkhead. Pressure on the ship sides can then cause the <b>bulkhead</b> and cross <b>deck</b> strip to buckle, with minor and local buckles on the bulkhead leading to shear buckling of the whole structure. The purpose of the Study Group will be an investigation of this cracking and buckling process...|$|R

50|$|R/P FLIP (FLoating Instrument Platform) is an {{open ocean}} {{research}} platform owned by the U.S. Office of Naval Research (ONR) and operated by Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The platform is 355 ft long and is designed to partially flood and pitch backward 90°, resulting in only the front 55 ft of the platform pointing {{up out of the}} water, with <b>bulkheads</b> becoming <b>decks.</b> When flipped, most of the ballast for the platform is provided by water at depths below the influence of surface waves, hence FLIP is stable and mostly immune to wave action similar to a spar buoy. At the end of a mission, compressed air is pumped into the ballast tanks in the flooded section and the platform, which has no propulsion, returns to its horizontal position so it can be towed to a new location. The platform is frequently mistaken for a capsized ocean transport ship.|$|R
