40|$|With {{the tenth}} {{anniversary of the}} {{landmark}} publication Social Lives of Medicines (Whyte, van der Geest and Hardon 2003), new avenues arise for exploring the ‘thinginess of things’ (Latour 2000). This paper, based on fieldwork between between 2001 and 2008, discusses how “the Chinese antimalarial” as an over-the-counter medicine in petty enterprise clinics of East Africa became a biotechnological <b>bulk</b> <b>item</b> for Chinese import-expert traders in a highly subsidised antimalarial health field after the WHO recommendations of 2005 and 2006. These observations are put in perspective with reflections on a practical engagement with the plant itself, i. e. Artemisia annua L. Rather than taking an ‘ego-centred’ and transactionalist viewpoint that follows the drug through a string of ‘regimes of value’ (Appadurai 1986), this paper underlines that a thing’s thinginess is ontologically constitutive of its playing fields...|$|E
40|$|Counterfeit products, {{particularly}} pharmaceuticals, electronic devices, and apparels, are widespread. They threaten consumer {{safety and}} cause huge economic losses to licit supply chain partners and governments. Although {{a number of}} traditional anti-counterfeiting technologies, such as holograms and chemical tags, are available to combat counterfeiting, they are vulnerable to imitation or being reused. Besides, these technologies are intended to protect individual items, rather than to safeguard an entire supply chain. As such, fake products may likely be injected into the supply chain to hurt end-consumers. Track-and-trace technology based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has recently emerged as a promising tool to combat counterfeiting, because of its automatic and non-line-of-sight capability to identify massive product items. By maintaining an electronic pedigree (e-pedigree) that records the transaction information of product items along the supply chain, this approach stands out for protecting the supply chain against infiltration, eliminating theft and fraud, facilitating recall of defective products, and supporting remote authentication. However, a number of technical and critical issues {{have yet to be}} solved for practical implementation of RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting. These include generation of accurate initial product e-pedigree in fast moving manufacturing lines, precise e-pedigree updating in batch product distributing and receiving, and fast e- pedigree queries for remote and real-time product authentication from end-customers. Without fully addressing these issues, the accumulated product e-pedigree data would be untrustworthy, rendering any subsequent operations of track-and-trace and product authentication unreliable. This thesis investigates the crucial implementation issues in RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting. It firstly presents an innovative track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting system, based on which a TDPS algorithm is proposed for generation of initial product e-pedigree in fast moving production lines. The TDPS overcomes many practical issues, such as tag writing error and tag locking failure, and helps identify the bottleneck of initial product e-pedigree generation. To tackle the bottleneck, the TDPS is further optimized by incorporating a block writing method to enhance the tag EPC writing efficiency and an integration method to balance the overhead of RFID equipment. In product distributing and receiving, a mechanized 3 D scanning method is proposed to improve <b>bulk</b> <b>item</b> identification rate and enhance the accuracy and completeness of product e-pedigree. Indeed, RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting mandates a relatively high <b>bulk</b> <b>item</b> identification rate for product authentication and e-pedigree updating. Experimental results demonstrate that the mechanized 3 D scanning can achieve a <b>bulk</b> <b>item</b> reading rate of up to 98. 9 %, which largely outperforms the widely documented bulk reading rate (70 %) in real applications. In retailing level, the efficiency of e-pedigree queries would hugely impact on customer shopping experience and the effectiveness of track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting. A partition-based method is therefore developed to cluster product e-pedigree data to improve the speed of e-pedigree queries. This approach partitions the accumulated e-pedigree data into fixed and dynamic groups, such that queries are conducted mainly on active data, rather than on the whole historical data sets. By addressing the above key issues, this thesis contributes to making implementation of RFID-based track-and-trace anti-counterfeiting practically viable and reliable. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

The arrivals of all three types of customers are assumed to be a Markovian arrival process (MAP). It is also assumed that the number of items demanded for the second commodity is a random variable. The ordering policy is to place orders for both commodities when the inventory levels are below prefixed levels for both commodities. The lead time is assumed to have a phase type distribution, and the demands that occur during stock out period are assumed to be lost. The joint probability distribution for both commodities is obtained in the steady state case. Various measures of system performance and the total expected cost rate in the steady state are derived.

Many factors, both internal and external, affect the supply chain. Our aim was to identify those factors, so as to maintain future supply and business continuity in health and social care. Methods:Qualitative interviews with 20 senior managers from private and public sector health service providers and social care providers in south west England. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Results:There were four areas of concern: contradictions with government legislation which caused confusion about how best to deliver sustainable solutions; procurement was unclear and created multiple approaches to purchasing <b>bulk</b> <b>items</b> at low cost; internal organizational systems needed to be reconsidered to embed sustainability; and embedding sustainability requires a review of organizational systems.
