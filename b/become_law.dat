5|$|Before a {{bill passed}} by the {{legislative}} Houses can <b>become</b> <b>law,</b> the royal assent (the monarch's approval) is required. In theory, assent can either be granted (making the bill law) or withheld (vetoing the bill), but since 1707 assent has always been granted.|$|E

5|$|For {{bills to}} <b>become</b> <b>Law,</b> {{they are to}} be first passed by both houses of the National Diet, signed by the Ministers of State, {{countersigned}} by the Prime Minister, and then finally promulgated by the Emperor; however, without specifically giving the Emperor the power to oppose legislation.|$|E

5|$|In most circumstances, {{in order}} to <b>become</b> <b>law</b> a bill must be first passed by both houses of the Diet and then {{promulgate}}d by the Emperor. This role of the Emperor {{is similar to the}} Royal Assent in some other nations; however, the Emperor cannot refuse to promulgate a law and therefore his legislative role is merely a formality.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except {{for the fact that}} the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can <b>become</b> <b>law.</b> The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to <b>become</b> <b>law.</b> Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E

5|$|In February 2013, the Philippine Senate {{passed a}} bill declaring waling-waling (Vanda sanderiana) as the {{national}} flower alongside Sampaguita. A similar bill in the House of Representatives had already been passed in 2012. Normally, the bill would <b>become</b> <b>law</b> after being signed by the President. However, it was vetoed by President Benigno Aquino III. The veto did not grant the waling-waling as the second national flower due to the confusion that it would create.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} legislation involved {{two measures}} to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), {{and a new}} Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having <b>become</b> <b>law</b> under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until such time as the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not <b>become</b> <b>law</b> before the session ended.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill was}} next {{considered}} in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed. The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it {{at the expense of}} the consumer. Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests. Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to <b>become</b> <b>law</b> without his signature.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{national}} assembly of theologians to advise Parliament on further church reforms was first presented to the House of Commons in 1641. Such a proposal was {{also included in the}} Grand Remonstrance, a list of grievances which Parliament presented to Charles on 1December that year. Charles responded on 23December that the church required no reforms. Undeterred, Parliament passed three bills in 1642 appointing an assembly and stipulating that its members would be chosen by Parliament. Charles, whose royal assent was required for the bills to <b>become</b> <b>law,</b> was only willing to consider such an assembly if the members were chosen by the clergy. This was the practice for selection of members of Convocation, the assembly of clergy of the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|To <b>become</b> <b>law</b> or bill, a {{constitutional}} amendment {{had to have the}} assent of both the Diet and the Emperor. This meant that while the Emperor could no longer legislate by decree he still had a veto over the Diet. The Emperor also had complete freedom in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, and so, under the Meiji constitution, Prime Ministers often were not chosen from and did not enjoy the confidence of the Diet. The Imperial Diet was also limited in its control over the budget. While the Diet could veto the annual budget, if no budget was approved the budget of the previous year continued in force. This all changed with the new constitution after World War II.|$|E

5|$|To the LCL, {{this was}} a {{dangerous}} situation, and seeing a need to avoid it, they compromised: their position abruptly changed to being in favour of wholesale reform of the Legislative Council. When Dunstan put forward bills to reform it, the LCL relented, and Eastick convinced the LCL councillors to let them pass, conditional on amendments to the legislation. These were a minor change to the particular proportional system used to elect the councillors, and that it remained non compulsory {{to vote in the}} council. The new council would eventually have 22 members, with half elected each election from a multi-member constituency covering the entirety of the state. Hall attacked the LCL for its sudden change in stance on reform, and managed to see the first LM policy <b>become</b> <b>law</b> with the lowering of the council suffrage age to 18.|$|E
5|$|If the Governor General of Canada {{is unable}} to give assent, {{it can be done}} by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not {{actually}} necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have <b>become</b> <b>law.</b> Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons, whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.|$|E
5|$|Modern DST {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose shift work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through {{a large part of}} a summer day. An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not <b>become</b> <b>law,</b> and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.|$|E
