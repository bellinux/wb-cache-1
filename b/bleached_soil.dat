40|$|Abstract. Four great pedological provinces are {{distinguished}} in the North-East of France and Rhenish Germany. The brown {{soils are}} developed on the liasic and triasic {{regions of the}} « Plateau Lorrain ». The calcareous landscapes are characterised by red rendzinas, inherited from tertiary alterations and recarbonated in the periglacial times. In the hercynian mountains, the bad decomposition of the organic matter produces brown acid soils or sometimes podzolic soils, when rocks and expositions are favourable. In the Rhenish rift, the variety of soils is very great : the loess bears generally brown and brown <b>bleached</b> <b>soils,</b> but locally near Mainz a chernozem inherited from the Boreal period. The author attempts to give a chronology of this soils : the most evolved are dated from Boreal, Atlantic (brown soils) or Subboreal (heath-podzols). Bonnefont Jean-Claude.

40|$|The Upper Pleistocene sediments of the Aschenhütte sink-hole (west of Herzberg am Harz, Lower Saxony) enable {{one to make}} {{interesting}} {{correlations between}} palynological and geological results. The sequence is composed of limnic-telmatic deposits (Eemain to Lower Weichselian) and loess with paleosoils (Weichselian). Sedimentation started during the hornbeam-dominated phase of the Eemian interglacial period and continued throughout the Eemian, the Weichselian Brörup interstadial (sensu Andersen) {{and parts of the}} preceding and the following stadial phases, the Herning and the Rederstall stadials. As opposed to most of the known Eemian sites spruce was a major tree species during the hornbeam-dominated phase of the Eemian. The vegetational development during the interstadial phase does not show a period of climatic deterioration as is the case for the Brörup interstadial when considering regions with a more demanding vegetation or regions close to the natural boundaries of the tree species concerned. Pollen or seeds of Bruckenthalia and Picea omoricoides have not been found in the Aschenhütte cores. The limnic-telmatic sediments interlock with loess-paleosoils (Eemian soil and Lower Weichselian <b>bleaching</b> <b>soils)</b> at the lake shore. They are overlaid by loess paleosoils of the Stillfried-B interstadial (Hattorf soil and Lohne soil). Lake level fluctuations were determined by means of the facies distribution and isochrones as defined by pollen analysis. A relatively high stand of the lake level existed {{after the end of the}} Eemian interglacial and during the Brörup interstadial periods. In the course of the Herning stadial period the water level dropped, whereas during the Rederstall stadial phase the lake basin was covered by sediments and therefore dried up...|$|R
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to study {{the genesis of the}} Payson and Trenton polypedons in northern Utah to understand why the Payson polypedon is an Alfisol, while the Trenton polypedon is a Mollisol. Even though the soil-forming factors appear similar, the soils differ at the order level. Two pedons, one belonging to the Payson polypedons and the other belonging to the Trenton polypedon, have been described and sampled by genetic horizons. Both pedons have essentially the same climate, slope, age, elevation, and are developed on the parent material of Lake Bonneville sediments. The differences in physical, chemical and mineralogical properties among the horizons in the same pedon and between the Payson and Trenton pedons is due to differences in deposition as alluvium or lacustrine sediments during different periods. The high amount of exchangeable sodium in both pedons reflects the development of texture in natric horizons and helps the movement of fine clay and organic matter from the eluvial to the illuvial horizons. The light color of the surface of the Payson pedon is related to high amounts of calcium carbonate in the Al horizon, <b>bleaching</b> of <b>soil</b> particles within the structural units by sodium, and the presence of large amounts of light-colored minerals in the epipedon of the Payson soil...|$|R

30|$|When soil {{scientists}} {{studied the}} hydrogen-seeping {{features in the}} EEC in Russia (Sukhanova et al. 2013; Polyanskaya et al. 2014), they found that molecular hydrogen seeps from these structures and that this seepage affects the soil layers by disturbing the vegetation and the microbial biomass. In areas of H 2 seepage, the humus content decreases {{by a factor of}} 2 – 3 and the optical density of the humic acids is lower than in the surrounding areas. The fertility of arable lands decreases significantly, and they often become unsuitable for cultivation (Sukhanova et al. 2013). The total quantities and biomasses of bacterial cells and fungal spores and the lengths of fungal and actinomycete mycelia decrease (Polyanskaya et al. 2014).

40|$|This study {{focus on}} the {{characterization}} of hydrocarbon microseepages in the northern Tucano Basin (Bahia State, Brazil), using geostatistical analysis of regional hydrocarbon geochemical data yielded from soil samples and digital processing of Enhanced Thematic plus (ETM+/Landsat 7 satellite) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer imagery (ASTER/Terra satellite). A theoretical detection model was devised in which gas anomalies (seeps) indicated by hydrocarbon geochemistry should spatially match a number of surface expressions, such as <b>bleaching</b> of <b>soils</b> and rocks (i. e., reduction of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 +), geobotanical markers and development of specific clays (kaolinite) and carbonates (siderite). These indirect evidences were employed {{for the application of}} remote sensing data and information extraction techniques in order to locate sites more favorable to host hydrocarbon seeps in the Tucano Basin. The ETM+ data was processed using the pseudo-ratio technique- an adaptation of the classic principal components analysis. The ASTER data was processed using the Spectral Angle Mapper and the Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering techniques, which are commonly used for the processing of hyperspectral data, though adapted here for these multispectral dataset. In addition, the ASTER data were classified using three different neural network systems (Fuzzy Clustering, Radial Basis Functional Link Network and Probabilistic Neural Network). The results showed that a number of the sites predicted using the applied detection model concurred with known geochemical anomalies. Other sites with similar characteristics but for which no geochemical data were available were also revealed. These sites are taken as new potential targets for the presence of seep...|$|R
40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{application}} of geochemical methods {{in the area of}} the deserted village Hol with a focus on phosphate analysis. The goal of the research of the area was to define the relative differences in the geochemical composition of soil in individual parts of intravilan and fields and contribute to the knowledge about their economic utilization. The evolution of the phosphate analysis in the world and in the Czech Republic with the focus on the issue of application of different methods used mainly in the medieval locations constitutes a significant part of the thesis. Natural conditions and other external effects influencing the content of phosphate in the soil were taken into account. The macroscopic observations during the probe digging proved the absence of a strong humic horizon in a place, where gardens were originally assumed. This absence could point to the location of economic buildings. The <b>bleaching</b> of upper <b>soil</b> horizons in the area could be caused by previous human activity; this phenomenon is connected not only to natural conditions, which are not opportune, but also to the absence of medieval tillage. The content of P in the assumed gardens does not differ greatly. It is relatively high which could indicate the presence of previous economic buildings or [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{microbiological}} {{techniques are}} used to provide reliable data on the rate and extent of kill {{for a range of}} biocides. However, such techniques provide very limited data regarding the initial rate of kill of fast-acting biocides over very short time domains. This study describes the application of a recombinant strain of Escherichia coli expressing the Photorhabdus luminescens lux operon as a whole-cell biosensor. Light emission is linked directly to bacterial metabolism; therefore, by monitoring light output, the impact of fast-acting biocides can be assessed. Electrochemically activated solutions (ECASs), bleach, Virkon, and ethanol were assessed at three concentrations (1 %, 10 %, 80 %) in the presence of organic soiling. Over a 2 -s time course, 80 % ECAS produced the greatest reduction in light output in the absence of organic load but was strongly inhibited by its presence. Eighty percent ethanol outperformed all tested biocides in the presence of organic <b>soil.</b> <b>Bleach</b> and Virkon produced similar reductions in bioluminescence at matched concentrations within the time course of the assay. It was also demonstrated that the assay can be used to rapidly assess the impact of organic soiling. The use of bioluminescent bacteria as whole-cell bioreporters allows assessment of the relative efficacies of fast-acting biocides within milliseconds of application. The assay can be used to investigate activity over short or extended time domains to confirm complete metabolic inhibition of the bioreporter. Moreover, the assay may enable further elucidation of their mechanism of action by allowing the investigation of activity over tim...|$|R
40|$|Redox processes, {{which are}} {{widespread}} in soils, {{need to be}} quantified for an improved comprehension {{of the dynamics of}} Fe- and Mn-oxides and their associated trace elements. The classical methodology used to study these redox processes generally relies on the quantification of all mineral species in the various pedological features that can be related to different redox stages. However, this approach usually encounters the difficulty of precisely quantifying the different forms of poorly crystallised Fe- and Mn-oxides. In this study, we use the signature of rare earth elements (REEs) to visualise and, eventually, quantify the importance of redox processes in soils. Our approach relies on that developed by Laveuf et al. (2008) and the idea that the relative contribution to the mobilisation of REEs that is made by the primary minerals reactive to redox conditions depends on the following factors: (i) their initial proportion in the different pedological features that can be related to various redox processes, (ii) their relative mobilisation during the redox process in question, and (iii) their initial REE signatures. The catena studied is characterised by two stages of redox conditions: the first is related to the formation and subsequent dissolution of Fe-Mn concretions, and the second is related to the <b>bleaching</b> of the <b>soil</b> matrix due to morphological degradation. In this soil, the main minerals reactive to redox conditions are Mn-oxides, ferrihydrite, goethite and (fluor) apatite. The results indicate that the primary redox conditions can be characterised by a positive Ce anomaly on the REE pattern, which has been attributed to a preferential immobilisation of this element, due to its association with Mn-oxides. The results also indicate that the secondary redox conditions can be characterised by depletion in medium REEs (MREEs) in the REE pattern, which has been attributed to a preferential release of these elements during the dissolution of (fluor) apatite and, to a lesser extent, of ferrihydrite. These results emphasise the potential of REE signatures of the visualisation of the various redox processes that have been active in a soil. Additionally, REE signatures are a proxy of the frequency and intensity of the redox conditions...|$|R
40|$|Geology and soils {{in general}} Surinam is {{situated}} at {{the northern edge of}} the very old and stable Guiana shield. Six-sevenths of the country’s surface are occupied by formations belonging to the shield and designated together as the basal complex. However, the Roraima formation does not belong to the complex. It was deposited during the Mesozoic (probably the Cretaceous) as a thick layer mainly consisting of sandstone that covered the greater part of the shield. Later on the original sandstone plateau was dissected, a process accelerated by the uplifting of the shield, and finally it disappeared almost completely by erosion. The former surface is now only represented by the flat tops of some table-mountains one of which is found in the interior of Surinam: Tafelberg. See Schols & Cohen (1953). The surface of the northern seventh part of the country is occupied by deposits of Quaternary age. In general may be distinguished (from the south to the north) : 1) The Zanderij formation, consisting mainly of sands of continental origin; 2) the Coropina formation, comprising the “old coastal plain”; the main parts are (a) the so-called “schols”, i. e. the remnants of an old sea-clay plain, separated by filled-up tidal gullies, and (b) the remnants of the offshore bars that formerly separated the plain from the sea; 3) the Demerara formation, comprising the “young coastal plain”. See Van der Eyk (1954, 1957). Geological-pedological classification of the savannas Savannas are found on the basal complex, the Roraima, the Zanderij and the Coropina formation. Cohen & Van der Eyk (1953) classify them as follows: I Savannas of the Coropina formation 1. Watamalejo-type – on the offshore bars 2. Welgelegen-type – on the “schols” II Savannas of the Zanderij formation a. Kasipora-type – on dry <b>bleached</b> sand <b>soils</b> b. Zanderij-type – on wet <b>bleached</b> sand <b>soils</b> c. Coesewijne-type – on non-bleached soils III Savannas of the Roraima formation: Tafelberg-type IV Savannas of the basal complex 1. Paroe-type – on granitic soils 2. Bosland-type – on schist hills 3. Saban-pasi-type – on subgraywacke hills Savanna soils The climate is characterized by the sequence of a long rainy season (April-July), a long dry season (August-November), a short rainy season (December-January) and a short dry season (February-March). In connection with this periodicity the water-table in many places fluctuates strongly {{in the course of the}} year. During the dry seasons the upper layers of the savanna soils are always completely dry, except just after a shower. A soil is called very dry if even during the rainy seasons the upper layers are not influenced by the ground water. A very wet soil, however, at this period is covered by some cm of water; in addition it is characterized by many small hummocks, in Surinam called “kawfoetoes”, which are built up by worms and in which these animals are able to keep their heads above the water. Certain soils occur that in spite of deep watertables are wet, because an impermeable layer in the subsoil impedes drainage of the topsoil. Of course there is a scala between the extremes “very dry” and “very wet”. The texture of the upper layers ranges from bleached and slightly red sand to sandy and silty clay. Object of the investigation The flora and the vegetation of the northern Surinam savannas are the object of this investigation. These savannas do not only represent the types of the Zanderijand the Coropina-formation, but also the Bosland- and the Saban-pasi-type, for these two types are present on the basal complex only near its northern border. The following savannas have been studied. Welgelegen-type: the savannas of Bersaba and Vierkinderen, the Bigi-olo savanna near Hanover and the Fransina savanna near Welgelegen; Kasipora- and Zanderij-type: the white-sandy part of the Lobin savanna near Zanderij; Coesewijne-type: the loamy part of the Lobin savanna, the savanna Mimili Okili near Powaka, the Doti savanna near Wisawini and the Coesewijne savanna near Bigipoika; Saban-pasi-type: the Gros savanna and the De Jong Noord savanna. Data of some other authors pertaining to these and the other types have also been taken into account, some published (Lanjouw, 1936; Maguire c. s., 1948; Heyligers, 1963), some unpublished. The savannas present a marked diversity, among other things with regard to the structure of their vegetation. However, nearly all satisfy this definition: “A savanna (or a campo) is an area with a xeromorphic vegetation comprising an ecologically dominant ground layer consisting mainly of grasses, sometimes together with sedges, and with or without trees and/or shrubs either forming a more or less continuous layer, or in groups, or isolated. ” The species have been studied with respect to the relation with the habitat, the means of dispersal and the area of distribution, all in mutual correlation. Vegetationunits have been distinguished and classified; ecological and chorologic aspects have been taken into account. A combination of all data, obtained during this as well as former investigations by others, permits the drawing of a provisional and general picture of the flora and the vegetation of the northern Surinam savannas as far as the present aspects are concerned. The following statements all apply to N. Surinam only, unless mentioned otherwise. Flora Habitat in general. Nearly all plants occurring on the savannas are heliophilous and are able to survive repeated burning. The flora of the open vegetation types consists of about 270 species the majority of which (72 %) is restricted to the open savannas. However, there are species occurring either in other open situations too, partly as weeds (8 %), or on wet savannas and other wet places (3 %), or in savanna rivulets and in swamps (7 %), or in savanna bushes (8 %). Out of ca. 100 species of the savanna bushes only 15 % are restricted to this vegetation type. The other species occur either also in the open savanna (20 %), or along forest borders (8 %), or in savanna wood and forest (23 %) and/or even in rain forest (31 %). A group of 12 % belonging to the last category does not flower or even not grow high in the bushes. Quite apart from this division other groups may be distinguished among the species of the bushes in the following way: occurring also in secondary forest (31 %) in marsh forest (9 %), in swamps (3 %). The trees and shrubs of the savannas support only few epiphytes and (half-) parasites; these belong to 19 different species. In the field nearly all species show some (factual) range with regard to the degree of moistness and the texture of the soil. The texture itself is not necessarily the decisive factor as there is a relation between the texture and some other properties of the soil, e. g. the consistency and the mineral content. This has not been further investigated. The same holds for the species preferring slightly shaded localities. These spots have a microclimate that differs more from that of its surroundings than in light intensity only. The majority of the open-savanna species have diaspores that are not obviously adapted to any agent of dispersal (71 %). The remaining 29 % are distributed over 6 different categories. The diaspores of the species of the bushes belong partly to the non-adapted forms too (35 %), but 50 % of them are fleshy. Generally speaking, the savanna species have a wider geographic distribution than the spieces of the flora of Surinam as a whole. This is particularly true for the opensavanna species. On the basis of similar areas of distribution the species are classed under 6 geographic elements, viz. the Guianan (G), the northern South-American (N), the northern + eastern South-American (NE), the Middle- and northern + eastern South-American (MNE), the South-American (S) and the American element (A). The distribution of the species of the open-savanna vegetations and of the bushes, respectively, among the geographic elements is as follows (percentages) : G 12 : 26; N 11 : 18; NE 16 : 13; MNE 10; 3; S 9 : 18; A 42 : 22. It appears from a comparison of these figures too, that the species of the first group in general have a wider distribution. Apart from the geographic elements the Roraima element has been distinguished. It comprises all species collected on one or several of the table-mountains in the Guianan interior. The distribution of these species among the geographic elements does not differ considerably from the one of the savanna flora as a whole. It may have appeared already from the foregoing that the species of the bushes, though presenting a higher percentage of adapted diaspores, nevertheless do not have areas of distribution wider than those of the open-savanna species. The expected correlation is, however, apparent if the two groups are considered separately: the mean area of distribution of the species with adapted diaspores is wider than the one of those with non-adapted diaspores. A comparison of the ecological and the chorologic aspects brings to the fore two focal points within the savanna flora: The elements with a small distribution (G and N) are most numerously represented on wet to very wet sandy (in particular white-sandy) soils, whereas the elements with a wide distribution (MNE, S and A) are concentrated on dry and moist non-bleached sands and loams and on very wet soils and present a preference-top on dry and moist loamy sand. The Roraima species are by far the most numerous on the wet white sand, in general they are more numerous on wet than on dry soils. Vegetation Vegetation-units have been distinguished and classified according to the BraunBlanquel school. It has been attempted to make the groups of so-called characteristic and differential species correspond with ecological groups in the sense of Duvigneaud (1946, 1949). The latter consist of species with clear, sociological affinities between them because of similar habitat requirements. The open-savanna (and orchard-savanna)|$|R
