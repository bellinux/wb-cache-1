50|$|SilhouetteSilhouette {{changed over}} time {{supported}} by {{the evolution of the}} undergarment. In earlier days, wide skirts were supported by fabrics like linen which used horsehair in the weave. Crinolines were used to give skirts a beehive shape, with at least six layers petticoats worn under the skirt, which could weigh as much as fourteen pounds. Later, the cage crinoline was developed. Women were freed from the heavy petticoats, and were able to move their legs freely beneath the cage.Silhouette later began to emphasise a slope {{toward the back of the}} skirt.

5000|$|Increased {{standards}} and improved equipment meant that class 5.9 climbs in the 1960s became only of moderate difficulty for some. Rather than reclassify all climbs each time standards improved, additional classes were added. It soon {{became apparent that}} an open-ended system was needed and further classes of 5.11, 5.12, etc. were added. It was later determined that the 5.11 climb was much harder than 5.10, leaving many climbs of varying difficulty <b>bunched</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 5.10.

2500|$|On the left, {{the three}} attacking battalions of the 92nd Brigade were {{subjected}} to a [...] "tremendous" [...] barrage on their assembly-positions, just before zero hour which caused much disorganisation.

The right-hand battalion was unable to advance and troops in the centre and left flank battalions found areas of uncut wire and lost many casualties, when they <b>bunched</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the gaps before reaching the wood, which they found to be full of fallen trees covered in barbed wire. The British troops were then cut off and captured or forced back with many casualties. Many of the troops were stranded in no man's land and had to wait all day under fire from snipers, machine-guns and artillery until nightfall, before completing the retirement. A German counter-attack pushed the 92nd Brigade back and retook Gavrelle Windmill for a short time, until forced back by another British attack. It was discovered after the war {{that the majority of the}} Hull Commercials who had been taken prisoner during the attack, had advanced as far as Oppy village.|$|R
40|$|Profiles of the {{electric}} field strength IEI 2 /IEoI 2 for spherical metallic shells on a dielectric core are presented both inside the particle and outside. The dependence of the near-field strength and extent on shell thickness and total particle size is discussed qualitatively. Although the internal fields inside the shell and in the core are larger than for homogeneous particles, for not too thick shells, this does not translate into a stronger near-field away {{from the surface of}} the shell. The fields inside the shell, at the low energy resonance and close to it, are rotated by ~ with respect to fields inside homogeneous particles, which means that the maximum field strengths in the shell are perpendicular to the incident polarisation. This follows from the fact that the low energy resonance for a shell is for the largest dipole moment of the whole system, which compensates the incident field. The largest moment is created when the same charges are collected at both interfaces (shell/medium and core/shell) along the incident polarisation. This creates regions of low field densities at the poles along the incident polarisation, because same charge fields repel each other. Following from that, the field lines are <b>bunched</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the perpendicular poles, creating large field line densities and hence large fields at these points. The case for opposite charges across the interfaces creates the high energy, antisymmetric resonance...|$|R
3000|$|Two marks were {{possible}} for each reason in Q 14, {{and there was}} an indication that students did slightly better for the first reason than the second. This is likely to have occurred because it is more difficult to think of two reasons than one. Overall, for both reasons, the mean score was 1.2. If a reason was repeated with little change, no mark was given for the second. The ‘not sure’ responses were generally followed by ‘I don't know’ or a blank. Some reasons for ‘Yes’ answers did not provide any specific information from the plot (score of 0), e.g. ‘Yes, because you can see it’ and ‘People have differnet [different] heights in diff[e]rent age groups.’ Scores of 1 generally only mentioned a single feature of the plot or a general recognition of the context: ‘If you look {{at the top of the}} graph there is one dot in the very end’ and ‘Yes because normally Year 7 's have bigger armspans (sic.) and I've seen it.’ Responses that scored 2 marks displayed a general recognition of difference in shape, as in, ‘Because one is more to the right and one more to the left’ and ‘Because the graph shows that grade 6 's are <b>bunched</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the small end’.

5000|$|Like most albums {{released}} {{during his}} lifetime, Our Mother the Mountain did not sell {{in great numbers}} but reinforced {{his reputation as a}} [...] "songwriter's songwriter". In the 2004 biopic Be Here To Love Me (its title taken from the opening track on Our Mother the Mountain), musician Joe Ely recalls first hearing the album after Van Zandt had given him a copy when they first crossed paths in Lubbock, Texas when Ely picked the singer up hitchhiking back to Houston from San Francisco in 1971. Van Zandt was carrying only his guitar and a backpack stuffed with records and, as a means of thanking Ely, gave him a brand-new copy of Our Mother the Mountain. [...] "I'd never met anybody who'd actually recorded an album before," [...] Ely remembered, [...] "and I take the record back to Jimmie Gilmore. We put the record on and we're just mesmerized by it. Ends up we played that record over and over for weeks. It made us rethink what we were doing and what a song was all about." [...] In the book To Live's To Fly: The Ballad of the Late, Great Townes Van Zandt, John Kruth describes the title track as [...] "otherworldly. Like the best of Van Zandt's dark sagas, this tale of a bewitched lover is a minor-key waltz that limps along like foreboding footsteps approaching in the hall, coming closer, closer, closer, as the song slowly envelops you." [...] AllMusic writes that, [...] "'St. John the Gambler' is the kind of hopeless, poetic love ballad Van Zandt does so well, with an aching melody that would have sounded better without the sappy strings," [...] and notes that the best tracks [...] "are <b>bunched</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the end of the album and only add minimal touches to Van Zandt's moaning delivery and sparse picking." ...|$|R
40|$|White dwarfs (WDs) are {{the most}} {{promising}} captors of dark matter (DM) particles in the crests {{that are expected to}} build up in the cores of dense stellar clusters. The DM particles could reach sufficient densities in WD cores to liberate energy through self-annihilation. The extinction associated with our Galactic Centre, the most promising region where to look for such effects, makes it impossible to detect the potential associated luminosity of the DM-burning WDs. However, in smaller stellar systems which are close enough to us and not heavily extincted, such as ω-Cen, {{we may be able to}} detect DM-burning WDs. We investigate the prospects of detection of DM-burning WDs in a stellar cluster harbouring an IMBH, which leads to higher densities of DM at the centre as compared with clusters without one. We calculate the capture rate of WIMPs by a WD around an IMBH and estimate the luminosity that a WD would emit depending on its distance to the center of the cluster. Direct-summation N-body simulations of ω-Cen yield a non-negligible number of WDs in the range of radii of interest. We apply our assumption to published HST/ACS observations of stars in the center of ω-Cen to search for DM burning WDs and, although we are not able to identify any evident candidate because of crowding and incompleteness, we proof that their <b>bunching</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> high luminosities would be unique. We predict that DM burning will lead to a truncation of the cooling sequence at the faint end. The detection of DM burning in future observations of dense stellar clusters, such as globular clusters or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could allow us to probe different models of DM distributions and characteristics such as the DM particle scattering cross section on nucleons. On the other hand, if DM-burning WDs really exist, their number and properties could give hints to the existence of IMBHs...|$|R

40|$|Architect, a time {{explicit}} hybrid code {{designed to}} perform quick simulations for electron driven plasma wakefield acceleration, is described. In {{order to obtain}} beam quality acceptable for applications, control of the beam-plasma-dynamics is necessary. Particle in Cell (PIC) codes represent the state-of-the-art technique to investigate the underlying physics and possible experimental scenarios; however PIC codes demand the necessity of heavy computational resources. Architect code substantially reduces the need for computational resources by using a hybrid approach: relativistic electron bunches are treated kinetically as in a PIC code and the background plasma as a fluid. Cylindrical symmetry is assumed for {{the solution of the}} electromagnetic fields and fluid equations. In this paper both the underlying algorithms as well as a comparison with a fully three dimensional particle in cell code are reported. The comparison highlights the good agreement between the two models up to the weakly non-linear regimes. In highly non-linear regimes the two models only disagree in a localized region, where the plasma electrons expelled by the <b>bunch</b> close <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the first}} plasma oscillation...|$|R
