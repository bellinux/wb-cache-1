5|$|Mary {{apparently}} expected Elizabeth to {{help her}} regain her throne. Elizabeth was cautious, ordering an inquiry into {{the conduct of the}} confederate lords and the question of whether Mary was guilty of Darnley's murder. In mid-July 1568, English authorities moved Mary to Bolton Castle, because it was further from the Scottish border <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> close to London. A commission of inquiry, or conference as it was known, was held in York and later Westminster between October 1568 and January 1569. In Scotland, her supporters fought a civil war against Regent Moray and his successors.|$|E

Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised {{for its ability}} to reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E

25|$|Carbon-related {{stars are}} stars whose spectra {{indicate}} production of carbon by helium triple-alpha fusion.

25|$|Not all {{numbers of}} a given length are equally hard to factor. The hardest {{instances}} of these problems (for currently known techniques) are semiprimes, the product of two prime numbers. When they are both large, for instance more than two thousand bits long, randomly chosen, and {{about the same size}} (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> close, e.g., to avoid efficient factorization by Fermat's factorization method), even the fastest prime factorization algorithms on the fastest computers can take enough time to make the search impractical; that is, as the number of digits of the primes being factored increases, the number of operations required to perform the factorization on any computer increases drastically.|$|E
25|$|In 1921 to 1926, William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberal {{government}} {{pursued a}} conservative domestic policy with {{the object of}} lowering wartime taxes and, especially, cooling wartime ethnic tensions, as well as defusing postwar labour conflicts. The Progressives refused to join the government, but did help the Liberals defeat non-confidence motions. King faced a delicate balancing act of reducing tariffs enough to please the Prairie-based Progressives, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> much to alienate his vital support in industrial Ontario and Quebec, which needed tariffs to compete with American imports. King and Conservative leader Arthur Meighen sparred constantly and bitterly in Commons debates. The Progressives gradually weakened. Their effective and passionate leader, Thomas Crerar, resigned {{to return to his}} grain business, and was replaced by the more placid Robert Forke. The socialist reformer J.S. Woodsworth gradually gained influence and power among the Progressives, and he reached an accommodation with King on policy matters.|$|E

25|$|The {{advertising}} {{program for the}} Crown Jewels sandwiches featured the slogan Flash, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> flash which was an inference stating while they cost more than the standard burger offerings at BK, they were {{not as much as}} one would expect to pay at a higher end outlet. The products were introduced in a series of three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in a fearful way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango).|$|E
500|$|Writer, director, and series creator Chris Carter based {{the episode}} around an idea he and fellow writer Frank Spotnitz {{had been working}} on, {{featuring}} a haunted house. The only scene that the two had completely planned out was the climax, which features Mulder and Scully pulling themselves across the floor, bleeding profusely. Carter wanted to keep all the action on one set, with the episode featuring only one location. To do this, production designer Corey Kaplan proposed that the episode be filmed in Scully's apartment, a set that the crew had not used for season six. Carter, however, wanting to keep the haunted house motif, asked Kaplan if she could design a mansion set. Kaplan was tasked with designing a set that was [...] "bleak, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> bleak [...] decrepit, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> decrepit," [...] and [...] "deserted, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> deserted." ...|$|E

James Endrst of the Hartford Courant identified her as [...] "a spoiled rich kid", while the Daily News dubbed Rachel an [...] "endearingly spoiled Daddy's girl." [...] Author Kim Etingoff wrote about Rachel in her book Jennifer Aniston: From Friends to Films [...] that the character is [...] "spunky and sometimes spoiled", while TV Land called her [...] "naive." [...] Citing the differences between Rachel and her two female friends, The Guardians Ryan Gilbey observed that the character [...] "wasn't insulated by self-regard, like Monica, or swaddled in gormlessness, like Phoebe." [...] Frequently identified as fitting the [...] "girl next door" [...] archetype, Anne Bilson of The Telegraph described Rachel as [...] "funny <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> funny, pretty <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> pretty, sexy <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> sexy, scatterbrained <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>too</b> scatterbrained."

[...] In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, intervened to secure a knighthood (KBE) for Wodehouse, which was announced in January 1975, in the same New Year Honours list in which Charlie Chaplin became Sir Charles.
