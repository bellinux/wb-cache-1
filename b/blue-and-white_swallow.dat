50|$|These {{birds are}} not to be {{confused}} with the very similar <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow,</b> which can be differentiated by the pale-footed swallows blackish flanks, and its faster flight. The pale-footed swallow is also slightly smaller than the <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
50|$|This swallow {{most likely}} nests in burrows, like the similar <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow,</b> in mossy {{cavities}} or in cavities created in roads. They prefer both subtropical and tropical montane forests {{and the upper}} cloud forest, avoiding clearings. They also prefer elfin forests, usually residing just above the altitudes where the <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow</b> resides, in comparably more forested areas.|$|E
50|$|The pale-footed swallow has {{a flight}} call {{frequently}} {{described as a}} dzreet. Their call can be differentiated from {{the call of the}} similar <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow</b> {{by the fact that it}} is drier than that of the <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow.</b> These swallows also have been known to use a call described as a trilled tre-e-e-ed. The song is a series of trills and thin warbles. The song is described as buzzy, but musical.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow's</b> shallow straw nest {{is built}} by both adults {{in a wide}} range of natural or {{man-made}} cavities include tree holes, rock crevices and bridges. The clutch is up to six white eggs in the south of the range, two or three in the north, which are incubated by both parents for 15 days to hatching. The nestlings are fed by both parents for 26 days to fledging, bur return to the nest to sleep with the parents for up to two months. There may be two broods.|$|R
50|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. They are usually seen in small flocks, occasionally with the <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{often found in}} small flocks when not breeding. The <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow</b> subsists {{primarily}} on a diet of insects, caught in the air; they have been seen to gather where termites swarm. The flight is typically fluttery, and this swallow frequently perches on wires or branches.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow</b> (Pygochelidon cyanoleuca) is a {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds from Nicaragua south throughout South America, {{except in the}} deserts and the Amazon Basin. The southern race is migratory, wintering {{as far north as}} Trinidad, where it is a regular visitor. The nominate northern race may have bred on that island.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow</b> averages 11 - 12 cm {{long and}} weighs about 10 g. It has dark blue upperparts and white underparts, and its underwings and the {{undersurface}} of its short forked tail are blackish. The juvenile is brown above, buff-tinted below, {{and has a}} less forked tail. The call is a buzzing dzzzhreeee.|$|E
50|$|This swallow is {{classified}} as least-concern by the IUCN. The justification {{for this is the}} fact that the population is stable, there are most likely more than 10,000 adults of this species, and they have a large range. The breeding range is estimated to be 2730000 km2. The population size is unknown, but it is apparently fairly common. Although this is true, it may be overlooked because of how similar it is to the <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
50|$|The pale-footed swallow is {{an aerial}} insectivore, eating insects in the air, usually over, and {{sometimes}} through, the forest canopy. They also forage over nearby clearings. Their flight is usually quick, low, and erratic. They {{are known to}} backtrack numerous times. These swallows usually forage in groups of 10—15, but sometimes 50 birds can be seen together.They usually don't perch, but when they do, they usually perch on bare, dead limbs of forest trees. They have been seen to forage with the similar <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow</b> and the brown-bellied swallow.|$|E
40|$|La golondrina chilena, Tachycineta meyeni (Cabanis), nidifica en el centro de Chile y suroeste de Argentina. En invierno migra a Bolivia, Paraguay y al sureste de Brasil. Estas golondrinas ocuparon una serie de cajas-nido en Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. Luego de la temporada de cría, tratamos los nidos con acetato de etilo y los revisamos en búsqueda de artrópodos hematófagos. Encontramos pulgas adultas, que fueron fijadas, aclaradas, deshidratadas, diafanizadas y montadas en un derivado de clavo de olor para su observación al microsocopio óptico. Identificamos machos y hembras de Dasypsyllus (Avesopsylla) lasius lasius (Rothschild). En Argentina, esta pulga es conocida solamente en Sierra de la Ventana (Buenos Aires), donde se la halló parasitando la golondrina barranquera, Notiochelidon cyanoleuca patagonica (Vieillot). La información disponible debería complementarse con prospecciones en localidades intermedias. Otras aves relacionadas con ambas golondrinas por la ocupación de nidos, como el rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda (Gmelin)), ratona común (Troglodytes aedon Vieillot), caminera común (Geositta cunicularia (Vieillot)), hornero (Furnarius rufus (Gmelin)), podrían contribuir a la dispersión de la pulga entre las dos localidades registradas. Chilean {{swallows}} Tachycineta meyeni (Cabanis) nest in {{the central}} area in Chile and Southwest in Argentina. In winter, they migrate to Bolivia, Paraguay and Southeast of Brazil. A nest box population of Chilean swallows was established in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. After the breeding season, we collected all nests, treated them with ethyl acetate, and inspected all the nest material for hematophagous arthropods. We found adult fleas, which were fixed, cleared, diaphanized, dehydrated, and mounted in a clove derivative for observation under a microscope. We identified males and females of Dasypsyllus (Avesopsylla) lasius lasius (Rothschild). In Argentina, this flea is only known for Sierra de la Ventana (Buenos Aires), where it was found parasitizing the <b>blue-and-white</b> <b>swallow</b> Notiochelidon cyanoleuca patagonica (Vieillot). This information should be completed with prospecting at intermediate localities. Other birds that occupy nests of both of these swallow species, and which may contribute to flea dispersal between the two recorded localities, include the following: thorn-tailed Aphrastura spinicauda (Gmelin), house wren Troglodytes aedon Vieillot, common miner Geositta cunicularia (Vieillot), and rufous hornero Furnarius rufus (Gmelin) ...|$|E
