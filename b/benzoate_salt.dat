Abamectin is also used as a veterinary antihelmintic. Resistance to abamectin-based antihelmintics, although a growing problem, is not as common as to other classes of veterinary antihelmintics. The <b>benzoate</b> <b>salt</b> emamectin benzoate is also used as an insecticide.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} between {{silver benzoate}} (1) and iodine is very fast and produces a very reactive iodinium benzoate intermediate (2). The {{reaction of the}} iodinium salt (2) with an alkene gives another short-lived iodinium salt (3). Nucleophilic substitution (SN2) by the <b>benzoate</b> <b>salt</b> gives the ester (4). Another silver ion causes the neighboring group substitution of the benzoate ester to give the oxonium salt (5). A second SN2 substitution by the benzoate anion gives the desired diester (6).|$|E
50|$|Emamectin, {{produced}} by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis, belongs to the avermectin family of compounds all of which exhibit toxicity for nematodes, arthropods, and several other pests. The <b>benzoate</b> <b>salt</b> of emamectin in particular has found widespread use as an insecticide and is approved by the EPA for use in prevention of emerald ash borer in ash trees.Emamectin is derived from avermectin B1, also known as abamectin, a mixture of the natural avermectin B1a and B1b. Emamectin has also shown promising applications in the eradication of fish lice and in fish farming.|$|E

40|$|Starting from (S) -β-phenylalanine, easily {{accessible}} by lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution, a chiral triamine was assembled by a reductive amination and finally cyclized {{to form the}} title compound 10. In the crystals of the guanidinium <b>benzoate</b> <b>salt</b> the six membered rings of 10 adopt conformations close to an envelope with the phenyl substituents in pseudo-axial positions. The unprotonated guanidine 10 catalyzes Diels–Alder reactions of anthrones and maleimides (25 – 30 % ee). It also promotes as a strong Brønsted base the retro-aldol reaction of some cycloadducts with kinetic resolution of the enantiomers. In three cases, the retro-aldol products (48 – 83 % ee) could be recrystallized to high enantiopurity (≥ 95 % ee).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, five {{different}} products of each metronidazole tablets and <b>benzoate</b> <b>salt</b> oral suspensions were purchased {{from the different}} retail outlets in the local market of Addis Ababa and analyzed using official methods (Pharmacopoeial methods of USP/BP/IP) by employing HPLC for the tablet dosage forms and nonaqueous titration with potentiometric end point for the suspensions. The assay results showed that all brand and generic products of metronidazole tablets and metronidazole benzoate oral suspensions met the USP and the IP specifications, respectively. Furthermore, all the tablets analyzed have passed the hardness, friability and weight variation tests. All tablets except metrogyl passed the disintegration time test and dissolution rate test specifications of BP/USP.

40|$|A dataset {{consisting}} of structures and aqueous solubility and melting point data for 51 salt {{forms of the}} phenylethylamine base methylephedrine is presented. Analysis showed correlation between solubility and melting point and between melting point of the salt and melting point of the parent acid, but no correlation of salt solubility with solubility of the parent acid. Identification of associations was aided by examining chemically sensible subgroups of the dataset, and this approach highlighted significantly different relationships between solubility and melting point for these subgroups. Thus, for example, the expected negative correlation between solubility and melting point was found for 24 anhydrous <b>benzoate</b> <b>salts,</b> but a positive correlation observed for 8 halide salts. Hydrated forms were anomalous. Packing analysis identified groups of structures that were isostructural with respect to cation packing.

40|$|The {{anhydrous}} salts of 1 H -indole- 3 -ethanamine (tryptamine) with isomeric (2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) {{acetic acid}} (2, 4 -D) and (3, 5 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic (3, 5 -D), C 10 H 13 N 2 + (C 8 H 5 Cl 2 O 3) -, [(I) and (II), respectively] have been determined and their one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded polymeric structures are described. In the crystal of (I),the aminium H-atoms {{are involved in}} three separate inter-species N-H [...] . O hydrogen-bonding interactions, two with carboxyl O-atom acceptors and the third in an asymmetric three-centre bidentate carboxyl O,O' chelate [graph set R 2 / 1 (4) ].

O(carboxyl) hydrogen bonds similar to (I) but with the third, a three-centre asymmetric interaction with carboxyl and phenoxy O-atoms is found [graph set R 2 / 1 (5) ]. The chain polymeric extension is also along b. There are no pi [...] pi ring interactions in either of the structures.

40|$|The {{structures}} of the Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba salts of 1 -naphthoic acid are examined and compared with analogous {{structures of}} <b>salts</b> of <b>benzoate</b> derivatives. It is shown that catena-poly[[[diaquabis(1 -naphthoato-kappa O) magnesium(II) ]-mu-aqua]dihydrate], {[Mg(C 11 H 7 O 2) (2) (H 2 O) (3) ]center dot 2 H(2) O}(n), exists as a one-dimensional coordination polymer that propagates only through Mg-OH 2 -Mg interactions along the crystallographic b direction. In contrast with related <b>benzoate</b> <b>salts,</b> the naphthalene systems are large enough to prevent inorganic chain-to-chain interactions, and thus species with inorganic channels rather than layers are formed. The Ca, Sr and Ba salts all have metal centres that lie on a twofold axis (Z'= 1 / 2) and all have the common name catena-poly[[diaquametal(II) ]-bis(mu- 1 -naphthoato) -kappa O- 3,O':O;kappa O- 3 :O,O '], [M(C- 11 -H 7 O 2) (2) (H 2 O) (2) ](n), where M = Ca, Sr or Ba. The Ca and Sr salts are essentially isostructural, and all three species form one-dimensional coordination polymers through a carboxylate group that forms three M-O bonds. The polymeric chains propagate via c-glide planes and through MOMO four-membered rings. Again, inorganic channel structures are formed rather than layered structures, and the three structures {{are similar to those}} found for Ca and Sr salicylates and other substituted benzoates...|$|R
40|$|Benzene is {{classified}} by the IARC as carcinogenic to humans. Several sources may contribute for {{the occurrence of}} this toxic compound in foods, such as, environmental and process contamination and the oxidative decarboxilation of benzoic acid {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid. <b>Benzoate</b> <b>salts</b> and ascorbic acid may be naturally present or added as food additives. A screening for the presence of benzene in foods of the Belgian market was performed. 400 food samples were purchased in local supermarkets. Food selection was based on several criteria, including the natural presence of benzoate, the presence of benzoate as a food additive, the potential presence of environmental or process contaminations, etc. Food samples were analyzed by distillation and isotope dilution HS-GC/MS. This method was fully validated [1] and presents detection limits below the legal limit established by the European Council for benzene in drinking water (1 µg L- 1). Precautions were taken to prevent losses of benzene and/or artefactual benzene formation from benzoic acid during analysis. Preliminary results of 290 samples analysed showed the presence of benzene in 64 % of the samples. 36 % of the samples contained benzene above 1 µg L- 1 and 23 samples (8 %) presented benzene concentrations above 10 µg L- 1. The highest benzene contents were found in coffee, tea and fish products. These high concentrations are possibly due to the production process or specific nature of the food samples. The high number of contaminated samples suggests that environmental contamination of benzene in the food chain should not be underestimated. References [1] R. M. Vinci, M. Canfyn, B.

The initial growth rate in benzoate, p-hydroxybenzoate or phenylacetate increased and then decreased with increasing concentration of benzenoid compound, according to a relationship which is interpreted by analogy with enzyme inhibition by excess substrate.
