25|$|On November 25, 1864, Carson led {{his forces}} against the southwestern tribes at the First Battle of Adobe Walls in the Texas panhandle. Adobe Walls was an {{abandoned}} trading <b>post</b> <b>blown</b> up by its inhabitants {{to prevent a}} take-over by hostile Indians. Combatants at the First Battle were the United States Army and Indian scouts against Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches. It {{was one of the}} largest engagements fought on the Great Plains.|$|R
50|$|Hurt Wood Mill {{was built}} in the 1845, {{replacing}} a post mill that had been <b>blown</b> down. The <b>post</b> mill was standing in 1648. The mill worked by wind until c1885 and the sails and fantail were removed shortly afterwards. The mill was house converted at some point, with two new sails being fitted in 1914. In 1937 four new sails and two new stocks were fitted by Neve's, the Heathfield millwrights.|$|R

50|$|On 6 June, state TV {{started to}} report heavily armed groups of unknown gunmen attacking {{security}} {{forces in the}} town. According to these reports, they first ambushed a group of policemen, who were responding to calls from local residents that unknown gunmen were terrorising them, killing 20 of them. Later they attacked a police command center and overran it killing another 82 {{members of the security}} forces. Also, the gunmen attacked and <b>blew</b> up a <b>post</b> office that was guarded by the police which left another eight policemen dead. In all, 120 security forces troops were reported killed during the day.|$|R
5000|$|Conversing with Michael, Oliver {{says that}} Grant wishes someone could {{be punished for}} his mother's death, at which Michael is again suspicious. Researching archives, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and {{that he tried to}} <b>blow</b> up a <b>post</b> office in Kansas at age 16. He is seen by Oliver, who later confronts him, incensed at Michael's {{intrusions}} and presumptions of judgment. He states that he was retaliating against the government for seizing his family farm's water supply, which rendered it unusable and eventually led to his father's suicide. He states he was imprisoned, and admits to assuming the identity of his deceased friend Oliver Lang to hide his criminality from his children.|$|R
60|$|The veranda was shady, and Kit {{sat on the}} {{top step}} in the cool breeze that <b>blew</b> between the <b>posts.</b> Olivia {{occupied}} a basket-chair farther back; her pose was languidly graceful and sometimes she smiled. It was not for nothing she had put on clothes she liked the best of all she had, but she thought she knew why Kit for the most part looked at the town and not at her. Sometimes his puritanical conscience bothered him. Mrs. Austin's rule was to receive all her friends who liked to come after six o'clock, but Kit had arrived two hours sooner, because Olivia had hinted that he might. She knew Jacinta would not be about, and now thought Kit imagined he ought to go.|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether the material of construction perceptibly affects the timbre of a lip-reed instrument {{has been the subject of}} much discussion. In this paper, to establish whether any differences in timbre can be correlated with variations in wall vibration amplitude, five post horns of identical geometry and surface finish but manufactured from different copper alloys are studied. Mounting each post horn, in turn, vertically on a turntable, enabled vibration measurements to be made at discrete locations around the circumference and along the length of each instrument. First, the frequencies and shapes of the structural resonances of the post horns were established by mechanically exciting the post horn under test through a set frequency range and using a laser Doppler vibrometer to measure the wall vibration amplitudes. An artificial mouth was then used to <b>blow</b> each <b>post</b> horn, the notes produced were recorded and the vibration amplitudes induced under playing conditions were measured using the vibrometer. The wall vibrations induced when the post horns were artificially blown are compared with each other and then related to the structural responses of the instrument. In addition, preliminary results are presented from both spectral and psychoacoustical analysis of the notes produced by each post horn...|$|R
6000|$|From about August 6th, or {{especially}} August 10th, {{when the}} Maria-Theresa Correspondence, or [...] "Congress of Braunau," [...] ended likewise in zero, Friedrich became impatient for actual junction with Prince Henri, actual push of business; {{and began to}} hint of an excellent plan he had: [...] "Burst through on their left flank; <b>blow</b> up their <b>post</b> of Hohenelbe yonder: thence is but one march to Iser river; junction with Prince Henri there; and a Lacy and a Loudon tumbled to the winds." [...] "A plan perfectly feasible," [...] says Schmettau; [...] "which solaced the King's humor, but which he never really intended to execute." [...] Possibly not; otherwise, according to old wont, he would have forborne to speak of it beforehand. At all events, August 15th, in the feeling that one ought really to do something, the rather as forage hereabouts was almost or altogether running out, he actually set about this grand scheme.|$|R
50|$|He {{joined the}} Provisional IRA and was first arrested in 1972 {{on charges of}} <b>blowing</b> up the <b>post</b> office in Moy. He spent six weeks on remand, but was {{released}} due to insufficient evidence. In December 1973 he was arrested again and later sentenced to seven years for possession of a rifle. He was imprisoned in Long Kesh and later in Magilligan prison. During this period of incarceration his younger brother Seán, also an IRA paramilitary, was killed whilst engaged in IRA activity on 13 May 1974. He was released in 1977 but was sentenced to 14 years in August 1980 after being caught by the British Army with a loaded sten gun along with another IRA member Gerard O'Callaghan. That same year his older brother Tommy, who {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment, nearly died on hunger strike after refusing food for 53 days. Another brother, Kevin, a civilian, and an uncle, Jack McKearney, were both shot dead by Loyalist paramilitaries.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} 5 November (1998), V <b>blows</b> up the <b>Post</b> Office Tower and Jordan Tower, killing [...] "the Ear" [...] leader Brian Etheridge; {{in addition}} to effectively shutting down three government agencies: the Eye, the Ear, and the Mouth. Creedy's men and Harper's associated street gangs violently suppress the subsequent wave of revolutionary fervor from the public. V notes to Evey {{that he has not}} yet achieved what he calls the [...] "Land of Do-as-You-Please", meaning a functional anarchistic society, and considers the current chaotic situation an interim period of [...] "Land of Take-What-You-Want". Finch has been mysteriously absent and his young assistant, Dominic Stone, one day realises that V has been influencing the Fate computer all along, which would explain V's consistent foresight. All the while, Finch has been travelling to the abandoned site of Larkhill, where he takes LSD to conjure up memories of his own devastated past and to put his mind in the role of a prisoner of Larkhill, like V, to help give him an intuitive understanding of V's experiences. Returning to London, Finch suddenly deduces that V's lair is inside the abandoned Victoria Station, which he enters.|$|R
50|$|Post led {{more than}} 40 firefighters, {{consisting}} of USFS, CCC, and BPR employees, up the ridge seeking {{an opening in}} the forest to take refuge. Spot fires <b>blew</b> ahead of <b>Post</b> and his crews preventing them from advancing further up the ridge, but they found a rocky outcropping and laid prone on the ground as the fire engulfed them. Crammed together on the outcropping, Post's men moved around to avoid the flames and USFS employee Paul Tyrrell (who later died) used his own body to keep several CCC firefighters from panicking and to shield them from the fire. The flames and heat nevertheless drove five firefighters to charge the flames in an attempt to escape {{to the other side of}} the firefront, but only one of them survived. A total of nine firefighters were killed on the fire lines and six more died later from their burns, while another 38 suffered various injuries. The Blackwater fire is tied for fourth involving the greatest loss of life by firefighters on a wildfire in U.S. history. It killed more professional wildland firefighters in the U.S. than any other in the 103 years between the Great Fire of 1910 and the Yarnell Hill Fire in 2013.|$|R
50|$|Several events {{involving}} V differ markedly {{from the}} comics. He sets his first bomb {{to destroy the}} Old Bailey and targets the Houses of Parliament one year later, {{but he does not}} <b>blow</b> up the <b>Post</b> Office or 10 Downing Street and the bomb he leaves in Jordan Tower is safely defused. In place of Finch, Norsefire official Peter Creedy and his men confront V {{at the end of the}} film, bringing High Chancellor Adam Sutler (Adam Susan in the graphic novel) as V has demanded. Creedy executes Sutler, but V refuses Creedy's command to take off his mask and surrender: through a hail of gunfire, V stays on his feet long enough to kill Creedy and his men. A piece of armor plating under his cape stops most of the bullets, but V is still mortally wounded. He staggers down to the Underground tunnel, where Evey is waiting, and dies in her arms. She places his body on the explosive-laden train for a Viking funeral, but Finch arrives with the intent of arresting her. However, he relents and allows Evey to start the train, having finally decided to turn his back on the tyrannical Norsefire regime. The two watch, along with thousands of spectators dressed as V, as the train explodes and destroys the Houses of Parliament.|$|R
60|$|And if Mr. Brumley's {{system of}} romantically {{distorted}} moral assumptions was shattered by Lady Harman's impersonal <b>blow</b> at a <b>post</b> office window {{when all the}} rules seemed to require her to fly from the oppression of one man to the chivalry of another, what words can convey the devastating effect upon him of her conduct after her release? To that crisis he had been looking forward continually; to record the variety of his expectations would fill a large volume, but throughout them all prevailed one general idea, that {{when she came out}} of prison her struggle with her husband would be resumed, and that this would give Mr. Brumley such extraordinary opportunities of displaying his devotion that her response, which he was now beginning to suspect might be more reluctant than his earlier dreams had assumed, was ultimately inevitable. In all these dreams and meditations that response figured as the crown. He had to win and possess Lady Harman. The idea had taken hold of his busy yet rather pointless life, had become his directing object. He was full of schemes for presently arresting and captivating her imagination. He was already convinced that she cared for him; he had to inflame interest and fan liking into the fire of passion. And with a mind so occupied, Mr. Brumley wrote this and that and went about his affairs. He spent two days and a night at Margate visiting his son at his preparatory school, and he found much material for musing in the question of just how the high romantic affairs ahead of him would affect this delicately intelligent boy. For a time perhaps he might misjudge his father.... He spent a week-end with Lady Viping and stayed on until Wednesday and then he came back to London. His plans were still unformed when the day came for Lady Harman's release, and indeed beyond an idea that he would have her met at the prison gates by an enormous bunch of snowy-white and crimson chrysanthemums he had nothing really concrete at all in his mind.|$|R
40|$|Islamic veiling {{has been}} the subject of many theological, social and legal debates, which are fluid and their {{intensity}} has been further influenced by its contextualised meanings such as religiosity, modesty, identity, resistance, protest, choice and subjugation. Literature on Muslim veiling has either examined its treatment by legal or socio-feminist perspectives, whereas this thesis critiques the religious, socio-feministic and the legal discourses. The contemporary discourse is dominated by competing binaries that label it as a tool of oppression or one of empowerment. Many of the assertions are based not on the veil’s multiple meanings or the wearer’s true motivations but on misplaced assumptions of moral authority by those who oppose or defend the practice, as well as native informants professing to represent veiled Muslim women, leaving Muslim veiled women’s voices muted. Having examined the religious imperative that has a patriarchal basis, the thesis constructs a critique of the two dominant discourses central to the contemporary debates on veiling. One discourse defends the practice as empowering whilst the other calls for prohibitions on the practice using liberation from oppression as a justification, particularly with issues surrounding the wearing of the full face veil. This is followed by a critique of the key cases generated under Article 9 ECHR, which attempts to balance the religious rights of those who veil with the rights of others. The case law highlights that the ECtHR not only falls short in disclosing satisfactorily how it has struck a balance between these competing rights, but also fails to adopt a neutral stance to religious expression through symbols, its reasoning being based on contradictory stereotypes of Muslim women as passive and victims of gender oppression in need of liberation. The influence of such stereotypes and an inadequate application of the margin of appreciation doctrine have led the ECtHR in validating state prohibitions on the hijab and the full face veil, thereby failing to acknowledge the voices of the veiled women at the centre of a human rights claim, delivering a further <b>blow</b> to them. <b>Post</b> the case of S. A. S. v. France the ECtHR has exasperated this even further by allowing an abstract principle of ‘living together’ as a justification for the full face veil’s prohibition in public spaces, resulting in Article 9 rights of Muslim women who veil being endangered even further by the introduction of such an open-ended ground...|$|R
5000|$|On 8 June 1943, Leonardi was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Augusta-Syracuse Naval Fortress Area.This was the most heavily armed fortress in Sicily, with six coastal batteries of large and medium caliber (381 mm, 254 mm, 152 mm), 17 anti-aircraft batteries (102 and 76 mm guns), two armed pontoons (armed with 149 and 190 mm guns) on the seaward side; like many fortresses and bases of the Regia Marina, however, whereas the seaward side was strongly fortified, the defences on the landward side were far weaker. The landward defence perimeter, 50 km long, consisted of a chain of 30 coastal strongholds manned by two coastal battalions.When the Allied forces landed in Sicily, on July 10, 1943, no amphibious landing was carried out against Augusta; to avoid facing the formidable coastal defences of Augusta, a column of the Eighth Army landed between Avola and Pachino and then attacked Syracuse from the weakly defended landward side, across the Anapo river. Airborne troops also {{took part in the}} attack against Augusta and Syracuse in Operation Ladbroke.Admiral Leonardi tried to stem the British advance with tumultuary troops, but to little avail, as he had no artillery (Augusta, as mentioned, was only armed with coastal and anti-aircraft batteries: the former could be useful to repel an amphibious landing, and the latter against aircraft, but both were useless against a ground attack) or organic troops. While British forces steamrolled towards Syracuse and the interior, Leonardi tried to organize a counter-attack in co-operation with German units, but on the night between 10 and 11 July - while Leonardi was absent from Augusta, having gone in the backcountry to organize the counter-attack - many the troops that manned the Augusta defences, and especially the units of the Coastal Artillery Militia (MILMART, a Blackshirt branch tasked with coastal defense, whose personnel was recruited locally, and whose morale was particularly low because of the dire conditions of their families and their fear of being executed for being Fascist) abandoned their <b>posts,</b> <b>blew</b> up batteries and fortifications, disbanded and went home. When he was informed of this, Leonardi put together some units with second-line troops and dispersed soldiers and tried again to organize a defense together with German units; he [...] "spent the next few days dashing from unit to unit, to bolster morale and {{to keep in touch with}} his disparate and dispersed forces", and at one point, on July 12, he personally reactivated an abandoned MILMART battery and opened fire on the first British destroyer that entered Augusta harbour. These movements, however, also had the effect of preventing many subordinates from contacting him, causing further confusion.The abandonment and destruction of the coastal batteries enabled the Royal Navy to land troops directly in Augusta; despite fierce fighting in some areas, both Augusta and Syracuse fell by July 13. Leonardi himself was captured by British forces six days later and sent to a POW camp in Great Britain, where he remained till November 1944.|$|R
