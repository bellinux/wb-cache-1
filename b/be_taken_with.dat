5|$|Vasari {{suggests}} that the tomb went over budget, costing 1,000florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess. Although the original source for this claim is unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500florins, yet its exactness may <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> a grain of salt.|$|E

5|$|The 2010 {{census of}} Association of Religion Data Archives has also {{reported}} that 46.5% {{of the total population}} was Christian, slightly larger than the Muslim population of 45.5%, while 7.7% were members of other religions. However, these estimates should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> caution because sample data is mostly collected from major urban areas in the south, which are predominantly Christian.|$|E
5|$|The dusky woodswallow has a {{very large}} range. The {{population}} size of this bird {{has not yet been}} quantified or estimated. It is, however, expected to be as populous as other birds within its densest range labeled 'common'. Because of this, the dusky woodswallow is evaluated to be of Least Concern (LC). This classification may change with new evidence, so is not to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> complete accuracy.|$|E
5|$|At his Pro Day workout, Vick ran the 40-yard dash in 4.33 seconds; {{his time}} has been clocked as low as 4.25, which is the fastest-ever for an NFL quarterback. Vick was {{selected}} first in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons, becoming the first African-American quarterback to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> the top pick. The San Diego Chargers had the number-one selection but traded it to Atlanta Falcons {{the day before the}} draft for the Falcons' first- and third-round picks in 2001. Vick was taken in the 30th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies, despite not playing baseball since the 8th grade.|$|E

5|$|Care must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> medications, as {{side effects}} {{may be more}} common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications for classroom learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E
5|$|Embers of the badnjak may be {{used for}} divination in Jadar. The number of these equal to the sum of grain and {{livestock}} sorts grown by the family are taken out from the ognjište and placed on the česnica. Each of the sorts is associated with its own ember on that loaf. The sort whose ember retains its glow longer than the others should be the most productive in the coming year. The log sparking by itself presages a rich harvest of honey. Cooled coals of the badnjak may be placed between the branches of fruit trees; the young trees may be provided also with twigs from the badnjak. Its ash may be spread over the fields and mixed with fodder. Some of the ash may be set aside to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> water as a remedy for headache. There are also numerous other regional practices connected with the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of the}} sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is {{supported}} by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles. The lions may {{be based on the}} Florentine , as if to mark John XXIII {{in the same manner as}} a conquered city-state. As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E

5|$|Regarded {{as the top}} {{offensive}} tackle available in the 2008 NFL Draft, Long drew comparisons to Ryan Tucker. His 37 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press tied Vernon Gholston for the highest total at the 2008 NFL Combine. In addition to being one of eight {{offensive tackle}}s drafted {{in the first round}} that year, Long was only the third offensive tackle ever to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, after Hall of Famer Orlando Pace (1997, a 5-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 2000s) and Hall of Famer Ron Yary (1968, an 8-time All-Pro and All-Decade team for the 1970s). The Dolphins drafted Long's college teammate, quarterback Chad Henne, {{in the second round of}} the draft with the 57th overall pick.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of the Earl of Gloucester's death at the Battle of Bannockburn is the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi. This account is written as a moral tale, expounding on the earl's heroism and the cowardly conduct of his companions. For this reason, its historical accuracy must <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> some caution. According to some accounts, Gloucester rushed headfirst into battle {{in the pursuit of}} glory, and fell victim to his own foolishness. The Vita, on the other hand, claimed that, as the earl was vigorously trying to fend off the Scottish attacks, he was knocked off his horse, and killed when his own men failed to come to his rescue. It is also likely that the quarrels between Gloucester and Hereford over precedence could have contributed to the chaotic situation. According to one account, Gloucester rushed into battle without a distinguishing coat of arms, exposing himself to the Scottish soldiers, who otherwise would have been eager to secure a valuable ransom.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex {{had made}} {{researchers}} at the Bakelite Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not {{taking advantage of the}} latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> the Bakelite barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.|$|E

25|$|When ingested, it {{is usually}} {{recommended}} that the more water-soluble, short-acting tetracyclines (plain tetracycline, chlortetracycline, Oxytetracycline, demeclocycline and methacycline) <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> a full glass of water, either two hours after eating or two hours before eating. This is partly because most tetracyclines bind with food and also easily with magnesium, aluminium, iron and calcium, which reduces their ability to be completely absorbed by the body. Dairy products, antacids and preparations containing iron should be avoided near the time of taking the drug. Partial exceptions to these rules occur for doxycycline and minocycline, which may <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> food (though not iron, antacids, or calcium supplements). Minocycline can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> dairy products {{because it does not}} chelate calcium as readily, although dairy products do decrease absorption of minocycline slightly.|$|E

25|$|When {{levofloxacin}} <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> anti-acids containing {{magnesium hydroxide}} or aluminum hydroxide, the two combine to form insoluble salts {{that are difficult}} to absorb from the intestines. Peak serum concentrations of levofloxacin may be reduced by 90% or more, which can prevent the levofloxacin from working. Similar results have been reported when levofloxacin <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>with</b> iron supplements and multi-vitamins containing zinc.|$|R
