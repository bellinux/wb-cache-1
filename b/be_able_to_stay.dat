5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Ekholm was {{skeptical of the}} balloon's ability to retain hydrogen, from his own measurements. His {{buoyancy}} checks {{in the summer of}} 1896, during the process of producing the hydrogen and pumping it into the balloon, convinced him that the balloon leaked too much to ever reach the Pole, let alone go on to Russia or Canada. The worst leakage came from the approximately eight million tiny stitching holes along the seams, which no amount of glued-on strips of silk or applications of special secret-formula varnish seemed to seal. The balloon was losing 68kilograms (150lb) of lift force a day. Taking into account its heavy load, Ekholm estimated that it would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> airborne for 17 days at most, not 30. When {{it was time to go}} home, he warned Andrée that he would not take part in the next attempt, scheduled for summer 1897, unless a stronger, better-sealed balloon was bought.|$|E
5|$|Early {{during the}} {{development}} of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. (The New York Times reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least The Winds of Winter before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published {{before the start of the}} sixth season of the HBO series.|$|E

25|$|Wattles began {{training}} Dan Patch {{in earnest}} at a half-mile track (0.8 km) in Templeton in 1899. Before {{his first start}} in August 1900, Dan Patch impressed Messner and Wattles with a timed mile of 2:14, a promising performance for an unprompted horse who {{did not seem to}} be working hard. On August 30, they entered him at the Boswell county fair with a purse of $250 against 2:35 horses, meaning their fastest official time was no better than the next level of 2:20. Attendance at the fair that day exceeded 8,000, boosted by a large contingent from Oxford who wanted to see the local favorite. Dan Patch did not disappoint, winning in three straight heats in times of 2:24, 2:24 and 2:24. Wattles had not pushed the colt, wanting to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> at the 2:35 level and perhaps to improve his odds in potential side bets in his upcoming races.|$|E

25|$|The eighteenth {{stage was}} an {{individual}} time trial, with a finish on the Mont Ventoux. It was won {{with a great}} margin by Jean-François Bernard, who became the new leader of the general classification, and the new hope of the French cycling fans. Bernard was a good climber and a good time-trialist, and {{had the support of}} a good team, so he could <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> leader {{until the end of the}} race. But already in the next stage, Bernard lost considerable time. He had a flat tire just before the top of a climb, and lost contact with the other riders while he had to wait for repairs, and had to spend energy to get back. His rivals Mottet and Roche had made a plan to attack in the feed zone, where cyclists could get their lunch. Mottet and Roche had packed extra food at the start of the stage, and attacked while Bernard was at the back of the peloton. Bernard chased them, but was not able to get back to them, and lost four minutes in that stage, which made Roche the new leader, closely followed by Mottet and Delgado.|$|E
25|$|When Noah visits {{his father}} in prison, he crushes the Colonel's hopes by {{revealing}} that his marriage to Ameera is in name only and that he and Luke are still a couple. Not long thereafter, Ameera disappears, leaving a note saying that she will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in the country without the marriage and will have it annulled. Luke and Noah have little time to celebrate before they are advised that the Colonel has escaped from prison, which leads Noah to fear for his boyfriend's safety and also to worry that Ameera has been kidnapped. When Noah tries to track him down, the Colonel assaults him, but he manages to get away and reunite with Luke and Ameera, who has also escaped the Colonel. The Colonel is determined to get Ameera back under his control and tricks the young men with some fake police officers, but Luke calls upon his grandmother Lucinda, who brings real police to protect them. Following a confrontation with his son, the Colonel dives {{into the water and}} does not resurface; he is believed dead. Noah blames Luke for this for a time, but the couple eventually reunite after Cyndi Lauper, in town on the True Colors Tour, dedicates a set to Luke. Noah tells Luke he wants to be with him, and the couple kiss again.|$|E

Valverde himself said that taking {{the record for the}} most wins in the race was [...] "a real honour". He gave credit to his team – and especially to Giovanni Visconti – for driving hard just before the climb started, in order to get him into the perfect position. He said that he had been confident that, if he accelerated in the final part of the climb, he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> away to the finish line.|$|E
500|$|Harvey and Stewart {{said that}} the fatwa was a {{departure}} from the previous legal opinions among Islamic scholars, which typically emphasised the obligation to emigrate from any country where proper religious observance was not possible. Notably, the Maliki scholar al-Wansharisi, the leading living authority on the issue, was among the proponents of this view. Stewart contended that, while the fatwa's text did not mention any opponent, it was intended as a rebuke against the views of al-Wansharisi. Recipients of this fatwa would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> put, outwardly conforming to Christianity and not see themselves as abandoning their faith. The fatwa addressed the recipient as [...] "al-guraba", a word that means [...] "outsiders" [...] or [...] "those living abroad", but this word also appears in several hadiths (sayings of Muhammad) and evokes a spiritual meaning of heroic Muslims loyal to their faith in spite of great suffering. The sympathy shown by the author, as well as his acknowledgement of the Muslims' loyalty and suffering, is in contrast with the predominant opinion such as al-Wansharisi's which saw them unfavourably.|$|E
500|$|On September 4, 1995, Simms' jersey was {{retired in}} a halftime {{ceremony}} {{of a game}} versus the Dallas Cowboys. During an emotional speech, Simms stated {{that he wanted to}} don his jersey one final time, and throw [...] "one more pass" [...] to teammate Lawrence Taylor. Simms later commented, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass." [...] Simms then motioned for Taylor to run a longer pattern, and after 30–40yards, threw him the pass. Taylor later stated that the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, [...] "I'm saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), 'If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way to Upper Saddle River because there ain't no way I'm going to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in that stadium'." [...] Taylor caught the pass however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval. Since he has been retired for more than five years, Simms is eligible for selection into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; he has yet to be inducted, however.|$|E

In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled Toughman on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms' jersey during halftime of {{a game against the}} Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, [...] "ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I've put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he's got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he's had a few beers and he's going to run down the field and I'm going to throw him a pass."
