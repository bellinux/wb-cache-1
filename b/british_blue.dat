25|$|The National Flag {{must always}} be flown in a {{position}} superior to {{that of any other}} flag or ensign when flown in Australia or on Australian territory, and it should always be flown aloft and free. The flag must be flown in all government buildings and displayed in polling stations when there is a national election or referendum. Private pleasure craft can fly either the Red Ensign or the Australian National Flag. The <b>British</b> <b>Blue</b> Ensign can be flown on an Australian owned ship instead of the Australian Flag if the owner has a warrant valid under British law.|$|E
25|$|The flag {{consists}} of a defaced <b>British</b> <b>Blue</b> Ensign with the state badge located in the fly. The badge is a white disk with a red lion passant in {{the centre of the}} disk. There is no official record of how the lion came to be included on the flag. Where this design originated from is unknown, but it is assumed that the red lion is a link with England. This flag has remained almost unchanged since 1875, with only a slight change of the style of the lion when the flag was officially adopted by the government in 1975, although this was a mistake, as it had already been officially gazetted by the colonial government in 1876.|$|E

2500|$|The first flag of New Zealand to {{be based}} on the <b>British</b> <b>blue</b> ensign was {{introduced}} in 1867 following the Colonial Navy Defence Act 1865, which required all ships owned by colonial governments fly the defaced Royal Navy blue ensign with a colonial badge.

2500|$|The first local flag of Tasmania {{was adopted}} by {{proclamation}} of Tasmanian colonial Governor Sir Frederick Weld on 9 November 1875. [...] The flag had a white cross on a blue field, in the canton was the Union Flag, and in the fly was five five-pointed stars of the Southern Cross. [...] The <b>British</b> <b>Blue</b> Ensign and Red Ensign (for use respectively by government vessels and by those privately owned) were to have a white cross added. At the fly end of each flag a Southern Cross was to be formed of white stars added {{above and below the}} horizontal arm of the cross. Two weeks later, on 23 November, those flags were officially abandoned because Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London made it clear that only a single badge could be placed at the fly end of the ensign, as set out by rule of the British Admiralty.|$|E

2500|$|Green Grass/Violet Club was {{the first}} UK-deployed weapon to {{dispense}} with the crude polonium and beryllium impact or crush type initiators used in Fat Man and other early US weapons together with the <b>British</b> <b>Blue</b> Danube and Red Beard. Instead it used an electronic neutron initiator (ENI) known as Blue Stone. This had the great advantage of being adjustable, allowing the neutron burst to be triggered at precisely the right moment. The burst heights of Green Grass were optimized for either maximum overpressure without allowing fireball contact with the ground, or to maximise the ground area subjected to a 6 psi overpressure; respectively [...] and [...] above ground level A barometric fuze was used, backed-up by an adjustable clockwork timer fuze with impact fuses as a final fail-safe. Most of these mechanisms originated from Blue Danube although the radar altimeter fuze was omitted. The electrical power for these fuzing mechanisms and the firing mechanisms of the 72-lens, [...] implosion device came from lead-acid accumulators located in {{the tail of the}} Blue Danube casing. These were commercially sourced six-volt motorcycle batteries.|$|E
2500|$|For their part, the British {{wanted the}} McMahon Act's {{restrictions}} on nuclear cooperation to be relaxed. They {{wanted to know}} the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British V-bombers, and American warheads to be fitted to <b>British</b> <b>Blue</b> Streak missiles. This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium. While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide. The United States Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, was concerned that a Special Relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies. Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire. Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were [...] "interdependent", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.|$|E

60|$|The {{evidence}} {{presented in the}} <b>British</b> <b>Blue</b> Book on the Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire[9] shows that this explanation is correct. The Armenians were not massacred spontaneously by the local Moslems; the initiative came entirely from the Central Government at Constantinople, which planned the systematic extermination of the Armenian race in the Ottoman Empire, worked out a uniform method of procedure, despatched simultaneous orders to the provincial officials and gendarmerie to carry it into effect, and cashiered the few who declined to obey. The Armenians were rounded up and deported by regular troops and gendarmes; they were massacred on the road by bands of chettis, consisting chiefly of criminals released from prison by the Government for this work; when the Armenians were gone the Turkish populace was encouraged to plunder their goods and houses, and as the convoys of exiles passed through the villages the best-looking {{women and children were}} sold cheap or even given away for nothing to the Turkish peasantry. Naturally the Turkish people accepted the good things the Government offered them, and naturally this reconciled them momentarily to the War.|$|E
