50|$|As {{the shoes}} in drum brakes wear, brakes {{required}} regular manual adjustment until {{the introduction of}} self-adjusting drum brakes in the 1950s. Drums are prone to <b>brake</b> <b>fading</b> with repeated use.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle <b>braking</b> system <b>fade,</b> or <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> is the {{reduction}} in stopping power that can occur after repeated or sustained application of the brakes, especially in high load or high speed conditions. <b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> can {{be a factor in}} any vehicle that utilizes a friction braking system including automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, airplanes, and bicycles.|$|R
50|$|Carbon-ceramic {{brake disks}} for {{vehicles}} {{are resistant to}} <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> at high temperatures.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> occurs {{most often}} during high {{performance}} driving or when going down a long, steep hill. It is {{more prevalent in}} drum brakes due to their configuration. Disc brakes are much more resistant to <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> because the heat can be vented away from the rotor and pads more easily, and {{have come to be}} a standard feature in front brakes for most vehicles.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> {{is caused}} by a buildup of heat in the braking {{surfaces}} and the subsequent changes and reactions in the brake system components and can be experienced with both drum brakes and disc brakes. Loss of stopping power, or fade, can be caused by friction fade, mechanical fade, or fluid <b>fade.</b> <b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> can be significantly reduced by appropriate equipment and materials design and selection, as well as good cooling.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} water on <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> (all <b>brakes</b> are {{designed}} to withstand at least temporary exposure to water) ...|$|R
50|$|The Apache is {{the first}} bike in India with a petal disc brake, which offers better heat {{dispersion}} thereby allowing fewer <b>brake</b> <b>fades.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> {{failures}} can cascade. For example, {{a typical}} 5-axle truck/trailer combination has 10 brakes. If one <b>brake</b> <b>fades,</b> <b>brake</b> load {{is transferred to}} the remaining 9 brakes, causing them to work harder, get hotter, and thus fade more. Where fade is non-uniform, fade may cause a vehicle to swerve. Because of this, heavy vehicles often use disproportionately weak brakes on steered wheels, which hurts the stopping distance and causes brakes on non-steered wheels to work harder, worsening fade. An advantage of low-fade brakes such as disc brakes is steered wheels can do more braking without causing brake steer.|$|R
5000|$|The other {{consequence}} of overheating is <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b> This {{is due to}} one of several processes or more usually an accumulation of all of them.|$|R
25|$|Amongst {{the options}} {{available}} for the B8 RS4, are ceramic brakes, allowing the car to perform heavy braking without having <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b> A total of ca. 7000 units of the Audi B8 RS4 were built.|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> is {{not always}} due to overheating. Water between the {{friction}} surfaces and the drum {{can act as a}} lubricant and reduce braking efficiency. The water tends to stay until heated sufficiently to vaporize, at which point braking efficiency returns. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. Once that rate is reached, applying greater pedal pressure doesn't change it—in fact, the effects mentioned can substantially reduce it. Ultimately, this is what <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> is, regardless of the mechanisms of its causes. Disc brakes are not immune to any of these processes, but they deal with heat and water more effectively than drums.|$|R
5000|$|Fade - As a brake heats, it {{may become}} less effective, called <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b> Some designs are {{inherently}} prone to fade, while other designs are relatively immune. Further, use considerations, such as cooling, often have a big effect on fade.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanical}} disadvantages {{are largely}} those of added complexity. Undriven wheels require a brake shaft. Mounted inboard, {{it is more}} difficult to arrange for cooling air to flow over the rotor and air ducting can be required to prevent <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compared to drum brakes, {{disc brakes}} offer better {{stopping}} performance because the disc is more readily cooled. As a consequence discs are {{less prone to}} the <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> caused when <b>brake</b> components overheat. Disc brakes also recover more quickly from immersion (wet brakes are less effective than dry ones).|$|R
50|$|Since {{the lining}} is {{the portion of}} the braking system which {{converts}} the vehicle's kinetic energy into heat, the lining must be capable of surviving high temperatures without excessive wear (leading to frequent replacement) or outgassing (which causes <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> a decrease in the stopping power of the brake).|$|R
5000|$|Newer drum {{technologies}} and turbine cooling devices inside of these drums has also eliminated any edge disc brakes {{may have had}} in heavy duty applications. By installing brake turbines inside of a specially configured drum, temperatures are many times cut in half and <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> is nearly eliminated.|$|R
2500|$|Compared to drum brakes, {{disc brakes}} offer better {{stopping}} performance because the disc is more readily cooled. As a consequence discs are {{less prone to}} the <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> caused when <b>brake</b> components overheat. [...] Disc brakes also recover more quickly from immersion (wet brakes are less effective than dry ones).|$|R
50|$|Semi trucks use air pressure, {{rather than}} {{hydraulic}} fluid, to actuate the brake. The use of air hoses allows {{for ease of}} coupling and uncoupling of trailers from the tractor unit. The most common failure is <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> usually caused when the drums or discs and the linings of the brakes overheat from excessive use.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Truck air <b>brakes</b> can <b>fade</b> due to {{expansion}} if improperly adjusted ...|$|R
5000|$|Excessive {{brake drum}} heating {{can cause the}} brake fluid to vaporize, which reduces the {{hydraulic}} pressure applied to the brake shoes. Therefore, the brakes provide less deceleration for a given amount {{of pressure on the}} pedal. The effect is worsened by poor maintenance. Brake fluid that is old and has absorbed moisture has a lower boiling point, so <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> occurs sooner.|$|R
2500|$|Disc brakes are {{increasingly}} used on {{very large and}} heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One {{reason is that the}} disc's lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknife on articulated vehicles. Another is disc <b>brakes</b> <b>fade</b> less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% the distance of a passenger car, but with drums stopping takes about 150% the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.|$|R
50|$|The Audi B8 RS4 {{is using}} the Volkswagen MLB platform. It is also only {{available}} with the Dual Clutch S-tronic gearbox configuration, allowing the car to achieve 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds.Amongst the options available for the B8 RS4, are ceramic brakes, allowing the car to perform heavy braking without having <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b> A total of ca. 7000 units of the Audi B8 RS4 were built.|$|R
25|$|If {{the front}} brake is mounted behind the fork a {{so-called}} self-assisting effect occurs. The friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment which presses the shoe even stronger {{on the rim}} thus leading to an amplified brake force. Self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake. A disadvantage might be <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> - a non-linear relation between actuation force and brake force.|$|R
50|$|Étancelin's 1935 {{season was}} no better, {{with only a}} third at Tunis. He gave Rudolf Caracciola's Mercedes a tough fight at Monaco in the little 3.7 litre Maserati, but {{suffered}} <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> and came fourth. Driving a Maserati for the Subalpina team, {{he also had a}} spectacular accident at the Swiss Grand Prix in Bern, with his car upturned and in flames, but he did not suffer injuries.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fade</b> {{typically}} {{occurs during}} heavy or sustained braking. Many high-speed vehicles use disc brakes, and many European heavy vehicles use disc brakes. Many U.S. and third-world heavy vehicles use drum brakes {{due to their}} lower purchase price. On heavy vehicles, air drag is often small compared to the weight, so the brakes dissipate proportionally more energy than on a typical car or motorcycle. Thus, heavy vehicles often need to use engine compression braking, and slow down so braking energy is dissipated over a longer interval. Recent studies have been performed in the United States to test the stopping distances of both drum brakes and disc brakes using a North American Standard called FMVSS-121. The results showed that when newer compounding of friction materials typically used in disc brakes is applied to drum brakes that {{there is virtually no}} difference in stopping distance or <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b> As the United States changed its FMVSS-121 rules for Class Eight trucks built in 2012 to reduce stopping distances by about 1/3rd there was no recommendation to use either drum or disc brakes in the current law.|$|R
50|$|When Car and Driver took a 2013 Genesis Coupe 3.8 R-Spec to Virginia International Raceway for its yearly Lightning Lap time trial, they {{posted a}} time of 3:13.9 around VIR's Grand West configuration, 0.1 second slower than the 306-hp 2011 Genesis Coupe 3.8 R-Spec and slower than the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Ford Mustang V6, Chevrolet Cobalt SS and Nissan NISMO 370Z. They were {{unsettled}} by its tendency to power oversteer, and its <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Heat {{build-up}} {{can lead}} to failure with disc brakes. Disc brakes heat discs {{in the same way}} as rim brakes heat rims, but discs provide an inherently smaller surface to dissipate heat. Excessive heat leads to boiling hydraulic fluid, resulting in <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> or total failure. Overheating is more common in road cycling assuming the brakes are undersized to reduce weight. Recorded cases of disc brake failures [...] usually involves several kilometers of downhill, combined with small underweight discs.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to most manual gearboxes, most automatic transmissions have far less effective engine braking. This {{means that the}} engine does not slow the car as effectively when the automatic transmission driver releases the engine speed control. This leads to more usage of the brakes in cars with automatic transmissions, bringing shorter brake life. Brakes {{are also more likely}} to overheat in hilly or mountainous areas, causing reduced <b>braking</b> ability, <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> and the potential for complete failure with the automatic transmission vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Suspension {{changes for}} the AS series {{included}} uprated rear springs and reduction in rear anti-roll bar diameter. Improvements were also made to the TX5 Ghia's adjustable suspension. In terms of braking, Ghias were now fitted with four-wheel disc brakes; Telstar GL and TX5 retained front discs and rear drums. Ventilated front disc brakes and semi-metallic pads were now fitted across the range to provide, {{in conjunction with the}} brake cooling ducts in the front valance, increased brake cooling capacity and reduced <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> and squeal.|$|R
25|$|The Veyron's brakes use cross drilled, {{radially}} vented {{carbon fibre}} reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) composite discs, manufactured by SGL Carbon, {{which have a}} much greater resistance to <b>brake</b> <b>fade</b> when compared with conventional cast iron discs. The lightweight aluminium alloy monobloc brake calipers are made by AP Racing; the fronts have eight titanium pistons and the rear calipers have six pistons. Bugatti claims maximum deceleration of 1.3g on road tyres. As an added safety feature, {{in the event of}} brake failure, an anti-lock braking system (ABS) has also been installed on the handbrake.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transmission}} is the 6-speed, paddle operated, sequential manual {{found in the}} F430. The transmission uses Formula One technology and can shift gears in 150 ms. The brakes use carbon ceramic material, which is very resistant to <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b> Both front and rear suspension use double wishbones and anti-roll bars. The exhaust system is updated for the Challenge car, placing the outlet ports higher {{in the back of}} the car. The back also includes a new grille to help with drawing heat out of the engine.

2500|$|A lighter, {{and higher}} performing, [...] "Audi ceramic" [...] front brake system was an option from 2007 model year onwards (and only with 19inch wheels). It {{comprised}} cross-drilled, radially vented and floating Carbon fibre-reinforced Silicon Carbide (C/SiC) composite SGL Carbon discs, [...] diameter and [...] thick, with grey Brembo monoblock six-opposed-piston fixed aluminium alloy calipers. [...] The discs {{have a much}} greater tolerance to thermal differences, virtually eliminating <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> and have a duration of five times greater than conventional iron discs. The ceramic brakes also reduce unsprung mass by around 50% and thereby improve steering response and overall handling.|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} forces generated during braking between brake pads and discs produce high thermal gradients on the rubbing surfaces. These thermal gradients may cause braking {{problems such as}} <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> premature wear or hot spotting and the associated hot judder phenomenon in the frequency range below 100 Hz. Further consequences are comfort reductions, a defective braking process, inhomogeneous wear, cutbacks of the brake performance and even damage of brake components. The present paper proposes a modeling concept that is targeted on this field of application and introduces the new Modelica class ThermoelasticPlate, which is implemented in the DLR FlexibleBodies library...|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristics}} {{that make the}} Bandini F3 historically important are the unprecedented postponement of box differential and testing of disc brakes on all four wheels. Disc brakes had only recently appeared on racing cars {{with the advent of}} the 1951 C-type, which used them to great advantage at Le Mans. The advantages of disc brakes were mainly limited solely to lower unsprung masses as the study of materials of seals of friction had not yet allow evolution that today poses this choice as a solution required the cars allocated to the races. They also helped avoid <b>brake</b> <b>fade.</b>|$|R
50|$|Performance: Performance is a {{measurable}} and testable {{value of a}} vehicle's ability to perform in various conditions. Performance can be considered {{in a wide variety}} of tasks, but it's generally associated with how quickly a car can accelerate (e.g. standing start 1/4 mile elapsed time, 0-60 mph, etc.), its top speed, how short and quickly a car can come to a complete stop from a set speed (e.g. 70-0 mph), how much g-force a car can generate without losing grip, recorded lap times, cornering speed, <b>brake</b> <b>fade,</b> etc. Performance can also reflect the amount of control in inclement weather (snow, ice, rain).|$|R
