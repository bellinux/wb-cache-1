5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist. His satirical works, {{inspired}} by {{the philosophy of the}} Age of Enlightenment, were critical of the lack of education of the Audiencia of Quito, the way the economy was being handled in the Audiencia, the corruption of its authorities, and aspects of its culture in general. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|In 1900 {{a massive}} {{hurricane}} struck Galveston, destroying {{much of the}} city. That and another storm in 1915 shifted much of the focus from investors away from Galveston and toward nearby Houston, which {{was seen as a}} safer location for commercial operations. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> events, the coming oil boom became heavily centered on the city of Houston both as a port and a commercial center.|$|E

5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in high-temperature applications. This material is refractory, hard, and resistant to chemical attack. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> properties, zircon finds many applications, few {{of which are}} highly publicized. Its main use is as an opacifier, conferring a white, opaque appearance to ceramic materials. Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for molten metals.|$|E

5|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} has little economic value, though its attractive skin is occasionally used for leather. In Australian waters, {{it is not}} fished and faces minimal threats. However, elsewhere in its range it may be negatively affected by extensive fishery activity and habitat degradation from pollution, blast fishing, and coral removal. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> concerns, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|A large {{volcanic}} eruption from any volcanoes in the Mount Cayley field would have major {{effects on the}} Sea-to-Sky Highway and municipalities such as Squamish, Whistler, Pemberton and probably Vancouver. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> concerns, the Geological Survey of Canada is planning to create hazard maps and emergency plans for Mount Cayley, as well as Mount Meager north of the volcanic field, which experienced a major {{volcanic eruption}} 2,350years ago similar to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E
5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|Appeals to nonviolent {{resistance}} were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, {{a recently}} appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> and other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their {{actions on the}} protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued {{that there was a}} difference between taxation without representation in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{and other}} successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and the needed inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in field conditions, and aside from limited successes, {{such as at}} the Battle of Seven Pines, {{the utility of the}} Balloon Corps was limited. In addition, jurisdictional squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had grown tired of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning to civilian research. The Balloon Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> disappointments, No. 6 Commando's {{first major}} {{action as a}} formed unit came in November 1942 when, along with No. 1 Commando, it formed part of the {{spearhead}} for the Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Iain McAlpine, the commando embarked upon HMT Awatea in October 1942 in Glasgow along with some United States Army Rangers that were also {{taking part in the}} operation. Tensions were high between the British and the Vichy French at this time because of a number of clashes and as a result the decision was made for the commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort to placate the defenders.|$|E

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers nevertheless completed its engineering study of the project in 1971, and the final report was {{released to the public}} in 1979. In 1980, U.S. President Jimmy Carter created the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Sanctuary, which formally protected the area from development and disallowed any similar project.|$|E
5|$|Delacroix, who was of French origin, met {{the king}} in Paris {{as a young}} girl, {{when she was only}} 16 and he was 65. At that time, she earned her living as a prostitute. They soon {{embarked}} upon a relationship that was to last until his death in 1909. Leopold lavished upon her large sums of money, estates, gifts, and a noble title, Baroness Vaughan. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> presents, Caroline was deeply unpopular both among the Belgian people and internationally, as Leopold became increasingly criticized for his greed-induced actions in the Congo Free State, his own personal colony. As Caroline largely profited off the income from the colony, she became known as La reine du Congo (“the Queen of Congo”).|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles {{to life on}} Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding {{the early history of}} the terrestrial biosphere. Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and {{the large}} {{adjustment}} as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). Note that the unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.|$|E

On September 21, a fire of uncertain origin destroyed a quarter of New York City. In {{the immediate aftermath of}} the fire Nathan Hale was executed for spying. Although American troops delivered an unexpected check to the British at Harlem Heights in mid-September, Howe defeated Washington in battle again at White Plains and then again at Fort Washington. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> defeats, Washington and the army retreated across New Jersey and into Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Paterson and Cauty held several {{recording}} {{sessions at}} Cauty's studio, Trancentral. When offered an album deal by Big Life, the Orb found themselves at a crossroads: Cauty preferred that the Orb release their music through his KLF Communications label, whereas Paterson wanted {{to ensure that}} the group did not become a side-project of the KLF. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name the Orb. As a result of the break-up, Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the in-progress recordings and released the album as Space on KLF Communications. Also out of these sessions came the KLF album Chill Out, on which Paterson appeared in an uncredited role.|$|E
