5000|$|<b>Offset</b> <b>binary</b> {{is often}} used in digital signal {{processing}} (DSP). Most analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) chips are unipolar, {{which means that they}} cannot handle bipolar signals (signals with both positive and negative values). A simple solution to this is to bias the analog signals with a DC offset equal to half of the A/D and D/A converters range.

50|$|Most {{standard}} computer CPU chips cannot {{handle the}} <b>offset</b> <b>binary</b> format directly. CPU chips typically can only handle signed and unsigned integers, and floating point value formats. <b>Offset</b> <b>binary</b> values {{can be handled}} in several ways by these CPU chips. The data may just be treated as unsigned integers, requiring the programmer {{to deal with the}} zero offset in software. The data may also be converted to signed integer format (which the CPU can handle natively) by simply subtracting the zero offset. As a consequence of the most common offset for an n-bit word being 2^(n-1), which implies that the first bit is inverted relative to twos complement, {{there is no need for}} a separate subtraction step, but one simply can invert the first bit. This sometimes is a useful simplification in hardware, and can be convenient in software as well.|$|R

Three of them preserve the DSSS approach: in the 868/915 MHz bands, using either <b>binary</b> or <b>offset</b> quadrature phase shift keying (the second of which is optional); in the 2450 MHz band, using the latter. An alternative, optional 868/915 MHz layer is defined using a combination of binary keying and amplitude shift keying (thus based on parallel, not sequential spread spectrum, PSSS).

5000|$|<b>Offset</b> <b>binary,</b> also {{referred}} to as excess-K, excess-N, excess code or biased representation, is a digital coding scheme where all-zero corresponds to the minimal negative value and all-one to the maximal positive value. There is no standard for <b>offset</b> <b>binary,</b> but most often the offset K for an n-bit binary word is K = 2n−1. This has the consequence that the [...] "zero" [...] value is represented by a 1 in the most significant bit and zero in all other bits, and in general the effect is conveniently the same as using twos complement except that the most significant bit is inverted. It also has the consequence that in a logical comparison operation, one gets the same result as with a twos complement numerical comparison operation, whereas, in twos complement notation a logical comparison will agree with twos complement numerical comparison operation if and only if the numbers being compared have the same sign. Otherwise the sense of the comparison will be inverted, with all negative values being taken as being larger than all positive values.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>Offset</b> Carrier {{modulation}} (BOC modulation) {{was developed}} by John Betz, PhD, {{in order to allow}} interoperability of satellite navigation systems. It is currently used in the US GPS system, Indian IRNSS system and in Galileo and is a square sub-carrier modulation, where a signal is multiplied by a rectangular sub-carrier of frequency [...] equal or higher to the chip rate. Following this sub-carrier multiplication, the spectrum of the signal is divided into two parts, therefore BOC modulation is also known as a split-spectrum modulation.|$|E
50|$|L1C {{consists}} of a pilot (called L1CP) and a data (called L1CD) component. These components use carriers with the same phase (within {{a margin of error}} of 100 milliradians), instead of carriers in quadrature as with L5. The PRN codes are 10,230 bits long and transmitted at 1.023 Mbit/s. The pilot component is also modulated by an overlay code called L1CO (a secondary code that has a lower rate than the ranging code and is also predefined, like the ranging code). Of the total L1C signal power, 25% is allocated to the data and 75% to the pilot. The modulation technique used is BOC(1,1) for the data signal and TMBOC for the pilot. The time multiplexed <b>binary</b> <b>offset</b> carrier (TMBOC) is BOC(1,1) for all except 4 of 33 cycles, when it switches to BOC(6,1).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Offset</b> <b>binary,</b> {{also called}} excess-K or biased representation, uses a pre-specified number K as a biasing value. A value is {{represented}} by the unsigned number which is K greater than the intended value. Thus 0 {{is represented by}} K, and &minus;K {{is represented by the}} all-zeros bit pattern. This {{can be seen as a}} slight modification and generalization of the aforementioned two's-complement, which is virtually the [...] representation with negated most significant bit.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{well-known}} ways to represent signed numbers in a binary computing system. The most common is two's complement, which allows a signed integral type with n bits to represent numbers from −2(n−1) through 2(n−1)−1. Two's complement arithmetic is convenient {{because there is}} a perfect one-to-one correspondence between representations and values (in particular, no separate +0 and −0), and because addition, subtraction and multiplication do not need to distinguish between signed and unsigned types. Other possibilities include <b>offset</b> <b>binary,</b> sign-magnitude, and ones' complement.|$|R
