40|$|Abstract. The {{authors have}} {{established}} that oribatid mites (Acariformes, Oribatei) are transmitted by birds. More than 2, 100 birds of 150 species from different ecological groups were surveyed. 180 species of live oribatid mites {{were collected from}} <b>bird</b> <b>feathers.</b> Some oribatid mite species live in <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> constantly. The authors assume that oribatid mites feed not on the particles of the skin, but on fungi inhabiting <b>bird</b> <b>feathers,</b> as all oribatid mites are mycophagous. Oribatid mites were found in different forms of their lifecycle. It has been established that they reproduce in <b>bird</b> <b>feathers.</b> Transmis-sion of these microarthropods by birds may be a principle cause of their distribution, especially in the remote Arctic areas, on the Oceanic islands, and in the oases of deserts.

50|$|Specimen IGM 100/977 of Shuvuuia {{was found}} {{surrounded}} by small, hollow, tube-like structures resembling the rachis (central vane) of modern <b>bird</b> <b>feathers.</b> Though highly deteriorated and poorly preserved, biochemical analyses later showed that these structures contain decay {{products of the}} protein beta-keratin, and more significantly, the absence of alpha-keratin. While beta-keratin is found in all integumentary (skin and feather) cells of reptiles and <b>birds,</b> only <b>bird</b> <b>feathers</b> completely lack alpha-keratin.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{describes}} the aerodynamic characteristic for aircraft wing model {{with and without}} <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> like winglet. The aerofoil used to construct the whole structure is NACA 65 3 - 218 Rectangular wing and this aerofoil {{has been used to}} compare the result with previous research using winglet. The model of the rectangular wing with <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> like winglet has been fabricated using polystyrene before design using CATIA P 3 V 5 R 13 software and finally fabricated in wood. The experimental analysis for the aerodynamic characteristic for rectangular wing without winglet, wing with horizontal winglet and wing with 60 degree inclination winglet for Reynolds number 1. 66 × 10 5, 2. 08 × 10 5 and 2. 50 × 10 5 have been carried out in open loop low speed wind tunnel at the Aerodynamics laboratory in Universiti Putra Malaysia. The experimental result shows 25 - 30 % reduction in drag coefficient and 10 - 20 % increase in lift coefficient by using <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> like winglet for angle of attack of 8 degree.

40|$|To reduce {{friction}} drag with bionic method {{in a more}} feasible way, the surface microstructure of <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> was analyzed attempting to reveal the biologic features responding to skin {{friction drag}} reduction. Then comparative bionic surface mimicking <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> was fabricated through hot-rolling technology for drag reduction. The microriblet film was formed on a PVC substrate through a self-developed hot-rolling equipment. The bionic surface with micron-scale riblets formed spontaneously due to the elastic-plastic deformation of PVC in high temperature and high pressure environment. Comparative experiments between micro-structured bionic surface and smooth surface were performed in a wind tunnel to evaluate the effect of bionic surface on drag reduction, and significant drag reduction efficiency was obtained. Numerical simulation results show that microvortex induced in the solid-gas interface of bionic surface {{has the effect of}} shear stress reduction and the small level of an additional pressure drag resulting from pressure distribution deviation on <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> like surface, hence reducing the skin friction drag significantly. Therefore, with remarkable drag reduction performance and simple fabrication technology, the proposed drag reduction technique shows the promise for practical applications...|$|R
