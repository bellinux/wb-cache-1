5000|$|Because the {{advancing}} blade has higher airspeed than the retreating blade and generates a dissymmetry of lift, rotor blades {{are designed to}} [...] "flap" [...] - lift and twist {{in such a way}} that {{the advancing}} blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack. Conversely, the retreating blade flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, and generates more lift. At high speeds, the force on the rotors is such that they [...] "flap" [...] excessively, and the retreating blade can reach too high an angle and stall. For this reason, the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called VNE, velocity, never exceed. In addition, it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of the retreating <b>blade</b> <b>stalls,</b> which results in high vibration, pitch-up, and roll into the retreating blade.|$|R

Through the comparison of flow transition characteristics at different flow rate conditions, the interface between the incoming flow and tip clearance flow shifts forward to the upstream as the mass flow decreases.

40|$|Three ways {{in which}} {{secondary}} flow can be generated in a straight compressor cascade have been investigated. 1. Wakeflow. The inlet flow {{is characterized by a}} constant inlet angle and a varying stagnation pressure over the span. 2. Skewed flow. The inlet flow is characterized by a constant stagnation pressure and a varying inlet angle over the span. 3. Skewed wakeflow. The inlet flow is characterized by a variation of both stagnation pressure and inlet angle over the span. For a certain combination of inlet angle and stagnation pressure distribution (presented in a formula) in the skewed wakeflow case no secondary flow is generated behind the cascade. The kinetic energy of the secondary flow was found to be very small in all three cases. The secondary flow itself did not create any losses but the <b>blades</b> <b>stalled</b> in the skewed flow layer and in the skewed wakeflow layer causing great losses. The stream pressure and the tangential blade force were lower in the disturbed flow region. A small perturbation theory (for a non-viscous, incompressible fluid) had been developed to describe analytically the secondary flow. Formulae readily adaptable for numerical calculations of flow deviation angles, kinetic energy of the secondary flow, and tangential blade force are presented. Good and satisfactory correlation of theory and experiment was found. Applied to compressor design the results imply: The secondary flow is very small and may occur as an overturning or an underturning of the flow at the casings depending on the actual design. The kinetic energy of the secondary flow may be neglected when considering the losses. The ends of the <b>blades</b> <b>stall</b> in the skewed boundary layer at the casings causing losses. This could be reduced by twisting the blade ends to account for the increased incidence angle. The stream pressure varies in spanwise direction through the boundary layer on the casings.

50|$|When {{dissymmetry}} {{causes the}} retreating blade to experience less airflow than {{required to maintain}} lift, a condition called retreating <b>blade</b> <b>stall</b> can occur.

50|$|Furling {{works by}} {{decreasing}} {{the angle of}} attack, which reduces the induced drag from the lift of the rotor, {{as well as the}} cross-section.

50|$|A fixed-speed HAWT (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine) {{inherently}} increases its {{angle of}} attack at higher wind speed as the blades speed up.

5000|$|Rotating stall {{is a local}} {{disruption}} of airflow within the compressor which continues to provide compressed air but with reduced effectiveness. Rotating stall arises when {{a small proportion of}} airfoils experience airfoil stall disrupting the local airflow without destabilising the compressor. The stalled airfoils create pockets of relatively stagnant air (referred to as stall cells) which, rather than moving in the flow direction, rotate around the circumference of the compressor. The stall cells rotate with the rotor blades but at 50 to 70% of their speed, affecting subsequent airfoils around the rotor as each encounters the stall cell. Propagation of the instability around the flow path annulus is driven by stall cell blockage causing an incidence spike on the adjacent blade. The adjacent <b>blade</b> <b>stalls</b> {{as a result of the}} incidence spike, thus causing stall cell [...] "rotation" [...] around the rotor. Stable local stalls can also occur which are axi-symmetric, covering the complete circumference of the compressor disc but only a portion of its radial plane, with the remainder of the face of the compressor continuing to pass normal flow.|$|R
50|$|Normally a {{helicopter}} or gyrocopter cannot fly {{forward at the}} same speed as or faster than its rotor tip speed.

50|$|Thus, in summary; If {{main rotor}} rpm is too low, {{the speed at}} which the {{retreating}} <b>blade</b> sections <b>stall</b> will be the maximum speed limit. If the main rotor rpm is too high, {{the speed at which}} the advancing blades encounter supersonic airflow would be the maximum speed limit. Even to the casual observer it should be clear that the designer should aim for a balance between these two limits. It should also be mentioned that in addition to these two addressed issues, there are a host of others which also contribute to maximum airspeed limits.|$|R
5000|$|In forward flight, {{there is}} no upward flow (upflow) of air in the hub area. As forward {{airspeed}} decreases and vertical descent rates increase, an upflow begins {{because there are no}} airfoil surfaces in the mast and blade grip area. As volume of upflow increases, the induced flow (air pulled or [...] "induced" [...] down through the rotor system) of the inner blade sections is overcome and the <b>blades</b> begin to <b>stall</b> near the hub. As the inner <b>blade</b> sections <b>stall,</b> a second set of vortices, similar to the rotor tip vortices, form {{in the center of the}} rotor system. The inner set of vortices decreases the amount of lift being produced and causes an increase in sink rate. In an accelerated condition, the inner and outer vortices begin to feed each other to the point where any increase in rotor blade pitch angle increases the interaction between the vortices and increases the rate of descent. In this state, the helicopter is operating in its own downwash, descending through descending air. The failure of a helicopter pilot to recognize and react to the condition can lead to high descent rates and impact with terrain.|$|R
