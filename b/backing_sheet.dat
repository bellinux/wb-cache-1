40|$|This {{paper is}} dealing with {{measuring}} the water ingress to PV-modules under different climatic conditions and simulating it over an expected lifetime of 20 years. Furthermore different kinds of <b>back</b> <b>sheet</b> / encapsulant combinations were considered. For this purpose an own developed high sensitive test device composed of a climate cabinet and a mass spectrometer was used to investigate the temperature dependent permeation and diffusion processes {{that takes place in}} the polymers. Furthermore the results - permeation and diffusion coefficient - were used to simulate the mass transport through the <b>back</b> <b>sheet</b> and inside the encapsulant materials. In a second part the amount of absorbed water was analysed by a gravimetric method. For this study encapsulant materials were exposed to different ambient climates to quantify the sorption isotherme. With these results - permeation / diffusion coefficient and absorbed water amount - the mass transport and water concentration were simulated over the lifetime of a PV-module under different climatic conditions. Additional the influence of various tight <b>back</b> <b>sheets</b> on water ingress will be shown...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBeing {{interested}} in bifacial and not fully covered rear contact (e. g. back contact) silicon solar cells and their rear side importance, we have studied how the sample holders add an external current mainly {{due to the}} reflectance properties of their surface and {{we have found that}} this influence can be higher than one percent in JSC. In a second approach, an innovative measurement setup configuration is presented, which includes a simultaneous front-rear illumination. For this configuration we have measured two types of bifacial solar cells which can be distinguished by their ratio of front to rear performance and we have found differences in power output of about thirty percent if the rear illumination is applied or not. Modules with different <b>back</b> <b>sheets</b> were further manufactured using these types of bifacial solar cells. Outdoor measurements for modules with transparent <b>back</b> <b>sheets</b> demonstrated an average gain in power output of up to twenty percent if the module was placed on a highly reflecting surface and scattered light penetrated the module from the rear side. A set of mini modules was also tested indoors to show how the <b>back</b> <b>sheet</b> influences the reflection as well as the spectral resolved response of the devices...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the typical}} [...] "direct print" [...] method, the plate is inked, the thin paper (dampened) {{is placed on}} the inked plate and trimmed to size, paste is applied to the thin paper, and the {{ensemble}} (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened <b>backing</b> <b>sheet.</b> This is then run through a printing press. In the pressure of the press, the ink is transferred to the thin paper, and the thinner paper is simultaneously adhered to the backing paper. An advantage of this method is that the thin paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is trimmed to size and then quickly affixed in place.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, many commercially sold, hand-coloured {{photographs}} were packaged and framed for retail sale.

A <b>backing</b> <b>sheet</b> was often {{glued to the}} back of the mat-board. Unfortunately, the paper products produced and used during the late-19th and early-20th centuries are highly acidic and will cause yellowing, brittling and degradation of hand-coloured photographs. Metallic inclusions in the paper can also oxidize which may be the cause of foxing in paper materials. Wood panel slats will also off-gas causing further degradation of the photographs.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of different types}} of new encapsulation and <b>back</b> <b>sheet</b> materials for PV modules was investigated. Therefore, various types of laminates were made in order to examine the environmental impact on such materials during the materials aging process with special attention to the permeability of the <b>back</b> <b>sheet.</b> The laminates were characterized by Raman Spectroscopy, FT-IR/VIS reflectance measurements before and after different accelerated aging procedures. The water vapor and oxygen permeation properties were measured. A clear correlation between the permeation properties and the observed aging behavior was found. The degradation, especially of the encapsulant, resulted in increasing background fluorescence in the Raman Spectra and in a change of transmittance of the encapsulants which is also known as yellowing. It could be shown that the encapsulation/cell/back-sheet system should be optimized in order to minimize the stress on the PV-module components. Copyrigh...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the typical}} [...] "pre-pasted" [...] method, the thin paper (dry) is trimmed {{to the size}} of the plate, then paste is applied and allowed to dry. When the {{printmaker}} is ready to print, the paper is dampened to activate the paste and placed, paste-side up, on an inked plate. Then the ensemble (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened <b>backing</b> <b>sheet</b> and run through a press as described above. An advantage of the pre-pasted method is that once dried, the paste-applied papers can be stored indefinitely, just like a lick-and-stick postage stamp. A disadvantage of this method is that because the paper is trimmed dry, the artist must take into account how much in each direction the paper will expand when it is dampened prior to printing.|$|E

The <b>back</b> <b>sheet</b> can be dimpled to minimize undesired thermal contact with the underlying spacecraft component and can be metallized on the surface facing the component to optimize its absorptance and emittance.

40|$|Most {{photovoltaic}} (PV) -modules have {{polymeric materials}} as encapsulants and <b>back</b> <b>sheets.</b> Usually these materials are not water vapour-tight and air-tight, but allow permeation of gases from the ambient atmosphere, especially oxygen and water vapour, which {{could contribute to}} degradation of the PV-modules. This work gives a short overview on how the permeation process through polymers takes place {{and how it is}} influenced by the material properties and ambient conditions. Results of permeation and diffusion measurements for water vapour as well as oxygen are shown for various encapsulation and <b>back</b> <b>sheet</b> materials with special focus on temperature dependence. The results demonstrate differences in permeability and temperature dependence for the investigated materials, but also show similarities for material groups. All investigated materials feature a Fickian behaviour within the measurement conditions even when crossing glass temperature or melting temperature.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the water uptake by PV-modules during {{weathering}} {{tests of the}} type approval standard IEC 61215 was simulated and compared with the water ingress under ambient outdoor conditions. For this purpose, the base materials, one encapsulant (EVA) and one <b>back</b> <b>sheet</b> (TPT), were analyzed regarding their water vapor permeability. The micro climate a PV-module sees at its surface was monitored during accelerated IEC tests and at outdoor test sites located in four different climatic regions. These measured values were used for FEM based simulations of the water ingress into PV-modules. The results show the speed {{and the amount of}} water uptake under IEC-test conditions as damp heat, humidity freeze and thermal cycling tests compared with the water ingress under the different climates. It can be stated that the IEC-damp-heat test provokes almost two times higher water concentrations in the encapsulant between cell and glass than outdoor weathering can adjust over 20 years. The humidity freeze test shows a similar behavior and even the thermal cycling test results in a slightly water uptake in the <b>back</b> <b>sheet...</b>|$|R
