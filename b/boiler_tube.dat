Up to 300,000 tons of mains water per year is {{used in the}} station, however it has to be cleaned of impurities before use. This is done at an on site water treatment plant that uses a process of ion exchange to remove impurities such as silica and control PH levels so as to avoid <b>boiler</b> <b>tube</b> corrosion. This treated water is used to make superheated steam in the coal-fired boilers, that will turn the turbines before being recovered in the condenser and reused.|$|E

40|$|The {{failures}} of superheater and reheater <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> {{operating in a}} power plant utilizing natural gas or mazut as a fuel have been analysed and the fire-side corrosion has been suggested as {{the main reason for}} the failure in <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes.</b> The tubes have been provided by a fossil fuel power plant in Iran and optical and electron microscopy investigations have been performed on the tubes as well as the corrosion products on their surfaces. The results showed that the thickness of the failed tubes is not uniform which suggests that fire-side corrosion has happened on the tubes. Fire-side corrosion is caused by the reaction of combustion products with oxide layers on the tube surface resulting in metal loss and consequently tubes fracture. However, the tubes corrosion behaviour did not follow the conventional models of the fire-side corrosion. Given that, using the corrosion monitoring techniques for these <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> seems essential. As a result, the thickness of the <b>boiler</b> <b>tubes</b> {{in different parts of the}} boiler has been recorded and critical points are selected accordingly.
