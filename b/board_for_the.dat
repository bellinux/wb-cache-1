5|$|In 1887, he {{was signed}} by the Peanut Eaters of the Pennsylvania State Association, and played in 36games before being sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, along with Ed Beatin for $1,000 on July27. Soon, the deal was put on hold by the NL, as the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association(AA) also claimed they had a deal in place for these players. On September6, an {{arbitration}} <b>board</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> NL and AA leagues convened to render their findings. They found that Detroit's contract with the players was dated on July20, which superseded Cincinnati's contract that was signed on July27, and awarded Detroit the players. Detroit then sold their contracts with the players to the London Tecumsehs of the International Association. Though he did not play for London in 1887, he did play in two games for the New York Metropolitans of the AA, going hitless in eight at bats.|$|E
5|$|Oberlin’s {{compensation}} policies required Stone to do {{twice the}} labor a male student {{had to do}} to pay the same costs. Stone frequently rose at two o'clock to fit in work and study, and she found her health declining. In February 1845, having decided to submit to the injustice no longer, she asked the Faculty <b>Board</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same pay given two lesser-experienced male colleagues. When her request was denied, she resigned her position. Pleading with the faculty to restore Stone, her former students said they would pay Stone “what was right” if the college would not. Stone had planned to borrow money from her father when funds ran out, but Francis Stone, moved by his daughter’s description of her struggles, promised to provide money when needed. Help from home was not needed, however, because after three months of pressure, the faculty yielded and hired Stone back, paying both her and other women student teachers at the same rate paid male student teachers.|$|E
