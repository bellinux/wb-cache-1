25|$|The major {{advantage}} of conventional hydroelectric dams with reservoirs is {{their ability to}} store water at low cost for dispatch later as high value clean electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro station larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. When used as peak power to meet demand, hydroelectricity has a higher value than <b>base</b> <b>power</b> and a much higher value compared to intermittent energy sources.|$|E
25|$|Hydropower is a {{flexible}} source of electricity since stations can be ramped {{up and down}} very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. Hydro turbines have a start-up time {{of the order of}} a few minutes. It takes around 60 to 90 seconds to bring a unit from cold start-up to full load; this is much shorter than for gas turbines or steam plants. Power generation can also be decreased quickly when there is a surplus power generation. Hence the limited capacity of hydropower units is not generally used to produce <b>base</b> <b>power</b> except for vacating the flood pool or meeting downstream needs. Instead, it serves as backup for non-hydro generators.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Apple {{released}} the Power Mac G4 Cube, their first desktop since the discontinued Power Macintosh G3, to slot between the iMac G3 and the Power Mac G4. Even with its innovative design, it was initially priced US$200 {{higher than the}} comparably-equipped and more-expandable <b>base</b> <b>Power</b> Mac G4, while also not including a monitor, making it too expensive and resulting in slow sales. Apple sold just 29,000 Cubes in Q4 of 2000 which was one third of expectations, compared to 308,000 Macs during that same quarter, and Cube sales dropped to 12,000 units in Q1 of 2001. A price drop and hardware upgrades could not offset the earlier perception of the Cube's reduced value compared to the iMac and Power Mac G4 lineup, and it was discontinued in July 2001.|$|E

Using the proposed model, IR-drop analysis for 16 nm technology node latest by ITRS is performed. For a temperature range from 150 K to 450 K, the variation of resistance of GNR interconnect is ~ 2 - 5 × times lesser {{than that of}} traditional copper <b>based</b> <b>power</b> interconnects.

2500|$|To {{avoid the}} {{turbulent}} surf zone {{as well as}} to move closer to the cold-water resource, OTEC plants can be mounted to the continental shelf at depths up to [...] A shelf-mounted plant could be towed to the site and affixed to the sea bottom. This type of construction is already used for offshore oil rigs. The complexities of operating an OTEC plant in deeper water may make them more expensive than land-based approaches. Problems include the stress of open-ocean conditions and more difficult product delivery. Addressing strong ocean currents and large waves adds engineering and construction expense. Platforms require extensive pilings to maintain a stable <b>base.</b> <b>Power</b> delivery can require long underwater cables to reach land. For these reasons, shelf-mounted plants are less attractive.|$|E

Taillights lost the traditional [...] "rocket" [...] exhaust theme in favor of horizontal lights and trimmed center section. Rooflines were squared off and had a [...] "formal" [...] air. The XL was dropped, as were concealed headlight covers for the LTD. The convertible {{was moved to the}} LTD series in 1970 (1971 model year) and lasted through 1972. The engine line-up saw some changes for '71. The 351 2v V8 was now standard equipment on all full-sized Fords save for the lower-line Custom & Custom 500 versions where the 240 straight six was still the <b>base</b> <b>power</b> plant with a 302 2v V8 and up still offered as options. The optional 390 2v FE V8 was replaced mid-year by a new 335 series 400 2v V8. The 429 4v was still the top engine, while the police-only versions received a new 370hp 429 'Police Interceptor' as their new top offering. A column-shifted 3-speed manual was still the base transmission on the 240,302 & 351 engines with Select-Shift automatic being optional but mandatory on all of the larger engines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cognitive {{radio network}} (CRN) is a {{promising}} approach to improve spectrum efficiency for wireless networking. This paper investigates {{how to perform}} optimal power control on each node (or per-node <b>based</b> <b>power</b> control) in the network so as to optimize network performance. Per-node <b>based</b> <b>power</b> control is a difficult problem due to its large design space (i. e., interaction among the powers on different nodes in the network) and the coupling relationship between power control and upper layers (scheduling and routing). In this paper, we develop a formal mathematical model for joint power control, scheduling, and routing. We formulate a cross-layer optimization problem encompassing these three layers and develop a unified solution procedure based on branch-and-bound framework and convex hull relaxation. Using numerical results, we demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} solution procedure and offer insights on the behavior of per-node <b>based</b> <b>power</b> control.
