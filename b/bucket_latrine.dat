50|$|A bucket toilet, {{also called}} a honey bucket or <b>bucket</b> <b>latrine,</b> {{is a very}} simple, basic form of a dry toilet which is portable. The bucket (pail) may be {{situated}} inside a dwelling, or in a nearby small structure (an outhouse), or on a camping site or other place that lack waste disposal plumbing. These toilets used to be common in cold climates, where installing running water can be difficult, expensive, and subject to freezing-related pipe breakage.|$|E

The Twin Bucket Emergency Toilet system (a two bucket system), for example, has been developed in Christchurch, New Zealand following their infrastructure destroying earthquake in 2011. The system has been endorsed by the Portland Bureau of Emergency Management. It is promoted by the volunteer advocacy group PHLUSH (Public Hygiene Lets Us Stay Human) for reasons of safety, affordability and matching ecological sanitation principles.|$|R

One important component of sanitation management is Faecal Sludge Management which includes management of entire faecal sludge (FS) systems, on-site sanitation and services, as well as costing, economics, FS collection and haulage, FS treatment and Reuse or disposal of FS. This paper presents and discusses FS management arrangements in residential areas and basic schools at Madina in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Results from the study showed that excreta from only Kumasi Ventilated Improved Pit Latrine (KVIP) and Water Closet (WC) with septic tanks were collected and treated. The excreta from household <b>bucket</b> <b>latrines,</b> pit latrines and Ventilated Improved Pit Latrines (VIPs) were manually collected and discharged untreated into open drains, in the bush or in water bodies. Householders were spending too much on cost of disposal of sludge whiles schools had difficulties funding the management of FS. There was weak regulatory framework and subsequent weak enforcement of sanitation by-laws. The study concludes that stronger political will is vital for effective faecal sludge management...|$|R

Disposal of human feaces is one of the pressing public health problems in most of the urban areas. A critical look at the existing toilet systems of the slums was observed and analyzed. Considerations were made with respect to the slums, environmental factors, provision of sanitation system, physical, social and cultural factors. Four different locations were sampled this include Elabuchi, Marine Base, Abonnema Wharf and Nember Waterside. At Elabuchi 165 households disposes faeces directly into the River while 25 house holds have <b>bucket</b> <b>latrine.</b> At Marine base, 65 households disposes faces directly into the river, while 25 households have <b>bucket</b> <b>latrine.</b> Abonnema Wharf has 80 households disposing feaces directly into the river while 10 households have <b>bucket</b> <b>latrine</b> and for Nembe waterfront has 75 households disposing faeces directly into the river while 15 households have <b>bucket</b> <b>latrine.</b> A comparison of composted and un-composted feaces was observed.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Environmental Health)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2003 This study {{provides}} information on the provision of environmental health services to informal housing settlements by local authorities. A standard for Environmental Health Service delivery according to Government policies and legislation has been provided. Actual environmental health services delivered to Ducats informal settlement at the time (1992), have been compared to the services {{that should have been}} delivered by law. Baseline data have been compiled by means of questionnaires, in order to assist the different levels of government in addressing the housing and environmental health needs of the Ducat community. The nature of Environmental Health and the history of informal housing, more specific that of the Ducat informal housing settlement, have been determined. Limited environmental health services were rendered to informal housing settlements occupying land illegally during 1992. These environmental health services were limited to basic sanitation, water supply and refuse removal. Only pit <b>latrines</b> or <b>bucket</b> <b>latrines</b> were required as a means of sanitation, tanks for water supply and skips for the disposal of waste. Amatola Regional Services Council however rendered all the environmental health services required. Other environmental health aspects such as pest control, communicable disease control, air pollution control, radiation, occupational health issues, temperature extremes, lighting, ventilation, noise, social environment, food and meat hygiene were not required. This study has provided a set of Government policies and legislation, which should be considered in rendering environmental health services for housing in future. Uncertainty of the past decade, about rendering of Environmental Health services to people occupying land illegally, still persists. The Municipal Structures Act, 117 of 1998 requires the rendering of Environmental Health services by local authorities, but it does not state whether these services should be rendered to people occupying land illegally as well. Since this has been the biggest restriction in providing environmental health services in the past, it is recommended that Government address this uncertainty...|$|R

50|$|Sanitation: Inside the camp, squalor {{and lack}} of {{sanitation}} reigned: clutter, blood, vomit and decomposing bodies filled the barracks, which were also full of pests and of the foul stench of the often overflowing <b>latrine</b> <b>bucket.</b> Due to exposure to the elements, inmates suffered from impaired health leading to epidemics of typhus, typhoid, malaria, pleuritis, influenza, dysentery and diphtheria. During pauses in labor (5:00-6:00; 12:00-13:00, 17:00-20:00) inmates had to relieve themselves at open latrines, which consisted of big pits dug in open fields, covered in planks. Inmates would tend to fall inside, and often died. The Ustaše encouraged this by either having internees separate the planks, or by physically drowning inmates inside. The pit would overflow during floods and rains, and was also deliberately drained into the lake, from which inmate drinking water was taken. The inmate's rags and blankets were too thin to prevent exposure to frost, as was {{the shelter of the}} barracks. Clothes and blankets were rarely and poorly cleansed, as inmates were only allowed to wash them briefly in the lake's waters once a month save during winter time, when the lake froze. Then, a sanitation device was erected in a warehouse, where a few clothes were insufficiently boiled.|$|R
50|$|The Vickers {{machine gun}} {{accompanied}} the BEF to France in 1914, {{and in the}} years that followed, proved itself to be the most reliable weapon on the battlefield, some of its feats of endurance entering military mythology. Perhaps the most incredible was the action by the 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps at High Wood on 24 August 1916. This company had ten Vickers guns, and it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for twelve hours onto a selected area 2000 yd away in order to prevent German troops forming up there for a counter-attack while a British attack was in progress. Two companies of infantrymen were allocated as carriers of ammunition, rations and water for the machine-gunners. Two men worked a belt-filling machine non-stop for twelve hours keeping up a supply of 250-round belts. 100 new barrels were used up, and all the water, including the men’s drinking water and contents of the <b>latrine</b> <b>buckets,</b> was used to keep the guns cool. In that twelve-hour period the ten guns fired a million rounds between them. One team is reported to have fired 120,000 from their gun to win a five franc prize offered to the highest-scoring gun. At the end of operation, it is alleged that every gun was working perfectly and that not one gun had broken down during the whole period. It was this reliability which endeared the Vickers to the soldiers that used it. It rarely broke down; it just kept on firing. Demand from the British Army for Vickers machine guns was so high that Vickers had to find new ways of increasing production and by 1915 Vickers had supplied the British armed forces with 2,405 guns. These increases continued throughout the war: 7,429 were supplied in 1916, 21,782 in 1917 and 39,473 in 1918.|$|R
