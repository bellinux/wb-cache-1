Because Louisiana law considers seventeen-year-olds to be adults for purposes of criminal culpability, the charges for these four were unaffected by the appellate ruling overturning Bell's conviction.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{development}} {{of law in}} the field of environment undoubtedly experiences expansion. Republic of Macedonia as a state candidate for full membership of EU, in the recent several years makes significant efforts for harmonization of its legal regulation {{in the field of}} environment with the legal regulation of the Union. The Law on Waste Management has a special place in the subject problem. By passing and harmonization of the laws and subordinate regulation with acquies and according to the national strategy for waste management, Republic of Macedonia made a significant step toward setting the basic directions in the field of waste management. Within the paper we will make an analysis on the most important aspects, which are of significance for the thematic determination of this paper, wherein the major emphasis in the paper will be placed on the regulation related to the waste <b>batteries</b> <b>and</b> accumulators, in hope that the consequent implementation of the regulation will minimize their negative influence on the environment.
