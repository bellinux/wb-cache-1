5|$|Director Everett Lewis {{financed the}} film almost entirely, using money earned working on other films. Skin & Bone was {{originally}} intended to be entirely improvised, but {{after a year of}} filming Lewis decided to script some of it to add shape to the story. The film alternates <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white and color, marking shifts between depictions of a character's fantasy and reality.|$|E
5|$|The film {{starts with}} the Polaroid {{photograph}} of a dead man. As the sequence plays backwards the photo reverts to its undeveloped state, entering the camera before the man is shot in the head. The film then continues, alternating <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white and color sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{story has}} been read as an {{analysis}} of race relations, not <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white but within the black community, exploring its own color and class prejudices. The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States. The ending of the story, however, has been called ambiguous and leaves several questions unanswered.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{many parts}} of South Africa, {{conflict}} was an element largely absent from Jan Smuts's early life. Whether conflict between Briton and Boer, or conflict <b>between</b> <b>Black</b> <b>and</b> White — it had been many years since the farmers of the Swartland had {{had to deal with}} turmoil on their doorsteps. The absence of conflict, along with its inevitable counterpart, development of prejudice, had its effect upon Smuts.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white and places {{the focus on the}} complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
5|$|A {{nationalist}} {{movement in the}} Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as the questions of federalism and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.|$|E

5|$|Farmwork {{combined}} with lessons {{from his mother}} — such was the order of Jan's life {{for the next few}} years. During his early childhood, still too young to be given formal responsibilities on the farm, Jan accompanied the Coloured farm labourers as they went about their daily work. At this time the relations between master and servant, <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white, were certainly not based on social equality; nevertheless, on these Swartland farms there was little of the rigid segregation which was already emerging elsewhere in South Africa and which was later to have such profound consequences. Since 1828 the Cape had enshrined in law the principle of strict legal equality between the races. Unlike the rest of South Africa, all adult males, were entitled to vote and to stand for election to the Colonial legislature, subject only to a property qualification. In these country districts therefore, there existed a certain intimacy between the farm owners and their labourers. At harvest times it was common to find both working together to gather in the crops and it was also commonplace to find the farm's children playing with one another, irrespective of race.|$|E
5|$|Ikaruga is a {{vertically}} scrolling shoot 'em up. The game features five stages, {{three levels}} of difficulty, and supports single-player or two-player cooperative modes. The player pilots the Ikaruga fighter, moving to avoid obstacles and other danger. A key gameplay feature to Ikaruga is its polarity system. The player can press a button at any time to switch the polarity of their ship <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white. When white, the ship will absorb white bullets fired by enemies and store their power until released with a special attack. However, if the ship is white and hit by black bullets, it will be destroyed. The opposite is true when the ship is black. Enemy fighters also have black and white polarities. If the player ship is white and the enemy is black, the player's bullets will do twice the damage than if their ship was black. If an enemy is destroyed with the same polarity as the player, the ship will expel energy which can be absorbed or, if the player changes polarities too quickly, present a fatal danger.|$|E
5|$|New York {{political}} offices, {{including the}} mayor, were historically held by Democrats before the war, but {{the election of}} Abraham Lincoln as president had demonstrated the rise in Republican political power nationally. Newly-elected New York City Republican Mayor George Opdyke was mired in profiteering scandals {{in the months leading}} up to the riots. The Emancipation Proclamation of January 1863 alarmed much of the working class in New York, who feared that freed slaves would migrate to the city and add further competition to the labor market. There had already been tensions <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white workers since the 1850s, particularly at the docks, with free blacks and immigrants competing for low-wage jobs in the city. In March 1863, white longshoremen refused to work with black laborers and rioted, attacking 200 black men.|$|E

5|$|The novel then {{switches}} {{to the second}} plot strand, the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown's partner Joe Christmas. The surly, psychopathic Christmas {{has been on the}} run for years, ever since presumably killing his strict Methodist adopted father. Although he has light skin, Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry. Consumed with rage, he is a bitter outcast who wanders <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white society, constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike. Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron, and later Joe Brown, works. The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas's bootlegging operation, which is illegal under Prohibition. He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden, an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers. Though their relationship is passionate at first, Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion, which frustrates and angers Christmas. At the end of her relationship with Christmas, Joanna tries to force him, at gunpoint, to kneel and pray. Joanna is murdered soon after: her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated.|$|E
25|$|Contrast {{is defined}} as the {{difference}} in radiographic density between adjacent portions of the image. The range <b>between</b> <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white on the final radiograph.

40|$|The {{educational}} gap <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> {{whites in}} the United States is wide and widening at the college graduate level. A less known {{fact is that the}} size of this gap differs across the various regions of the country. The difference is especially great for the Northeast, an area known for high average educational achievement.; This paper explores the reasons for the differential college completion gaps by race across regions, focusing chiefly on adults between the ages of 25 and 34. Two hypotheses are explored. One is that differential incidence by region of factors determining access to a college education is the principal determinant of the variation in the magnitude of the gaps. The other is that regional college completion gaps reflect ongoing differences among the regions in location preferences <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites.; The study concludes that variation across regions in college completion gaps <b>between</b> <b>blacks</b> <b>and</b> whites is a product both of differences in past factors affecting access to college and of ongoing differences in location preferences of <b>black</b> <b>and</b> white adults.
