500|$|The {{remainder}} of Teach's crew and former associates were found by <b>Brand,</b> in <b>Bath,</b> and were transported to Williamsburg, Virginia, {{where they were}} jailed on charges of piracy. [...] Several were black, prompting Spotswood to ask his council {{what could be done}} about [...] "the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates." [...] Regardless, the men were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg's Capitol building, under admiralty law, on 12March 1719. [...] No records of the day's proceedings remain, but 14of the 16accused were found guilty. [...] Of the remaining two, one proved that he had partaken of the fight out of necessity, having been on Teach's ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before, and not as a pirate. [...] The other, Israel Hands, was not present at the fight. [...] He claimed that during a drinking session Teach had shot him in the knee, and that he was still covered by the royal pardon. [...] The remaining pirates were hanged, then left to rot in gibbets along Williamsburg's Capitol Landing Road (known for some time after as [...] "Gallows Road").|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT   The {{study has}} as its {{rationale}} {{the fact that there}} are numerous <b>brands</b> of <b>bath</b> soap in the market. The changes of consumer behavior, which influenced by the economy crisis occurred in Indonesia, has suppressed the producers to readjust their marketing programs. It is crucial for the firms to recognize  the consumer attitudes on their products in making their marketing programs. The study was aimed at understanding: (1) the consumer attitudes on the bath soaps’ (i. e., Lux and Giv brands) attributes, (2) the influence of the consumer’s social environment toward the subjective norm in making the purchasing decision on the Lux and Giv, (3) the differential of consumers attitudes on the Lux and Giv. Interview and questionnaire were used to collect data, by using the semantic differential scale method. Fishbein model and Wilcoxon’s signed rank test were applied to test the study’s results. Results of the study showed that: (1) there was a positive attitude of consumer on both the Lux and Giv. “Aroma”, whereas “prestige” had the lowest positive score for the Giv; (2) the consumer’s social environment influenced the subjective norms of consumer in making the purchasing decision of the Lux and Giv. “Family members” was the dominant variable of both the Lux and Giv; (3) there were the differences in the consumer attitude between the Lux and Giv brands. By the differential test for each attribute, then, it was showed that there were the significant differences in the consumer attitude on the product’s attributes,  except for the “packaging”. Based on the study results and empirical evidences supported by the statistical testing,  it is showed that the two <b>bath</b> soap <b>brands</b> have dominate the consumer’s mind. Nevertheless, in making their purchasing decision, the consumers have the difference attitudes in assesing those two brands depends on their desires.

5000|$|The title {{originated}} from {{the name of}} a <b>brand</b> of <b>bath</b> salts or Run Devil Run oil a folk remedy to ward off evildoers which McCartney had picked up at Miller's Rexall Drugs, a hoodoo store in Atlanta. The mock up of a shop with the name [...] "Run Devil Run" [...] on the album cover is of Miller's Rexall Drugs, with the name altered to fit the title song. In the album press release interview prior to release of the album the interviewer asked McCartney about the genesis of the title track. McCartney answered as follows: I was in Atlanta with my son and he wanted to visit the funky side of town. So we went down there and were just wandering around the block and we came across this sort of voodoo shop selling cures for everything. I was looking in the shop window and I saw this bottle of bath salts called Ran Devil Run. I thought that was a good title for a song. So when I was on holiday after that I started thinking of words for it and it came quite easily - 'Run Devil Run, the angels having fun, making, winners out of sinners, better leave before he's done, and when he gets through he'll be coming after you, so listen to what I'm telling you, run Devil run.' After continuing to describe the process of the lyrics, written while sailing, McCartney said that he himself was planning to use the Run Devil Run bath salts: Yeah, I'm getting the bath salts and I'll be taking a bath with them. Not that I have got many demons to get rid of but there may be one or two lurking and this stuff is definitely going to do the trick.|$|R
5000|$|Maynard took {{command of}} the two armed sloops on 17 November. He was given 57 men—33 from HMS Pearl and 24 from HMS Lyme. Maynard and the {{detachment}} from HMS Pearl took {{the larger of the}} two vessels and named her Jane; the rest took Ranger, commanded by one of Maynard's officers, a Mister Hyde. Some from the two ships' civilian crews remained aboard. They sailed from Kecoughtan, along the James River, on 17 November. [...] The two sloops moved slowly, giving Brand's force time to reach <b>Bath.</b> <b>Brand</b> set out for North Carolina six days later, arriving within three miles of Bath on 23 November. Included in Brand's force were several North Carolinians, including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, sent to put down any local objection to the presence of foreign soldiers. Moore went into the town to see if Teach was there, reporting back that he was not, but that the pirate was expected at [...] "every minute." [...] Brand then went to Governor Eden's home and informed him of his purpose. The next day, Brand sent two canoes down Pamlico River to Ocracoke Inlet, to see if Teach could be seen. They returned two days later and reported on what eventually transpired.|$|R
40|$|Smells {{are being}} {{included}} as {{key components of}} product offerings in an ever increasing number of product categories. However, this practice is guided only by intuitive beliefs that the addition of smells might lead to richer brand identities, help brand preference etc. This is because olfaction research in marketing is in its infancy while studies in branding have focused on strategies to extend a brand's existing equity rather than on issues relating to the initial formation of brand knowledge structures. Thus, there is little understanding of the processes that govern consumer learning of products that involve olfactory in addition to visual and verbal elements. This research examines the role of smells vs. visual/verbal elements in the encoding process of such multimodal brands. Our primary focus is on exploring the effects of congruency among the various elements on the derivation of olfactory associations and learning of the brand. Subjects {{in the study were}} exposed to fictitious <b>brands</b> of <b>bath</b> oils and asked to rate the appeal of each brand. Subjects examined the triads of brand elements (i. e., smells, colors and labels) in one of two sequences and the combinations that represented each brand differed based on various congruency conditions. Subjects then undertook a recognition task that was devised to test their learning of the associations between the brand elements. The results suggest that visual/verbal elements play a dominant role in shaping encoding of the product offering. Visual/verbal associations were learned quite easily, regardless of congruency. By contrast, associations between the odors and the labels or colors were learned more accurately when the relevant pair was congruent. Further, the labels and colors seemed to guide the learning of smells. Thus, when the smell was the sole incongruent element and the visual/verbal cues consistently pointed in a different direction, the odor was aligned with the other elements. Consequently, overall brand learning was contingent on the number of congruent cues that were present to assist in the derivation of olfactory associations. These findings provide guidelines to marketers faced with various branding decisions relating to product offerings that incorporate smells...|$|R
40|$|The {{study has}} as its {{rationale}} {{the fact that there}} are numerous <b>brands</b> of <b>bath</b> soap in the market. The changes of consumer behavior, which influenced by the economy crisis occurred in the Indonesia, has suppressed the producers to readjust their marketing programs. It is crucial for the firms to recognize the consumer attitudes on their marketing program. Moreover, consumer attitude is dominantly used in predicting the consumer behavior, in estimating the future demand of product, and in developing the appropriate marketing programs. The study aimed at understanding : (1). The consumer attitudes on the bath soaps (i. e, Lux and Giv brands) attributes, (2). The influence of the consumers social environment toward the subjective norm in making the purchasing decisions on the Lux and Giv, (3). The differential of consumers attitudes on the Lux and Giv. Interview and questionnaire were used to collect data, by using the semantic differential scale method. Fishbein model and Wilcoxons signed rank test were applied to the studys results. The result of research indicate that : (1) There was a positive attitude of consumer on both the Lux and Giv.

Based on the study results and empirical evidences supported by the statistical testing, it is showed that the two <b>bath</b> soap <b>brands</b> have dominated the consumers mind. Nevertheless, in making their purchasing decisions, the consumers have the difference attitudes is assessing those two brands depends on their desires. Thus, it is suggested that the firms need to have variation and to differentiate their products to maintain the consumers loyalties, to develop some promotional strategies involving the sellers, to create the advertisements that strongly conspicuous the prominent attributes of the product, and to choose the ads media that can reach all consumer levels.

40|$|The goal of {{operating}} a chromic acid plating process with controlled chemistry and, in turn, realizing consistent plating {{is now possible}} using an Electrodialytic Process that excels in pollution prevention. Chrome platers have problems. Their primary concern is to plate parts with a consistent coating- a coating without pits or bumps and of a uniform thickness. This is not easily done when the chemistry of the bath is continuously changing. Ideally the amount of electricity required to do the plating and the concentration and the chemistry of the bath remain constant. In reality, however, from the moment a <b>brand</b> new <b>bath</b> is used, everything changes- the energy required, the concentration of the acids and the coating itself. How rapidly the changes occur depends on items such as the ratio of anode to cathode, {{whether there is a}} reverse etch step, the number and variety of parts plated and what elements are dragged {{into and out of the}} bath. At some point in the plating process, the coating is not consistent or the amount of needed immersion time increases or the voltage has to be tumed up or catalysts have to be either added or removed. So the plater looks for ways to control the consistency of the bath. Often the plater removes a portion of the solution, stores it until it can be disposed of off-site (at increasingly higher costs) and replaces it with fresh make-up, or the plater relies on drag-out to remove the contaminants in the bath. At times the bath is analyzed and chemical adjustments are made based on the data reported. Another problem facing chrome platers is that employers and employees are concemed about safety in the workplace, particularly how to minimize chemical handling and potential contact with hazardous chemicals, and how to control emissions of fumes into the work environment. Because of these concerns, decanting chromic acid, storing barrels of hazardous waste and continual bath adjustments become less and less attractive ways to control bath chemistry. Other problems center around compliance, waste minimization, pollution prevention, cost of sludge disposal and waste treatment. Whenever possible, platers rinse parts over the tanks, use a stagnant dragout tank and countercurrent cascade rinses to minimize discharge and disposal of chemicals into rinse water and add as much rinse water as possible- with all the dragou...|$|R
