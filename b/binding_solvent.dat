40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} and characterization of novel, molecularly imprinted polymer nanofilament-based optical sensors {{for the analysis}} of enrofloxacin, an antibiotic widely used for human and veterinary applications, is reported. The polymers were prepared by nanomolding in porous alumina by using enrofloxacin as the template. The antibiotic was covalently immobilized on to the pore walls of the alumina by using different spacers, and the prepolymerization mixture was cast in the pores and the polymer synthesized anchored onto a glass support through UV polymerization. Various parameters affecting polymer selectivity were evaluated to achieve optimal recognition, namely, the spacer arm length and the <b>binding</b> <b>solvent.</b> The results of morphological characterization, binding kinetics, and selectivity of the optimized polymer material for ENR and its derivatives are reported. For sensing purposes, the nanofilaments were incubated in solutions of the target molecule in acetonitrile/HEPES buffer (100  mM, pH  7. 5, 50 : 50, v/v) for 20  min followed by incubation in a 10  mM solution of europium(III) ions to generate a europium(III) -enrofloxacin complex on the polymer surface. The detection event was based on the luminescence of the rare-earth ion (λexc= 340  nm; λem= 612  nm) that results from energy transfer from the antibiotic excited state to the metal-ion emitting excited state.

Using at least six different solvents as probes, the probes cluster in major pockets of the functional site, providing detailed and reliable information on the amino acid residues that are important for ligand <b>binding.</b> <b>Solvent</b> mapping was applied to 12 structures of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligand-binding domain (LBD), including 2 structures without a ligand, 2 structures with a partial agonist, and 8 structures with a PPAR agonist bound. The analysis revealed 10 binding “hot spots”, 4 in the ligand-binding pocket, 2 in the coactivator-binding region, 1 in the dimerization domain, 2 around the ligand entrance site, and 1 minor site without a known function. Mapping is {{a major source of}} information on the role and cooperativity of these sites. It shows that large portions of the ligand-binding site are already formed in the PPARγ apostructure, but an important pocket near the AF- 2 transactivation domain becomes accessible only in structures that are cocrystallized with strong agonists.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the structural and thermodynamic {{basis of the}} <b>binding</b> of <b>solvent</b> at internal sites within proteins a number of mutations were constructed in T 4 lysozyme. Some of these were designed to introduce new solvent-binding sites. Others were intended to displace solvent from preexisting sites. In one case Val- 149 was replaced with alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, isoleucine, and glycine. Crystallographic analysis shows that, {{with the exception of}} isoleucine, each of these substitutions results in the <b>binding</b> of <b>solvent</b> at a polar site that is sterically blocked in the wild-type enzyme. Mutations designed to perturb or displace a solvent molecule present in the native enzyme included the replacement of Thr- 152 with alanine, serine, cysteine, valine, and isoleucine. Although the solvent molecule was moved in some cases by up to 1. 7 Å, in no case was it completely removed from the folded protein. The results suggest that hydrogen bonds from the protein to bound solvent are energy neutral. The <b>binding</b> of <b>solvent</b> to internal sites within proteins also appears to be energy neutral except insofar as the bound solvent may prevent a loss of energy due to potential hydrogen bonding groups that would otherwise be unsatisfied. The introduction of a solvent-binding site appears to require not only a cavity to accommodate the water molecule but also the presence of polar groups to help satisfy its hydrogen-bonding potential. It may be easier to design a site to accommodate two or more water molecules rather than one as the solvent molecules can then hydrogen-bond to each other.

To measure the hydrophobicity at the center, structures of an antigen-antibody complex where a buried phenylalanine was replaced by smaller hydrophobic residues were determined. By correlating structural changes with binding free energies, we estimate the hydrophobicity at this central site to be 46 cal mol− 1 Å− 2, twice that at the periphery.

40|$|ABSTRACT Water, sodium, potassium, ATP, amino acids, and sugars are not uniformly {{distributed}} in Rana pipiens oocytes. Concentration differences exist between nucleus (germinal vesicle) and ooplasm and between animal and vegetal ooplasmic regions. The mechanisms {{responsible for these}} differences were investigated using intracellular reference-phase (iRP) analysis. The iRP is an artificial "organelle " that has the solvent properties of a dilute salt solution and is in diffusional equilibrium with water and solutes present in other cellular compartments. Ooplasm/iRP solute distributions show that ooplasm differs from ordinary aqueous solutions-exhibiting both solute exclusion and solute binding. Yolk platelets are an important cause of this behavior, largely because their proteins are present as hydrate crystals, which are rich in anionic sites and which interact intensely with associated water. Because of yolk's abundance, it obscures the <b>solvent</b> and <b>binding</b> properties of ooplasmic ground substance. The oocyte nucleus is yolk and organelle free and the nuclear envelope is readily permeable.

Two of the variants, Thr 26 [...] >Ser (T 26 S) and Thr 151 [...] >Ser (T 151 S), have increased reversible melting temperatures {{with respect to}} the wild-type protein. The third, Ala 93 [...] >Thr (A 93 T), has essentially the same stability as wild type. Thr 26 is in the wall of the active-site cleft. Its replacement with serine results in the rearrangement of nearby residues, most notably Tyr 18, suggesting that the increase in stability may result from the removal of strain. Thr 151 in the wild-type structure is far from the active site and appears to sterically prevent the access of solvent to a preformed binding site. In the mutant, the removal of the methyl group allows access to the <b>solvent</b> <b>binding</b> site and, in addition, the Ser 151 hydroxyl rotates to a new position so that it also contributes to <b>solvent</b> <b>binding.</b> Residue 93 is in a highly exposed site {{on the surface of the}} molecule, and presumably is equally solvent exposed in the unfolded protein.

The situation of hard-core interactions is addressed by considering the <b>binding</b> of <b>solvent</b> molecules to a precisely defined `cavity' in order to assess the probability that the `cavity' is entirely evacuated. The primitive quasi-chemical approximation corresponds to a extension of the Poisson distribution used as a default model in an information theory approach. This primitive quasi-chemical theory is in good qualitative agreement with the observations for the hard sphere fluid of occupancy distributions that are central to quasi-chemical theories but begins to be quantitatively erroneous for the equation of state in the dense liquid regime of ρ d^ 3 > 0. 6. How the quasi-chemical approach can be iterated to treat correlation effects is addressed. Consideration of neglected correlation effects leads to a simple model for the form of those contributions neglected by the primitive quasi-chemical approximation.

In {{the last decade or}} so we have applied much effort in elaborating computational strategies to infer the mechanisms of intramolecular and intermolecular communication in a number of GPCRs of the rhodopsin family. In this article, we review the most relevant achievements on the matter. In summary, the receptor sites of activating mutations or ligand-binding communicate with a common allosteric site in the cytosolic domains.

The latter turned out to be the primary recognition point for the C-terminus of the G protein alpha-subunit, independent of the receptor or the G protein type. In spite of the highly composite nature of the receptor-G protein interface, receptor contacts with the C-terminus of the alpha 5 -helix seem to be the major players in the receptor-catalyzed formation of a nucleotide exit route.

The decay of DAPI in buffer at pH 7 was decomposed using two exponentials having lifetime values of approximately 2. 8 ns and 0. 2 ns. The double exponential character of the decay was maintained over a large pH range from 3 to 9. At pH 1 the short component dominated, whereas at pH 12, only the long component was detectable. Two distinct spectra were associated with the two lifetime components; the short component was shifted to the red. The short lifetime component occurs in the presence of water. In water the excitation spectra depended on the emission wavelength and there was no viscosity dependence of the two forms. To explain these results we propose that there is a ground state conformer in which preferential solvation of the indole ring allows proton transfer in the excited state. DAPI complexed with polydeoxynucleotides retained most of the features of the decay of DAPI in solution.

40|$|By {{measuring}} quantitatively {{the active}} efflux of cephalosporins by the RND (resistance-nodulation-division) family efflux pump AcrB in intact cells of Escherichia coli, {{we found that}} the simultaneous presence of another substrate, such as chloramphenicol, benzene, cyclohexane, or Arg beta-naphthilamide, significantly enhanced the extrusion of cephalosporins. The stimulation occurred also in a strain expressing the covalently linked trimer of AcrB, and thus cannot be ascribed to the enhanced assembly of the trimer from AcrB monomers. When Va 1139 of AcrB was changed into Phe, the stimulation by benzene was found to occur at much lower concentration of the solvent. A plausible explanation of these observations is that the AcrB pump is constructed to pump out very rapidly the solvent or chloramphenicol molecules, and thus the efflux of cephalosporins, which presumably bind to a different subsite within the large binding pocket of AcrB, can become facilitated. Computer simulations of ligand binding to AcrB, both by docking and by molecular dynamics simulations, produced results supporting and extending this hypothesis. Benzene and the cephalosporin nitrocefin can bind simultaneously to the distal binding pocket of AcrB, both in the wild type and in the V 139 F variant. Interestingly, while the binding position and strength of benzene are almost unaffected by the presence of nitrocefin, this latter substrate is significantly displaced toward the exit gate in both wild type and mutant transporter in the presence of benzene.

In addition, we have remeasured the solvation energy of protonated benzene-benzene to compare with the previously measured value. ...|$|R
40|$|Water, sodium, potassium, ATP, amino acids, and sugars are not uniformly {{distributed}} in Rana pipiens oocytes. Concentration differences exist between nucleus (germinal vesicle) and ooplasm and between animal and vegetal ooplasmic regions. The mechanisms {{responsible for these}} differences were investigated using intracellular reference-phase (iRP) analysis. The iRP is an artificial "organelle" that has the solvent properties of a dilute salt solution and is in diffusional equilibrium with water and solutes present in other cellular compartments. Ooplasm/iRP solute distributions show that ooplasm differs from ordinary aqueous solutions [...] exhibiting both solute exclusion and solute binding. Yolk platelets are an important cause of this behavior, largely because their proteins are present as hydrate crystals, which are rich in anionic sites and which interact intensely with associated water. Because of yolk's abundance, it obscures the <b>solvent</b> and <b>binding</b> properties of ooplasmic ground substance. The oocyte nucleus is yolk and organelle free and the nuclear envelope is readily permeable. Consequently, nucleus/iRP solute concentration differences reflect the <b>binding</b> and <b>solvent</b> properties of nuclear ground substance. Nucleoplasm binds approximately 19 meq of potassium. Furthermore, the monosaccharides, 3 -O-methylglucose, L-glucose, and D-xylose, are selectively excluded, their nucleus/iRP concentration ratios averaging about 0. 7; ratios for other solutes studied are unity. We interpret monosaccharide exclusion to mean that nuclear ground substance water is different in its "instantaneous" structure from ordinary saline water. Because of this difference, hydrogen bond interaction between nuclear water and certain sterically restricted solutes, of which ringed monosaccharides are examples, is reduced. Some implications of modified ground substance water and selective solute exclusion are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{curvature of}} double helical DNA induced by regularly repeated adenine tracts (A-tracts) is well-known but still puzzling. Its physical origin remains controversial {{even though it}} is perhaps the best-documented sequence modulation of DNA structure. In order to shed some light upon this problem we were looking for relevant sequence motives that could spontaneously induce stable bends in DNA during molecular dynamics simulations. Such motif has been localized in the bending center of the kinetoplast body of Leishmania tarentolae which is the first bent DNA fragment investigated in vitro twenty years ago. We report here the results of comparative theoretical and experimental studies of bending dynamics in 35 -mer DNA fragments. This length appears large enough for the curvature to be distinguished by gel electrophoresis. Two DNA fragments, with identical base pair composition, but different sequences are compared. In the first one, a single A-tract motif was four times repeated in phase with the helical screw whereas the second sequence was "random". Both calculations and experiments indicate that the A-tract DNA is distinguished by the large static curvature and characteristic bending dynamics. These results confirm that the A-tract induced bending reproduced in simulations corresponds to the experimental phenomenon. They question the earlier views that attributed a decisive role in the mechanism of DNA bending to sequence specific base pair stacking or <b>binding</b> of <b>solvent</b> counterions. At the same time, our results support the hypothesis of a compressed frustrated state of the backbone as the principal physical cause of the static curvature...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} aimed at {{exploring}} the utility of thermoanalytical methods in the solid-state characterization of various crystalline forms of nevirapine. The different forms obtained by recrystallization of nevirapine from various solvents were identified using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The appearance of desolvation peak accompanied by weight loss in TGA indicated the formation of solvates: hemi-ethanolate (Form I), hemi-acetonitrilate (Form II), hemi-chloroformate (Form III), hemi-THF solvate (Form IV), mixed hemi-ethanolate hemi-hydrate (Form V), and hemi-toluenate (Form VI). The higher desolvation temperatures of all the solvates except toluenate than their respective boiling point indicate tighter <b>binding</b> of <b>solvent.</b> Emphasis has been laid on the determination of heat capacity and heat of solution utilizing microreaction calorimeter to further distinguish the various forms. The enthalpy of solution (ΔHsol), an indirect measure of the lattice energy of a solid, was well correlated with the crystallinity of all the solid forms obtained. The magnitude of ΔHsol {{was found to be}} − 14. 14  kJ/mol for Form I and − 2. 83  kJ/mol for Form V in phosphate buffer of pH  2, exhibiting maximum ease of molecular release from the lattice in Form I. The heat capacity for solvation (ΔCp) was found to be positive, providing information about the state of solvent molecules in the host lattice. The solubility and dissolution rate of the forms were also found to be in agreement with their enthalpy of solution. Form (I), being the most exothermic, was found to be the most soluble of all the forms...|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics replica exchange based method {{has been developed}} that allows rapid identification of putative ligand binding sites {{on the surface of}} biomolecules. The approach employs a set of ambiguity restraints in replica simulations between receptor and ligand that allow close contacts in the reference replica but promotes transient dissociation in higher replicas. This avoids long-lived trapping of the ligand or partner proteins at nonspecific, sticky, sites on the receptor molecule and results in accelerated exploration of the possible binding regions. In contrast to common docking methods that require knowledge of the <b>binding</b> site, exclude <b>solvent</b> and often keep parts of receptor and ligand rigid the approach allows for full flexibility of binding partners. Application to peptide-protein, protein-protein and a drug-receptor system indicate rapid sampling of near-native binding regions even in case of starting far away from the native binding site outperforming continuous MD simulations. An application on a DNA minor groove binding ligand in complex with DNA demonstrates that it can also be used in explicit solvent simulations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{combination}} of mass spectrometric and quantum chemical techniques {{is used to}} study solvent effects {{on the structure of}} desolvated [AA-H+Zn]+ complexes (AA: amino acid), formed in the gas phase by electrospray ionization. By studying the collision-induced fragmentations of such complexes, we show that the solvent used may have a direct impact on the structure of the gaseous ions formed. In the case of [Gly-H+Zn]+, four isomers may be potentially formed, and ions extracted from methanol/water and acetonitrile/water solutions show different fragmentations patterns. The formation of different isomers when using these two solvents is further evidenced by the fragmentation spectra of [Asn-H+Zn]+, and [Asp-H+Zn]+. These cases illustrate the fine tuning which can sometimes be exerted on the structures of electrosprayed ions. Ab initio calculations are used to show the decisive role of the <b>solvent</b> <b>binding</b> energies on the last steps of the electrospray process. It is concluded that both the solvent and the cone voltage in the electrospray source may have a strong influence on the structure of fully desolvated, gaseous ions. © 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

[...] University of Washington, 2012 Detoxication of {{superoxide}} (O 2 -) in anaerobic organisms {{is performed}} by the iron (Fe) containing metalloenzyme Superoxide Reductase (SOR) via reduction to hydrogenperoxide. To understand the mechanism involved and how small molecular changes aect the properties and reactivity of SOR model complexes [Fe(II) (S Me 2 N 4 (6 -H-DPPN)) ](PF 6), [Fe(II) (S Me 2 N 4 (2 -QuinoEN)) ](PF 6) and [Co(II) S Me 2 N 4 (6 -Me-DPEN)) ](PF 6) were used {{in an attempt to}} reproduce the functionality of SOR and to characterize intermediates of reactivity. Intermediates of reaction with (O 2 -) were investigated through spectroscopic analysis as well as reactivity with a variety of substrates. Geometric alterations resulted in the reversible <b>binding</b> of neutral <b>solvent</b> ligands to [Fe(II) (S Me 2 N 4 (6 -H-DPPN)) ](PF 6). The thermodynamics of binding were studied. Based on these observations, new ligand designs incorporating steric bulk or electron donating substituents were proposed with the goal of stabilizing and isolating intermediate compounds...|$|R
40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Dimerization of {{cyclodextrin}} (CD) molecules is {{an elementary}} {{step in the}} construction of CD-based nanostructured materials. Cooperative binding of CD cavities to guest molecules facilitates the dimerization process and, consequently, the overall stability and assembly of CD nanostructures. In the present study, all three dimerization modes (head-to-head, head-to-tail, and tail-to-tail) of β-CD molecules and their binding to three isoflavone drug analogues (puerarin, daidzin, and daidzein) were investigated in explicit water surrounding using molecular dynamics simulations. Total and individual contributions from the <b>binding</b> partners and <b>solvent</b> environment to the thermodynamics of these binding reactions are quantified in detail using free energy calculations. Cooperative drug binding to two CD cavities gives an enhanced binding strength for daidzin and daidzein, whereas for puerarin no obvious enhancement is observed. Head-to-head dimerization yields the most stable complexes for inclusion of the tested isoflavones (templates) and may be a promising building block for construction of template-stabilized CD nanostructures. Compared to the case of CD monomers, the desolvation of CD dimers and entropy changes upo...|$|R
