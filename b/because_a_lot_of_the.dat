Among these are various alternate takes and small extensions that were micro-edited out of the film and soundtrack releases, but some have been unearthed by fans.|$|E

500|$|Half of {{the first}} day's footage came out {{overexposed}} and unusable. Before the financiers or studio bosses knew about the problem, Soderbergh was already doing reshoots. The insurers made him agree that any further mishaps resulting in additional filming {{would come out of}} the director's own pocket. Soderbergh shot in various cities in California, Ohio and Texas, on a 54-day schedule and came in $2 million under budget. The director operated the camera himself in an effort to [...] "get as close to the movie as I can," [...] and to eliminate the distance between the actors and himself. Soderbergh drew inspiration from the cinema verite style of Ken Loach's films, studying the framing of scenes, the distance of the camera to the actors, lens length, and the tightness of eyelines depending on the position of a character. Soderbergh remembers, [...] "I noticed that there's a space that's inviolate, that if you get within something, you cross the edge into a more theatrical aesthetic as opposed to a documentary aesthetic". Most of the day was spent shooting <b>because</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film was shot with available light.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{director}} Len Wiseman, [...] "You'd {{think that}} the concept of vampires and werewolves mixing it up had been done more than a few times on film. But according to Wiseman, the mix hadn't really been done in decades. [...] "It's funny <b>because</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talk has been that it's a simple concept and why hasn't this been done before. It's true. When we decided let's do vampires and werewolves, we thought that concept's been done. Of course it's been done. We talked to our agent, we went on the Internet, we looked at everything, and outside of the 50s, it just hasn't been done. It was kind of shocking to us".|$|E
2500|$|Most of the deleted scenes feature {{additional}} {{characters from}} the television series who ultimately did {{not appear in the}} finished film. Lynch has said that [...] "I had a limit on the running time of the picture. We shot many scenes that—for a regular feature—were too tangential to keep the main story progressing properly. We thought it might be good sometime to do a longer version with these other things in, <b>because</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters that are missing in the finished movie had been filmed. They're part of the picture, they're just not necessary for the main story." [...] According to Lynch, had the film included these scenes, it [...] "wouldn't have been quite so dark. To me it obeyed the laws of Twin Peaks. But {{a little bit of the}} goofiness had to be removed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thirdly, {{the writing}} {{sessions}} {{were affected by}} Patrick's struggles with addiction, concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. While Patrick had struggled {{with it in the}} past, it became particularly bad upon dealing with the pressure of recording a follow-up to the platinum selling Title of Record. Patrick would stay up for multiple days at a time without sleep, spending entire days indulging in his addictions instead of working on the album. The album's first single, [...] "Where Do We Go From Here" [...] addressed said struggles; the track was self-referential in Patrick's struggles to create the album in the face of his addiction, knowing that the money being spent in the prolonged period, and the drugs being taken, were not sustainable activities. The track [...] "God Damn Me" [...] was written in between Patrick's blackouts one night when he was so heavily intoxictated that a friend kept on stopping in to wake him up {{to make sure he was}} still alive. In 2013, Patrick would reflect on the writing sessions, stating [...] "I went through a music phase where I was writing as I experienced my life within drugs and alcohol....I cringe when I hear some of it <b>because</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lyrics I feel like ugh what was I thinking. There’s a lot of stuff I would have changed if I had been a little bit more clear headed." ...|$|E

50|$|I mean photojournalists {{do tend to}} {{take great}} risks, more than most average people do, and go to places they {{probably}} shouldn't <b>because</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things that they're covering are either conflict or they're just contentious in their own right.

50|$|There {{were very}} few leading roles for Indian actors, and even {{when it came to}} small parts and extras Indian actors had to compete against other actors who were impersonating Native Americans.

By using make-up, braids, tanner, and dark hair actors pretended to be Indian and convinced film studios to give them Indian parts.
