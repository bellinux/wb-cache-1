40|$|Introduction: Nowadays, {{the tractor}} mounted <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> {{is used in}} many {{agricultural}} fields. These sprayers have many advantages compared to other sprayers, but in Iran, their field efficiency is much {{lower than that of}} the developed countries, because the tank volume and consumption of pesticides per hectare is often so highthat spraying per hectare takesa long time for handling the solutions and transporting the sprayers. Also spray droplet size is ordinarily high and its distribution is unknot uniform. So, often spraying and dropping top parts of plants on the earth is inevitable. According to studies carried out in the country during the years 2005 - 2008 in the agricultural research centers in several provinces such as Khuzestan, four types of sprayers including tractor mounted sprayer, atomizer, microner, and electrostatic atomizer were studied and some of the results obtained include the following. From {{the point of view of}} percentage of crash crop, tractor mounted sprayer has the highest percentage, but microner sprayer had the lowest. From the point of view of the solution of consumption amount and spraying cost per hectare, the operation of the tractor mounted sprayer and electrostatic sprayer had the highest and the lowest ranks, respectively. Atomizer sprayer had the highest effect on the percentage amount of weed control, but it requires a high amount of water consumption, high drift and low operation (Safari and Lovaimi, 2010). Materials and Methods: The experiment was carried out during 2012 - 2013 in the field of agricultural research located in the Mollasani city located 20 km near Ahvaz. In this study, tractor mounted spinning disk sprayer (mounted microner sprayer) was evaluated in comparison with conventional <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> on weeds control. The treatments included medium (3500 rpm) and low (2000 rpm) speed rotation disk sprayer and two types of nozzle in conventional <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer.</b> One of them was an Italian tee jet nozzle and the other one was flowage nozzle and they were compared with control treatment. Experiment design was Randomized Completed blocks Design (RCBD) with seven replications. Parameters such as spraying quality, diameter, volume mean diameter and numerical mean of droplets, spray quality factor, the percentage of crash crop, weeds dry weight and number, percentage of weed control and the drift were measured. The results were compared with a control treatment. For comparative tests between the sprayers, the measured parameters were compared with each other using SAS software. Results and Discussion: Volume mean diameter and numerical mean diameter in tractor mounted microner sprayer with medium and low speed rotation disk treatment and also tractor mounted <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> with Italian fan nozzle treatment were metered 162. 5, 461 and 635. 5 micron, and 138. 5, 355 and 452. 5 micron, respectively. Volume mean diameter related to numerical mean diameter was obtained to be 1. 17 and 1. 3 for tractor mounted microner sprayer with medium and low levels of speed rotation disk, and 1. 4 for tractor mounted <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> with Italian fan nozzle, respectively. Whenever the spray quality coefficient is closer to one, the spray quality is better. So microner sprayer treatment with 1. 17 coefficient has the best spray quality.

40|$|Granular <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> {{has been}} used by large scaled farmers for centuries. This machine is used to repel or {{fertilize}} their crops. In MARDI, they used 3 types of fertilizer that is Nitrogen, N, Phosphorus, P and Potassium, K. Those 3 types of particles have been simulated by using Ansys software and the results show that potassium, K fertilizer not scattered to the ground and the others 2 fertilizers are conversely. The uniformity of the distribution of granular fertilizer was carried out with a reasonable range of variables. Various methods have been used to study the efficiency of the spray boom design on through simulation software and lab approach. In this work, the simulation of the particles in the <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> is performed from the <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> entering until the exit and distributed to the ground. The simulation is performed by using ANSYS CFX based on the Taguchi method. Taguchi method have been used in this study. For the orthogonal array, since this case study consists of 4 level and 5 factor, L‟ 16 was used for the simulation process. This simulation utilize only one fertilizer that contained all types of the basic NPK fertilizer. The parameters are involved the granular diameter size, air velocity at the inlet, blow head distance, height of collecting plate and width of collecting plate. Results shows that the air velocity must be kept higher when the diameter of particle increases. Collecting plates with excessive height and width can cause the velocity fertilizer to drop and the particles fail to distribute well. Furthermore, furthers distance between the boom section can also cause the particles to scattered unevenly onto the ground. The most desired simulation result was achieved with 1. 5 mm diameter particles, air velocity 8 m/s, distance between boom section is 200 mm and height and width of collecting plate is 14 mm and 10 mm.

Assuming equal pest control efficacy, the study calculates the annualized net present cost per acre of owning and operating each sprayer for ten years using a baseline discount rate of 10 percent over 200 acres of semi-dwarf apple trees. The analysis found the annualized net present cost per acre, from least to greatest, to be $ 287 for the air curtain sprayer, $ 312 for the tower sprayer with electronic sensors, $ 345 for the plain tower sprayer, and $ 391 for the conventional air blast sprayer. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the ranking of these cost results was sensitive to farm size, but not to percentage of funds borrowed, discount rate, loan interest rate, or pesticide costs within the ranges investigated.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for {{the regulation of}} <b>boom</b> <b>sprayers</b> working in circular trajectories has been developed. In this type of trajectory, {{the areas of the}} plots of land treated by the outer nozzles of the boom are treated at reduced rates, and those treated by the inner nozzles are treated in excess. The goal {{of this study was to}} establish the methodology to determine the flow of the individual nozzles on the boom to guarantee that the dose of the product applied per surface unit is similar across the plot. This flow is a function of the position of the equipment (circular trajectory radius) and of the displacement velocity such that the treatment applied per surface unit is uniform. GPS technology was proposed as a basis to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor. The viability of this methodology was simulated considering two circular plots with radii of 160 m and 310 m, using three sets of equipment with boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 m. Data showed as increasing boom widths produce bigger errors in the surface dose applied (L/m 2). Error also increases with decreasing plot surface. As an example, considering the three boom widths of 14. 5, 24. 5 and 29. 5 m working on a circular plot with a radius of 160 m, the percentage of surface with errors in the applied surface dose greater than 5 % was 30 %, 58 % and 65 % respectively. Considering a circular plot with radius of 310 m the same errors were 8 %, 22 % and 31 %. To obtain a uniform superficial dose two sprayer regulation alternatives have been simulated considering a 14. 5 m boom: the regulation of the pressure of each nozzle and the regulation of the pressure of each boom section. The viability of implementing the proposed methodology on commercial <b>boom</b> <b>sprayers</b> using GPS antennas to establish the position and displacement velocity of the tractor was justified with a field trial in which a self-guiding commercial GPS system was used along with three precision GPS systems located in the <b>sprayer</b> <b>boom.</b> The use of an unique central GPS unit should allow the estimation of the work parameters of the boom nozzles (including those located at the boom ends) with great accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Pesticide spray {{flow from}} air-assisted orchard sprayer through pear orchard and {{deposition}} on different environmental systems were estimated {{using a new}} integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The model simulated the complex interactions between wind, air and spray flow from the sprayer with target orchard canopy and the neighbouring environment. The new CFD approach involves the incorporation of the actual 3 D canopy architecture into the model to simulate its effect on air and spray flow and deposition of droplets on the branches. Source-sink terms {{were added to the}} basic momentum and turbulence equations in a detailed sub-domain created around the branches to represent the effect of leaves. The spray droplets were generated from atomization model and tracked using a Lagrangian particle transport model. A new stochastic deposition model was developed and used to calculate deposition on leaves. The deposition model is a function of leaf optical porosity of the trees, leaf area density, leaf drag coefficient and droplet interception coefficient of the leaves. Two distinct nozzle setups, orchard and <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> setups with AIR brown and TT blue nozzles, respectively, were compared to assess the effect of droplet size distribution on spray flow and deposition. The model results were compared with results from field measurements. For both sprayer setups, the simulation results agreed well with the measurements. The spray proportion above the tree height and behind the trees for the <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> setup was 57. 2 % and 69. 6 % more than the orchard sprayer setup according to the simulations and the measurements, respectively. Such a model can be used to improve design features and the calibration of operational parameters of sprayers for better spraying efficiency and reduced environmental impact. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Conventional {{high volume}} {{pesticide}} spraying in citrus crops with oscillating boom sprayers results in {{low levels of}} pesticide retention on trees {{and high levels of}} off- target losses. This study was conducted to establish whether lower volume pesticide spraying with an air-assisted low-profile sprayer and air-assisted sprayers fitted with tower air conveyors (air-towers) could replace conventional high volume pesticide spraying. The spraying efficacy of an oscillating <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> applying 10 000 l ha (- 1) was compared with three different air-assisted sprayers applying volumes of between 500 and 6000 l ha (- 1). Spray efficacy was determined by measuring spray deposits on citrus leaves and fruit and off-target losses (canopy run-off) by using a fluorescent dye tracer technique. Biological efficacy was determined by assessing the control of two insect pests of citrus being California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii Maskell) and Citrus mealybug (Planococcus citri Risso) using Supracide 400 (methidathion). The Barlow tower sprayer operating at 6000 l ha (- 1) produced equal spray deposits on leaves and higher spray deposits on fruit compared to the oscillating boom operating at 10 000 l ha (- 1). The Hardi low-profile air-blast sprayer produced significantly lower spray deposits on both leaves and fruit as the height zone increased in the trees. The Silvan air-shear tower sprayer produced better distribution of spray than the low-profile air-blast sprayer through the height zones in the tree on both leaves and fruit. The percentage of leaf retention of spray volume increased with decreasing application volume from 14 % for the oscillating boom at 10 000 1 ha (- 1) to 59 % for the Silvan tower at 500 l ha (- 1). Canopy spray run-off increased with increasing volume from 2 % for the Silvan tower at 500 and 1000 l ha (- 1) and the Barlow tower at 1500 1 ha (- 1) to 28 % for the oscillating boom at 10 000 1 ha (- 1). The biological efficacy of the oscillating <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> on red scale was matched by the Barlow tower at 6000 l ha (- 1) and the Silvan tower at 500 l ha (- 1). The Barlow tower at 6000 l ha (- 1) produced a greater reduction in fruit infected with mealybug in the calyx than the oscillating <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> at 10000 l ha (- 1) and all other sprayer treatments. The reduction in dose rate of insecticide produced by using lower spray volumes with registered rates based on volume of spray volume resulted in pests not being controlled in some of the lower volume treatments. This clearly illustrates that changes to certain pesticide registrations will be necessary in the adoption of lower spray volumes in crops such as citrus. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For a given operating pressure and for each increment of 1 hPa in vapor pressure deficit, there was a diameter reduction of approximately 0. 0759, 0. 518 and 1. 514 &# 956;m for the parameters DV 0. 1, DV 0. 5 and DV 0. 9, respectively. The diameter of the droplets decreased as the operating pressure increased...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} tractor-hiring unit of Edo state, Nigeria. The criteria used were fleet of equipment, personnel and workshop facilities {{and its impact on}} the farming populace in the state. The study adopted the use of a questionnaire and interview schedules. Among the information requested from the respondents were access to services rendered by the unit and increment in farm sizes. Records available at the headquarters and zonal offices of the unit provided additional sources of information. The unit has seven Steyr, 18 Fiat and nine Massey Ferguson tractors, eight ploughs, 17 harrows, seven tipping trailers, two <b>boom</b> <b>sprayers,</b> one fertilizer spreader, three maize shellers, two rotary slashers, one drilling machine, two ridgers and a pick-up van which are located in the various zones of the unit. Most of these equipment are either functional or require minor repairs to be used on the field. There is sufficient number of tractors but insufficient implements to fully utilize them. Workshop facilities and personnel are inadequate. The maintenance culture adopted is customer motivated. This is not a good practice as it has resulted in about 12 % of the equipment being abandoned as scraps. There has been a general increase in farmsizes since th...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{pesticide}} applicators {{constitute a}} unique pesticide use group. Aerial, mechanical-ground, and focal weed control by application of herbicides, in particular chlorophenoxy herbicides, yield diverse exposure scenarios. In the present work, we analyzed aberrations in G-banded chromosomes, reproductive hormone levels, and polymerase chain reaction-based V(D) J rearrangement frequencies in applicators whose exposures were mostly limited to chlorophenoxy herbicides. Data from appliers where chlorophenoxy use was less frequent were also examined. The biomarker outcome data {{were compared to}} urinary levels of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) obtained {{at the time of}} maximum 2, 4 -D use. Further comparisons of outcome data were made to the total volume of herbicides applied during the entire pesticide-use season. Twenty-four applicators and 15 minimally exposed foresters (control) subjects were studied. Categorized by applicator method, men who used a hand-held, backpack sprayer in their applications showed the highest average level (453. 6 ppb) of 2, 4 -D in urine. Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) values were correlated with urinary 2, 4 -D levels, but follicle-stimulating hormone and free and total testosterone were not. At the height of the application season; 6 / 7 backpack sprayers, 3 / 4 applicators who used multinozzle mechanical (<b>boom)</b> <b>sprayers,</b> 4 / 8 aerial applicators, and 2 / 5 skidder-radiar...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{evaluation of a}} <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> is typically achieved upon plants or ground distribution (in a sprayed area) and spray drift (outside sprayed area, downwind) as defined by International Standards. When transposed to mist blowers, protocols & methodologies might appear unadapted or undefined. This paper introduces experimental feed-back {{in the assessment of}} mist blower spraying quality used for crop protection (banana crops) or environmental purposes (mosquito control). The definition of an effective sprayed zone according to a spray distribution pattern is discussed through the comparison of two methodologies. The comparison between several types of sprayers might be critical as spraying conditions may vary (e. g. number of spraying sides). The results on drift values of a mist blower used on banana crop will be discussed as an example. Key words: Spray application quality, drift, canon mist blowers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Natural wind, {{relative}} position between the nozzle and the outlet of the ram in the air-assistant spray {{have a great}} influence on performance. Air-assisted <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> model is developed based on CFD. According to the data of the related parameters of the spray machine, variables of 3 -D model were defined. With velocity of natural wind and inlet of the ram, the spraying flow keeping constant, the {{relative position}} between the nozzle and the outlet being a research variable, this article calculates the drift rate of the droplets respectively, then analyzes the results scientifically and gets the corresponding conclusion. At the same time, in order to confirm {{the reliability of the}} simulation results, this paper makes an experiment, which is done in Shandong agricultural university spray performance laboratory. Studies have shown that drift rate is significantly lower when the nozzles located under outlet position than on the downwind or the upwind. Instructio...|$|E
40|$|AGDISP is a {{well-established}} spray drift model {{that has been}} validated for aerial spraying of forests. Recently a prototypical ground boom option {{has been added to}} AGDISP. This was evaluated in the current study by collecting data from spray trials over a grass sward using a ground <b>boom</b> <b>sprayer</b> and representative application parameters. Spray solutions were made up of water, sticker adjuvant and a metal cation, which was changed for each spray application. Deposition from spray drift was measured by analyses of the cation deposits on artificial targets (plastic tapes) placed on the grass surface. Measured deposition was compared with profiles calculated using AGDISP. AGDISP overpredicted deposition from spray drift by a factor of 3. 5 - 100 outside the spray block. Possible reasons for these discrepancies are given. Options are to improve measured deposition and the algorithms for the deposition on the downwind swath of the spray block and evaporation of droplets...|$|E

40|$|Wind tunnels {{have been}} used by a number of {{researchers}} to evaluate the risk of pesticide drift contamination from <b>boom</b> <b>sprayers</b> (eg Walklate et al 2000, Buttler Ellis and Bradley 2002, Taylor 2002). These typically determine the vertical drift distribution at a distance of 2 m downwind of a single nozzle operated at controlled conditions and the horizontal drift distribution from 2 m to 7 m downwind. Spray drift is often collected on 2 mm diameter polythene lines. A typical layout is shown in Figure 1. A droplet trajectory model of the wind tunnel drift measurements is currently being developed based on the ballistic model used by Mokeba (1997) and Cox (2000). A sample of the graphical output from the preliminary model is shown in Figure 2. It is proposed that the model will eventually incorporate factors such as the initial droplet size and velocity, entrained air, vortex generated by the spray plume, boundary effects due to the wind tunnel, droplet evaporation and wind tunnel characteristics. Drift was measured in the 1. 75 m wide, 1. 75 m high and 10 m long working section of the wind tunnel located at the University of Queensland, Gatton Campus and the results compared to the preliminary model predictions. Drift values predicted by the preliminary model for 2 m downwind from the nozzle is similar t...|$|R
