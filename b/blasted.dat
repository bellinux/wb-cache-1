50|$|Vacuum <b>blasting</b> is an {{abrasive}} <b>blasting</b> method, {{also referred}} to as dustless <b>blasting</b> or closed loop abrasive <b>blasting.</b> The method is characterized by a <b>blast</b> tool that does abrasive <b>blasting</b> and collects both used <b>blast</b> media, and loosened particles from the surface to be treated, simultaneously. The <b>blast</b> tool is equipped with a <b>blast</b> hose and a suction hose, that both run from the <b>blast</b> tool to a control unit. The control unit supplies the <b>blast</b> tool with pressurized air mixed with <b>blast</b> media, and sucks back dust, loosened particles and used <b>blast</b> media. The control unit continuously separates dust and loosened particles from the used <b>blast</b> media, and sends used <b>blast</b> media back into the pressurized air flow. The dust and loosened particles are collected in a waste bin.|$|R

In this study, we further characterized <b>blast</b> producing moderate traumatic brain injury and defined “composite” <b>blast</b> and primary <b>blast</b> exposure set-ups. Schlieren optics visualized interaction between the head and a shock wave generated by external shock tube, revealing strong head acceleration upon positioning the rat on-axis with the shock tube (composite <b>blast),</b> but negligible skull movement upon peak overpressure exposure off-axis (primary <b>blast).</b> Brain injury signatures of a primary <b>blast</b> hitting the frontal head were assessed and compared to damage produced by composite <b>blast.</b> Low to negligible levels of neurodegeneration were found following primary <b>blast</b> compared to composite <b>blast</b> by silver staining. However, persistent gliosis in hippocampus and accumulation of GFAP/CNPase in circulation was detected after both primary and composite <b>blast.</b> Also, markers of vascular/endothelial inflammation integrin alpha/beta, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1, and L-selectin along with neurotrophic factor nerve growth factor-beta were increased in serum within 6 [*]h post-blasts and persisted for 7 [*]days thereafter.

40|$|Consideration of <b>blast</b> {{damage in}} rock slope {{stability}} {{has been a}} challenging task in rock mechanics because <b>blasting</b> results depend on several factors {{that can lead to}} different forms of damage. Currently, it is not clear on how to consider <b>blast</b> damage in rock slopes. This thesis investigates the occurrence of <b>blast</b> damage in rock slopes using an integrated field investigation, remote sensing and numerical modelling approach. A framework for defining <b>blast</b> damage in the field and using remote sensing data was developed to provide the input for a <b>blast</b> damage model which can then be used either for numerical analysis or understanding the occurrence of <b>blast</b> damage features in the field. Results of field investigation and numerical simulations show that <b>blast</b> damage on the rock slope surface varies depending on the rock mass quality. <b>Blast</b> fracturing increases with decrease in rock mass quality. Observations on exposed joint surfaces in open pit slopes indicate that the <b>blasting</b> process has induced varying forms of damage on these surfaces. Finite-discrete element numerical modelling of <b>blast</b> induced damage indicates that <b>blast</b> damage develops in different forms from the slope surface. The simulated <b>blast</b> damage zone varied from complete blocks (fully connected blocks), partially connected blocks, dilation and undamaged zone.

Since Mokra Quarry was not a hypothetical mine but a mine with existing operations that incorporates current <b>blasting</b> works the new design was to serve as means to modernize the current <b>blasting</b> works. <b>Blast</b> design is important because good design produces desired fragmentation and reduces cost related to material handling or secondary <b>blasting.</b> The modernization of <b>blasting</b> works at the quarry required detail assessment of current <b>blasting</b> practices that are undertaken. Therefor a visit to Mokra Quarry was contacted to obtain information of current <b>blasting</b> parameters. During the field visit information on geology, bench geometry, explosives, detonators, <b>blast</b> pattern and firing system were recorded. Mine workers on site assisted with logistics and technical information. Based on the information gathered planning model was formulated that incorporates input data and predicted output (results).
