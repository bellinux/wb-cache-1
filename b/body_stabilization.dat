The test have been executed in the cases when the bus is stocked with an automatic hydro-mechanical transmission {{in the process of}} speed picking up, gear-changing or road braking which is assigned by accidental road humps. A computer simulation of dynamic structures in combination with virtual devices and real objects (HIL – Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation) has been carried in the paper. Personal computers, software, programmed logic controller, frequency generator, solenoid-operated valve have been used for the investigation process. The paper proposes an unconventional method for improvement operational characteristics which is based on integrated control of a suspension and automatic hydro-mechanical transmission. A mathematical model includes systems of automatic transmission, suspension and module for generation of accidental road humps. The model has been considered as a basis for semi-natural laboratory bench with industrially-manufactured controller, other components of automatic systems and standard control organs. The most efficient method for <b>body</b> <b>stabilization</b> is control of the suspension according to the parameter of angular rate during vertical turn of an automobile’s center line with {{a turning point in the}} center of mass.

The spinal cord acts as key executing center, but how it coordinates many body parts located across distance remains poorly understood.  Here we employed mouse genetic and viral approaches to reveal organizational principles of long-projecting spinal circuits and their role in quadrupedal locomotion. Using neurotransmitter identity, developmental origin, and projection patterns as criteria, we uncover that spinal segments controlling forelimbs and hindlimbs are bidirectionally connected by symmetrically organized direct synaptic pathways that encompass multiple genetically tractable neuronal subpopulations. We demonstrate that selective ablation of descending spinal neurons linking cervical to lumbar segments impairs coherent locomotion, by reducing postural stability and speed during exploratory locomotion, as well as perturbing interlimb coordination during reinforced high-speed stepping.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{adductor}} {{pectoral fin}} muscle in post-spawning females {{of the white}} croaker Micropogonias furnieri (Desmarest, 1823) is described from a morphological, histochemical and morphometric perspectives. A description of the morphological characteristics was conducted after dissections in different layers, down to the deep layer. Five muscles were found: superficial, medial, radial and deep adductors, and dorsal arrector. Their fibers were studied after applying histochemical techniques: succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) to reveal mitochondria, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) for glycogen, Sudan black for lipids, myosin adenosinetriphosphatase (mATPase) to reveal the types of fibers, and modified mATPase to evidence the capillaries. Fiber diameters were measured {{and the number of}} capillaries was counted. Fiber subtypes named small, medium and large were found within red, pink and white fibers, the latter prevailing. Staining homogeneity was observed in white fibers after alkaline pre-incubations. The number of capillaries decreased from red to white fibers. Due to the prevalence of white fibers, the adductor muscle of the pectoral fins appears to be capable of rapid and discontinuous movements, which are important to <b>body</b> <b>stabilization</b> during subcarangiform swimming. The homogenous staining of white fibers observed in this research corresponds to the post-spawning gonad stage studied...|$|E

Four patients underwent biopsy of in-continuity and bypassed jejunal and ileal {{segments of the}} small intestine 11 to 22 months after the bypass operation. Microscopically, marked mucosal villus hypertrophy of the in-continuity bowel was observed, especially in the ileum. Bypassed jejunal mucosa underwent atrophy compared with pre-bypass jejunum, whereas bypassed ileum appeared similar microscopically to pre-bypass ileum. The specific activities of mucosal disaccharidase enzymes (maltase, sucrase, lactase and trehalase) in units per mg protein remained similar to pre-bypass levels in segments of the in-continuity jejunum and the bypassed jejunum and ileum. On the other hand, elevated mucosal disaccharidase levels were measured in biopsy specimens of the in-continuity ileum.

40|$|Visually guided animals depend {{heavily on}} the quality of visual signals in order to obtain {{functionally}} relevant information about their environment. To support visual information processing, nature has evolved a large variety of physiological adaptations and behavioral strategies such as compensatory head movements. During self-movement, head rotations compensate for changes in body attitude in order to stabilize gaze. However, how walking animals cope with uneven structured substrates, which may affect body and gaze orientation, is still unknown. We used stereo high-speed video to analyze compensatory head movements of blowflies walking freely on differently structured substrates. We found that even a pronounced asperity of the ground structure, with bumps of almost the size of the animal, was largely compensated by the walking apparatus of the blowfly, which leads to body roll and pitch movements only marginally larger than those on flat substrate. Pitch and roll fluctuations of the head were smaller compared with body fluctuations on all tested substrates, emphasizing the significance of gaze stabilization during walking on structured substrates. Furthermore, we found no impairment in head and <b>body</b> <b>stabilization</b> during walks in darkness, which indicates that the control system mediating compensatory head movements works well without any visual input.
