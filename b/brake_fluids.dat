5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the brake master cylinder seal. [...] A seal in the brake master cylinder may be susceptible to damage following the use of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 <b>brake</b> <b>fluid.</b> If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> indicator light or a <b>BRAKE</b> <b>FLUID</b> LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{polyethylene}} glycol based fluids, Dot 5 is hydrophobic. An advantage over {{other forms of}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> is that silicone has a more stable viscosity index over a wider temperature range.

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{braking system}} is designed as a closed system: {{unless there is a}} leak in the system, none of the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> enters or leaves it, nor does the fluid get consumed through use. Leakage may happen, however, from cracks in the O-rings or from a puncture in the brake line. Cracks can form if two types of <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> are mixed or if the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> becomes contaminated with water, alcohol, antifreeze, or any number of other liquids.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fluids</b> must {{maintain}} {{a low level}} of compressibility, even with varying temperatures to accommodate different environmental conditions. This is important to ensure consistent brake pedal feel. As compressibility increases, more brake pedal travel is necessary for the same amount of brake caliper piston force.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>fluids</b> {{must not}} corrode the metals used inside {{components}} such as calipers, wheel cylinders, master cylinders and ABS control valves. They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) {{are added to}} the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork unlike glycol-ether based DOT fluids.|$|E
5000|$|Excessive {{brake drum}} heating {{can cause the}} <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> to vaporize, which reduces the {{hydraulic}} pressure applied to the brake shoes. Therefore, the brakes provide less deceleration for a given amount {{of pressure on the}} pedal. The effect is worsened by poor maintenance. <b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> that is old and has absorbed moisture has a lower boiling point, so brake fade occurs sooner.|$|R

40|$|Abstract‘Turbo Braking Assists’ (TBA) {{employs the}} {{principles}} of turbo machinery and automotive engineering {{in order to achieve}} effective braking assistance for the modern day disc as well as drum brakes. These brakes are intended for the purpose of braking assists during high speed motion. The major components include a turbine or rotor, pump, nozzle, enlarged <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> chamber, DOT 5. 1 <b>braking</b> <b>fluid.</b> The functioning involves directing a jet of high velocity <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> (DOT 5. 1 in this case) at the blades of the rotor which is coupled with the wheel. The braking circuit is used as such with the enlargement of the <b>brake</b> <b>fluid</b> chamber. A pump is added to the set up to enable increase of mass flow rate of fluid and also to ensure the continuity of fluid flow in the entire circuit. A speed sensor is integrated along with the circuit to activate the pump such that the braking assists are put to use only after a particular velocity is reached as braking assists are not necessary at lower speed...|$|R

50|$|The company {{started as}} a car brake {{manufacturer}} after, in 1925, Albert H. Girling (also co-founder of Franks-Girling Universal Postage) patented a wedge-actuated braking system. In 1929 he sold the patent rights to the New Hudson company. Girling later developed disc brakes, which were successful on racing cars from the early 1950s to the 1970s. Girling brakes had the quirk of using natural rubber (later nitrile) seals, which caused difficulties for some American owners of British cars because of incompatibility with US <b>brake</b> <b>fluids.</b>|$|E

Overspill from pushing back pistons should be avoided, because glycol based fluid will quickly lift or strip paints and other coatings on contact (it can be removed by quickly washing with water, not wiping). <b>Brake</b> <b>fluid</b> level may also be low because of a leak, which {{could result in a}} loss of hydraulic pressure and consequently a significant loss of braking ability.
