40|$|On the {{north-western}} {{edge of the}} Witbank Coalfield, {{near the}} town of Delmas (Mpumalanga Province) a prominent and undulating sill is believed to affect quality of the coal in the seams mined in the area. The study area was separated into two subsections, Study Area A and Study Area B. In Study Area A the sill overlays the coal seams. The top of coal and the sill are separated by ~ 11 m thick sandstone with intermittent bands of shale, siltstone and carbonaceous shale. Study Area B, on the other hand, is located where the same sill underlies the coal seams. In this area, Dwyka tillites form the parting between the sill and the <b>bottom</b> <b>coal</b> seam. 51 composited samples were received from Study Area A and 26 uncomposited samples were received from Study Area B. In both areas, Seam 2 (<b>bottom</b> <b>coal)</b> was sampled due to its consistency and economic importance, as other seams were irregular over the complete area. Three parameters were assessed and compared to the thickness of the sill and the distance between the sill and the bottom coal; i. e. volatile matter, calorific value and ash. The volatile matter behaviour was further investigated using an empirical equation postulated by an industry specialist to determine whether the samples had been devolatilised by an external mechanism, i. e. contact metamorphism. The experimental calculation, based on a regression slope in relation to the South African baseline, indicated that two very different events had occurred on the coal seam. In Study Area A, the calculation indicated that the coal in the area was not devolatilised, thus implying that the sill had no influence on the coal. Conversely the results of the experimental equation in Study Area B indicated that the volatile matter of the lower coal seam had been greatly reduced by an external factor and the coal was devolatilised. Global studies of similar conditions point out that the content of volatile matter in the coal is the most affected variable during the intrusion of an igneous body into coal. This variability is governed by proximity to the sill, the shape of the intrusion, the thickness of the intrusion, orientation, location of the sill or lastly by the thermal conductivity of the country rock. In Study Area A the <b>bottom</b> <b>coal</b> seam was insulated from the heat conducted away from the sill by the presence of strata of different conductivities separating the sill intrusion from the <b>bottom</b> <b>coal.</b> On the other hand, in Study Area B heat was successfully transmitted to the <b>bottom</b> <b>coal</b> by highly conductive strata which separated the sill from the <b>bottom</b> <b>coal.</b> Therefore the study concluded that the sill had a significant influence on the <b>bottom</b> <b>coal</b> when it was underlying the coal (Study Area B) and a conductive layer separated the sill from the coal. In addition, the results indicate that neither the distance from the sill nor the thickness of the sill influence the effect which the sill had with the <b>bottom</b> <b>coal</b> seam in Study Area A.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Chemical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. During Sasol-Lurgi Fixed Bed Dry <b>Bottom</b> <b>coal</b> gasification, {{the mineral}} matter in coal {{undergoes}} various transformations. Heat induced transformation due to low ash fusion temperatures leads to agglomeration of the ash particles to sizes varying from tiny particles to lumps larger than 100 mm. Channel burning and {{instability in the}} ash bed can occur as a result. It is therefore important to understand and anticipate the reactions of the mineral matter prior to feeding the coal into a gasifier. The principal aims of this thesis were to investigate the effect of minerals and mineral associations on the ash fusion temperature of coal. Ash fusion temperature {{was used as a}} measure of the expected behaviour of the ash bed during gasification. Representative samples of run-of-mine coal from three sources were density separated and then comprehensively characterised. The predominant basic oxides present were identified to be Ca, Mg and Fe due to the presence of calcite, dolomite and pyrite. The results showed highest linear correlations with SiO 2 and CaO and confirmed literature that low ash fusion temperatures may be attributed to increased basic oxide levels and low SiO 2 /AI 2 O 3 ratios. The combined removal of Ca, Mg and Fe by chemical fractionation resulted in an increase in ash fusion temperature. Different combinations of minerals were removed by different leaching agents. Chemical fractionation selectively altered the mineral content of coal which in turn provided valuable information on mineral interactions. This was clearly illustrated in the models developed for the calculation of ash fusion temperature. Master...|$|E

This paper presents {{an overview of the}} work published on physical, chemical, and mineralogical composition, mechanical properties such as workability, setting times, compressive, splitting and flexural strength, permeability etc. of concrete and CLSM made with waste foundry sand, <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash, cement kiln dust and wood ash...|$|R

One of the environmental problems is represented by the particulate matter with the diameter of less than 2. 5 mm derived from combustion of coal. In order to find solutions to reduce emissions at source, the particle size distribution of the <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash after removing it from the steam boiler of the large combustion plant from Romag Halanga in Drobeta Turnu – Severin area was determined. Dry particle size distribution shows that the major fraction is one that has a particle size of 125 µm. Particle size distribution in the smallest size fraction was performed with laser diffraction particle size analyzer Brookhaven 90 Plus Nanoparticle Size Analyzer. Particle size distribution shows that in the composition of the <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash were found particles with nanometric dimensions...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{combustion}} by-product {{has been}} around since people understood that burning coal can generates electricity, and its utilization in concrete production for nearly a century. Malaysia facing an increasing production using by-products called <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash from thermal power plants, running into method of disposal where no other commercial usage. A significant amount of research has been conducted somewhere on <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash to ascertain its pozzolanic activity, compressive strength in concrete and mortar, durability and water absorption characteristics in order to ensure its usage as a construction material. This paper presents the experimental investigations carried out to study the effect of bottom ash as partial sand replacement on concrete compressive strength and workability. The various properties was studied consist of compressive strength, workability and water absorption of the concrete at the various percentage of replacement. The strength development for various percentages varies from 0...|$|R
40|$|The use of coal as {{the primary}} fossil fuels in Indonesia are {{increasingly}} widespread. Now, the use of coal is not only used for the power plant but also {{a wide range of}} industries. Resulting from the use of <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash which can still be used because they save the calorific value for alternative fuel that is becoming briquette product. Through research it is known that the bottom ash can be processed into briquettes products with the addition of teak leaves charcoal to improve its quality. This study was conducted with a variety of compositions between bottom ash and teak leaves charcoal. The treatment uses ratio of <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash : teak leaves charcoal 0 %: 100 %, 20 %: 80 %, 40 %: 60 %, 50 %: 50 %, 60 %: 40 %, 80 %: 20 % and 100 %: 0 %. The results showed that the optimum variation of briquettes is a variation of 20 % <b>coal</b> <b>bottom</b> ash and 80 % teak leaves charcoal, this briquettes has a water content of 4, 052 %,ash content of 36, 358 %, calorific value of 4. 520 cal/g, compressive stength of 2, 383 kg/cm 2,CO 54 ppm or 61, 84 mg/Nm 3,Cu 0, 85 µg/g and Zn 1, 21 µg/g. The result of the briquttes characteristics test showed that with increasing amounts of teak leaves charcoal can increase the moisture content and calorific value, and be able to lower ash content and compressive strength...|$|R
