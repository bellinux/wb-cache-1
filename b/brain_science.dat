50|$|The Institute {{focuses on}} two main Biomedical programs: The Stem Cell Policy and Ethics Program and The Program in Ethics and <b>Brain</b> <b>Sciences.</b> With {{support from the}} Greenwall Foundation, the Institute’s (SCoPE) Program, in {{collaboration}} with the Johns Hopkins Institute for Cell Engineering, focuses on ethical issues in the transition from stem cell science to clinical research, and from clinical research to clinical practice. Program in Ethics and <b>Brain</b> <b>Sciences</b> is formed in collaboration with Johns Hopkins <b>Brain</b> <b>Sciences</b> Institute, and focuses on the careful analysis ethical and social issues of revolving around <b>brain</b> <b>sciences.</b>|$|R

25|$|Critics {{pointed to}} his {{decisions}} {{to sign off on}} an ambitious <b>brain</b> <b>science</b> program without consulting the faculty, to sell $80 million in bonds {{for the construction of a}} biomedical sciences building, and to cut the university's extremely popular Charleston String Quartet, which many saw as part of Gee's effort to lead the school away from its close but unprofitable relationship with the arts.|$|E
25|$|Several {{relevant}} {{books were}} published {{during this time}} as well: Sandra Ackerman's Hard Science, Hard Choices: Facts, Ethics and Policies Guiding <b>Brain</b> <b>Science</b> Today (Dana Press), Michael Gazzaniga's The Ethical Brain (Dana Press), Judy Illes' edited volume, Neuroethics: Defining the Issues in Theory, Practice and Policy (both Oxford University Press), Dai Rees and Steven Rose's edited volume The New Brain Sciences: Perils and Prospects (Cambridge University Press) and Steven Rose's The Future of the Brain (Oxford University Press).|$|E
25|$|In Now You See It: How the <b>Brain</b> <b>Science</b> of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now You See It, Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Willis is {{considered}} a second pioneer {{in the study of}} neurology and <b>brain</b> <b>science.</b> In 1664 in Cerebri Anatome (...) , followed by Cerebral Pathology in 1667. In these he described the structure of the cerebellum, the ventricles, the cerebral hemispheres, the brainstem, and the cranial nerves, studied its blood supply; and proposed functions associated with different areas of the brain. The circle of Willis was named after his investigations into the blood supply of the brain, and {{he was the first to}} use the word [...] "neurology." [...] Willis removed the brain from the body when examining it, and rejected the commonly held view that the cortex only consisted of blood vessels and the view of the last two millennia that the cortex was only incidentally important.|$|E
