Hornibrook recommended a repositioning treatment for patients with BPPV from the posterior canal location. He wrote that the procedure most often performed for this purpose was a slightly transformed version of the Epley maneuver, and afterwards recommended carrying out a Dix–Hallpike test to assess the status of BPPV. If such a test was positive, Hornibrook recommended using a Magic Wand to deliver vibrations to the area of the mastoid process.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} {{that result in}} vertigo are <b>benign</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV), Ménière's disease, and labyrinthitis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo {{is a problem in}} a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benign</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> is {{more likely}} in someone who gets {{repeated}} episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. The episodes of vertigo should last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In Ménière's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In labyrinthitis the onset of vertigo is sudden and the nystagmus occurs without movement. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered. This is especially true if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.|$|E
40|$|To {{demonstrate}} that {{for treatment of}} benign <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> {{it is not necessary}} to identify a positional nystagmus. Study Design: Prospective trial of 43 patients with <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> without clinical evidence of positional nystagmus who were treated with a modified canal-repositioning maneuver. Methods: Results were compared with the results obtained in the treatment of posterior semicircular cupolo-canalithiasis with typical positional nystagmus with the same repositioning maneuver. Results: Treatment of 43 patients with <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> without <b>positional</b> nystagmus resulted in a 60. 46 % (26 / 43) complete recovery rate and a 6 % (3 / 43) persistence of disorder rate compared with a 90 % complete recovery rate obtained in 90 patients with typical <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>vertigo</b> (with <b>positional</b> nystagmus).

40|$|One {{person out}} of two has {{experienced}} (or will experience) dizziness at least once, and one out of seven acute vertigo. 5 % of the patients seen by a GP have vertigo and/or disequilibrium. In 37 % of the cases, patients are referred to a specialist. In 2 %, a serious disorder is diagnosed: an embolic transient ischemic attack due to vertebral artery dissection, or basilar trunk dissection, affecting the posterior fossa. During diving, aero-embolic accidents affect more electively the inner ear, but sometimes severe medullary lesions may be associated. In fact, most of vertiginous patients coming to emergency departments present with <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>vertigo</b> (35 %), first manifestations of a Ménière's disease (6 %), or vestibular neuritis (6 %); more rarely temporal bone fracture, or infectious complications such as the rare and severe infectious labyrinthitis.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the nature and prevalence of audiovestibular disturbances in mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC), 32 consecutive MC patients were studied by a wide audiological and vestibular examination.

Bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was found in seven MC patients (22 %) and altered vestibular function test values in other seven subjects (22 %). Moreover, anamnestic and clinical data revealed a high incidence of <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>vertigo</b> in our MC series.

2500|$|<b>Benign</b> <b>Paroxysmal</b> <b>Positional</b> <b>Vertigo</b> (BPPV) – The {{most common}} cause of vertigo.

An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting {{out of bed in the}} morning, or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation.|$|E

40|$|National and {{international}} evidence and guidelines on falls prevention and management in community-dwelling elderly adults recommend that falls services should be multifactorial and their interventions multicomponent. The way that individuals {{are identified as}} having had or being at risk of falls {{in order to take}} advantage of such services is far less clear. A novel multidisciplinary, multifactorial falls, syncope, and dizziness service model was designed with enhanced case ascertainment through proactive, primary care–based screening (of individual case notes of individuals aged ≥ 60) for individual fall risk factors. The service model identified 4, 039 individuals, of whom 2, 232 had significant gait and balance abnormalities according to senior physiotherapist assessment.

40|$|Background: Non-pharmacological {{interventions}} {{have been}} shown to have some effectiveness in adults with dizziness; however, the effectiveness of these interventions in older people is unknown. Purpose: To determine the effects of conservative non-pharmacological interventions for dizziness in older people. Data Sources: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL, AMED, Index to Chiropractic Literature, PsychINFO and MANTIS were searched from inception to May 2014. Study Selection: Two investigators independently screened controlled trials with dizzy participants over 60 years of age. Dizziness from a specific diagnosis such as Meniere&# 039;s disease and <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>vertigo</b> were excluded. Outcome measures from included studies included self-reported dizziness and postural balance. Data Extraction: Two investigators independently extracted data on participants, interventions, comparison group, outcome measures and results. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed with the Cochrane Handbook 12 -item risk of bias, and Cochrane Back Group 5 -item clinical relevance assessment. Data Synthesis: Seven articles consisting of seven controlled trials were included. All studies utilized some form of exercise as the main intervention including vestibular rehabilitation exercises, postural balance exercises, and Tai-Chi exercise. Studies had a high risk of bias with a lack of adequate randomization and allocation concealment, reporting on co-interventions, reporting on reasons for drop-outs, and reporting on participant compliance.

40|$|Dizziness {{is largely}} {{a problem in the}} elderly, being the most common reason {{patients}} over the age of 75 years seek medical attention. The term is used to describe many sensations, including vertigo, disequilibrium and light-headedness. There are different causes of dizziness in older people such as cardiovascular, neurological or locomotor disease, deterioration in sensory organs, vestibular dysfunction and adverse drug effects. Distinctions between the effects of aging and borderline pathology on instability and falls are not always clear-cut. The elderly's greater risk of balance disorders stems from a higher likelihood of impairments or diseases affecting the physiological subsystems underlying the complex skill of balancing. Diagnosing a specific cause of dizziness or vertigo in older people can be a challenge, since the symptom descriptions are often vague and examination findings overlap among potential causes. Once a differential diagnosis is formulated, {{it is not clear what}} tests – if any – will add clinical value. Intervention needs to be tailored to each patient to obtain the maximum effect, designing different exercises for individuals with different kinds of deficiency. Vestibular dysfunction in the elderly can be treated effectively with vestibular rehabilitation, which comprises both a ‘generic’ type and more specific protocols. Moreover, all the following interventions may have a role: exercises designed specifically to improve muscle function and to address sarcopenia, visual deficit treatment, pacemakers, vitamin D supplementation, gradual withdrawal of psychotropic medication, multifaceted podiatry and hip protectors, cognitive behavioural interventions, home safety assessment and modification interventions. In many cases, a multifactorial approach could be the best solution, as the elderly are frequently affected by multiple deficiencies. There is strong scientific evidence that rehabilitation has a significant role for multisensory dizziness, vestibular hypofunction and locomotor pathologies.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} {{this thesis is about}} investigation of the two less well understood mechanisms of balance system, namely utricular function and interactions of visual and vestibular system. Utricules are part of otolith apparatus and sense linear acceleration including gravity and lateral head tilts. Recent advances in rotational technology allow robust methods of assessment of unilateral utricular function using centrifugation techniques. Unilateral centrifugation generates substantial linear acceleration and the utricular response can be measured via tilt perception using subjective visual vertical (chapter 2). Utricular function was studied in common vestibular disorders seen in clinics, like chronic vestibular neuritis, <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>vertigo,</b> unilateral Ménière’s disease, migraine and bilateral vestibular hypofunction. Bilateral vestibular hypofunction produced significantly low utricular gain (chapter 3). A detailed study of the utricular function of larger group of unilateral Ménière’s disease showed significantly greater utricular asymmetry and lower utricular gain than normal controls. Interestingly, hearing loss was a predictor of utricular asymmetry (chapter 4). There was poor correlation between subjective measures and audiovestibular function. The chronic course of Ménière’s disease is well known with slow decline over years and absence of correlation between symptoms and function may point to ‘burn out’ as long term phenomenon (chapter 5). An investigation into visual dependence and vertigo was performed to understand the effect of visual dependence on tilt perception in chronic vertigo. Individuals with vestibular symptoms can have increased visual dependency and migraineurs can have a non-adaptable increase in visual dependency (chapter 6). In summary, we found that the unilateral centrifugation is a safe and well tolerated technique and provides additional, potentially useful information about utricular function. In future, the study of utricular function during acute phases of vertigo will further help overall understanding of otolith pathophysiology and mechanisms used for compensation. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to examine {{possible}} relationships between several clinical aspects of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> and factors better defined as “intrinsic” to the patient, above all age. The disorder can affect essentially all age groups; nevertheless, the onset of age-linked degenerative processes, such as vascular damage, can have a negative influence – at least in theory – on the pathogenic mechanisms of cupulolithiasis or canalolithiasis. The study was based on the review of 566 patients with the typical form of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Based on age, the patients were divided into two groups, respectively ≤ 50 years and > 50 years. For the purposes {{of this study}}, a series of clinical-laboratory conditions associated with the risk of, or clear, vascular damage were also considered. The results indicate that if there are no clinical or case-history elements that can be attributed to an aetiological hypothesis, the clinical behaviour of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> is not affected by the age factor. However, the existence of generic vascular damage, hypothesised by the presence of the above-mentioned conditions, influences certain clinical aspects of the disorder, particularly recovery time, the trend of the active phase and the number of relapses. In conclusion, <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> with a presumed vascular aetiology, the incidence of which increases with age, presents a worse prognosis, not only with respect to the “idiopathic” form in childhood but also the “idiopathic” type in the elderly. The lithiasic model responds well to pathogenic interpretation requirements, which envisage macular degeneration with a vascular component. However, the observation, via imaging, of diffuse ischaemic lesions in critical areas of the brainstem and the cerebellum in many “vascular” patients, does not exclude the possibility of alternative pathogenic mechanisms that, in the final analysis, can lead to compromised VOR on a central level...|$|R

The patient was checked 3 - 5 days later: {{in the presence of a}} positive result, the treatment was repeated; if negative, patients were seen at clinical follow-up 7, 30, 180 and 365 days after recovery.

The incidence of <b>paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> appeared to be higher in females and in patients aged 50 - 70 years, being low in patients under 30. In 88. 8 % of cases posterior semicircular canals showed a significant involvement; in 6. 8 % of cases, only involvement of lateral semicircular canals; monolateral (2. 7 %) and bilateral (1. 7 %) multicanalar forms were rare. <b>Paroxysmal</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> forms involving posterior semicircular canals have been treated with Semont (simplified by Toupet), Epley, Parnes Price-Jones manoeuvres; those, involving lateral semicircular canals with Vannucchi-Vicini forced position and "barbecue" or Gufoni manoeuvre.
