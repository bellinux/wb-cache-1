5|$|The Omaha <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> {{was formed}} in 1883 by the Union Pacific; some shady {{dealings}} by Jay Gould brought the <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> into {{the control of the}} Missouri Pacific Railroad by 1885, when it was constructed with Union Pacific materials {{under the control of the}} MoPac. Stations along with Line included the Florence Depot, Webster Street Station and the Ralston Station. Operated by that company until the early 1960s, today the Line is largely abandoned, with a section redeveloped into the recreational MoPac Trail.|$|E

5|$|The road forks to the {{northeast}} between large buildings and passes beneath Bloor Street, then crosses the Rosedale Ravine. It passes through residential South Rosedale, entering a trench and passing beneath Crescent Road. The road descends into the Yellow Creek ravine (crossing David A. Balfour Park) along the former route of Roxborough Drive, then climbs to pass beneath the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks. It continues to climb along the eastern bank of the ravine, entering Moore Park and turning north at St. Clair Avenue East. The road passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name. It crosses the old <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> Railway trail, and winds northeast into Davisville Village.|$|E

5|$|Under the new plan, freight {{would still}} only operate at night through the tunnel. Spurs {{connecting}} the tunnel in Brooklyn to the Long Island freight <b>belt</b> <b>line,</b> to the B freight sidings on Staten Island, {{and to the}} new city piers on Staten Island would have all been built. The project was projected to cost $60,000,000 and if the job was done quickly, {{it could have been}} done by 1929. The route would help develop the waterfront areas in Staten Island and Jamaica Bay. Provisions would be made for connections with the subway system's Fourth Avenue Line, even though the Transit Commission refused to be involved with the plans.|$|E
5|$|US-60 {{would be}} realigned through {{many of the}} towns it served in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The highway was {{adjusted}} through Fairland to use Connor Avenue, a shorter, straighter route through town; this change was approved on July 11, 1949. The highway's route through Nowata was altered next, on November 13, 1950. Previously, US-60 followed Delaware Avenue to Oak Street, where it turned south, before {{turning back to the}} east on Cherokee Avenue; after the change, it turns south on Pine Street and joins Cherokee Avenue further west. On the same date, the highway was realigned through Bartlesville. The US-60 system through Ponca City was next to be reworked, on July 14, 1952. The previous US-60 and US-77 <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> routes and City Routes were removed in favor of a new US-60 route bypassing the city to the south on Harding Avenue and proceeding east across a new Arkansas River bridge—the present day route. Further west, US-60 and US-177 were realigned in Tonkawa on May 4, 1953, replacing an alternate US-60/US-177 that previously paralleled the main highway there.|$|E

25|$|The Junction Railroad's Buffalo <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> {{opened in}} 1871, {{providing}} a bypass of Buffalo, New York, to the northeast, {{as well as}} a loop route for passenger trains via downtown. The West Shore Railroad, acquired in 1885, provided a bypass around Rochester, New York. The Terminal Railway's Gardenville Cutoff, allowing through traffic to bypass Buffalo to the southeast, opened in 1898.|$|E
25|$|The Baltimore <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> was {{constructed}} by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) in the early 1890s to connect the railroad's newly constructed line to Philadelphia and New York City/Jersey City {{with the rest of}} the railroad at Baltimore, Maryland. It included the Howard Street Tunnel, the Mount Royal Station and the first mainline railroad electrification in the United States. The line is currently operated by CSX Transportation as part of its Baltimore Terminal Subdivision.|$|E

The BeltLine is a current proposal {{for the use of}} light rail and possibly bus or streetcar service on existing railroad rights-of-way around Atlanta's central business districts. The conversion of existing rail right-of-way to the proposed BeltLine also calls for the creation of three additional MARTA rapid transit stations where existing lines intersect the <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> at Simpson Road, Hulsey Yard, and Murphy Crossing.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} of {{electrification}} on a main line was on a four-mile stretch of the Baltimore <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B to the new line to New York {{through a series of}} tunnels around the edges of Baltimore's downtown. Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways, abetted by the Sprague's invention of multiple-unit train control in 1897. By the early 1900s most street railways were electrified.|$|E
25|$|Street railway {{operations}} {{ended in}} Thunder Bay in 1948. Port Arthur's last three antiquated cars made their final run over the North <b>Belt</b> <b>Line</b> on February 16, 1948 in a driving snowstorm, and Fort William's street cars ceased operations on October 16, 1948. Since January 1, 1970, when Port Arthur and Fort William were amalgamated into the City of Thunder Bay, {{the system has}} been known as Thunder Bay Transit. Electric trolley buses were discontinued on September 10, 1972, and the city has since used diesel buses.|$|E

25|$|On July 18, 2001, a 60-car CSXT freight derailed in the Howard Street Tunnel, {{sparking}} a {{fire that}} burned for six days and blocked traffic for much longer. The Howard Street Tunnel fire {{called attention to the}} <b>Belt</b> <b>Line,</b> both as a risk to the surrounding structures and as a link in rail traffic. CSXT has implemented various improvements to increase the integrity of the link, but is limited by the shallow depth of the bore (only three feet below the surface at the south end) and the instability of the surrounding soil.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} {{picture of}} apical constriction is most complete for Drosophila. During Drosophila gastrulation, apical constriction of midline cells initiates invagination {{to create the}} ventral furrow. Like in Xenopus, actomyosin contractility {{plays a major role}} in constricting the apical side of the cell. The constricting cells have an actin meshwork directly beneath the apical membrane as well as circumferential actin <b>belts</b> <b>lining</b> the adherens junctions between cells. Pulsed contractions of the actin meshwork are believed to be primarily responsible for reducing the apical surface area.|$|R
40|$|More {{knowledge}} is needed about variability of starch functional traits in adapted and exotic germplasm and possible genetic {{effects of these}} traits before conducting rigorous inheritance studies and breeding programs for starch quality. We studied and compared the range of variability for starch functional traits {{in a set of}} Corn <b>Belt</b> inbred <b>lines</b> with a set of exotic inbred lines from Argentina, Uruguay, and South Africa. Reciprocal hybrids of some of the lines within each set were compared with their parents. Functional traits were examined by using differential scanning calorimetry on starch extracted from single kernels of genotypes. The set of Corn <b>Belt</b> <b>lines</b> had a wider range of values for most traits than did the set of exotic lines. For both sets of lines, the maximum value for peak height index was as high as that previously reported for the waxy endosperm mutant. Although the Corn <b>Belt</b> <b>lines</b> exhibited a wider range of values for range of retrogradation than the exotic lines, the exotic lines showed a wider range of values for percentage retrogradation. Hybrid values were not consistently higher, lower, midpoint, or similar with respect to the values of their parents. This was true regardless of germplasm type or functional trait. Reciprocal cross values showed trends suggesting reciprocal differences, although there was no trend suggesting greater effect of the female parent. These traits seem to be controlled by many modifying effects in addition to major effects. Results indicate that sufficient variability exists in Corn Belt germplasm to conduct breeding and inheritance studies effectively and that there should be potential for breeding for functional traits...|$|R
