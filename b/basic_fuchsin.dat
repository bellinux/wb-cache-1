In the Gimenez staining method, <b>basic</b> <b>fuchsin</b> stains bacteria red or magenta, and malachite green {{is used as a}} blue-green counterstain. Malachite green is also used in endospore staining, since it can directly stain endospores within bacterial cells; here a safranin counterstain is often used. Malachite green can also be used as a saturable absorber in dye lasers, or as a pH indicator between pH 0.2-1.8. However, this use is relatively rare. Leuco-malachite green (LMG) is used as a detection method for latent blood in forensic science. Hemoglobin catalyzes the reaction between LMG and hydrogen peroxide, converting the colorless LMG into malachite green. Therefore, the appearance of a green color indicates the presence of blood.|$|E

40|$|That {{aldehydes}} {{produce a}} curious effect upon structures stained with <b>basic</b> <b>fuchsin</b> {{has been known}} for some time. Both Goodpasture (6) and Fite (4) demonstrated that organisms which have been stained red with carbol fuchsin and then differentiated with formaldehyde are rendered violet. Fite found this procedure to be successful when acid-fast bacilli were most difficult to stain. Gomori (5), in 1950, reported that <b>basic</b> <b>fuchsin,</b> in the presence of strong mineral acids, forms intensely purplish dyes with certain aldehydes. The dye was referred to as aldehyde-fuchsin and was found to possess useful staining prop-erties. During an investigation on the staining of beta-cell granules in pancreatic islets, it was observed that methyl violet 2 B or crystal violet stained these granules, after selective oxidation, just as intensely as did aldehyde-fuchsin after the same oxidation. <b>Basic</b> <b>fuchsin,</b> methyl violet 2 B, and crystal violet are known basic triphenylmethane dyes which differ structurally in regard to the relative number of open amino groups. It seemed possible, then, that certain aldehydes are capable of reacting with the open amino groups of <b>basic</b> <b>fuchsin</b> to produce a dye similar both structurally and in staining properties to methyl or crystal violet. The present study was undertaken in order to support or disprove this hypothesis regarding the chemical characteristics of Gomori’s paraldehyde-fuchsin dye.
