This we unwound quickly, and after impaling a live grasshopper upon the barbs of our respective hooks, dropped them into the water, and gazed intently at the lines. Mr Russ, who was a great lover of angling, now began to get excited, and made several violent pulls at the line, under the impression that something had bitten. Suddenly his rod, stout as it was, bent with the immense muscular force applied to it, and a small goldeye, about three or four inches long, flashed like an electric spark from the water, and fell with <b>bursting</b> <b>force</b> on the rocks behind, at the very feet of a small Indian boy, who sat, nearly in a state of nature, watching our movements from among the bushes. The little captive was of a bright silvery colour, with a golden eye, and is an excellent fish for breakfast. The truth of the proverb, [...] "It never rains but it pours," [...] was soon verified by the immense number of goldeyes of every size, from one foot to four inches, which we showered into the bushes behind us. Two or three dozen were caught in a few minutes, and at last we began to get quite exhausted; and Mr Russ proposed going up to the house for his new fly-rod, by way of diversifying the sport, and rendering it more scientific.|$|E

These forces and associated cellular deformations induce {{a variety of}} biological processes. The degree of deformation depends on the mechanical properties of the cell. As most cells are anchorage dependent for normal functioning, {{it is important to}} study the mechanical properties of cells in their attached configuration. The goal {{of the present study was}} to obtain the mechanical and failure properties of attached cells. Individual, attached C 2 C 12 mouse myoblasts were subjected to unconfined compression experiments using a recently developed loading device. The device allows global compression of the cell until cell rupture and simultaneously measures the associated forces. Cell bursting was characterized by a typical reduction in the force, referred to as the <b>bursting</b> <b>force.</b> Mean bursting forces were calculated as at an axial strain of 72 ± 4 %. Visualization of the cell using confocal microscopy revealed that cell bursting was preceded by the formation of bulges at the cell membrane, which eventually led to rupturing of the cell membrane. Finite element calculations were performed to simulate the obtained force–deformation curves. A finite element mesh was built for each cell to account for its specific geometrical features.

40|$|New {{satellite}} and in situ observations show large intraseasonal (10 – 60 day) variability of surface winds and upper-ocean current in the equatorial Indian Ocean, {{particularly in the}} east. An ocean model forced by the Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) wind stress is used to study {{the dynamics of the}} intraseasonal zonal current. The model has realistic upper-ocean currents and thermocline depth variabilities on intraseasonal to interannual scales. The quality of the simulation is directly attributed to the accuracy of the wind forcing. At the equator, moderate westerly winds are punctuated by strong 10 – 40 -day westerly wind bursts. The wind <b>bursts</b> <b>force</b> swift, intraseasonal (20 – 50 day) eastward equatorial jets in spring, summer, and fall. The zonal momentum balance is between local acceleration, stress, and pressure, while nonlinearity deepens and strengthens the eastward current. The westward pressure force associated with the thermocline deepening toward the east rapidly arrests eastward jets and, subsequently, generates (weak) westward flow. Thus, in accord with direct observations in the east, the spring jet is a single intraseasonal event, there are intraseasonal jets in summer, and the fall jet is long lived but strongly modulated on an intraseasonal scale. The zonal pressure force is almost always westward in the upper 120 m, and changes sign twice a year in the 120 – 200 -m layer. Transient eastward equatorial undercurrents in early spring and late summer are associated with semiannual Rossby waves generated at the eastern boundary following thermocline deepening by the spring and fall jets. An easterly wind stress is not necessary to generate the undercurrents. Experiments with a single westerly wind <b>burst</b> <b>forcing</b> show that apart from the intraseasonal response, the zonal pressure force and current in the east have an intrinsic 90 -day time scale that arises purely from equatorial adjustment...|$|R

The method of encapsulation used in this study takes advantage of a new technology known as membrane emulsification and suspension polymerization. This study investigates the encapsulation of the paraffin wax RT 21 ® in a poly(methyl methacrylate) shell, which could be used to increase the thermal mass of a building. The objectives of the study are: (1) to encapsulate RT 21 ® through the use of membrane emulsification and (2) to test the mechanical properties of the microcapsules under nanocompression. Membrane emulsification was carried out using Shirasu porous glass hydrophilic membranes of pore sizes 10, 10.2, and 20  μm. Polymerization was conducted in a batch reactor with methyl methacrylate as the monomer in the temperature range 70 – 90  °C. The thermal properties (the latent heat of melting and melting temperature) of the microcapsules were tested using a differential scanning calorimeter. Particle size analysis was conducted to determine the average size distribution of the microcapsules produced. Membranes with pore sizes of 10, 10.2, and 20  μm produced microcapsules with average diameters of 22.40  ±  1.47, 25.38  ±  0.80, and 37.50  ±  1.69  μm, and average latent heats of 113.91  ±  12, 116.69  ±  1.40, and 109.89  ±  8.69  J/g, respectively. In order to determine the mechanical properties of these microcapsules, a modified nanoindentation compression technique was used to test the <b>bursting</b> <b>force</b> for individual microcapsules.|$|E
40|$|Laminopathies {{comprise}} {{a group of}} inherited diseases with variable clinical phenotypes, caused by mutations in the lamin A/C gene Q 1 (LMNA). A prominent feature in several of these diseases is muscle wasting, as seen in Emery–Dreifuss muscle dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Although the mechanisms underlying this phenotype remain largely obscure, two major working hypotheses are currently being investigated, namely, defects in gene regulation and/or abnormalities in nuclear architecture causing cellular fragility. In this study, using a newly developed cell compression device we have tested the latter hypothesis. The device allows controlled application of mechanical load onto single living cells, with simultaneous visualization of cellular deformation and quantitation of resistance. With the device, we have compared wild-type (MEF 1 / 1) and LMNA knockout (MEF 2 / 2) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and found that MEF 2 / 2 cells show a significantly decreased mechanical stiffness and a significantly lower <b>bursting</b> <b>force.</b> Partial rescue of the phenotype by transfection with either lamin A or lamin C prevented gross nuclear disruption, as seen in MEF 2 / 2 cells, {{but was unable to}} fully restore mechanical stiffness in these cells. Our studies show a direct correlation between absence of LMNA proteins and nuclear fragility in living cells. Simultaneous recordings by confocal microscopy revealed that the nuclei in MEF 2 / 2 cells, in contrast to MEF 1 / 1 cells, exhibited an isotropic deformation upon indentation, despite an anisotropic deformation of the cell as a whole. This nuclear behaviour is indicative for a loss of interaction of the disturbed nucleus with the surrounding cytoskeleton. In addition, careful investigation of the three-dimensional organization of actin-, vimentin- and tubulin-based filaments showed a disturbed interaction of these structures in MEF 2 / 2 cells. Therefore, we suggest that in addition to the loss of nuclear stiffness, the loss of a physical interaction between nuclear structures (i. e. lamins) and the cytoskeleton is causing more general cellular weakness and emphasizes a potential key function for lamins in maintaining cellular tensegrity...|$|E
40|$|Steel-to-concrete bond {{is a basic}} {{aspect of}} the {{behaviour}} of reinforced concrete structures both at serviceability and ultimate states. When bond rules were originally developed, experimental results were mainly obtained on normal- strength concrete and a minimum relative rib area (bond index) was required by building codes to ensure good bond properties. The arrival into the market of high-performance concrete and newer structural needs may require different bond indexes. In the present paper, the experimental results of pull-out tests on short anchorages are presented. Several pull-out tests on ribbed bars, embedded in cubes of normal- and high-strength concrete with a concrete cover of 4. 5 times the bar diameter, were carried out {{in order to better}} understand the influence of the relative rib area and bar diameter on the local bond behaviour, {{as well as on the}} splitting crack width generated by the wedging action of ribs. A total of 96 tests were performed on machined bars of three different diameters (12, 16 and 20 mm) with a bond index ranging from 0. 040 to 0. 105. The results of 55 pull-out tests on commercial hot-rolled ribbed bars of four different diameters (12, 20, 40 and 50 mm) are also presented to confirm that the bond response also depends on bar diameter (size effect). Experimental results provide information concerning the influence of the relative rib area on bond strength and on the <b>bursting</b> <b>force</b> due to the rib’s wedge action. As the minimum measured bond strength of rebars was always markedly greater than the minimum bond strength required by building codes even when low bond indexes were adopted, the test results point out the possibility of reducing the minimum value of the relative rib area required by Eurocode 2 without limiting the safety coefficient of bond. The reduction also allows a higher structural ductility that can be achieved due to a greater strain penetration of the rebars from concrete cracks...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{puncture}} {{and burst}} properties of short-fiber reinforced polychloroprene rubber {{under various conditions}} were investigated to yield the best mechanical properties. In addition to five types of interphase conditions, four types of fiber aspect ratios (AR: length of fiber/diameter of fiber) and three different fiber contents were studied for their roles in the puncture and burst properties of rubber products.

Since both testing methods measure biaxial properties of reinforced rubber, {{the relation between the}} two properties is studied. The discrepancy between regressed puncture and <b>burst</b> <b>force</b> is explained based upon the rubber stiffness due to reinforcing parameters and the stress concentration upon sharp edge.

(1) An integrated and simplified shear design model has been developed. It {{has been found that}} the proposed model results in a much simpler design without sacrificing the shear capacity of the prestressed concrete members and without significantly impacting the cost. (2) For properly detailed prestressed concrete bridge I-beams, one can approach 0. 25 fc'bdv for maximum shear reinforcement. A key factor is the anchorage of the longitudinal reinforcement. (3) The horizontal wires of the orthogonal welded wire fabric {{have been found to be}} extremely effective to control shear cracking and increase the shear capacity. ^ Based on the strut-and-tie model analysis and eight 3. 1 m (10 ft) long NU- 1100 post-tensioned I-beams testing, the following conclusions are made on post-tensioned anchorage zone. (1) Two optimized anchorage zone details have been developed. The reduced tapered anchorage zone details are recommended to be used for all sizes of the NU I-beams. (2) Modification of the current available I-beam forms is not needed except an additional small form of about 1. 0 m (3. 3 ft) long. (3) Reinforcement in the anchorage zone is designed to resist post-tensioning <b>bursting</b> <b>force</b> in combination with vertical shear. ^ Based on the analysis and three 12. 2 m (40 ft) long NU- 1100 I-beams with 203 mm (8. 0 in.) deck slab testing, the following conclusions are made on beam continuity for negative moment. (1) Making the beams continuous before casting the deck can increase the span capacity and help increasing the composite action between the deck slab and the beam. (2) The continuity method using Grade 634 MPa (92 ksi) threaded rods has been developed. The developed connection details have performed well and are recommended as a standard non-prestressing beam continuity method.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{hydraulics}} and stability of "flowthrough" rockfill embankments. This thesis provides new information in the following seven areas: (1) A multi-disciplinary consideration {{of most of the}} available equations describing one-dimensional non-Darcy flow. Such flow is characterized by a non-linear dependence of velocity on the hydraulic gradient. New data is presented to assist in the evaluation of the effect of particle irregularity, as compared to perfect spheres. (2) A new computational method to estimate the quantity of flow moving through a rockfill embankment, {{as a function of the}} upstream water level, is presented. (3) If some minimum upstream water level is required, an impermeable element (in the form of a wall-like hydraulic barrier) will be needed. The hydraulics of an upstream impermeable facing (UIF) was studied in this research program. Some guidance is presented as to how to account for the effect of an elevated downstream water level on the stage-discharge rating curve of a flowthrough rockfill embankment. (4) Three distinct analytical methods for computing the position of the phreatic line are presented and evaluated. The validity of the Dupuit assumption, which is inherent in all three of the analytic methods, is also discussed. (5) A detailed computational framework is presented to make possible the prediction of the minimum elevation over which mesh protection is needed to prevent erosion of the downstream face of the dam. (6) The possibility of massive deep-seated failure was investigated in detail. As a first step to permit such evaluations, non-Darcy pore-pressure modelling was performed. An efficient method for executing such modelling on an electronic spreadsheet is presented. In an innovative series of experiments it was found that the measured <b>bursting</b> <b>force</b> at incipient failure was far closer to that theoretically predicted by the wedge method than that predicted by a classical rotational slip-circle method (Bishop's Simplified Method). (7) In another innovative series of experiments, this low-temperature behaviour was investigated using the Low Temperature Laboratory of the National Research Council of Canada. Based on this research a simple method for estimating the rate of growth of ice at the phreatic surface is presented. Ice was not observed to form in the voids within the body of the dam, except in one case in a small mixing zone (the base of Parkin's zone 3) below the lip of the UIF. A detailed theoretical framework for performing heat budget calculations is also presented, together with a short computer program to facilitate these calculations. It is quantitatively demonstrated that the viscous dissipation of hydraulic energy plays an important role in preventing ice formation in the voids. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to develop a}} new type of liquid-core {{capsules}} obtained by co-extrusion using the laminar jet break-up technique. These capsules, composed of an organic phase as the core and a hydrogel membrane, were meant to be applied as an in-situ product recovery technique for hydrophobic products and therefore required a fast mass transfer rate. Furthermore capsules had to be highly resistant to chelating agents, thermal sterilization process and mechanical stirring. The first part of the thesis was devoted to improvement of the mechanical stability of calcium alginate liquid-core capsules. A covalent structure could be added to the ionic calcium alginate membrane of the capsule. Acrylamide, methylene-bis-acrylamide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide were mixed with the sodium alginate solution and co-extruded with dibutyl sebacate into a gelling bath composed of 8 % calcium alginate and sodium pyrosulfite. Capsules with a cross-linker versus monomer ratio of 5 % were found to have the highest elasticity and <b>bursting</b> <b>force</b> after treatment with a citrate solution. Capsules were shown to be stable in the range of pH 4 to 9 and resistant to a sterilization process at 121 °C. The first application of these reinforced capsules was their use as an in situ product recovery technique for pesticide removal from water. Atrazine, ethyl parathion, methyl parathion and 2, 4 D were chosen as examples of pesticides and their mass transfer towards the capsules under different conditions was studied. This revealed that the main resistance was found in the stagnant organic phase within the liquid-core capsules, rather than through the bulk (well mixed) fluid or capsule membrane. In order to recycle the capsules, extracted pesticide was biodegraded by a specific bacteria. The experiments were performed in shake flasks, where the capsules filled with atrazine were suspended in a medium free of nitrogen and with citric acid as the carbon source. Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP was found to degrade atrazine as sole nitrogen source. By using the liquid-core capsules as a reservoir for the nitrogen source, high concentrations of pesticide could be degraded in the absence of inhibition as opposed to when pure aqueous systems were used. In addition, the results have shown that the immobilization of the organic phase could protect the cells from phase toxicity caused by dibutyl sebacate. The second application of liquid-core capsules was their use as reactive perstraction system for lipase catalyzed reactions. Candida rugosa lipase was immobilized by covalent attachment or by adsorption on the capsules membrane. Hydrolysis of tripropionin and nitrophenyl laurate could be performed with this immobilized lipase and the system could easily be recycled for repeated uses. In the case of nitrophenyl laurate hydrolysis, nitrophenol and lauric acid were the products of the reaction. Combined with the reaction, lauric acid was extracted directly by the organic liquid-core while nitrophenol was released into the aqueous phase thereby reducing inhibition of the enzymatic activity. The hydrolysis of penicillin G by penicillin acylase was the second enzyme catalyzed reaction chosen as a model to demonstrate the feasibility to use liquid-core capsules as a reactive perstraction system. The reaction was performed at pH 3. 5, where phenyl acetic acid, one of the two products of the reaction, was partially extracted by the liquid-core capsules. The second product of the reaction, 6 -aminopenicillanic acid, was released into the aqueous phase. The system, composed of immobilized penicillin acylase on liquid-core capsules, was successfully recycled up to five times by back extracting the phenyl acetic acid with an alkaline solution. However, the extraction efficiency of this system in stirred tank reactors was limited by the important water content of the liquid-core capsule membrane. Therefore the latter were packed in a column in order to obtain a chromatographic reactor. This set-up allowed the simultaneous reaction and separation of the products throughout the column. Parameters such as flow rate and column height were shown to greatly influence the product separation and reaction yield. Further improvement in this field could be by the use of a simulating moving bed chromatographic reactor...|$|E

Additionally, the temperature in the 20 – 50  m depth layer on 12 December (Fig. 6 a) was mixed at approximately 29.6  °C, and such conditions were potentially favorable for drastic IL deepening. That is, before the IL deepening, there was a potential condition of the mixed temperature just below the surface halocline, and the temperature stratification existed only near the surface above 20  m depth. After losing heat to the atmosphere near the surface, the temperature stratification near the surface disappeared, and the ILD value drastically increased. However, because the salinity stratification in the IL remained, the ML deepening showed a 1 -day lag with the IL deepening.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{angles of}} repose and {{internal}} friction are important parameters which determine the flow characteristics of agricultural granular materials, such as flour, maize, beans, wheat, sor-ghum and rice. The angles {{have a big}} influence on the design offlow and storage structures of agricultural materials such as hoppers, silos, bunkers and bins because they determine whether the flow will be smooth or not, and whether the <b>bursting</b> <b>forces</b> in relation to vertical forces will be great or not. An apparatus for determination of the angle of repose was specifi-cally designed for the purpose. The a'ngles of repose for three different grains, namely maize, sorghulll and rice at four moisture content levels, namely 10, 15, 20 and 25 %wb were deter-mined using the designed apparatus. A tri-axial compression machine {{was used to determine}} the angles of internal friction for the same grains and same moisture contents. The data ob-tained were fed into SAS statistical software for step-wise regression analysis. A model of the form r = 22. 35 + 0. 013 2; + 0. 019 [MC] 2 where r = the angle of repose, 1 = angle of intemlilfriction and MC = percent moisture content on wet basis was established, and used to predict the angleofreposefor the tested grains ~ith high accuracy (R 2 = 0. 97). It was concluded that the angle of repose was consistently higher than the angle of internal friction for all the granular materials tested, and the angle of internal friction was highest for maize, followed by rice and finally sorghum...|$|R
5|$|Continuing {{from the}} {{previous}} episode, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) hold each other at gunpoint. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), the person lingering outside his apartment, <b>bursts</b> in and <b>forces</b> Skinner to put his gun down. He also demands that Skinner surrender the digital tape. Skinner insists on keeping the tape, saying it is their only leverage in exposing the conspiracy.|$|R
