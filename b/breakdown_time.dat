40|$|A simple random {{ionization}} path length model {{is used to}} investigate the breakdown probabilities and jitter in single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) with submicron multiplication widths. The simulation results show that increasing the multiplication width may not necessarily increase the breakdown probability relative to the breakdown voltage, as the effect of dead space becomes more dominant in thinner multiplication regions at realistic ionization threshold energies for GaAs. On the other hand, reducing the multiplication width results in smaller <b>breakdown</b> <b>time</b> and jitter, despite the increased dead space. The effect of dead space in degrading <b>breakdown</b> <b>time</b> and jitter is relatively weak and further compensated by the stronger influence of large feedback ionization at high fields. Thus, SPAD designs that can minimize the dark count rate may potentially benefit from enhanced breakdown probability, <b>breakdown</b> <b>time,</b> and jitter by reducing {{the thickness of the}} multiplication region.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that a {{trade-off}} exists between estimates of the breakdown strength drop and the critical slip-weakening distance (e. g., Guatteri and Spudich, 2000). For this reason, only the fracture energy, proportional to these two parameters, may be estimated from waveform modeling. However, Mikumo et al. (2003) proposed a new technique to estimate the slip-weakening distance of earthquakes, separate from the fracture energy. For this method to be valid, the peak slip-velocity time must be close to the stress <b>breakdown</b> <b>time.</b> Here we explain the theoretical background of this assumption and clarify the limitations of this technique using numerical simulations based on the boundary integral equation method.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{frequency}} on the <b>breakdown</b> <b>time</b> in a straight discharge tube is investigated {{by means of a}} fluid model. The discharge tube is similar to a compact fluorescent lamp tube, contg. argon at 3 Torr and mercury at a few Torr. The mechanism of breakdown at frequencies of the order of several 10 kHz is considered and related to breakdown at a dc voltage. During a neg. potential on the powered electrode, an ionization wave traverses the tube in a way similar to that in a dc operated tube. During a pos. potential on the powered electrode, the elec. field in the part of the tube already traversed by the ionization wave is enhanced by neg. charge on the inner wall of the tube. Although the ionized region does not extend during this phase, the ionization d. increases substantially. Furthermore, we investigated the dependence of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>time</b> on the applied frequency and found that the breakdown voltage is independent of the frequency.

40|$|Abstract. The {{homogeneous}} {{gas phase}} models of relaxation kinetics (application {{of the gas}} phase effective coefficients to represent surface losses) are applied {{for the study of}} charged and neutral active particles decay in neon afterglow. The experimental data obtained by the <b>breakdown</b> <b>time</b> delay measurements {{as a function of the}} relaxation time t d (τ) (memory curve) is modeled in early, as well as in late afterglow. The number density decay of metastable states can explain neither the early, nor the late afterglow kinetics (memory effect), because their effective lifetimes are of the order of milliseconds and are determined by numerous collision quenching processes. The afterglow kinetics up to hundreds of milliseconds is dominated by the decay of molecular neon Ne 2 and nitrogen ions N 2 (present as impurities) and the approximate value of N 2 ambipolar diffusion coefficient is determined. After the charged particle decay, the secondary emitted electrons from the surface catalyzed excitation of nitrogen atoms on the cathode determine the <b>breakdown</b> <b>time</b> delay down to the cosmic rays and natural radioactivity level. Due to the neglecting of number density spatial profiles, the homogeneous gas phase models give only the approximate values of the corresponding coefficients, but reproduce correctly other characteristics of afterglow kinetics from simple fits to the experimental data...|$|E

The light is most effective when it is applied at the position near the high-voltage electrode. Besides, the tube material and size are important for enhancing the effect.
