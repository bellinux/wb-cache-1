5|$|In {{the letter}} column of Kill or Be Killed #12 (September 2017), Brubaker {{mentioned}} {{plans for a}} semi-sequel to The Fade Out. He said that if made, the comic <b>book</b> <b>would</b> share the setting {{and some of the}} supporting characters, but the plot would be unrelated.|$|E
5|$|After Wallis had {{finished}} the initial manuscript for The Road to Total Freedom, he provided representatives of Scientology leadership with a copy. Wallis negotiated with the Scientology leaders, and it was agreed upon that certain sections of the <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be edited. In total, approximately 100 sections of the book were edited due to input from Scientology leaders. This fact was not made public {{at the time of}} the book's publication.|$|E
5|$|Brisingr is {{the third}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. It was {{released}} on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to conclude the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex to conclude in one book, because the single <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be close to 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Convinced the <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be popular, Jewett {{made the}} unusual {{decision}} (for the time) to have six full-page illustrations by Hammatt Billings engraved {{for the first}} printing. Published in book form on March 20, 1852, the novel sold 3,000 copies on that day alone, and soon sold out its complete print run. A number of other editions were soon printed (including a deluxe edition in 1853, featuring 117 illustrations by Billings).|$|E
5|$|The {{title is}} {{a play on}} the Michael M. Lewis book Moneyball, which {{examines}} the 2002 Oakland Athletics' use of sabermetrics to build a competitive baseball team; the <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be made into an Oscar nominated film in 2011, the year after this episode aired. Moe laments his decision to advertise his drink specials in Scientific American magazine, which led to Frink and company coming in.|$|E
5|$|This book's target {{audience}} {{is not the}} common consumer of pig meat, but the grocer who would sell the products to the masses. The goal of the book was {{to aid in the}} proper handling, selling and profiting from the business of selling pork. Furthermore, Nicholls noted that this <b>book</b> <b>would</b> come to fill a need for the students who would be taking the Institute of Certificated Grocer exams.|$|E

5|$|An Introduction was {{reviewed}} positively in several academic publications. The political philosopher Steve Cooke said that Cochrane's own approach showed promise, {{and that the}} <b>book</b> <b>would</b> have benefited from devoting more space to it. Robert Garner, a political theorist, praised Cochrane's synthesis of such {{a broad range of}} literature, but argued that the work was too uncritical of the concept of justice as it might apply to animals. Cochrane's account of interest-based rights for animals was subsequently considered at greater length in his 2012 book Animal Rights Without Liberation, published by Columbia University Press. An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory {{was one of the first}} books to explore animals from the perspective of political theory, and became an established part of a literature critical of the topic's traditional neglect.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his <b>book</b> <b>would</b> have been impossible without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, Rowling parted {{company with}} her agent, Christopher Little, {{moving to a}} new agency founded {{by one of his}} staff, Neil Blair. On 23 February 2012, his agency, the Blair Partnership, {{announced}} on its website that Rowling was set to publish a new book targeted at adults. In a press release, Rowling said that her new <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be quite different from Harry Potter. In April 2012, Little, Brown and Company announced that the book was titled The Casual Vacancy and would be released on 27 September 2012. Rowling gave several interviews and made appearances to promote The Casual Vacancy, including at the London Southbank Centre, the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Charlie Rose and the Lennoxlove Book Festival. In its first three weeks of release, The Casual Vacancy sold over 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Littell {{thought that}} his <b>book</b> <b>would</b> sell around {{three to five}} {{thousand}} copies. Éditions Gallimard, his publishing house, was more optimistic and decided to print 12,000 copies. Word of mouth and the enthusiastic reviews soon catapulted sales {{to such an extent}} that Gallimard had to stop publishing the latest Harry Potter novel in order to meet the demand for The Kindly Ones, which ended up selling more than 700,000 copies in France by the end of 2007. Littell was finally given French citizenship.|$|E
5|$|Morton and {{his colleagues}} {{anticipated}} that copies of the new <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be prepared quickly. However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned {{from a trip to}} Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E
5|$|Other promotional campaigns {{included}} introducing bound {{versions of}} {{the first chapter of}} the novel, across city bookstores. Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the <b>book</b> <b>would</b> do wonders for its promotion. Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the publishing world like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar. Ultimately, when Tripathi's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5,000 copies of the book himself, they already had the celebrity preview attached to it, and it helped in promotion. The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy, including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from Red Ink Literary Agency. The <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be released in the United States in summer 2013. In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that an original soundtrack was made for a book series.|$|E

The announcement also promised that any reprints of the already released Macross and Masters <b>books</b> <b>would</b> be in the traditional size. In August 2013, the Macross Saga sourcebook was reprinted in full size. The Masters Saga was unavailable in the larger format until the summer of 2016.|$|R
5000|$|She quickly {{decided that}} she wanted to write romantic {{adventure}} novels. Unlike the style of romance novels, her <b>books</b> <b>would</b> be told in first person narrative. Her new type of writing should contain heroes and heroines, as well as [...] "a sense of family and community." [...] In that vein, she intended her new style of writing {{to be based on the}} TV sitcom model. Like Seinfeld, her new <b>books</b> <b>would</b> have a central character that the rest of the cast of characters revolve around.|$|R
5|$|Potter {{had long}} wanted {{to develop a}} book of nursery rhymes, but such a project left Warne cold. Rhymes were already well {{represented}} in the firm's catalogue, and Warne felt Potter's unbridled enthusiasm for the genre would make the project a headache for him. In the past, {{he had tried to}} discourage Potter's interest in rhymes, believing her own stories superior, but she persisted. He reluctantly agreed to a book of rhymes for 1905, but Potter did not have it ready at the end of 1904, so he accepted the tea party tale instead. Early in 1905, it was decided the <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be published {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Since Juster did {{the cooking}} for the housemates, if Feiffer wanted to eat, {{he had to}} do the drawings. Feiffer quickly {{realized}} the <b>book</b> <b>would</b> require illustrations of the type and quality that John Tenniel had created for Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and although a nationally-known artist, doubted his competence to do the text justice. Feiffer considers the double-spread illustration of demons late in the book to be a success and one of his favorites. It differs from his usual style (which would involve a white background), and instead uses Gustave Doré's drawings as an inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter. It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1905. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is a hedgehog washerwoman who lives in a tiny cottage in the fells of the Lake District. A child named Lucie happens upon the cottage and stays for tea. The two deliver freshly laundered clothing to the animals and birds in the neighbourhood. Potter thought the <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be best enjoyed by girls, and, like most girls' books of the period, it is set indoors with a focus on housework.|$|E

5|$|Tripathi had {{confirmed}} in September 2011 {{that he was}} writing The Oath of the Vayuputras, with Westland announcing the release date as 27 February 2013. The book was longer than the previous installments of the series and Tripathi clarified that all the loose ends {{left out in the}} previous <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be addressed, with the death of certain characters. Following the release of the cover art, it was announced that the publication rights of the books have been bought by both US and UK publisher houses. Like The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas, the book contained innovative marketing techniques, including launching interactive apps, merchandise and a music album titled Vayuputras, containing music inspired by different events in the series.|$|E
5|$|As his musings {{developed}} {{along these}} lines, Hazlitt continued to contribute miscellaneous articles to various periodicals. In February 1816, he reviewed August Wilhelm Schlegel's Lectures on Dramatic Literature for the Edinburgh Review. The German critic Schlegel showed {{an appreciation for}} Shakespeare of a kind {{that no one in}} Hazlitt's country had yet demonstrated, and Hazlitt, sympathising with many of Schlegel's ideas, felt there was a place for a whole book that would provide appreciative criticism of all of Shakespeare's plays. Such a <b>book</b> <b>would</b> provide liberal quotations from the text, and focus on the characters and various qualities particular to each play; and he felt that he could write it. His writing career was now moving in this direction (he had been contributing miscellaneous literary criticism to the Examiner and elsewhere during this period), he needed the money to support his family, and his growing reputation as a drama critic enabled him to have his name appear on the title page (as a reviewer for periodicals, his contributions were anonymous, as was customary at the time).|$|E
5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun if he had any time to spare, and a <b>book</b> <b>would</b> be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E
