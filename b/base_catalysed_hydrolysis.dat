In this research, the chemistry of the mycalamides was explored and structure-activity relationships were determined, with the overall objective of producing analogues with better, or more selective biological activities. Along with this, the conformational behaviour of the mycalamides and a related compound, pederin, was examined. Simple esters, silyl and alkyl ethers of the hydroxyl and amide functionalities were prepared during initial studies. While many of these proved to be inactive, they were still useful as protected intermediates for use in acid and <b>base</b> <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> reactions.

A {{series of}} {{phosphate}} esters containing the E. -nitrophenyl moiety as a leaving group were synthesised and their <b>base</b> <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> and electron impact-induced fragmentations studied. Heterocyclic ester substituents {{were present in}} some of the substrates and in-this sense they were considered as models for a nucleotide molecule containing both the 11 energy-rich 11 phosphate bond and the nitrogen heterocyclic ring. The relative reactivity of the phosphorus-E,-nitrophenoxide bond was taken as a probe for nitrogen (pyridyl or quinolyl) participation in the substitution reaction. Although the heterocyclic derivatives show that the introduction of the nitrogen centre increases the rate of <b>base</b> <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis,</b> the reactivity enhancement is. not significant and results probably from polar effects rather than from intra-molecular catalysis. A comparison of the mass spectra of the heterocyclic and carbocyclic analogues, reveal differences which are significant (in the pyridyl substrates) and dramatic (in the quinolyl substrate) with regard to the fragmentation involving the E. -nitrophenoxy radical expulsion and formation of the corresponding phosphorylium ion. Synthetic approaches towards dimethylaryl and dimethyl(arylalkyl) phosphates are discussed. Nucleophilic displacement at the methyl ester carbon, and in particular the oxygen+ nitrogen methyl group transfer in these substrates occurs readily, complicating the synthetic procedures and lowering the stability of products. Dimethyl-(2 -pyridylmethyl) phosphate isomerises in water to the zwitterionic N-methylpyridinium derivative via bimolecular methylation. The kinetics of the reaction were studied and no evidence for intra-molecular methyl transfer was obtained. - ii - The isomerisation of dimethyl-(quinolin- 8 -yl) phosphate in water also provides evidence for the bimolecular methylation. The crystal and molecular structure of dimethyl-(quinolin- 8 -yl) phosphate was determined and has revealed that the orientation of the CH 3 groups in the crystal provide no indication for the occurrence of methyl transfer in the solid state. The dynamics of the prepared phosphate derivatives studied in solutions were also investigated by means of mass spectrometry. Fragmentation patterns and their relative contributions are presented and discussed. The effect of solvent on the rates of the reaction between trimethyl phosphate and i) pyridine and ii) 4 -(dimethylamino) pyridine, was studied at 25 - 65 °C using NMR techniques. The solvents used were DzO, CD 30 D, CD 3 CN and DzO/CD 30 D and DzO/CD 3 CN mixtures. Water (DzO) is the most effective medium for the methyl transfer reaction. We attribute this to the strong hydrogen bonding between water and the departing dimethyl phosphate anion in the transition state. Activation parameters obtained for the reactions in pure solvents confirmed our interpretation of the hydrogen bonding effect operating in the transition state. Fragmentation of S-arylethyl phosphates has been investigated. A novel feature is exhibited by S-arylethyl phosphorochloridates.

40|$|The amidase from Geobacillus pallidus RAPc 8, a {{moderate}} thermophile, {{is a member}} of the nitrilase superfamily and catalyzes the conversion of amides to the corresponding carboxylic acids and ammonia. It shows both amide-hydrolysis and acyl-transfer activities and also exhibits stereoselectivity for some enantiomeric substrates, thus making it a potentially important industrial catalyst. The crystal structure of G. pallidus RAPc 8 amidase at a resolution of 1. 9 A ˚ was solved by molecular replacement from a crystal belonging to the primitive cubic space group P 4232. G. pallidus RAPc 8 amidase is homohexameric in solution and its monomers have the typical nitrilase-superfamily α-β-β-α fold. Association in the hexamer preserves the eight-layered α-β-β-α:α-β-β-α structure across an interface which is conserved in the known members of the superfamily. The extended carboxy-terminal tail contributes to this conserved interface by interlocking the monomers. Analysis of the small active site of the G. pallidus RAPc 8 amidase suggests that access of a water molecule to the catalytic triad (Cys, Glu, Lys) side chains would be impeded by the formation of the acyl intermediate. It is proposed that another active-site residue, Glu 142, the position of which is conserved in the homologues, acts as a general <b>base</b> to <b>catalyse</b> the <b>hydrolysis</b> of this intermediate.

A radiochemical technique {{has been used to}} make a kinetic study of the solvolysis reactions of triphenylsilyl alkoxides. The compounds were prepared with the alkoxy group labelled with tritium. The rates of replacement of the alkoxy group, and thus the rates of solvolysis, were determined by withdrawing aliquots at intervals from the reaction mixtures, extracting the silicon compounds and measuring the radioactivity with a liquid photoscintillation counter. The hydrolysis of triphenylsilyl methoxides and isopropoxides in acetone/water and the methanolysis of the methoxides, a symmetrical exchange reaction, have been studied, with acidic and basic catalysts {{and in the absence of}} catalyst. Satisfactory results were obtained except in two cases, the <b>base</b> <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of the methoxides and the acid catalysed methanolysis of triphenylsilyl methoxide, which were greatly affected by impurities.

In general, acid is a more effective catalyst than base. The relative rates of reaction of the trisubstituted triphenylsilyl alkoxides do not satisfy the show Hammett relationship, but the results show there is a tendency for the electron supplying substituents to retard the reaction in all cases.

The structure of (Co$ sb 2 $(bpmp) ($ mu$-DPPO 2) ($ mu$-O$ sb 2 $)) (ClO$ sb 4) sb 2 $ contains a diphenylphosphinate and a peroxide bridged between two cobalt(III) centers. Interestingly one of the oxygen atoms of the peroxide is only about 2. 8 A away from the phosphorus of the coordinated phosphinate. When the bridging phosphinate is replaced with methyl phenylphosphonate (Co$ sb 2 $(bpmp) ($ mu$-MPPO 3) ($ mu$-O$ sb 2 $)) (ClO$ sb 4) sb 2 $, the ester bond is cleaved in aqueous DMSO (2 : 1 DMSO-d 6 /D$ sb 2 $O). The pseudo-first order rate constant for the cleavage of the methyl phenylphosphonate monoester bond in the complex is 5. 3 x 10 $ sp{- 7 }$ s$ sp{- 1 }$ at pH 7 (t$ sb{ 1 / 2 }$ = 15 days) at 20 $ sp circ$C. The estimated rate of <b>base</b> <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of the phosphonate is 1. 4 $ times$ 10 $ sp{- 11 }$M$ sp{- 1 }$s$ sp{- 1 }$ so that ca. 10 $ sp{ 11 }$ fold rate enhancement is observed. The reactivity of dinuclear cobalt(III) complexes for cleaving phosphate diester in (Co$ sb 2 $(N 3) $ sb 2 (mu$-OH) $ sb 2 (mu$-PO$ sb 4 $R$ sb 2 $)) can be significantly increased by decreasing the O-Co-O bond angle in the intermediate or transition state which forms a four membered ring. This {{can be achieved by}} increasing the N-Co-N ligands side bond angle opposite the O-Co-O angle. In (Co$ sb 2 $((9) aneN 3) $ sb 2 (mu$-OH) $ sb 2 (mu$-MPNPP)), the nitrogens are connected by two carbons whereas in (Co$ sb 2 $(tame) $ sb 2 (mu$-OH) $ sb 2 (mu$-MPNPP)), where tame is 1, 1, 1 -tri(aminomethyl) ethane, the nitrogens are connected by three carbons. This results in a 10 fold increase in the reactivity for tame complex over (9) aneN 3 complex.

It was shown that the Blactamase I <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of n-alkyl penicillins of increasing chain length produced an increase inkcaVKm up to the octyl derivative. Despite this {{it is believed that}} the activesite of the B-lactamase I enzyme does not display a strong recognition for B-lactams containing a hydrophobic C 6 side-chain. It was found that the pH dependence for the enzyme <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of benzyl penicillin and benzyl cephalosporin did not decline as expected at low pH, but instead the rate levels off. The incorporation of a negatively charged group into the phenyl C 7 side chain of cephalosporins resulted in lower activity at pH 7 compared to that for benzyl cephalosporin, but at low pH much higher activity is seen: 2 -carboxyphenyl cephalosporin was 10 fold more reactive at pH 3 than at pH 7. The B-lactamase I <b>catalysed</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of phenyl substituted penicillins containing a negatively charged functional group in the phenyl side chain was more complex. 2 -Carboxyphenyl penicillin shows higher activity at low pH, while the 3, 4 - carboxyphenyl penicillin derivatives show a typical 'bell-shaped' profile, but with the pKa I value shifted up-field. This was further investigated by preparing the cis/trans isomers of 2 - carboxycyclohexyl penicillin and cephalosporin. It was found that the cis 2 - carboxycyclohexyl penicillin compound displayed high activity at low pH, while the trans compound did not. Neither of the corresponding cepbalosporin derivatives showed evidence of higher activity at low pH. The C 3 ester and C 3 alcohol of penicillins and the C 4 cephalosporin lactone were synthesised. The penicillin alcohol and the cephalosporin lactone were found to be 'good' substrates for the B-lactamase I enzyme and produced 'normal' pH-rate profiles. It was found that with the B-lactamase 2 enzyme hydrolysis of n-alkyl penicillins proceeded at comparable rates irrespective of the length of the C 6 side chain alkyl group, and that the enzyme hydrolysis rate at pH 7 was minimally affected by substituent changes in the C 6 /C 7 side chains of penicillin and cephalosporin but the behaviour was more complex when the negatively charged carboxyphenyl B-lactams were investigated.
