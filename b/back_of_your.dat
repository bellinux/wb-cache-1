[...] Nick Southall of Stylus magazine wrote: [...] "The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than a shrill ringing as is so often the case."

Grace remarked on the possible implications of Franchitti's success on the promotion of CART in the United Kingdom: [...] "If that doesn't sell this sport to Britain then I don't know what will." [...] Mike Nicks in The Observer called Franchitti's win [...] "the greatest of his career", while Jim McGill of Scotland on Sunday noted that while Formula One was promoted as the fastest and most glamorous motorsport, Franchitti's victory helped CART show it could deliver the most drama.

Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

500|$|The singer had to {{tone down}} some of the suggestive lyrics to please the {{officers}} at Disney, the producers of Dick Tracy, who were worried about their image. In Ireland, the song was subject to controversy after two women's organizations accused Madonna of glorifying violence against women, specifically on the line [...] "I'll settle for the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hand"; one of the groups, the National Women's Council of Ireland, labelled the song [...] "highly dangerous" [...] while the other group, Ireland's Women's Aid, said the line was [...] "extremely harmful". Although initially approving of the idea of [...] "getting spanked"—even admitting her fondness on The Arsenio Hall Show—Madonna later backed down from the theme of spanking, explaining that the lyrics were written as a joke and believed that it was instead her character Breathless Mahoney that liked to get spanked. She added that it should have been obvious that the song was humorous in nature, since Madonna believed her image was more of a dominant person who took charge, contrary to the song's characterization.|$|E

Double Dash also received a perfect score from GamePro, who commented that the gameplay remains [...] "fast and furious". The feature of having two riders per kart was praised by Justin Leeper and Andy McNamara of Game Informer; McNamara stated: [...] "Giving the player control of two different characters is pretty cool in single-player, but add a friend on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kart in multiplayer and it opens the game up like never before." [...] GameSpy called Double Dash!! a [...] "great-looking, great-playing game that most gamers will instantly warm to."

And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every hair on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else."

It is a pop rock song, which contains influences of other genres including country, disco, funk, and house. According to Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times, classifying the genre of the song is difficult, as it combines [...] "tinny Euro-house synths, slowed-down funk drums and a boot-scooting bass line straight out of Nashville."

In other eras {{she might have been}} a pop torch singer, a soul belter or a new-wave frontwoman: a Shirley Bassey, a Dusty Springfield, or a Chrissie Hynde. There's a little of each of them in her voice" [...] also stating [...] "In the course of each song she let her voice rise in anger, contempt or passion". Jen Crothers of Green Left Weekly, in a review of Garbage, remarked that [...] "Manson, vocalist and guitarist, has a powerful voice, which soars and dips like a bird. It can plead or demand. It can sound dreamy or psychotic." [...] Reviewing a 2012 live Garbage performance, Catherine Gee of The Daily Telegraph noted that Manson [...] "remains a striking performer whose distinctive contralto snarl can still raise the hairs on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck." [...] In a review of Garbage, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described Manson's voice as [...] "thin and airy", whilst Mike Diver of the BBC stated Manson owned [...] "a snarl in her voice but [...] equally capable of a purr to melt away any resistance." [...] also adding [...] "even at her most vulnerable, Manson maintains her controlling condition".|$|E
2500|$|The Rapture {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Melody Maker hailed the record at its release and wrote: [...] "The Rapture is a fascinating, transcontinental journey through danger and exotica". Describing the arrangements, they added, [...] "it's a vivid cornucopia of lush instrumentation, mandolins vying with cellos and bells, sweeping strings describing starlit oceans and sirens calling from jagged rocks, and attics that hide secret worlds". Steve Malins of Vox {{also liked the}} album. He said, [...] "The title-track is a sublime melodrama recalling the experimentation of Peepshow and 1982's Kiss in the Dreamhouse", [...] before concluding with this sentence, [...] "The Rapture represents an intelligent twist on familiar Banshees obsessions". Liz Buckley of Sun Zoom Spark also praised it, writing, [...] "How is a band that first formed almost two decades ago able to remain both vital and celebrated? Answer: Metamorphosis". Buckley also declared that [...] "the album is able to excite the hairs on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck". Select gave it a 4-star rating, hailing the band as [...] "purveyors of scary pop par excellence". Matt Hall noted {{the ability of the}} group for [...] "trotting out jolly tunes about mental breakdown, love bordering on obsession and severely dislocated relationships." [...] The reviewer characterized The Rapture as a [...] "fine little Russian doll of a record", and said, [...] "Under the keyboard lines, swelling strings and OTT percussion, at the centre of every song is a nugget of disquiet that keeps you listening again and again".|$|E
2500|$|The band {{returned}} to Rock's Plantation Studios in Hawaii in May 2003 {{to begin the}} first recording sessions for the album. Their intention was to record an album even more simplified than Gravity and even closer in sound to what they sounded like live, an overall different record. [...] "I think we all knew going into it {{that it was an}} important record for us," [...] said Duncan Coutts. [...] "I think that when you get more than ten years into a band, It has to be a rebirth for us. We didn't want to go and remake any of our past records." [...] In one month, they recorded 12 songs live off the floor, most in two or three takes each. Following these sessions, several of the songs including [...] "Walking in Circles", [...] "No Warning" [...] and [...] "Wipe That Smile Off your Face" [...] were premiered live. After touring concluded for the year, the band was set to finish the album that October in time for a January 2004 release. While satisfied with the recorded material at first, with time the band became more critical of it and decided they would only be demos. They felt strongly about the songs [...] "Picture", [...] "Will the Future Blame Us?" [...] and [...] "Angels/Losing/Sleep" [...] but felt {{that the rest of the}} songs didn't live up to them. [...] "Even though we loved the energy of what we'd done, not enough of the songs were making the hair stand up on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> neck and so we realized that we needed to do more work," [...] bass player Duncan Coutts explained. They decided to postpone the album's release until June and then August to continue recording.|$|E
