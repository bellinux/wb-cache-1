25|$|Because {{of these}} {{differences}} in the building blocks, some <b>block</b> <b>copolymer</b> micelles behave like surfactant ones, while others don't. It is necessary therefore {{to make a distinction}} between the two situations. The former ones will belong to the dynamic micelles while the latter will be called kinetically frozen micelles.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} general types of polypropylene: homopolymer, random copolymer, and <b>block</b> <b>copolymer.</b> The {{comonomer}} is typically used with ethylene. Ethylene-propylene rubber or EPDM added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low temperature impact strength. Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point {{and makes the}} polymer more transparent.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} living radical {{polymerization}} techniques, RAFT allows chain extension of a polymer of one monomer {{with a second}} type of polymer to yield a <b>block</b> <b>copolymer.</b> In such a polymerisation, there is the additional challenge that the RAFT agent for the first monomer must also be suitable for the second monomer, making block copolymerisation of monomers of highly disparate character challenging.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} a series {{ethylene}} oxide–propylene oxide <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> upon the physical properties of a sandy soil has been investigated. Specifically the impact upon the saturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention and water imbibition was examined. It was shown that soils exposed to aqueous solutions containing these <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> have reduced hydraulic conductivities. It was concluded {{that this could be}} due to the dispersion of fine grained materials or through changes in pore size brought about by swelling. Imbibition into soils that had been exposed to the <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> was enhanced. However the effect of the <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> upon water retention was complex. These <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> are surface active and as such will reduce surface tension to some extent or another. This should result in reduced water retention. It was observed that some of the <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> investigated did lead to reduced water retention. However some actually increased water retention. It is proposed that this was due to the effect that the <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> have upon wetting...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of stimuli responsive polymers has progressed significantly with novel preparation techniques, which has allowed access to new materials with unique properties. Dual thermoresponsive (double temperature responsive) <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> are particularly of interest as their properties can change {{depending on the}} lower critical solution temperature (LCST) or upper critical solution temperature (UCST) of each segment. For instance, these <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> can change from being hydrophilic, to amphiphilic or to hydrophobic simply by changing the solution temperature without any additional chemicals and the <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> can change from being fully solubilized to self-assembled structures to macroscopic aggregation/precipitation. Based on the unique solution properties, these dual thermo-responsive <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> {{are expected to be}} suitable for biomedical applications.

30|$|<b>Block</b> <b>copolymers</b> create well-ordered {{structures}} by undergoing microphase separation. Their properties {{can also}} be controlled through manipulating the three critical parameters mentioned above. <b>Block</b> <b>copolymers</b> {{can be used to}} synthesise different nanostructures due to their fitting size and shape. Their properties are also easily tunable by simply changing the monomer used, their compositions and molecular weight. Using <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> for fabricating nanostructures is simple and affordable as well [34]. This section briefly focuses on synthesis of nanowires, nanorods, nanoribbons and nanofibers using <b>block</b> <b>copolymers.</b>|$|R
25|$|When <b>block</b> <b>copolymer</b> {{micelles}} don't {{display the}} characteristic relaxation processes of surfactant micelles, these are called kinetically frozen micelles. These {{can be achieved}} in two ways: when the unimers forming the micelles are not soluble in the solvent of the micelle solution, or if the core forming blocks are glassy at the temperature in which the micelles are found. Kinetically frozen micelles are formed when either of these conditions is met. A special example in which both of these conditions are valid is that of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide). This <b>block</b> <b>copolymer</b> {{is characterized by the}} high hydrophobicity of the core forming block, PS, which causes the unimers to be insoluble in water. Moreover, PS has a high glass transition temperature which is, depending on the molecular weight, higher than room temperature. Thanks to these two characteristics, a water solution of PS-PEO micelles of sufficiently high molecular weight can be considered kinetically frozen. This means that none of the relaxation processes, which would drive the micelle solution towards thermodynamic equilibrium, are possible. Pioneering work on these micelles was done by Adi Eisenberg. It was also shown how the lack of relaxation processes allowed great freedom in the possible morphologies formed. Moreover, the stability against dilution and vast range of morphologies of kinetically frozen micelles make them particularly interesting, for example, for the development of long circulating drug delivery nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|Pre-synthesized polymers, {{like the}} PDMEAMA/PTMSPMA <b>block</b> <b>copolymer,</b> can be immobilized on a surface (i.e. glass) by simply {{immersing}} {{the surface in}} an aqueous solution containing the polymer. For a process like this, grafting density depends on the concentration and molecular weight of the polymer {{as well as the}} amount time the surface was immersed in solution. As expected, an inverse relationship exists between grafting density and molecular weight. As the antimicrobial activity depends on the concentration of quaternary ammonium tethered to the surface, grafting density and molecular weight represent opposing factors that can be manipulated to achieve high efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{amphiphilic}} <b>block</b> <b>copolymer</b> micelles {{display a}} similar behavior as surfactant micelles. These are generally called dynamic micelles and {{are characterized by}} the same relaxation processes assigned to surfactant exchange and micelle scission/recombination. Although the relaxation processes are the same between {{the two types of}} micelles, the kinetics of unimer exchange are very different. While in surfactant systems the unimers leave and join the micelles through a diffusion-controlled process, for copolymers the entry rate constant is slower than a diffusion controlled process. The rate of this process was found to be a decreasing power-law of the degree of polymerization of the hydrophobic block to the power 2/3. This difference is due to the coiling of the hydrophobic block of a copolymer exiting the core of a micelle.|$|E

We have described two different classes of <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> with biofuctional properties.

40|$|<b>Block</b> <b>copolymers</b> {{have been}} of great {{interest}} to the scientific community {{for a number of years}} as they offer a route to control polymer morphology, via self- assembly, at a level that is very difficult to achieve by other means. Coil-coil <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> have been extensively investigated and the physical properties of these polymers. are reasonably well understood both experimentally and theoretically. Rod-coil <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> are <b>block</b> <b>copolymers</b> in which one of the blocks acts as a rigid rod.
