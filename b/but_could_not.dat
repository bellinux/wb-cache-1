5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify {{the course of the}} disease by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop. This gene produces prion protein, which is active in the brain and other tissues and also appears to be involved in transporting copper. A role for the ApoE gene was initially suspected <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Ban Joachim Gutkeled kidnapped Stephen's ten-year-old son and heir, Ladislaus {{and imprisoned}} {{him in the}} castle of Koprivnica {{in the summer of}} 1272. Stephen besieged the fortress, <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> capture it. Stephen fell ill and was taken to the Csepel Island. He died on 6 August 1272. Stephen was buried near to the tomb of his sister, Margaret, in the Monastery of the Blessed Virgin on Rabbits' Island.|$|E

They had {{initially}} been buried in her backyard by Rebecca Heggelund, Beth Israel's non-Jewish secretary, who first received them after their rescue, and were subsequently re-buried next to the grave of Beth Israel's gabbai Meyer Lachoff.

5|$|During May 1926, the {{approach}} road between Wentworth and {{the bridge was}} being progressively metalled, <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be completed in its entirety until construction of the bridge itself was complete.

5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E

5|$|Even at the 1.5m wavelength, antennas of {{practical}} size had relatively low gain and very poor resolution; the transmitter antenna created a fan-shaped signal over 90 degrees wide. This was not useful for homing on a target, so some system of direction indication was required. The team seriously considered phase comparison as a solution, <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find a suitable phase shifting circuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the ninth, Bottomley singled off Pennock <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> advance, {{giving the}} Yankees a 2–1 win in Game 1. Gehrig was their {{offensive}} star with both of his team's RBI. Pennock went the distance, striking out four and yielding but three hits, two in the first and one in the ninth. Hard-luck loser Sherdel gave up only two runs and six hits while striking out one.|$|E
5|$|Keeping the old {{systems and}} {{converting}} them to encrypted systems was also considered. This {{was estimated to}} cost NOK500 million to install, <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be guaranteed to work satisfactorily. In particular, encryption would delay communications, {{which would be a}} problem for urgent communications. It was also uncertain whether the level of encryption would be sufficient to allow the network to be considered closed and allow personal information to be transmitted.|$|E

5|$|Like most corvettes, Fredericton was {{installed}} with a Type 123A ASDIC detection system. This technology was designed in 1934 for armed trawlers and minesweepers of the Royal Navy. The system was outdated but {{was the best}} system available to the Canadian Navy at the time. Type 123A could detect the distance to underwater sounds <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> determine the depth.|$|E
5|$|Monitoring {{this from}} afar, and {{dissatisfied}} with Dohna's timidity in bringing Saltykov to battle, Frederick sent Carl Heinrich von Wedel to take command.

He wanted to attack the Russians at dawn the next day, <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> find an appropriately weak location in the Russian defenses.|$|E

5|$|Stephen IV {{attempted}} {{to regain his}} throne with Emperor Manuel I's support, but the latter made peace with Stephen III. He agreed to send his younger brother, Béla, to Constantinople and to allow the Byzantines to seize Béla's duchy, which included Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. In an attempt to recapture these territories, Stephen III waged wars against the Byzantine Empire between 1164 and 1167, <b>but</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> defeat the Byzantines.|$|E
