25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would <b>be</b> <b>dead</b> <b>by</b> morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

500|$|Orci and Kurtzman wrote a {{scene for}} Shatner, in which old Spock gives his younger self a {{recorded}} message by Kirk {{from the previous}} timeline. [...] "It was basically a Happy Birthday wish knowing that Spock {{was going to go}} off to Romulus, and Kirk would probably <b>be</b> <b>dead</b> <b>by</b> the time," [...] and it would have shifted into Shatner reciting [...] "Where no man has gone before". However, Shatner wanted to share Nimoy's major role, and did not want a cameo, despite his character's death in Star Trek Generations. He suggested the film canonize his novels where Kirk is resurrected, but Abrams decided if his character was accompanying Nimoy's, it would have become a film about the resurrection of Kirk, and not about introducing the new versions of the characters. Nimoy disliked the character's death in Generations, but also felt resurrecting Kirk would be detrimental to this film, and his friendship with Shatner caused them to avoid discussing the film.|$|E

2500|$|Percival enlisted on {{the first}} day of the war as a private in the Officer Training Corps of the Inns of Court, at the age of 26, and was {{promoted}} after five weeks' basic training to temporary second lieutenant.

[...] The following year he was dispatched to France with the newly formed 7th (Service) Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment, which became part of the 54th Brigade, 18th (Eastern) Division in February 1915. The first day of the Battle of the Somme (1 July 1916) left Percival unscathed, but in September he was badly wounded in four places by shrapnel, as he led his company in an assault on the Schwaben Redoubt, beyond the ruins of Thiepval village, and was awarded the Military Cross.|$|E
2500|$|Several other companions {{have died}} {{subsequent}} to their companionships.

Harry Sullivan's death was implied by Sarah Jane Smith {{when he was the}} only former companion of whom she spoke in the past-tense and she remarked that she loved him.

However, the fiftieth anniversary episode [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] reveals that the planet still exists in a separate pocket universe, leaving their fates uncertain. In 2050, Sarah Jane Smith is implied to <b>be</b> <b>dead</b> <b>by</b> Rani Chandra in [...] "The Mad Woman in the Attic". Vicki left the First Doctor circa 1250 BCE and passed into legend as Cressida.|$|E

2500|$|General Ralph Abercromby, the {{commander}} of the forces committed to the [...] "great push" [...] in the West Indies hesitated over which island to attack when he arrived in Barbados on 17 March 1796 before he dispatched a force under Major General Gordon Forbes to Port-au-Prince. Forbes's attempt to take the French-held city of Leogane ended in disaster as the French had built a deep ditch with palisades while Forbes had neglected to bring along heavy artillery. The French commander, the mulatto General Alexandre Pétion proved to be an excellent artilleryman, who used the guns of his fort to sink two of the three ships-of-line under Admiral Hyde Parker in the harbour, before turning his guns to the British forces; a French sortie led to a British rout and Forbes retreating back to Port-au-Prince. In the meantime, as more and more ships bringing troops committed to the [...] "great push" [...] arrived, more and more soldiers died of yellow fever. By 1 June 1796, of the 1, 000 from the Sixty-sixth regiment, only 198 had not been infected with yellow fever and of the 1, 000 men of the Sixth-ninth regiment, only 515 were not infected with yellow fever. Abercromby predicated that at the current rate of yellow fever infection, all of the men from the two regiments would <b>be</b> <b>dead</b> <b>by</b> November. Ultimately, 10, 000 British soldiers had arrived in Saint Domingue by June, but besides for some skirmishing near Bombarde, the British remained put in Port-au-Prince and other coastal enclaves while yellow fever continued to kill them all off. The government attracted much criticism about the mounting costs of the expedition to St. Domingue in the House of Commons, and in February 1797, General John Graves Simcoe arrived to replace Forbes with orders to pull back the British forces to Port-au-Prince. As the human and financial costs of the expedition mounted, more and more people in Britain demanded a withdrawal from St. Domingue, which was devouring money and soldiers while failing to produce the expected profits.|$|E
