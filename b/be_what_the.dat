The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E

McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; [...] "Cleveland Panthers" [...] was the winning choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an earlier failed football team. [...] "That old Panthers team failed", Brown said. [...] "I want no part of that name." [...] In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and christened the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections. With the roster fixed and the team's name chosen, Brown set out to build a dynasty.

500|$|The filmmakers {{thought the}} moral {{message of the}} {{original}} tale was inappropriate, and decided to [...] "put a spin on it" [...] by making the fulfillment of wishes seem like a great solution, but eventually becoming a problem. Another major theme was avoiding an attempt to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> person is not – both Aladdin and Jasmine get into trouble pretending to be different people, and the Prince Ali persona fails to impress Jasmine, who only falls for Aladdin when she finds out who he truly is. [...] Being [...] "imprisoned" [...] is also presented, a fate that occurs {{to most of the}} characters – Aladdin and Jasmine are limited by their lifestyles, Genie is attached to his lamp, and Jafar to the Sultan – and is represented visually by the prison-like walls and bars of the Agrabah palace, and the scene involving caged birds which Jasmine later frees. Jasmine is also depicted as a different Disney Princess, being rebellious against the royal life and the social structure, and trying to make her own way, unlike the princesses who just wait for rescue.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{raises questions}} about the range to which copyright law can extend. Alex Chapman of Campbell Hooper solicitors, stated [...] "The Church will have an uphill battle in a legal claim against Sony, and indeed it is likely that there is no basis for a claim." [...] He cited a provision in the UK's 1988 Copyright Designs and Patents act that [...] "explicitly states that it is not copyright infringement to represent certain artistic works that are on public display". This includes sculptures and buildings which are [...] "permanently situated in a public place or in premises open to the public". Chapman also pointed out that, in the UK, copyright expires 70 years after the person who created the work dies. He went on to say, [...] "What all this means is that public buildings are generally fair game for inclusion in video games, films et cetera, and it is something that their owners just have to accept. What isn't fair game, however, is if the building is presented in a way that could be said to be defamatory in relation to those associated with it and this might <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Church is more concerned about. Also if the representation of the building could be argued to have become so closely associated with a business that its representation amounts to a false endorsement of Sony or its products, or it is registered as a trademark, there may be issues. In each case however my impression is that the Church will have some difficulty in pursuing Sony. There is no law against insensitivity and as with many matters of this kind, it is the public reaction that might be more damaging than the legal one." [...] An unofficial review, by lawyers at Freeth Cartwright, of the rights that Sony might have infringed concluded that the Church of England did not have a case on either copyright or passing off grounds.|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 56 {{is part of}} the Fair Youth sonnets. [...] The sonnet's {{first line}} was {{inspired}} by George Whetstone's The Rocke of Regard (1576). [...] The sonnet is divided up into four quatrain, groups of four lines, and a couplet. [...] Sonnet 56 is puzzling because of its seemingly inappropriate placement next to Sonnet 55. In Sonnet 55, the poet's relationship with the young man is steady and secure, but here there is a sudden shift from confidence to deep insecurity. [...] In this sonnet the poet examines the [...] "quality of love." [...] It is not clear who's love is being addressed. [...] The poet's, [...] "his friend's, or that of both?" [...] The poet [...] "pleads for the love to be charged with fresh vigor." [...] At the same time, the poet suggests that a [...] "separation" [...] may <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> relationship needs in order to [...] "renew the intensity of their devotion." [...] It should noted that the identity of the [...] "Sweet love" [...] is not located in the poem and the ultimate fate of the relationship is left ambiguous.
