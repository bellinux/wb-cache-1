The discrete element method (DEM) was then used to model the interaction between the ballast and the geogrid by simulating large box pull-out tests and comparing the findings with the experimental results. Four different shapes of clumps were used to represent each ballast particle in order to obtain an acceptable shape for modelling the railway ballast. The DEM simulation results were shown to provide good predictions of the pull-out resistance and to examine the effect of clump shape on both the pull-out resistance and the distribution of contact forces. Therefore, the calibrated geogrid model and the 8 -ball tetrahedral clumps, used as ballast particles, hold much promise for investigating the interaction between geogrids and ballast, and thus, optimising performance...|$|R

A reinforced chassis also allows multiple tractors to be coupled together to maximize power and traction. Heavy-duty versions of commercial tractor units may be fitted with a <b>ballast</b> <b>box</b> and suitable drawgear, or a ballast tractor may be purpose-built. Ballast is placed above the driving axle, or spread out over multiple driving axles to maximize traction on each and evenly distribute its load.|$|E
40|$|Elastic {{elements}} such as rail pads, under sleeper pads and under ballast mats are railway components that allow for a reduction in track deterioration and vibrations. And they are furthermore commonly used to obtain an optimal vertical stiffness of the infrastructure. However, the use of elastomeric materials can increase construction costs and the consumption of raw materials. Thus, the utilization of used tire layers offers an alternative to reuse an abundant waste reducing the cost of elastic elements. In addition, an innovator technique allows deconstructing tire layers without grinding up the material, reducing production costs {{at the same time}} that tire properties are remained. This research is focused on the study of the viability of developing elastic components from used tire layers by evaluating the influence of thickness, the resistance capacity of the elements and their behavior in a <b>ballast</b> <b>box.</b> Results indicate the ability of tire pads to manufacture elastic elements (rail pads, under sleeper pads and under ballast mats) to be used in railway tracks...|$|E
40|$|Train {{speeds and}} heavy haul axle loads are {{constantly}} increasing the forces and stresses experienced by track structures. This {{is especially true}} for track transitions that generate high dynamic forces on both the track and vehicles as a result of differing track stiffness values {{on either side of the}} track transition. Reducing differential settlement between the two track structures at a track transition is one method of improving the life of the track and increasing maintenance intervals. Ballast attrition and breakdown at these track transition zones is also of major concern as ballast fouling can lead to reduced drainage performance of the ballast as well as a potential loss of strength as the ballast becomes increasingly fouled. In this study rigid polyurethane foam was used as a means to reinforce ballast. Various tests were conducted using a dynamic load hydraulic load frame in a large <b>ballast</b> <b>box</b> test at heavy haul axle loads. Unreinforced, reinforced and 50 % reinforced ballast layers of 300 mm depth were tested to approximately 5, 000, 000 load cycles. The results showed that rigid polyurethane foam reinforced ballast exhibited in the order of 60 % less settlement for a fully reinforced layer and 42 % less settlement for a half reinforced layer. The increase in layer stiffness with increasing load cycles was also observed for the reinforced ballast layers which is contrast with the decrease in layer stiffness for conventional unreinforced ballast. The use of rigid polyurethane foam (RPF) to reinforce ballast has a number of benefits which could result in better track geometry and longer maintenance cycles resulting in lower overall costs.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) and ballast water treatment regulations by the International Maritime Organization, the fluctuation of fuel price levels, along with the continuous endeavor of the shipping industry for economic growth and profits has led the shipbuilding industry to explore new and cost-efficient designs for various types of merchant ships. In this respect, proper use of modern computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering systems (CAD/CAE) extends the design space, while generating competitive designs with innovative features in short lead time. The present article deals with the parametric design and optimization of containerships. The developed methodology, {{which is based on}} the CAESES/Friendship-Framework software system, is demonstrated by the conceptual design and multiobjective optimization of a midsized, 6500 -TEU containership. The methodology includes a complete parametric model of the ship’s external and internal geometry and the development and coding of all models necessary for the determination of the design constraints and the design efficiency indicators, which are used for the evaluation of parametrically generated designs. Such indicators defining the objective functions of a multiobjective optimization problem are herein the EEDI, the required freight rate, the ship’s zero <b>ballast</b> container <b>box</b> capacity, and the ratio of the above to below deck number of containers. The set-up multiobjective optimization problem is solved by use of the genetic algorithms, and clear Pareto fronts are generated. Identified optimal design proves very competitive compared with the standard containership designs in the market...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to have consistent ballast testing methods that provide results reflecting the performance of different ballast materials in the railway trackbed. In this research, extensive laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the correlation between simple ballast index tests, and <b>box</b> tests simulating <b>ballast</b> field loading conditions in a simplified and controlled manner. In the box test, a sleeper load of 40 kN was applied to a simulated sleeper {{on the top of a}} sample of <b>ballast</b> in a <b>box</b> of dimensions 700 x 300 x 450 mm. The ballast was tamped using a Kango hammer which caused particles to rearrange as the level of the sleeper was raised. The ballast tests investigated in this project are those ballast tests specified in the Railtrack Line Specification (RT/CE/S/ 006 Issue 3, 2000), in addition to single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, petrographic analysis, and box tests. It was found that there was some correlation between the single particle crushing tests, oedometer tests, box tests and petrographic analysis. One of the current ballast tests, namely the Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) test, which is analogous to the oedometer test, is not appropriate because the ACV test uses 10 - 14 mm ballast particles, and there is a size effect on the strength of ballast and different ballasts have different size effects. However, if an oedometer test is used on track ballast, the results correlate better with ballast field performance as simulated in the <b>box</b> tests. Six <b>ballasts</b> were tested: A, B, C, D, E and F (mineralogy of these ballasts can be found in the appendix). The aim was to examine the relative performance of these ballasts and to establish which index tests were most indicative of performance in the box test. Simple index tests were performed on each of the <b>ballasts,</b> whilst <b>box</b> tests were only performed on ballasts A, B, C and D. The box tests were generally performed wet by adding a known volume of water at each tamp. For ballast A, controlled tests were also performed on dry ballast, and tests involving traffic loading only and tamping only were also conducted. A box test on 10 - 14 mm ballast A was also conducted to investigate the size effect on ballast behaviour in the box. The Wet Attrition Value (WAV), Los Angeles Abrasion (LAA), and Micro-Deval Attrition (MDA) seem to be suitable parameters to indicate ballast performance in the box test. However, this is considered to be due to the rearrangement of particles in the box test caused by the simulated tamping. In addition to the laboratory tests, the application of discrete element program PFC 3 D (Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., 1999) in simulating ballast behaviour was also investigated. Single particle crushing test was simulated to produce crushable agglomerates with a distribution of strengths of ballast A. These agglomerates were then used to simulate the oedometer test. The resulting normal compression line was compared with that for real oedometer tests: discrepancies can be attributed to the simplified geometry of the agglomerates. Due to the high computational time in simulating a box test with crushable agglomerates, uncrushable spherical balls and uncrushable angular agglomerates were used to represent individual ballast particles in the box. Important aspects of ballast behaviour under repeated loading, namely resilient and permanent deformation, were studied. It was found that the box test on uncrushable angular agglomerates give less permanent deformation compared with the test on spherical balls, because of the additional resistance provided by the irregular shape of the agglomerates.

40|$|Track {{deterioration}} has {{a serious}} influence on the safety and efficiency (speed restriction) of train operations. Many expensive, disruptive and frequent repair operations are often required to maintain the ballast characteristics due {{to the problem of}} settlement. Because of this, a geogrid solution that {{has proved to be a}} simple and economical method of reinforcing track ballast is widely used. This project presents an evaluation of the behaviour of geogrid-reinforced railway <b>ballast.</b> Experimental large <b>box</b> pull-out tests were conducted to examine the key parameters influencing the interaction between ballast and the geogrid. The experimental results demonstrated that the triaxial geogrid with triangular apertures outperforms the biaxial geogrid with square apertures and the geogrid aperture size is more influential than rib profile and junction profile. The discrete element method (DEM) has then been used to model the interaction between ballast and geogrid by simulating large box pull-out tests and comparing with experimental results. The DEM simulation results have been shown to provide good predictions of the pull-out resistance and reveal the distribution of contact forces in the geogrid-reinforced ballast system. The discrete element method has also been used to simulate cyclic loading of geogrid-reinforced ballast under confined and unconfined conditions. For the confined condition, box tests have been simulated on unreinforced samples and reinforced samples with different geogrid positions and geogrid apertures. The response of the ballast layer reinforced with geogrid under repeated loading agrees with experimental results. It was found that the optimum location of geogrid is 100 mm depth from base, and the triaxial geogrid outperforms biaxial geogrid. For the unconfined condition, cyclic loading of a trough of ballast has also been simulated, and the sample with the geogrid at 50 mm from the sub-ballast layer performs best. It was also found that the used of two geogrids at both 50 mm and 150 mm from the sub-ballast gave a smaller settlement than using a single layer geogrid, or the unreinforced ballast. The geogrid reinforcement limits the lateral displacement in reinforced zone, which is approximately 50 mm above and below the geogrid. Previous investigations have shown that the abrupt stiffness change in track support is often associated with accelerated rates of deterioration of track geometry, high maintenance demand, and poor ride quality. However, at present, there is no detailed understanding of the mechanisms of track geometry deterioration at transition zones. This work provides insight into the factors that can cause or accelerate track degradation at the transition zones, in order to identify and evaluate appropriate mitigation design. A simple track transition model with dimensions 2. 1 m x 0. 3 m x 0. 45 m was simulated by using PFC 3 D. In order to identify and evaluate appropriate mitigation methods, two kinds of transition patterns, including a single step change and a multi step-by-step change for subgrade stiffness distribution were tested. The influence of the train direction of travel and speed on the transition were also investigated. In addition, geogrid was used in the ballast layer to examine the effects of geogrid reinforcement.

40|$|Track {{performance}} was assessed {{in terms of}} vertical track settlement, and the {{factors that contribute to}} these settlements at specific field sites. The sites consisted of: (1) in-service revenue track having concrete and wood cross-ties and (2) wood and concrete tie sections from the DOT Facility for Accelerated Service Testing. ^ Field tests were conducted to assess the physical states of the ballast materials prior to a track maintenance operation. The physical state tests were repeated after the surfacing to determine the resulting changes in the ballast properties. Standard penetration tests, Dutch cone tests, and undisturbed tube sampling for laboratory tests were used to investigate the subgrade. ^ The dynamic wheel load distributions at each site were measured. A method was presented to account for the mix of wheel loads that contributed to the track deformations. ^ The stress-dependent resilient moduli of the ballast materials were derived from repeated load triaxial tests, with and without shear stress reversals. The resilient moduli of the subgrades were determined from repeated load triaxial tests and site-specific correlations with the standard and Dutch cone penetration tests. ^ A three dimensional, nonlinear, elastic, multilayer model, GEOTRACK, was used to estimate the stresses and deformations in the track foundations. The model was validated by comparing the predicted elastic foundation responses with those measured at FAST. Comparisons of measured and predicted track modulus were also made for the revenue field sites. ^ The inelastic behavior of the soil was investigated using repeated load triaxial tests and a <b>ballast</b> <b>box</b> device for simulating field conditions. A strain superposition method was developed to account for the deformations that resulted from repeated applications of the mixed field loading conditions. The predicted values of track settlement were compared to field measurements obtained using soil strain gages and surveying from benchmarks. ^ The track modulus and settlement predictions were of the same order of magnitude as the measured values. However, some differences in trends were observed. The study concludes with a discussion of the factors that were not accounted for in the methodology, and the implications of these factors in track performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Railways are {{integral}} to the transportation system of a growing economy. There is a constant demand by numerous stakeholders of the railway industry for greater train operational speeds, tonnage, passenger comfort and safety with minimal service disruptions. This is partly achievable through {{the improvement of the}} main components of railway track. A fundamental requirement for any railway track {{is to be able to}} maintain its as-built geometry over its service life. Settlement of a ballasted railway track is mainly caused by cyclic loading due to the passage of traffic. To return the rail track to the as-built alignment and level, track maintenance needs to be carried out. Tamping is one of the most common and traditional ways of maintaining the track and is not only costly but causes interruption to the day-to-day operations and damages the long term performance of the ballasted track. It therefore remains important to policy makers, rail practitioners and researchers to identify new techniques, innovations or processes that will prolong intervals between scheduled track maintenance. Track settlement is influenced by several interrelated track variables, not least of which are the railway sleeper, ballast and ballast-sleeper interface that have potential for alteration to be optimised with respect to the track performance. In this research, results are presented from a parametric experimental study using three different apparatus namely box test (confined), Composite Element Test (CET) (semi-confined), and Railway Test Facility (RTF) (full-scale), to investigate performance of different sleeper and <b>ballast</b> configurations. The <b>box</b> test and the CET apparatus were used ahead of the RTF (full-scale) apparatus as preliminary tests to obtain an insight into the performance and potential benefits of different sleeper types with and without the use of Under Sleeper Pads (USPs). The aforementioned apparatus were also used for comparison with the full-scale apparatus to assess the consistency of the sleeper settlement results (phase 1 tests). The purpose of using the box test and CET apparatus was also to allow a relatively large number of simplified tests to be carried out on sleeper and ballast combinations (Phase 2 tests) within a reasonable cost and time frame. Phase 2 tests were designed and conducted with consideration of the phase 1 test results. The test results from phase 1 showed that increasing the number of contact points between ballast particles and sleeper, and increasing the coefficient of friction at ballast-sleeper interface improved the settlement performance of the tarckbed. Therefore, having this in mind, further tests were designed and conducted including: finer ballast grading, two-layered ballast systems, frictional sleepers and USPs, and USP types with various stiffnesses. In addition, further tests on ballast bonding/gluing and ballast reinforcement were conducted with the aim of investigating possible ways of minimising ballast bed deterioration. Application of ballast gluing was proven beneficial (in literature) in improving ballast bed performance, however, the overall cost of super glues used for this method was high. Therefore in this study, a low cost glue was introduced and its performance was tested under conditions similar to real track. With regard to ballast reinforcement, the expanded polystyrene was added to the ballast sample with the aim of decreasing the contact forces between ballast particles and consequently minimising ballast bed deterioration and settlement. The observations in this study sought to establish qualitative and quantitative data on the effects of different parameters on the track performance, which may lead to a longer service life with less maintenance. The results showed that the type of sleeper has an influence on the performance of a railway track. With respect to settlement performance of a railway track, sleepers with higher depth and width, coefficient friction, and bending stiffness performed better. Out of all investigated sleeper types without any additional interventions, concrete mono-block gave the least settlement and the plastic sleeper gave the most. It was also found that inclusion of USPs (regardless of type) can be beneficial compared to the ‘no USP’ scenario in: (1) Increasing trackbed resiliency. (2) Reducing maintenance works related to settlement. (3) Reducing sleeper deflections (hogging) at the middle of sleeper. (4) Reducing the rate of deterioration of sleeper support at the rail seat (6) Reducing differences in the performance of different sleeper types. (7) Reducing tendency towards centre binding. (8) Reducing transmitted pressure on subgrade. (9) Making the trackbed stiffness more uniform. The conclusion of research was that use of concrete mono-block sleeper, USPs, finer ballast grading, a two-layered ballast system with finer ballast grading on top, frictional sleeper, frictional USP, and ballast gluing all have potential to improve the performance of ballasted railway track and reduce the maintenance requirements...|$|R
