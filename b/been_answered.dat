5|$|Mind of a Man is a {{game show}} {{broadcast}} by Game Show Network, with DeRay Davis as host. On each episode, two female contestants attempt {{to figure out what}} men believe about marriage, dating, work, and other subjects. Similar to Family Feud, the questions have previously <b>been</b> <b>answered</b> by a survey of one hundred men. Over the course of four rounds, a celebrity panel consisting of two men and a woman helps the contestants by offering their opinions about the correct answers to the surveys. The winner advances to the bonus round, which features a top prize of $10,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now <b>been</b> <b>answered.</b> Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E

25|$|Many cathedrals {{are places}} of pilgrimage {{to which people}} travel in order to worship or venerate a holy object or the reliquary of a saint. Many cathedrals are {{regarded}} as places that have provided rewarding religious experiences, where prayers have <b>been</b> <b>answered</b> or miracles have taken place. Pilgrimage was particularly popular in the late medieval period. Some cathedrals such as Santiago de Compostela continue to attract pilgrims.|$|E
25|$|Round 2: A buzzer round. One {{player from}} each team is {{nominated}} {{to go to}} an artefact {{while the rest of the}} team answers questions for 10 points each. Incorrectly answered questions are passed to the other team, and for every two correct answers the third member is given a bonus question on the artefact for 20 points. There are 5 bonus questions and the round is over when they have all <b>been</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|E

25|$|An {{emergency}} telephone number call may be answered by either a telephone operator or an emergency service dispatcher. The nature of the emergency (police, fire, medical) is then determined. If the call has <b>been</b> <b>answered</b> by a telephone operator, they then connect the call to the appropriate emergency service, who then dispatches the appropriate help. In the case of multiple services being needed on a call, the most urgent need must be determined, with other services being called in as needed.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{objections}} to the proposed change have <b>been</b> <b>answered</b> by its opponents. For example, Dr. Felicitas Arias, who, as Director of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM)'s Time, Frequency, and Gravimetry Department, is responsible for generating UTC, noted in a press release that the drift of about one minute every 60–90 years could {{be compared to the}} 16-minute annual variation between true solar time and mean solar time, the one hour offset by use of daylight time, and the several-hours offset in certain geographically extra-large time zones.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{game was}} played on 15 November 2014. Carlsen adopted the space-gaining Maróczy Bind setup against the Kan Variation of the Sicilian Defence, and {{accepted}} a set of isolated doubled pawns in return for active play. After an early queen exchange he soon developed a commanding position and appeared to have excellent winning chances. At move 26 there was a double blunder. Carlsen's 26.Kd2?? should have <b>been</b> <b>answered</b> with 26...Nxe5! (with a discovered attack on the g4-rook) 27.Rxg8 Nxc4+ (zwischenzug) 28.Kd3 Nb2+ 29.Ke2 Rxg8, and Black will wind up with 2 extra pawns (on e5 and c4) and excellent winning chances. However, Anand missed this and played 26...a4?? Carlsen made no further mistakes and converted his advantage into a win.|$|E

Every available space of sitting and standing room was crowded". She starts off her speech by giving a little background about her own life. Sojourner recounts how her mother told her to pray to God {{that she may have}} good masters and mistresses. She goes on to retell how her masters were not good to her, about how she was whipped for not understanding English, and how she would question God why he had not made her masters be good to her. Sojourner admits to the audience that she had once hated white people, but she says once she met her final master, Jesus, she was filled with love for everyone. Once enslaved folks were emancipated, she tells the crowd she knew her prayers had <b>been</b> <b>answered.</b>|$|E
500|$|Badler's co-star, Mullally, praised her {{appearance}} in Neighbours. He said that [...] "she {{has so much}} intensity on screen and sometimes she'll throw in some interesting comedy as well". He added [...] "She is great to work with, so beautiful, really happy and chirpy. And when she goes on screen she plays this callous, powerful, intimidating persona and her eyes just go straight through you!"

500|$|After the 1941 {{expedition}} to Colorado, Rossi {{decided that the}} question of whether mesotrons decay had <b>been</b> <b>answered.</b> [...] However, he was not satisfied with the precision with which the lifetime had been determined, for existing estimates depended on mesotron mass, which was not accurately known. [...] To perform a more direct measurement, he designed apparatus to measure the time interval between the arrival of a mesotron in an absorber, where it stopped, and the emission of an electron when the mesotron decayed. [...] To assist, he obtained the help of graduate student Norris Nereson. [...] At the heart of their experiment, was a [...] "chronometer", which was an electronic circuit that produced a pulse whose height was accurately proportional to the time interval, and which could be recorded by photographing an oscilloscope trace.|$|E

500|$|In {{a letter}} to the higher {{education}} secretary, CVC secretary KS Ramasubban has asked the ministry as to why the case against Singh is being closed when specific allegations have not <b>been</b> <b>answered.</b> The CVC has taken exception {{to the fact that the}} case is being closed on the basis of an [...] "emotional reply" [...] by Singh. CVC sources said the ministry had taken Singh's reply as final. [...] "Without investigation how can general comments be taken as the final word?" [...] a CVC official asked. CVC sources also said that the institute's Board of Governors had rejected allegations against Singh. [...] "This is not how an investigation is conducted," [...] the CVC official said, adding that the HRD ministry was to be blamed for not following the procedure.|$|E

2500|$|A {{question}} that has <b>been</b> <b>answered</b> is whether every integer greater than one {{is a product of}} primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes. [...] This is called fundamental theorem of arithmetic. A proof appears in Euclid's Elements.|$|E

Question 1.3 <b>was</b> <b>answered</b> using Level 4 visualization (Commit History). Finally, questions 1.2 and 2.1 through 2.4 <b>were</b> <b>answered</b> using Level 2 visualization (Topology). Almost all subjects answered all the questions similarly, except for subject P 4 in question 1.2 from Phase 1.|$|R
2500|$|The {{question}} of how neutrino masses arise has not <b>been</b> <b>answered</b> conclusively. [...] In the Standard Model of particle physics, fermions only have mass because of interactions with the Higgs field (see Higgs boson). [...] These interactions involve both left- and right-handed versions of the fermion (see chirality). [...] However, only left-handed neutrinos have been observed so far.|$|E
2500|$|Albert Ellis, a {{cognitive}} psychologist and humanist, has questioned {{the results of}} transpersonal psychotherapy, the scientific status of transpersonal psychology, {{and its relationship to}} religion, mysticism and authoritarian belief systems.

2500|$|A {{prime number}} is an integer greater than 1 {{that is not}} the product of two smaller {{positive}} integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. The prime numbers have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have <b>been</b> <b>answered.</b> [...] The study of these questions belong to number theory. [...] An example of a question that is still unanswered is whether every even number is the sum of two primes. [...] This is called Goldbach's conjecture.|$|E
