5|$|Their {{elongated}} {{upper and}} lower jaws form {{what is called a}} rostrum, or snout, which gives the animal its common name. The real, functional nose is the <b>blowhole</b> on top of its head; the nasal septum is visible when the <b>blowhole</b> is open.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling {{stale air}} from the <b>blowhole,</b> forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs; a humpback whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one <b>blowhole.</b> Breathing involves expelling stale air from the <b>blowhole,</b> forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
50|$|The Alofaaga <b>Blowholes,</b> {{also known}} as the Taga <b>Blowholes,</b> are a natural feature located in the {{district}} of Palauli, south west of Salelologa wharf on the island of Savai'i in Samoa. The entrance to the <b>blowholes</b> is in the village of Taga.|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or <b>blowholes,</b> are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two <b>blowholes,</b> as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired <b>blowholes</b> are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the <b>blowholes</b> has two plugs attached to it, making the <b>blowholes</b> water-tight while the whale dives.|$|R
5|$|It has paired <b>blowholes</b> on a {{prominent}} splashguard and a broad, flat, V-shaped rostrum. A single median ridge stops {{well short of}} the rostrum tip. A light V-shaped marking, the chevron, begins behind the <b>blowholes</b> and extends back and then forward again.|$|R
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin {{has a single}} <b>blowhole</b> located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap. The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction. Dolphins are voluntary breathers, who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air. They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can: the dolphin can store 36 milliliters (ml) of oxygen per kg of body weight, compared with 20 ml per kg for humans. This is an adaptation to diving. The {{bottlenose dolphin}} typically rises to the surface to breathe through its <b>blowhole</b> {{two to three times}} per minute, although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{characteristically}} has a large, squarish head one-third {{the length of}} its body; the <b>blowhole</b> is slightly to the left hand side; the skin is usually wrinkled; and it has no teeth on the upper jaw.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped <b>blowhole</b> is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives rise to a distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blowholes</b> {{have the}} {{capacity}} to change the topography near their locations. <b>Blowholes</b> can eventually erode the area surrounding the crevices to form larger sea caves. In some instances, the cave itself may collapse. This event may create shallow pools along the coast.|$|R

5|$|Transformation {{into human}} form {{is said to}} be rare, and usually occurs at night. The encantado will often be seen running from a festa, despite protests from the others for it to stay, and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form. When it is under human form, it wears a hat to hide its <b>blowhole,</b> which does not {{disappear}} with the shapeshift.|$|E
5|$|Because {{she is a}} whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her <b>blowhole.</b>|$|E
5|$|By contrast, a bottlenose's {{sense of}} smell is poor, because its <b>blowhole,</b> the {{analogue}} to the nose, is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing. It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain. Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty, sweet, bitter (quinine sulphate), and sour (citric acid) tastes, but {{this has not been}} well-studied. Anecdotally, some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types, although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference.|$|E
50|$|Torndirrup National Park {{has many}} {{impressive}} rock formations on the coast. These include the Gap, Natural Bridge and the <b>Blowholes</b> all shaped {{from the local}} granite. The park is along the coast {{on the west side}} of King George Sound and consists of a range of cliffs, gullies, <b>blowholes,</b> beaches and promontories.|$|R

5|$|Other {{television}} appearances by bottlenose dolphins include Wonder Woman, Highway to Heaven, Dolphin Cove, seaQuest DSV, and The Penguins of Madagascar, {{in which}} a dolphin, Doctor <b>Blowhole,</b> is a villain. In the HBO movie Zeus and Roxanne, a female bottlenose dolphin befriends a male dog, and in Bermuda Triangle, a girl named Annie (played by Lisa Jakub) swims with dolphins. Human and dolphin interaction segments shot on location in the Florida Keys with Dolphin Research Center as seen on a Halloween episode of The Simpsons, Treehouse of Horror XI.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have conical teeth, used {{to catch}} swift prey such as small river fish. They also have very long snouts, with some measuring , four {{times longer than}} most of their oceanic counterparts. They have a two-chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers. Breathing involves expelling stale air from their <b>blowhole,</b> followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs. They {{do not have the}} iconic spout, as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air, which does not occur in their tropical habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage. While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole, the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips. It is thought that the {{nostrils}} of the land-based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions, the left nostril becoming the <b>blowhole</b> and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blowholes</b> {{are likely}} to occur in areas where there are crevices, such as lava tubes, in rock along the coast. These areas are often located along fault lines and on islands. As {{powerful}} waves hit the coast, water rushes into these crevices and bursts out in a high pressured release. It is often accompanied by a loud noise and wide spray, and for this reason, <b>blowholes</b> are often sites of tourism.|$|R
5|$|When on the beach, most of {{them get}} stuck. Those that have {{remained}} too far in the water are dragged onto the beach by putting a hook in their <b>blowhole.</b> When on land, they are killed by cutting down to the major arteries and spinal cord at the neck. The {{time it takes for}} a whale to die varies from a few seconds Up to half a minute, depending on the cut. If the locals fail to beach the animals altogether, they are let free again.|$|E
5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would give him the strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the <b>blowhole,</b> causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the <b>blowhole,</b> and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small family group. There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E

25|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling {{stale air}} from their <b>blowhole,</b> forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh {{air into the}} lungs, however this only occurs in the polar regions of the oceans. Dolphins have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.|$|E
25|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling {{stale air}} from their one <b>blowhole,</b> forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh {{air into the}} lungs. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification. The spout only forms when warm air from the lungs meets cold air, so it does not form in warmer climates, as with river dolphins.|$|E
25|$|Fatal {{attacks from}} other species are less common, {{but there is}} a {{registered}} occurrence off the coast of Brazil in 1994, when a man died after being attacked by a bottlenose dolphin named Tião. Tião had suffered harassment by human visitors, including attempts to stick ice cream sticks down her <b>blowhole.</b> Non-fatal incidents occur more frequently, both in the wild and in captivity.|$|E

40|$|Laser-arc hybrid welding {{combines}} the laser and arc welding processes to provide advantages {{not found in}} either. This process can weld lapped steel sheets that have a larger gap than is possible with laser welding. <b>Blowholes</b> form when lap-welding zinc-coated steel sheets because of the zinc that is vaporized. The laser-arc hybrid welding proc-ess can lap-weld zinc-coated steel sheets without causing <b>blowholes.</b> The welding speed of laser-arc hybrid welding is nearly equivalent to that of laser welding. Laser-arc hybrid welding produces high-quality lap joints and is ideal for assembly welding of automotive parts...|$|R
