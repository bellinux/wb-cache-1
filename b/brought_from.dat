5|$|Domitian {{probably}} {{wanted a}} new {{war against the}} Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Syria and with at least five cohorts <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Pannonia. Trajan continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars. Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, importantly, annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.|$|E

5|$|The first {{victims were}} a few {{thousand}} men arrested in July 1941 and <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Riga Central Prison. In 1942 another 12,000 Jews were <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. In 1943 Riga Ghetto prisoners were brought here who were unable to work at Kaiserwald concentration camp, followed by those from the camp itself unable to work in 1944. In 1943 and onwards Nazis dug up graves and burned the bodies to hide the evidence. It is estimated {{that there are now}} around 20,000 victims buried in the forest.|$|E

5|$|This is the Ottoman {{development}} of the composite bow, presumably <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> the steppes. Turkish bows evolved, after the decline of military archery, into probably the best traditional flight bows. Their decoration often included delicate and beautiful multicoloured designs with gold.|$|E
5|$|Until the Industrial Revolution, Tyldesley was rural, {{agriculture}} and cottage spinning and weaving, mainly muslin and fustian, were the chief occupations before 1800. Silk weaving {{became an important}} cottage industry after 1827 when silk was <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} the time they were first <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> the New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|Gurnemanz {{asks the}} lead Knight for {{news of the}} King's health. The Knight says the King has {{suffered}} during the night and is going early to bathe in the holy lake. The squires ask Gurnemanz {{to explain how the}} King's injury can be healed, but he evades their question and a wild woman – Kundry – bursts in. She gives Gurnemanz a vial of balsam, <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Arabia, to ease the King's pain and then collapses, exhausted.|$|E

His remains are now in a small clay coffin (sarcophagus) bearing the number 4133.|$|E
5|$|In 1829 a Mastiff like dog was <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> the Great St Bernard Hospice and was {{exhibited}} in London and Liverpool {{to thousands of}} people. This publicised {{the existence of an}} Alpine Mastiff, but drawings of the dog did not match descriptions of the Alpine Spaniel from before the exhibition, and the descriptions of the Spaniel were ridiculed by later publications.|$|E

5|$|In Guatemala the Spanish {{routinely}} fielded indigenous allies; {{at first}} these were Nahua <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> the recently conquered Mexico, later they also included Maya. It {{is estimated that}} for every Spaniard {{on the field of}} battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and the participation of these Mesoamerican allies was decisive.|$|E
5|$|La Lagunita is {{the site}} of the San Constantino and Santa Elena Romanian Orthodox Church. The {{building}} is an architectural work from the 16th century, <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Romania, made completely from oak and fir woods, and detailed with more than 40,000 individually placed and carved tiles. It is one of only 15 churches of its type remaining in the world, and one of only two outside of Romania, the other being in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so much noise that the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E

5|$|Pugs were <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> China to Europe in {{the sixteenth}} century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.

5|$|Several old bronze statues {{that line}} the {{courtyard}} of the temple have a long history as war loot. They were originally Khmer statues, found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia, and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese. In 1564, the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago (Pegu). In 1599, King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally, Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785. According to local belief, many more of these statues were <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Arakan. However, King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace. Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> Siam, only six remain today, and are displayed in the temple complex. They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.|$|E
5|$|Some {{fragments}} of the priory travelled further afield. At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating sculptured stones <b>brought</b> <b>from</b> the priory. The priory's wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.|$|E
