5|$|In 1767 Pennant {{was elected}} {{a fellow of}} the Royal Society. About this time he met the much-travelled Sir Joseph Banks and visited him at his home in Lincolnshire. Banks {{presented}} him with the skin of a new species of penguin recently <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the Falkland Islands. Pennant wrote an account of this bird, the king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and all the other known species of penguin which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.|$|E

With the Smoking Man hiding truth from the public, Mulder seeks to reveal {{it to the public}} and the truth about the disappearance of his sister, Samantha. This leads to a rivalry that lasts {{until the end of the}} series.|$|E

5|$|The Crown {{took over}} the castle again in 1670, and Robert Holmes, the new Captain of the Isle of Wight, {{had some of the}} guns <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Cowes to the castle. The site was refortified and a new battery placed on the {{adjacent}} quay, but the older earthworks were demolished and the moat was filled in. Holmes built a mansion for himself alongside the castle, where on three occasions he hosted the King.|$|E
5|$|The {{church is}} adorned with monuments to {{individuals}} {{from the history of}} the city, including Sir William Penn (the father of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania). His helm and half-armour are hung on the wall, together with the tattered banners of the Dutch ships that he captured in battle. The church also displays a rib of a whale <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> one of his voyages by John Cabot.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the arrival of}} foods from the Americas in Early Modern times (around the sixteenth century), notably the {{incorporation}} of the potato into Northern European cuisine, and the eager adoption of the tomato into Mediterranean cuisine. The tomato, so central now to that cuisine, was first described in print by Pietro Andrea Mattioli in 1544. Similarly, many of the species of Phaseolus beans now used around the Mediterranean, including P. vulgaris (the French or haricot bean), were <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese explorers.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General â€“ Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no longer had the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Beebe's expeditions.|$|E
5|$|Greenhouses convert solar {{light to}} heat, {{enabling}} year-round {{production and the}} growth (in enclosed environments) of specialty crops and other plants not naturally suited to the local climate. Primitive greenhouses were first used during Roman times to produce cucumbers year-round for the Roman emperor Tiberius. The first modern greenhouses were built in Europe in the 16th century to keep exotic plants <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> explorations abroad. Greenhouses remain {{an important part of}} horticulture today, and plastic transparent materials have also been used to similar effect in polytunnels and row covers.|$|E

5|$|In the {{cultural}} sphere, {{there were some}} Mongol elements in Western medieval art, especially in Italy, of which most surviving examples are from the 14th century, after {{the chance of a}} military alliance had faded. These included the depiction of textiles from the Mongol Empire and Mongol script in various contexts, the latter often anachronistic. Imports of textiles had a considerable influence on Italian textile design. Mongol military costume is sometimes worn by soldiers, typically those acting against Christian figures, as in martyrdoms or Crucifixion scenes. These were perhaps copied from drawings made of Mongol envoys to Europe, or ones <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Outremer.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the two}} {{surviving}} Glastonbury chairs is {{on display}} in the palace. It was made in Britain from a description <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Rome in 1504 by Abbot Richard Beere to Glastonbury Abbey, and was produced for or by John Arthur Thorne, a monk who was the treasurer at the abbey. Arthur perished on Glastonbury Tor in 1539, hanged, drawn and quartered alongside his master, Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, during the dissolution of the monasteries. The Abbot sat on a Glastonbury chair of this type during his trial at the Bishop's Palace. Other chairs of this age and later reproductions can also be seen.|$|E
5|$|Richard Swinefield, Cantilupe's {{successor}} as Bishop of Hereford, {{wrote to}} Pope Nicholas IV {{in a letter}} dated 19 April 1290 proposing the bishop for canonisation, {{but it was not}} until 1307 that an investigation into Cantilupe's saintliness was initiated by Pope Clement V. For the canonisation process to succeed, convincing evidence of miracles that Cantilupe had performed since his death had to be presented, one of which was that William Cragh had been <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the dead by the bishop's intercession. Three papal commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry: William de Testa, a papal tax collector in England, Ralph Baldock, Bishop of London, and William Durand the Younger, Bishop of Mende.|$|E

5|$|The Rhodesian Army quickly {{deemed the}} French {{experiment}} a failure. It reassigned 7 Independent Company in late November to Marymount Mission, a small settlement {{to the east}} of Rusambo where there was a minor police station. The number of patrols they would embark on was reduced. Two of the company's vehicles were ambushed by cadres between Marymount and Rusambo on 6 January 1978, resulting in two men being injured, one fatally so. A week later another truck was surprised on the same bush road, resulting in one death and three serious casualties. The company was <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the bush four days later for rest and recuperation (R) in Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, Holt's planned {{expansion}} to {{meet the}} military's needs was no longer needed. The company was left in a difficult situation. The types of tractors needed by the military were {{very different from what}} farmers needed. Their situation was worsened as artillery tractors were <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Europe, depressing prices for new equipment and Holt's unsold inventory of military tractors. The company moved to focus less on agricultural machinery and more on producing road-building equipment. To keep the company afloat, they borrowed heavily.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Singapore the Australian Government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack as the RAAF lacked modern {{aircraft}} and the RAN was too small and unbalanced to counter the Imperial Japanese Navy. Additionally, the Army, although large, contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility. In response to this threat most of the AIF was <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the Middle East and the Government appealed to the United States for assistance. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions to Burma while they were en route to Australia, but Curtin refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1887, Bruce {{travelled}} north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences. The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were {{under the direction of}} Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology. The experience of Granton, and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists, convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland. He abandoned his place at UCL, and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh. This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson, and also gave him the opportunity to work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the Challenger expedition were being examined and classified. Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan, and gained a deeper understanding of oceanography and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012 Sihanouk {{issued a}} letter to express his wish to be cremated after his death, and for his ashes to be interred in a golden urn.

On 15October 2012 Sihanouk {{died of a heart attack}} at 1:20am, Phnom Penh time. When the news broke, Sihamoni, Hun Sen, and other {{government}} officials flew to Beijing to pay their last respects. The Cambodian government announced an official mourning period of seven days between 17October and 24October 2012, and state flags were ordered to fly at one-third height. Two days later, Sihanouk's body was <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Beijing on an Air China flight, and about 1.2million people lined the streets from the airport to the royal palace to witness the return of Sihanouk's cortege.|$|E
5|$|In {{the revival}} of neo-Platonism Renaissance humanists did not reject Christianity; quite the contrary, many of the Renaissance's {{greatest}} works were devoted to it, and the Church patronized many works of Renaissance art. However, a subtle shift {{took place in the}} way that intellectuals approached religion that was reflected in many other areas of cultural life. In addition, many Greek Christian works, including the Greek New Testament, were <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Byzantium to Western Europe and engaged Western scholars {{for the first time since}} late antiquity. This new engagement with Greek Christian works, and particularly the return to the original Greek of the New Testament promoted by humanists Lorenzo Valla and Erasmus, would help pave the way for the Protestant Reformation.|$|E
