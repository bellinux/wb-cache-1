A new technique of place <b>holder</b> <b>bits</b> that improves delay for networking problems with general costs is also presented. An example application is {{given for the}} problem of energy-aware scheduling and routing in a wireless mobile network with channel errors and multi-receiver diversity.

40|$|How to {{represent}} a graph in memory is a fundamental data structuring question. In the usual representations of an n-vertex graph, {{the names of the}} vertices (i. e. integers from 1 to n) betray nothing about the graph itself. Indeed, the names (or labels) on the n vertices are just log n <b>bit</b> place <b>holders</b> to allow data on the edges to encode the structure of the graph. In our scenario, there is no such waste. By assigning O(log n) bit labels to the vertices, we completely encode the structure of the graph, so that given the labels of two vertices we can test if they are adjacent in time linear {{in the size of the}} labels. Furthermore, given an arbitrary original labeling of the vertices, we can find structure coding labels (as above) that are no more than a small constant factor larger than the original labels. These notions are intimately related to vertex induced universal graphs of polynomial size. For example, we can label planar graphs with structure coding labels of size ! 4 log n, which implies the existence of a graph with n 4 vertices that contains all n-vertex planar graphs as vertex induced subgraphs...|$|R

That was very limiting {{in terms of what}} they put in the edit and the direction I was given. It wasn't until after the eighth episode that I felt I could be the character 100 percent, that I was allowed to react freely to situations. After they revealed that he wasn't a bad guy, it gave him some more space. It doesn't feel like I've been shooting more material, but it's been a little <b>bit</b> more about <b>Holder's</b> journey in the second season." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a wireless node that randomly receives data from different sensor units. The arriving data must be compressed, stored, and transmitted over a wireless link, where both the compression and transmission operations consume power. Specifically, the controller must choose {{from one of}} multiple compression options every timeslot. Each option requires a different amount of power and has different compression ratio properties. Further, the wireless link has potentially timevarying channels, and transmission rates depend on current channel states and transmission power allocations. We design a dynamic algorithm for joint compression and transmission, and prove that it comes arbitrarily close to minimizing average power expenditure, with an explicit tradeoff in average delay. Our approach uses stochastic network optimization together with a concept of place <b>holder</b> <b>bits</b> to provide efficient energy-delay performance. The algorithm is simple to implement and does not require knowledge of probability distributions for packet arrivals or channel states. Extensions that treat distortion constraints are also considered. Categories and Subject Descriptors: [...] . [ [...] . ]: [...] ...|$|R
