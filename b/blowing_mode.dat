40|$|Vortex {{generator}} jets {{have been}} applied to control a separating, turbulent boundary layer on the suction surface of compressor blades in a linear cascade at high incidence. With the jets operating in a steady <b>blowing</b> <b>mode,</b> loss measurements were taken over a range of jet velocities, yielding a loss reduction of 61 % relative to the uncontrolled case for a blowing ratio of 70 %. Higher jet velocities yielded {{a slight increase in}} the loss coefficient. To explore the behavior of the boundary layer over this range of blowing ratios, a comprehensive set of experiments was performed, including static pressure measurements, wall shear stress measurements, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, and a smoke-flow visualization study. The experiments showed that the minimum loss coefficient is achieved for a blowing ratio required to just keep the boundary layer attached. A vortex thatmigrates in the spanwise directionwas identified downstream of each jet. Shear stress is elevated beneath the vortex core and in a secondary flow region between the vortices created by adjacent jets, suggesting the importance of the secondary flow in contributing to the separation delay and loss reduction achieved by vortex generator jets.

40|$|The {{test results}} briefly {{described}} in this report were obtained on the three-dimensional 1 : 48 scale tunnel modeled on the design proposed by Messrs. D. S. M. A. Corporation. More particularly, while the test chamber dimensions were indeed scaled down in the ration of 1 : 48, including the contraction and the collector as well, the duct system itself leading {{to and from the}} chamber was adapted to suit laboratory conditions and space limitations. Earlier tests with the two-dimensional model showed that <b>blowing</b> <b>mode</b> was preferred as against the suction mode, hence all tests were performed with blowing only. At the exit of the contraction the maximum airspeed attained with the 1 HP blower unit was about 200 ft/sec. This airspeed may be increased in future if desired. The test results show that pressure recovery in the diffuser was about 34 percent due to the large blockage at its entrance. Velocity traverses taken across the diffuser entrance explain the reason for this blockage. Recirculation, studied with both, hot-wire anemometry and flow-visualization techniques, was largely affected by the design of the test chamber itself and the amount of vent-air admitted to the chamber. Vent-air helped to decrease the level of turbulence...|$|E

40|$|The Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) is an {{engineering}} scale demonstration of advanced coal based power systems, including the KBR Transport Gasifier, a hightemperature, high-pressure syngas filtration system, and a gas cleanup unit. Designed {{to be at}} a sufficient scale to test advanced power systems and components in an integrated fashion, the PSDF provides data necessary for commercial scale-up. The Transport Gasifier is a circulating fluidized bed reactor designed to operate at higher circulation rates and riser densities than conventional circulating bed units. The high circulation rates result in higher throughput, better mixing, and higher mass and heat transfer rates. Since the gasifier uses a dry feed system and does not slag the ash, it is particularly well-suited for high moisture fuels such as subbituminous coal and lignite. As of September 2006, the gasifier has achieved over 7, 100 hours of gasification using subbituminous Powder River Basin (PRB) coal and over 700 hours of gasification using lignite.

40|$|A {{push-pull}} {{fume cupboard}} shown is an innovative device to remove pollutants from a fume cupboard to the outdoor environment. A push flow {{coming from the}} bottom of a sash and a pull flow behind the doorsill are adopted to form an air curtain in the fume cupboard. Meanwhile, the roof of a push-pull fume cupboard is open to the environment and ambient fluids are drawn from the roof. To investigate the performance of a push-pull fume cupboard, a numerical model based on the finite volume method is utilized. Various ratios of push flows to pull flows are considered. Four characteristic flow fields are found at a variety of speed ratios. They are concave curtain, straight curtain, under suction and over <b>blow</b> <b>modes.</b> According to numerical results, a concave curtain mode with a fast pull flow and a weak push flow is recommended for the operation of a push-pull fume hood. Furthermore, the manikin effect on the flow filed of a push-pull fume hood is also examined in this study. A manikin is located in front of the fume cupboard according to the ANSI/ASHRAE 110 / 1995 standard. Numerical results reveal that fluid flows in a push-pull fume cupboard are not affected by a manikin.

(KBR) Transport Gasifier {{train with}} a Siemens Westinghouse Power Corporation (Siemens Westinghouse) particle filter {{system at the}} Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF) located in Wilsonville, Alabama. The Transport Gasifier is an advanced circulating fluidized-bed gasifier designed to operate as either a combustor or a gasifier in air- or oxygen-blown mode using a particulate control device (PCD). The Transport Gasifier was operated as a pressurized gasifier in air- and oxygen-blown modes during TC 08. Test Run TC 08 was started on June 9, 2002 and completed on June 29. Both gasifier and PCD operations were stable during the test run with a stable baseline pressure drop. The oxygen feed supply system worked well and the transition from air to oxygen blown was smooth. The gasifier temperature was varied between 1, 710 and 1, 770 F at pressures from 125 to 240 psig. The gasifier operates at lower pressure during oxygen-blown mode due to the supply pressure of the oxygen system. In TC 08, 476 hours of solid circulation and 364 hours of coal feed were attained with 153 hours of pure oxygen feed. The gasifier and PCD operations were stable in both enriched air and 100 percent oxygen <b>blown</b> <b>modes.</b> The oxygen concentration was slowly increased during the first transition to full oxygen-blown operations. Subsequent transitions from air to oxygen blown could be completed in less than 15 minutes. Oxygen-blown operations produced the highest synthesis gas heating value to date, with a projected synthesis gas heating value averaging 175 Btu/scf. Carbon conversions averaged 93 percent, slightly lower than carbon conversions achieved during air-blown gasification...|$|R

40|$|PulCheR (Pulsed Chemical Rocket with Green High Performance Propellants) {{is a new}} {{propulsion}} {{concept in}} which the propellants are fed in the combustion chamber at low pressure and the thrust is generated by means of high frequency pulses, reproducing the defence mechanism of a notable insect: the bombardier beetle. The radical innovation introduced by PulCheR is the elimination of any external pressurizing system even if the thruster works at high pressure inside the combustion chamber. At each pulse, pressurization of the combustion chamber gases takes place due to the decomposition or combustion reaction, and the final pressure {{is much higher than}} the one at which the propellants are stored. The weight of the feeding system is significantly reduced because the propellants are fed at low pressure, and {{there is no need for}} turbopumps, high pressure propellant tanks or gas vessels. The feed pressure becomes independent on the chamber pressure and the performance degradation typical of the <b>blow</b> down <b>mode</b> in monopropellant thrusters can be avoided. The PulCheR concept is able to substitute many currently used propulsion systems for accessing space in both mono and bipropellant configurations. The preliminary assessment of this new propulsion concept has been investigated using green propellants with potential similar performance to the current state-of-the-art for monopropellant and bipropellant thrusters...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} duality between IIB string theory on a pp-wave background, arising as a Penrose {{limit of the}} AdS 3 × S 3 × M, where M is T 4 (or K 3), and the 2 D CFT which is given by the N = (4, 4) orbifold (M) N /SN, {{resolved}} by a blowing-up mode. After analizying {{the action of the}} supercharges on both sides, we establish a correspondence between the states of the two theories. In particular and for the T 4 case, we identify both massive and massless oscillators on the pp-wave, with certain classes of excited states in the resolved CFT carrying large R-charge n. For the former, the excited states involve fractional modes of the generators of the N = 4 chiral algebra acting on the Zn ground states. For the latter, they involve, fractional modes of the U(1) 4 L ×U(1) 4 R super-current algebra acting on the Zn ground states. By using conformal perturbation theory we compute the leading order correction to the conformal dimensions of the first class of states, due to the presence of the <b>blowing</b> up <b>mode.</b> We find agreement, to this order, with the corresponding spectrum of massive oscillators on the pp-wave.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{experimental study}} was performed with sweeping jet actuators (fluidic oscillators) {{to determine their}} effectiveness in controlling flow separation on an adverse pressure gradient ramp. Actuator parameters that were investigated include <b>blowing</b> coefficients, operation <b>mode,</b> pitch and spreading angles, streamwise location, aspect ratio, and scale. Surface pressure measurements and surface oil flow visualization were used to characterize {{the effects of these}} parameters on the actuator performance. 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry measurements of the flow field over the ramp and hot-wire measurements of the actuator's jet flow were also obtained for selective cases. In addition, the sweeping jet actuators were compared to other well-known flow control techniques such as micro-vortex generators, steady blowing, and steady vortex-generating jets. The results confirm that the sweeping jet actuators are more effective than steady blowing and steady vortex-generating jets. The results also suggest that an actuator with a larger spreading angle placed closer to the location where the flow separates provides better performance. For the cases tested, an actuator with an aspect ratio, which is the width/depth of the actuator throat, of 2 was found to be optimal. For a fixed momentum coefficient, decreasing the aspect ratio to 1 produced weaker vortices while increasing the aspect ratio to 4 reduced coverage area. Although scaling down the actuator (based on the throat dimensions) from 0. 25 inch x 0. 125 inch to 0. 15 inch x 0. 075 inch resulted in similar flow control performance, scaling down the actuator further to 0. 075 inch x 0. 0375 inch reduced the actuator efficiency by reducing the coverage area and the amount of mixing in the near-wall region. The results of this study provide insight {{that can be used to}} design and select the optimal sweeping jet actuator configuration for flow control applications...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a CFD and experimental analysis {{associated with the}} parameter compressor fouling and a CFD analysis associated with the parameter on-line compressor washing of industrial gas turbines. On-line compressor washing is very popular and quite effective in the industrial gas turbine operational scheme. Many companies apply on-line washing with the engine running at normal speed {{so as to avoid}} downtime periods for off-line cleanings that could cause significant economic drawbacks. At this thesis vital parameters affecting compressor cleaning of an industrial gas turbine were examined and combined in such a way so as to provide adequate coverage of the frontal inlet guide vane area which is critical for effective cleaning. The parameters investigated were water injection nozzle position, inclination with respect to the engine centerline, injection velocity and nozzle spray angles. However, before applying compressor washing, compressor fouling comes into consideration. For this purpose a compressor cascade tunnel (test rig) was designed and come into operation in order to examine different levels of fouling. The cascade test rig involved as well a washing kit for future cleaning of the cascade blades. This work related to the cascade design released a lot of information about designing suction type compressor cascade test rigs by analysing the flow inside the cascade rig computationally and three-dimensionally via CFD tools. The results in terms of the quality of flow obtained for the current test rig were also compared with modified versions of the test rig, one which involved a bigger plenum area behind the cascade test section and one involving the current rig running in a <b>blowing</b> type <b>mode.</b> The CFD results coming out from the compressor cascade tunnel for the different fouling levels, were analysed in terms of mass flow capacity and polytropic efficiency reduction due to fouling by using Howell’s theory (1945) and they were used as inputs for running performance simulation in terms of an industrial gas turbine engine using the performance simulation code Turbomatch. Therefore, a correlation between cascade fouling and real engine uniformly stage spread fouling was achieved. At high levels fouling where the 254 microns roughness height takes place, the nondimensional air mass flow reduction can reach levels of 1. 6 % and the drop in compressor efficiency can touch the value of 5 %. The CFD results obtained after running all the simulation scheme for the different roughness levels, were compared to the actual experimental results coming from running the compressor cascade rig with the same fouling scheme of roughness. Applying Howell’s theory (1945), the fouled cascade was correlated to a uniformly fouled stage and a real industrial gas turbine. This time input in the Turbomatch code was the percentage deterioration in compressor efficiency calculated from correlated cascade data. This deterioration reaches a high level of 11 % when the fouling particle size is 254 microns. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} model based on reaction the rmodynamics {{has been developed}} to simulate basic oxygen steel making process for predicting hot metal composition inside Linz-Donawitz (LD) converter with respect to <b>blowing</b> time. This <b>mode</b> l also contributes to-wards the prediction of sloping phenomenon taken place during basic oxygen steel mak-ing process. Modelling of basic oxygen steel making process has significant utility as productivity and lining life of Basic Oxygen Steelmaking(BOS) is highly dependable upon mass, momentum, energy transfer and rigorous interaction among metal,slag and gaseous phases. Comprehensive thermodynamic model of basic oxygen steel making pro-cess has been developed to predict the bath composition and temperature as well as de-carburization rate dynamically based on relevant blowing process parameters. One of the striking features of this developed model {{is the first time}} prediction of temperature vari-ation depending on evolving bath composition and generated heat from bath composition dependent feasible reactions and their extent. Moreover, this {{numerical model}} does not require off gas analysis to maintain its dynamic nature of prediction. A true attempt for the benefit of steel industry is made for predicting slopping initiation time for particular blowing condition based on correlation with model predicted decarburization rate and critical decarburization rate for bloating of metal droplet. In connection to that, formation of foamy slag and sloping possibility have been studied using thermodynamic modelling followed by multiphase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation technique. The CFD simulation has been carried out taking different turbulence models along with vol-ume of fluid method (VOF) using ANSYS 15. 0 software. CFD work demonstrates change in bath deformation profile during blowing period and also identifies the locations of dif-ferent vortexes formed owing to supersonic oxygen jet penetration.
