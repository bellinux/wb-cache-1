The next unit, {{instead of}} being multiplied by 20, as called for by the vigesimal system, was multiplied by 18 {{in order to provide}} a rough approximation of the solar year (hence producing 360 days). This 360-day year was called a tun. Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, two level discriminative {{learning}} for audio events recognition in sport broadcasts archive is described. The audio events recognition {{is based on}} the idea that audio events are composed of <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Basic</b> <b>units</b> are some elementary events. Audio events used for semantic interpretation (mid-level concepts) are presented as a combination of the <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> Models for the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> are GMM models. Each 5 frames of audio data are recognized using models of the <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> Each mid-level concept is described by the distribution of the <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> The distribution of the <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> in each class of segment corresponding to mid-level concepts is considered as a macro model of this class. For events recognition the tree based framework is used. In each level of the tree two macro models are compared. The two level discriminative {{learning for}} macro models is applied. First discriminative training level is on the level of <b>basic</b> <b>units,</b> second is on the level of macro models. The suggested approach is compared with maximum likelihood decision and SVM with polynomial kernel. The results of experiments indicate significant improvement in comparison with the conventional approaches in the task of acoustically closely audio events recognition...|$|R

5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, but the majority of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E

5|$|Before 1846, Gray {{had been}} firmly {{opposed to the}} idea of {{transmutation}} of species, in which simpler forms naturally become more complex over time, including via hybridization. By the early 1850s, Gray had clearly defined his concept that the species is the <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> of taxonomy. This was partly the result of the 1831–1836 voyage during which Darwin discovered the differentiation of species among the various Galápagos Islands. Local geography could produce variances, like in the Galápagos and Hawaii, which Gray did not get to study in depth as he had wanted. Gray was insistent that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species, that like begat like. This concept was critical to Darwin's theories. Gray was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution.|$|E
5|$|By the 5th century, {{structures}} with small-scale domed cross plans existed {{across the}} Christian world. Examples include the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the martyrium {{attached to the}} Basilica of San Simpliciano, and churches in Macedonia and {{on the coast of}} Asia Minor. Small brick domes are also found in towers of Constantinople's early 5th century land walls. Underground cisterns in Constantinople, such as the Cistern of Philoxenos and the Basilica Cistern, were composed of a grid of columns supporting small domes, rather than groin vaults. The square bay with an overhead sail vault or dome on pendentives became the <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> of architecture in the early Byzantine centuries, found in a variety of combinations.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E

5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>unit</b> of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The {{block is}} {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} ofmammalian species harbor a tandem repeat in exon III of the geneencodingdopamine {{receptor}}D 4 (DRD 4), a receptor associated with cognitive functions. In this study, a DRD 4 gene exon III tandem repeat from the order Cetacea was identified and characterized. Included {{in our study}} were samples from 10 white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus albir-ostris), 10 harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), eight sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), and fiveminkewhales (Balae-noptera acutorostrata). Using enzymatic amplification followed by sequencing of amplified fragments, a tandem repeat com-posed of 18 -bp <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> was detected {{in all of these}} species. The tandem repeats in white-beaked dolphin and harbor por-poisewerebothmonomorphic and consistedof 11 and 12 <b>basic</b> <b>units,</b> respectively. In contrast, the sperm whale harbored a polymorphic tandem repeat with size variants composed of three, four, and five <b>basic</b> <b>units.</b> Also the tandem repeat in minke whale was polymorphic; size variants composed of 6 or 11 <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> were found in this species. The consensus sequences of the basic unitswere identical in the closely related white-beaked dolphin and harbor porpoise, and these se-quences differed by a maximum of two changes when com-pared to the remaining species. There was a high degree of similarity between the cetaceanbasic unit consensus sequences and those from members of the horse family and domestic cow, which also harbor a tandem repeat composed of 18 -bp <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> in exon III of their DRD 4 gene. Consequently, the 18 -bp tandem repeat appears to have originated prior to the differentiation of hoofed mammals into odd-toed and even-toed ungulates. The composition of the tandem repeat in cetaceans differed markedly from that in primates, which is composed of 48 -bp repeat <b>basic</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R

The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to adjust nonlinear regression models for the green beans production and to identify the plot size which provides the best explanation and adjustment to the models. The authors used two field and two protected environment (plastic tunnel) trials in the autumn-winter and spring-summer seasons. The logistic and von Bertalanffy models were adjusted for average weight of green beans accumulated after multiple harvests and with different plot sizes. The models presented similar estimates and the same parameters estimates in all the plot sizes. The logistic model provided estimates closest to the reality, showing the best description performance for the average weight of pods during the productive cycle. In the autumn-winter season, plot size of 14 <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> (28 plants in the cultivation line direction) {{in the field and}} of two <b>basic</b> <b>units</b> (four plants in the cultivation line direction) under the plastic tunnel provide a good quality in the models adjustment.
