By using cylinder-type {{eccentric}} shaft vibration exciter with consistent amplitude vibrator {{mounted on the}} side panel screen box and V-belt driven by a motor which produced centrifugal force, forcing the screen box vibrate. Screen side plate is made of high quality steel plate with bolt or rivets connection on side panels, beams, ring groove and chassis. Furthermore, the vibrators mounted on panel screen box are rotated by the motor through the coupling, provided a centrifugal inertial force to vibrate sieve. The materials on the inclined surface of sieve screen would be impulse by screen box to produce a continuous throwing motion. Thus, as the materials and screen surface encountered the particles of materials which smaller than sieve will through the sieve to achieve classification of materials.|$|E
40|$|At the 2011 Yale Chemical Biology Symposium, Jason Gestwicki {{presented}} a novel yet intuitive approach to drug screening. This method, which he termed “gray box” screening, targets protein complexes {{that have been}} reconstituted in vitro. Therefore, the gray <b>box</b> <b>screen</b> can achieve greater phenotypic complexity than biochemical assays but avoids the need for target identification that follows cell-based assays. Dr. Gestwicki’s research group {{was able to use}} the gray <b>box</b> <b>screen</b> to identify myricetin as an inhibitor of the DnaK-DnaJ chaperone complex.

When map object is set by the map layer manager, map coordinate system is set by the boundary <b>box.</b> <b>Screen</b> coordinate system is set according to the size of view panel. If the screen coordinate system and the map coordinate system are set, the number of coordinate converters is calculated for conversion of the two systems, which enables a free conversion of MSNS screen coordinate and the GML map coordinate. The coordinate converter changes the screen coordinate to the map coordinate when a user sets the target area in the mobile sensor network field. And it changes the map coordinate to the screen coordinate when the map, the target area and the sensors are visualized in MSNS.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a set of free {{software}} technologies, tools and programming languages that are used for application development and the utilization of these tools on the development of a specific application named ZIDEC. Nowadays, we can hardly imagine life without computers, and even though the word computer more or less reminds us of the hardware <b>box,</b> <b>screen,</b> keyboard and computer mouse, the true value of problem solving is brought to us by computer applications and software. During the evolution of software, two main streams appeared: commercial ownership solutions and free ware. In these rough economic times many individuals and companies realize the importance of economical behaviour. One of the possible ways of economizing is changing commercial solutions with free ware. In this diploma paper I have tried to choose from the many free ware solutions and find those that help in developing and up-keeping applications such as project management, code revisions, virtualization of development environment and the choice of programming language. Along with the choice of software, this paper describes the concept of setting a development environment in a virtual machine. One of the main reasons to use free ware is of course economizing, saving on the costs of development and up-keeping of the applications. The main goal of the developed application ZIDEC is to simplify and speed up the long term process of calculating the seismic resistance of masonry building. The application is fully used in the Karlovšek d. o. o. company. ...|$|E
40|$|Toxicology faces {{enormous}} {{challenges in}} a world in which we are exposed to thousands of chemicals and millions of mixtures thereof. In response, radically new approaches need to be developed. A milestone in this direction is the vision of the national research council (NRC) of the USA "Toxicity testing in the 21 st century: A vision and a Strategy". Currently, an alliance formed by the national toxicology program (NTP) and the chemcial genomics centre (NCGC) of the NIH and the computational toxicology centre (NCCT) of the EPA is testing whether this new strategy can realistically form the basis for future public health decisions. The visionrequires a radical paradigm shift in the approach to safety assessments, and turns the commonly known procedures upside down. Where animal experiments used to be the most important technology, the future is seen in the strength of in vitro and in silico approaches based on human material. Toxicity testing starts today with an initia lblack <b>box</b> <b>screen</b> on animals, sometimes followed by mechanistic studies, while the new vision approaches hazard assessment bottom up. The procedure would begin with in vitro tests to definethe perturbated pathways. To fill remaining gaps of knowledge a limited and targeted testing in animals would then be performed as potential second step. This means nothing less than changing toxicology, from being a predominantly observational craft and regulatory support discipline, to becoming again a natural science with all its dimensions. The background, the implications and parallel European trends are discussed here for interested Europeans. JRC. I. 2 -In-vitro Toxicolog...|$|E

Modal characteristic analysis and static analysis on the whole unit of <b>screen</b> <b>box</b> were done, and natural frequencies and modal shapes in the top 15 orders were obtained, distribution regularities of stress and deformation of {{each part of the}} <b>screen</b> <b>box</b> under the static load were revealed, providing the necessary basis for the improvement design and research on <b>screen</b> <b>box.</b> 1 Structure and working principle of the combining vibrating screen Basing on the traditional vibrating screen with double amplitudes and different frequency, a new type vibrating screen with higher productivity and screening efficiency for large screen and light structure is developed. Its biggest innovation lies in setting two kinds of vibration parameters in <b>screen</b> <b>boxes</b> of two separate units respectively, two kinds of vibration parameters are high-frequency with small amplitude and low frequency with large amplitude. The innovation keeps the advantages in screening efficiency and productivity of the traditional vibrating screen with double amplitudes and different frequency, it also solves design difficulty of elastic coupling in the traditional vibrating screen with double amplitudes and different frequency, so it is full of broad application prospect. The whole structure of the screen is shown in Fig. 1...|$|R
30|$|Another {{mechanism}} of resistance, antixenosis, was assayed {{based on the}} preference of test lines by the BPH for feeding. This study {{on the level of}} antixenosis was conducted simultaneously with the conventional seed <b>box</b> <b>screening</b> test (Heinrichs et al. 1985). The first scoring was recorded after 24  h of infestation of BPH nymphs at two to three-leaf stages of plants and next scoring was done after every 24  h for number of BPH nymphs per hill until 90 % of TN- 1 starts wilting. Genotypes which were most preferred by BPH were declared as susceptible and do not possess antixenosis mechanism and vice versa, after comparing with the load of BPH nymphs on susceptible and resistant checks following the method of Heinrichs et al. (1985). Each genotype was replicated three times and the whole experiment was repeated twice to attain more accurate results and appropriate conclusion.|$|R
