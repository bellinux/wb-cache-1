5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to {{in the title of}} his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of gearshift for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual <b>baking</b> <b>oven.</b> In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{a visionary}} who {{produced}} designs and ideas {{far ahead of}} their time. He {{was the first to}} describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage gearshift, dough-kneading machine, perpetual <b>baking</b> <b>oven,</b> marine salvage process, quadruple-effect evaporator, and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation and left him isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.|$|E
25|$|Barbecuing {{encompasses}} {{four or five}} distinct {{types of}} cooking techniques. The original technique is cooking using smoke at low temperatures—usually around 240–280°F or 115–145°C—and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), known as smoking. Another technique, known as baking, used a masonry oven or <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> that uses convection to cook meats and starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking occurs at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting for a few hours.|$|E

It had tapestry hangings to the wall, and cushions both to the carved chairs and deep windows, which looked out into the street, the whole storey projecting into close proximity with the corresponding apartment of the Syndic Moritz, the goldsmith on the opposite side. An oaken table stood in the centre, and the gallery was adorned with a dresser, displaying not only bright pewter, but goblets and drinking cups of beautifully-shaped and coloured glass, and saltcellars, tankards, &c. of gold and silver.|$|E

25|$|When cooking over a campfire, it is {{possible}} to use old-style lipped cast-iron Dutch <b>ovens</b> as true <b>baking</b> <b>ovens,</b> to prepare biscuits, cakes, breads, pizzas, and even pies. A smaller baking pan can be placed inside the ovens, used and replaced with another as the first batch is completed. It is also possible to stack Dutch ovens on top of each other, conserving the heat that would normally rise from the hot coals on the top. These stacks can be as high as 5 or 6 pots.|$|R

50|$|The {{way it was}} {{prepared}} {{is related to the}} way houses used to be built in western Finland, that is with the <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> separate from the heating oven. In eastern Finland, where the oven used to be heated every day, it was more common to eat freshly baked bread and to cook various kinds of long-stewed oven foods like the Karelian hot pot.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{porridge}} was {{a staple}} food {{in much of}} Northern Europe and Russia. It was often made from barley, though other grains and yellow peas could be used, depending on local conditions. It was primarily a savoury dish, with meats, root crops, vegetables and herbs added for flavor. Porridge could be cooked in a large metal kettle over hot coals or heated in a cheaper earthenware container by adding hot stones until boiling hot. Until leavened bread and <b>baking</b> <b>ovens</b> became commonplace in Europe, porridge was a typical means of preparing cereal crops for the table.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of modern cereal <b>baking</b> <b>ovens</b> are tunnel ovens with multiple zones, {{each of which}} is individually controlled. A baking profile is set by the oven operator, which describes the target temperatures and air velocities in each of the zones {{along the length of the}} oven. There may be up to ten zones in modern tunnel ovens; it is thus a complex procedure to generate an optimum profile. A computer numerical model was developed to model the baking process and to make predictions of the biscuit temperature, heat flux and moisture content through the bake.

50|$|Litchfield {{was posted}} to Katherine in 1944 as District Officer {{covering}} the region from Borroloola to Kalkarindji and south {{as far as}} Daly Waters. Katherine was being developed as a provisioning centre by the Australian Army. Litchfield was required {{to move away from}} his profession often to accommodate the necessary constructions of kilns, <b>baking</b> <b>ovens,</b> laundries and other essential equipment to service the growing defence population. He also supervised the construction of the Manbulloo Abattoirs, now a World War II heritage site. He also designed and supervised the construction of houses and buildings suited to Katherine's climate, including the Katherine Museum.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the rear}} kitchen wing has been modernized. An {{original}} cooking fireplace and <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> remains in the frame portion, which also has other older finishes.

5000|$|The {{original}} occupations of {{the first}} inhabitants are represented by the buildings now within the museum. Some were building trades, such as carpenters and a stonemason, and probably built their own properties. The plot would be fenced in and a simple cottage with a stove and <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> built. Other buildings might be provided for domestic animals. In time, the buildings would expand {{around the perimeter of}} the plot, enclosing a courtyard.|$|E
50|$|The job may be {{delivered}} to the coating booth or hangers in any fashion, most commonly using either hands or pliers. After passing through the booth, or tank, and getting coated, the workpiece then either goes into a <b>baking</b> <b>oven</b> or {{out into the open}} air to allow the paint to cure on the part. In spray coating, many different spray nozzles may be used depending on the desired paint consistency and the shape of the workpiece.|$|E
5000|$|The {{settlement}} {{may have}} begun life as a small short-lived military establishment guarding a crossing of the River Kennet. This was replaced by local circular farming huts around AD 70 and a Roman-style rectangular building fifty years later. Activity involved <b>baking</b> <b>ovens,</b> malting tanks and grinding stones. After another fifty years, this {{was replaced by a}} large two-storeyed winged corridor villa with integral bath suite. This building went through a number of changes over the subsequent centuries, notably a major rebuilding around AD 270. The villa had a number of mosaics and there were detached workshops, barns and a large gatehouse.|$|R

Yitzhak Magen and Yuval Peleg entered the discussion commenting on how one could feed such large numbers of community members: [...] "Were we to accept {{the claim that the}} sect lived at Qumran for about 170 years, we would expect to find hundreds of cooking and <b>baking</b> <b>ovens</b> as well as thousands of cooking pots." ...|$|R

50|$|Four main {{models of}} AGA are {{currently}} in production: two-, three-, four- and five-oven versions, with the four- and five-oven versions wider than the others. The two-oven model has three doors behind which are the burner, roasting oven and simmering oven. The newer three-oven model also includes a <b>baking</b> <b>oven,</b> the four-oven version also has a warming oven and warming plate on the top, and the five-oven has an additional slow-cooking oven. All models have two hotplates — a boiling plate and a simmering plate. The cookers come {{in a range of}} different colours, but the most popular is the original cream.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{elements}} demonstrate the Belgian American presence: place names (Brussels, Namur, Rosiere, Luxemburg, Charleroi), a local French patois, common surnames, unique foods (booyah, trippe, jutt), the Kermesse harvest festival and architecture. Many original wooden structures belonging to Belgian Americans were destroyed in a firestorm which swept across southern Door County in October 1871; a few stone houses (made of local dolomite) survived. More common are 1880s red-brick houses, distinguished by their modest size and gable-end, bull's-eye windows. Some houses have detached summer kitchens, with <b>baking</b> <b>ovens</b> appended to the rear. The Belgians, {{many of them}} devout Catholics, also erected small roadside votive chapels like those in their homeland.|$|R
50|$|Maria and Giuseppe Nacchio owned a small Italian-American vitalian artisan bread bakery where Maria made baked-style soft pretzels. The bakery {{was located}} {{in the heart of}} an Italian-American neighborhood, in South Philadelphia. During the 1920s, her son, Edmund, saw a {{business}} opportunity with the popularity of the soft pretzel and the family recipe. He started a factory to bake them in larger quantities. He combined the manual skills of workers hand-twisting the pretzels with a conveyor system of equipment, imported from Germany, that moved the pretzels to a soaking solution and through <b>baking</b> <b>ovens.</b> The mass production operation thereby became the Federal Pretzel Baking Company.|$|R
25|$|Acoma Pueblo {{has three}} rows of three-story, apartment-style {{buildings}} which face south {{on top of}} the mesa. The buildings are constructed from adobe brick with beams across the roof that were covered with poles, brush, and then plaster. The roof for one level would serve as the floor for another. Each level is connected to others by ladders, serving as a unique defensive aid; the ladders are the only way to enter the buildings, as the traditional design has no windows or doors. The lower levels of the buildings were used for storage. <b>Baking</b> <b>ovens</b> are outside the buildings, with water being collected from two natural cisterns. Acoma also has seven rectangular kivas and a village plaza which serves as the spiritual center for the village.|$|R
