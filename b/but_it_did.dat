5|$|Portraits of Mary {{show that}} she had a small, oval-shaped head, a long, graceful neck, bright auburn hair, hazel-brown eyes, under heavy lowered eyelids and finely arched brows, smooth pale skin, a high forehead, and regular, firm features.

5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> {{not reflect the}} numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than {{to that of a}} modern warship.|$|E
5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> become more emotional.|$|E

On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E
5|$|Alien {{opened in}} American theaters on May 25, 1979. The film had no formal premiere, yet moviegoers {{lined up for}} blocks to see it at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood where a number of models, sets, and props were {{displayed}} outside to promote it during its first run. Religious zealots {{set fire to the}} model of the space jockey, believing it to be the work of the devil. In the United Kingdom, Alien premiered at a gala performance at the Edinburgh Film Festival on September 1, 1979, before starting an exclusive run at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on September 6, 1979, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not open widely in Britain until January 13, 1980.|$|E

5|$|Although the Navy was {{satisfied}} with the investigation and its results, others were unconvinced, and in October 1991, amid increasing criticism, Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation. This second investigation, handled by independent investigators, was hampered {{by the fact that}} most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, {{also referred to as}} amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> periodically publish good stories. In the end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E

Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are officially used by the Georgian Orthodox Church alongside Mkhedruli. Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia called on people to use all three Georgian scripts.|$|E

To his great surprise he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.|$|E

There were 44 on hand on 19 July 1944. By this time they were relegated to training duties with the 1st Training Armoured Division. A company of R-2s was sent to Transnistria with the ad-hoc Cantemir Mixed Tank Group on 24 February 1944, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>did</b> not see combat before being withdrawn on 28 March 1944.|$|E

In response, Boyce proposed buying the Post Office Department for $300million (USD), {{claiming that he}} would reduce postal rates by half, eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations, establish a rural postal express, pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings, and return profits over seven percent.

As of 2007, it grossed to ¥1.22 billion ($10.8 million) in the Japanese box office. It became the seventh most popular anime film released in Japan during 2005. In a theatrical chart from the same year, Conqueror of Shamballa ranked as the seventh best anime film from 2005, and as the 47th best film in overall.|$|E
