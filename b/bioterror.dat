5|$|The 1985 Rajneeshee {{assassination}} {{plot was}} a conspiracy {{by a group of}} high-ranking followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho) to assassinate Charles Turner, the then-United States Attorney for the District of Oregon. Rajneesh's personal secretary and second-in-command, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), assembled the group after Turner was appointed to investigate illegal activity at Rajneeshpuram. Turner investigated charges of immigration fraud and sham marriages, and later headed the federal prosecution of the 1984 Rajneeshee <b>bioterror</b> attack in The Dalles, Oregon.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver gave {{a speech}} in the United States House of Representatives in which he {{asserted}} that the Rajneeshees {{were involved in the}} <b>bioterror</b> attack in Oregon. At a series of press conferences in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes, including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a Jefferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram. Turner was never physically harmed, and had retired by 1995.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 Rajneeshee <b>bioterror</b> {{attack was}} the food {{poisoning}} of 751individuals in The Dalles, Oregon, through the deliberate contamination of salad bars at ten local restaurants with Salmonella. A leading group of followers of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho) {{had hoped to}} incapacitate the voting population of the city so that their own candidates would win the 1984 Wasco County elections. The incident {{was the first and}} single largest bioterrorist attack in United States history. The attack is one of only two confirmed terrorist uses of biological weapons to harm humans since 1945, the other being the 2001 anthrax attacks across the USA.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{followers}} (called Rajneeshees) of charismatic leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now {{known as}} Osho), {{were convicted of}} a 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner, and an additional unindicted eighth member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. The perpetrators were high-ranking followers within the Rajneeshee organization. Prosecutors in the case stated that the perpetrators had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head {{an investigation into the}} group's activities in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon. Turner's investigation focused on sham marriages organized by the group, as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud, and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the 1984 Rajneeshee <b>bioterror</b> attack in The Dalles, Oregon. Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators included: Ma Anand Sheela, Sally-Anne Croft, Chief Financial Officer of Rajneeshpuram; Susan Hagan, head of {{security}} at Rajneeshpuram, Catherine Jane Stork, who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered {{to be the}} actual murderer; Ann Phyllis McCarthy, fourth-in-command of Rajneeshpuram; and co-conspirators Alma Potter, Carol Matthews, Phyllis Caldwell and Richard Kevin Langford. Two of the conspirators obtained false identification to purchase handguns out-of-state, stalked Turner, and planned to murder him near his workplace in Portland, Oregon. The assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later, {{as a result of}} the investigation by federal law enforcement into the <b>bioterror</b> attack in The Dalles and other illegal acts by the Rajneeshpuram leadership.|$|E
25|$|The alleged crimes, {{which he}} stated had been {{committed}} without his knowledge or consent, included the attempted murder of his personal physician, poisonings of public officials, wiretapping and bugging within the commune and within his own home, and a <b>bioterror</b> attack on the citizens of The Dalles, Oregon, using salmonella to impact the county elections. While his allegations were initially greeted with scepticism by outside observers, the subsequent investigation by the US authorities confirmed these accusations and resulted in the conviction of Sheela and several of her lieutenants.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 efforts refocused on {{activities}} in the United States and Rajneesh relocated to a facility known as Rajneeshpuram in Wasco County, Oregon. Almost immediately the movement ran into conflict with county residents and the state government and a succession of legal battles concerning the ashram's construction and continued development curtailed its success. In 1985, following the investigation of serious crimes including the 1984 Rajneeshee <b>bioterror</b> attack, and an assassination plot to murder US Attorney Charles H. Turner, Rajneesh alleged that his personal secretary Ma Anand Sheela and her close supporters had been responsible. He was later deported from the United States in accordance with an Alford plea bargain.|$|E

500|$|Ma Anand Sheela served 29 {{months in}} a minimum {{security}} federal prison for charges related to assault, attempted murder, arson, wiretapping and the 1984 <b>bioterror</b> attack in The Dalles, and moved to Switzerland after her release from prison in 1988. The assassination conspiracy was discovered after Sheela had left the United States, and as of 1999 she was still wanted by federal law enforcement {{for her role in}} the plot, and risked extradition if she crossed the Swiss border. Switzerland declined an extradition request from the United States, and instead tried her in a Swiss court. Sheela was found guilty of [...] "criminal acts preparatory to the commission of murder" [...] in 1999, and sentenced to time already served.|$|E
500|$|The book Emerging Infectious Diseases: Trends and Issues {{cites the}} 1984 Rajneeshee <b>bioterror</b> attack, {{along with the}} Aum Shinrikyo group's {{attempts}} to use anthrax and other agents, as exceptions to the belief [...] "that only foreign-state supported groups {{have the resources to}} execute a credible bioterrorism event". According to Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons Since 1945, these are the only two confirmed uses of biological weapons for terrorist purposes to harm humans. The incident was the single largest bioterrorist attack in United States history. In the chapter titled: [...] "Influencing An Election: America's First Modern Bioterrorist Attack" [...] in his 2006 book Terrorism on American Soil: A Concise History of Plots and Perpetrators from the Famous to the Forgotten, author Joseph T. McCann concludes: [...] "In every respect, the Salmonella attack carried out by the cult members was a major bioterrorist attack that fortunately failed to achieve its ultimate goal and resulted in no fatalities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Having {{left the}} music business, Gärdestad made a brief and {{unsuccessful}} attempt at acting and shortly thereafter began exploring meditation and Eastern religions. He {{became involved with}} the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh movement and publicly renounced his earlier life. Rajneesh was also known as Osho. In an interview with Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet in mid-1983, he said he no longer wanted to be addressed as [...] "Ted Gärdestad", his name was now Swami Sangit Upasani. Like all Bhagwan disciples, he wore clothes in a specific shade of orange. Gärdestad distanced himself from his friends {{in the music business}} and his family. His involvement in the movement gradually took over his life and his personality changed dramatically. In June 1983, one month before his second child with actress Ann Zacharias was born, he unexpectedly left his family and friends and moved to the movement's headquarters in Oregon, USA. Three years later, after Rajneesh was convicted for immigration fraud, tax evasion, embezzlement of his disciples' funds and <b>bioterror</b> attacks on the citizens of The Dalles and subsequently deported from the US, Gärdestad's family persuaded him to move back to Sweden. His severe mental health problems became increasingly apparent.|$|E

Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and former acting undersecretary and deputy undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate said, [...] "...we haven't had any major <b>bioterror</b> attacks the anthrax attacks of 2001 so this sort of leaves the public's consciousness and that's when complacency sets in." ...|$|E
