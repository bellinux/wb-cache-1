40|$|When the Australian Reptile Park was on {{the verge}} of closure in the early 1980 s, its founder and director, Eric Worrell, wrote a vindication of his park. Worrell {{discussed}} the important role of the park in the production of venom, primarily that of snakes and funnel web spiders but also of other creatures such as wasps and <b>blue</b> <b>ringed</b> <b>octopus,</b> which were used for life saving anti venoms. He told how venom from the Park was sent to research institutions around the world, of the positions of authority he held and of the Imperial and national honours he had received. In addition to this scientific contribution, Worrell claimed that his Australian Reptile Park was also important as the first man made tourist attraction on the Central Coast. He ended with a challenge, ‘What do Central Coast people want as the future of the Australian Reptile Park?’ Worrell was a desperate man, fighting for the park which was his boyhood dream, his home and his livelihood. He hoped to garner popular, political and economic support for the Australian Reptile Park by drawing attention to its many contributions. While we are treating his broader claims in our larger project, this paper will focus on his assertion that the Australian Reptile Park played a key role in the development of tourism on the Central Coast. It will be argued that Eric Worrell and the Australian Reptile Park were indeed at the forefront of the rapidly emerging car-based ‘drive tourism’ of the 1960 s and 1970 s...|$|E
50|$|All Cub Scouts first work {{on their}} Squirrel badge to {{complete}} the Cub Scout joining requirements, which include knowing the Cub Scout motto and salute. The Squirrel badge is dark <b>blue</b> <b>ringed</b> in gold, with a button loop. Once the Squirrel badge requirements have been completed, the Cub Scout will continue with the age appropriate program. The next three ranks are diamond-shaped red badges based upon the Boy Scouts of America Cub system from the 1940s through 1972. Rabbit Cub Scouts (second grade) work toward the Rabbit badge. Deer Cub Scouts (third grade) work toward the Deer badge. Initially, Bear work toward the Bear Badge. After earning the Bear badge, Scouts work toward earning activity badges. Finally, Bear Cub Scouts work toward the Arrow of Light. The Arrow of Light award is the highest award available to Cub Scouts. It requires the Scout to have earned the Bear Scout badge and eight activity badges. In addition to the skill and activity requirements of the preceding ranks, the Arrow of Light requires Scouts to learn the Scout Promise and Scout Law, in preparation for advancing to the Scout level. Earning the Arrow of Light will help earn many of the requirements for the lower ranks of the Scout level. Cub Scouts wear the badge above the left pocket.|$|R

50|$|The Eyrie {{is made of}} pale {{stone and}} {{primarily}} decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers have been described to be warm and comfortable, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale {{can be seen from}} its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with <b>blue</b> flowers and <b>ringed</b> by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord's chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush velvet curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit.|$|R

Forewing: {{base and}} costal margin densely irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales; a broad short velvety black bar across middle of cell, another along the discocellulars {{and a third}} beyond apex of cell, this last with superposed spots of crimson where the bar crosses the bases of {{interspace}}s 5 and 8; a crimson-centred black spot in middle of interspace 1; an irregularly curved prominent postdiscal series of dusky-black spots, so arranged as to leave a narrow edging of the creamy-white ground colour beyond, which is traversed by the black veins; the upper four spots of the postdiscal series fused to form a broad, continuous, but short, curved band; the terminal margin broadly dusky black; the cilia white. Both the dusky-black band and the postdiscal dusky-black markings subhyaline (almost glass like). Hindwing: base and dorsal margin broadly dusky black, the inner margin of the black colouration on the latter deeply but irregularly bi-emarginate; a crimson-centred black spot near base of interspace 5, another just beyond the middle of interspace 7, followed by a very conspicuous curved postdiscal series of five dull <b>blue</b> ocelli <b>ringed</b> with black and centred with white, and a narrow diffuse dusky black terminal band; cilia as in the forewing. Underside: similar, with a glassy appearance. Forewing: with the markings of the upperside visible by transparency; the white scaling of the upperside replaced by scale-like hairs of the same colour; the only scaled markings are the medial and apical transverse black bars in cell, three small crimson spots beyond and the black-encircled crimson spot in middle of interspace 1. Hindwing: the white scaling along the basal half of the costal margin nearly as on the upperside, the rest hair-like as {{on the underside of}} the forewing; a broad basal band of four crimson or vermilion-red spots followed by a discal irregular series of five similarly-coloured spots, the lower three formed into a short obliquely transverse band above the tornal angle; all the crimson spots encircled more or less obsoletely by black rings, and the following prominently centred with white: the spot in interspaces 2 and 5 and the basal and medial spots in interspace 7.Female similar; the dusky black irroration on the upperside of the forewing more extensive and formed into a narrow irregular band below the cell, which runs between the crimson spots beyond the cell-apex and the crimson spot in interspace 1; the crimson spots are larger, with an additional spot in interspace 6 of the forewing and a pretornal spot on the hindwing. Underside: similar to that of the male but all the red spots much larger and with white scaling in the centre. Antennae nearly black, with only a few white specks, head with brownish-yellow pubescence; rest of the thorax and abdomen covered densely with long white hairs which also clothe, more or less narrowly, the dorsal margin of the hindwing.|$|R
40|$|By Peter Fisher, RMIT University and D Trainham, RMIT University Welcome to the CBD. Take {{a look at}} all {{the glass}} masonry and asphalt. The streets are canyons. Apart from a tree in the footpath, or a Peregrine Falcon way overhead, there’s little nature to be seen. Nature is absent in these landscapes, or more {{correctly}} “hardscapes”. This runs counter to the trend to put urban people, and particularly children, back in touch with the natural world. Grass, flowers, birds, butterflies and worms are increasingly rare in a world of denser development. There’s no sense of season apart from flowers in street-side stalls. As much as five-sixths of our CBDs are buildings: asphalt dotted with street trees. The ratio of biomass to hard mass in such environments is minute. Trees help cool environments, while buildings increase heat absorption and reflection. This suggests cities are very poorly adapted to a projected 4 - 6 °C global warming – a world where it may prove impractical to ever again grow large trees especially in hot pavements. Greening the city Research is revealing that, although we may have left the savanna, it’s still a part of our wiring. Hospital patients who have a view of some sort of nature recover faster and need less medication. A recent article in Nature, “City living marks the brain”, points to a far higher incidence of mental illness in urban versus rural areas. Green exercise can act as a therapeutic intervention, which is doubly important in the hyper-dense environment envisaged by outspoken developers. However it’s not like that everywhere. In places such as Vancouver, setbacks are mandatory for high rises and view corridors have been preserved. Elsewhere, European and American cities have undertaken benchmark projects to soften the impact of roads. Hamburg and Madrid have roofed their inner autobahn/highway to create parklands. Portland tore down its waterfront freeway to do the same, as Seattle is currently doing. Other North American cities inspired by Michael Hough’s evocative book “Cities and Natural Processes” have returned rivers, ravines, swamps, and parkland to their natural state. Then there’s New York City’s High-Line, a greenway for walking, running or simply sitting. San Francisco has its “parklets” and sidewalk gardens. A Melbourne model? In Melbourne virtually no public greenspace has been created within the grid proper since City Square in 1980, and even it has succumbed to the granite treatment and been chopped in half. Hardscape is on the rise with planning applications for more than 50, 000 new apartments in 200 developments in and around the CBD. Few have recognised the “green-shift” now underway globally and recently embraced by Perth.   New York’s High Line, a place for city-dwellers to escape to a little nature. Flickr/Ed Yourdon   It’s helpful for urban designers seeking a context to immerse themselves in the pre-white settlement setting. Proto-Melbourne would be unrecognisable: wattle in bloom, kangaroo grass, kookaburras and kingfishers along the river. Above where Queens Bridge now stands were The Falls, where clear freshwater cascaded; and to the west, amid a swamp with masses of water birds, lay a shimmering <b>blue</b> lagoon <b>ringed</b> by pigface. Each city has its own tale of what followed. Take a look at these two images of The Falls – this one at foundation and this one in 1857 – that’s an awful lot of trashing in just 22 years. Such squandered landscapes defy replication at their original scale but we can replicate them on a small scale. It is a matter of rethinking the user experience. Roof gardens (including food crops), green walls, plant-draped atriums, water features and borrowed scenery are ways of using interiors, walls, and ceilings. Buildings have long been in the front line of fighting climate change through “green building” rating systems. It’s time they were enlisted to reforge our linkages with a landscape that people have all but forgotten. The opportunities are highlighted by a design for a three sided hospital in Spain – one side is a green wall; another is solar panels in the colors of a butterfly about to go regionally extinct; and the third is a vertical farm that will feed people in the hospital. It is one example of the ways our cities can become truly green.
