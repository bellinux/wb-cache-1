5|$|After {{the success}} of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, wanted a {{spacecraft}} launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

5|$|Peckham {{also studied}} other fields, however; and {{was guided by}} Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon's views {{on the value of}} {{experimental}} science. Where Peckham met Bacon is not known, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been at either Paris or Oxford. Bacon's influence can be seen in Peckham's works on optics (the Perspectiva communis) and astronomy.|$|E

5|$|The {{counterculture}} of the 1960s had rapidly {{declined by}} {{the start of}} the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be many former members of the counter-culture and hippie subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.|$|E

5|$|After {{debating whether}} {{abolition}} of slavery would best proceed gradually or at once, with compensation to loyal Union men or without, the Convention resolved to abolish slavery immediately without compensation on April 10, 1864. It abolished the viva voce voting {{and called for}} secret balloting for electing state officials. Immediately on its proclamation, the Constitution of 1864 was enforceable only in areas under Union control, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> serve as Virginia's fundamental law until the Constitution of 1870 went into force.|$|E

5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|An African prefecture, {{centered}} in Carthage, {{was established in}} April 534, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> teeter {{on the brink of}} collapse during the next 15 years, amidst warfare with the Moors and military mutinies. The area was not completely pacified until 548, but remained peaceful thereafter and enjoyed a measure of prosperity. The recovery of Africa cost the empire about 100,000 pounds of gold.|$|E
5|$|Cancel the Ground Combat Vehicle – If the Army {{reconditioned}} {{its current}} Bradley instead of replacing them, the current {{capability of the}} IFV fleet could be maintained through 2030.

5|$|How these {{clusters}} {{are formed}} {{is not yet}} known, but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters. Why M31 has such clusters, while the Milky Way does not, is not yet known.

5|$|On 16 February 2006 {{the unit}} reorganized as the 82d Sustainment Brigade under the Army's modular {{transformation}} redesign. As {{a part of}} this redesign, the brigade was removed from the command of the 82d Airborne Division and made a separate, independent unit. It would continue to support the 82d Airborne Division, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be able to take on different missions when deployed. Instead, its mission is to support all US Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) units stationed at Fort Bragg while generating sustainment capabilities to meet rotational demand and respond to future contingencies.|$|E

5|$|The 189th Infantry Brigade {{was first}} {{constituted}} and activated on 24 June 1921 in the Organized Reserves, and {{assigned to the}} 95th Division. The brigade was organized in 1922 at Muskogee, Oklahoma. However, {{it would never be}} mobilized for World War I, and thus never received participation credit for the action. It would stay active as a reserve brigade for the interwar period, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> never be used.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need to walk through the goods yard and along the main line, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|The laurels for the day’s action {{went to the}} defenders. The aim of the Luftwaffe was to {{wear down}} the Fighter Command without {{suffering}} excessive losses in the process, and in this it had failed. It cost the attackers five aircrew killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, for each British pilot casualty. In terms of aircraft, it had cost the Luftwaffe five bombers and fighters for every three Spitfires and Hurricanes destroyed in the air or on the ground. If the battle continued at this rate the Luftwaffe would wreck Fighter Command, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> come close to wrecking itself in the process.|$|E

5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E
5|$|As we {{understand}} the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be proper for her to intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
