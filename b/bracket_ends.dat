The numbers beside these brackets are labeled for the first example only (purple). Beside the upper bracket, the times from tide tables correspond to time ratios between fitted control points. The bracket below each dotted curve retains these ratios but has been shifted to align the <b>bracket</b> <b>ends</b> to the fitted points outside the tsunami window. Times inside the tsunami window are computed by applying the predicted ratios to this shifted bracket. Those times, evaluated on the polynomial, give the computed heights which, like the computed times, are in bold font.|$|E

Thus, compared to double elimination, there is no major stage of the L Bracket final played, and there is no game between the winners of the W and L Brackets.|$|R

The accusations against his party platform, along with Day's relative inexperience compared to decades-experienced fixtures like Clark and Chrétien, led to the party fading from contention.|$|R
