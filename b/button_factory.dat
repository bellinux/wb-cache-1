25|$|In the Federal era, the Old State Road {{was built}} to connect the newly founded county seat of Georgetown with the state capitol of Dover. With emancipation, African Americans took up free lives {{in the area and}} the railroads came after the American Civil War. Ellendale was founded in the early 19th century and {{surveyed}} in 1866-1867. Ellendale was first settled near the Morris Tavern Crossroads, near the current Old State Road and Main Street intersection, by a handful of families. The city is rumored to be named after either the daughter of Whig Republican Alfred Short, a state legislator, the wife of Dr. John S. Prettyman who laid out the town, or the daughter of Mr. Thomas William Dale, the chief engineer of the railroad survey team. Ellendale's current site was established in 1866 when the families moved east to settle around the Junction and Breakwater Railroad Depot. On July 16, 1873 the Ellendale Methodist Episcopal Church purchased land to erect a church, parsonage, and school. Ellendale's economy rapidly advanced as the RJ Clendaniel Sawmill, the Jester & Reed Canning Company, a brick yard, several peach evaporating and canning companies, basket factory, the Phillip J Ritter Ketchup Company, Ellendale Excelsior Company, and <b>button</b> <b>factory</b> opened in the town. The railroad was purchased by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1905 and that same year the town was formally incorporated. In February 1895, the Queen Anne's Railroad was authorized by the Delaware legislature to extend its rail lines across the state to Lewes. The goal of the company was to establish a direct link between Baltimore and Delaware's coastal resorts. This additional rail line passed through Ellendale and provided passenger, freight, and mail services as far west as Queenstown, Maryland (with links to Baltimore via steamship) and east to Rehoboth Beach (with links to Cape May, New Jersey via steamship) with the first passenger trains passing through in 1897. A post office was erected, with a large second floor room that was used by the Independent Order of Red Men, a break off group of the Improved Order of Red Men that was established in the town, at the site of what is now the Town Hall.|$|E

5000|$|The North American button {{industry}} {{began with}} a German craftsman named John Boepple, who had made buttons from seashells, horns and antlers in his native country. John Boepple immigrated to the United States in 1887 and {{found that there were}} vast beds of thick freshwater mussel shells in Muscatine, Iowa, which he determined were perfect for making [...] "pearl buttons". By 1891, Boepple had set up a shop and was in business as a craftsman making buttons. John Boepple's buttons became popular locally and to ward off competition he was very protective of the secrets of his trade. Since freshwater mussels were so common and the profit potential in making [...] "pearl" [...] buttons was so high, some of Boepple's staff who knew his techniques were [...] "recruited" [...] by other businessmen to start competing businesses. Within a few years there were <b>button</b> <b>factories</b> {{along the length of the}} Mississippi River.|$|R
5000|$|By 1899, {{there were}} sixty <b>button</b> <b>factories</b> {{in the river}} states of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin, {{employing}} 1,917 people. Millions of [...] "pearl" [...] buttons were made annually. This new button industry quickly placed a huge ecological demand on the freshwater mussels of the Midwestern United States. In 1899, clammers harvested over sixteen million pounds of freshwater mussel shells in Wisconsin alone, and the harvest of freshwater mussels in the late 1890s numbered {{in the tens of}} millions of pounds per year. Freshwater mussel beds which had previously been so dense as to virtually [...] "carpet" [...] miles of river bottom were almost completely harvested, leaving just a few living freshwater mussels per mile. In 1908, in what was deemed a drastic response to the rapidly declining freshwater mussel population, the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries established a mussel propagation program at the Fairport Biological Station. The purpose of this program was to regulate the overharvesting of freshwater mussels. Freshwater mussels are slow growing sessile organisms, and their reproduction is complex. The button industry in North America was in trouble because years of overharvesting the freshwater mussels had caused a shortage of freshwater mussels and pushed many of the species close to extinction. The invention of plastic and its use in manufacturing buttons during World War II replaced shell [...] "pearl" [...] buttons as the most popular product, and foreshadowed the end of the pearl button manufacturing business.|$|R
