Oda ruined his chances of a medal by doing an extra triple jump, resulting in a loss of 13 points. Florent Amodio used music with lyrics, which is not allowed in competitive skating with the exception of ice dancing. He was not given the normally required one-point penalty because not enough judges voted for it.|$|E

2500|$|Using this {{leftover}} money, Lynch {{decided to}} experiment on making {{a work that}} was a mix of animation with live action, producing a four-minute short called The Alphabet (1968). The film starred Lynch's wife Peggy as a character known as The Girl, who chants the alphabet {{to a series of}} images of horses before dying at the end by hemorrhaging <b>blood</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> her bed sheets. Adding a sound effect, Lynch used a broken Uher tape recorder to record the sound of his baby daughter Jennifer crying, creating a distorted sound that Lynch felt to be particularly effective. Later describing what had inspired him, Lynch stated that [...] "Peggy's niece was having a bad dream one night and was saying the alphabet in her sleep in a tormented way. So that's sort of what started The Alphabet going. The rest of it was just subconscious." ...|$|E
2500|$|His fast bowling {{gave him}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Typhoon Tyson", and despite his short career he achieved status as the fastest England bowler in living memory. Don Bradman called him [...] "the fastest bowler I have ever seen" [...] and Richie Benaud agreed, writing [...] "For a short time, Frank Tyson blasted all-comers". Tom Graveney wrote 'I cannot believe any bowler was faster than Tyson at that time'. When fielding in the slips he had 'to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still. the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots'. His Northants colleague Jock Livingston said 'When really firing, Tyson was the quickest of all {{over a period of}} three or four overs'. Livingston had seen Harold Larwood bowl Bodyline and batted against the Australian fast bowlers Miller and Lindwall in the Sheffield Shield. At the Aeronautical College in Wellington, New Zealand in 1955 metal plates were attached to a cricket ball and a sonic device was used to measure their speed, with Tyson's bowling measured at [...] 89mph (142km/h), but he was wearing three sweaters on a cold, damp morning and used no run up, Brian Statham bowled at 87mph (139km/h). He certainly bowled faster than 89mph in matches, and Tyson claimed that he could bowl at 119mph (190km/h), but this cannot be proven. The best that can be said was that he was noticeably faster than his contemporaries Ray Lindwall, Keith Miller, Fred Trueman, Brian Statham, Peter Heine and Neil Adcock. His great fast bowling rival Fred Trueman ‘was forever being told that when it came to bowling I was very fast, but on his day Frank Tyson was faster than me' and it was Tyson who kept Trueman out of the England team in 1954–55. When they played together in a Gentlemen v Players match at Scarborough in 1957 the captain Godfrey Evans insisted Trueman bowl into the headwind so as to give the faster Tyson the advantage of the tailwind. Dickie Bird, the famous England umpire, wrote [...] "he was certainly the quickest bowler I ever seen through the air, and on one occasion the quickest bowler I never saw through the air". When playing for [...] at Scarborough in 1958 [...] "I opened the innings against him and hit his first three deliveries through the off side for four. With supreme confidence I went on to the front foot for the fourth ball. Tyson dropped one short. It reared up and hit me on the chin. I went down as if I'd just been {{on the receiving end of}} a right hook...I still carry the scar to show my folly that day. There was <b>blood</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> and I saw stars. I could hear bells ringing in my head...". Dickie came back to score his then highest first class score of 62 and Tyson took 4/30. When they met in Australia in 1998–99 Tyson joked 'You're looking well Dickie. See you still have the scars though'.|$|E

2500|$|Peña {{began his}} wrestling career as the enmascarado (masked) {{character}} El Genio (Spanish for [...] "The Genius") on April 8, 1974. After wrestling as El Genio {{for a couple}} of months Peña got his uncle's blessing to adopt the Espectro name and began wrestling as Espectro Jr. [...] Peña wore the [...] "venom green" [...] mask and trunks like Espectro, but unlike the original he wrestled barefoot most of the time. As Espectro Jr., Peña blended a good solid wrestling foundation with various psychological antics to create a character, while being a hated rudo (Heel or [...] "bad guy") character drew the crowd's attention and soon he found himself challenging the top wrestlers of the 1970s for both the Mexican National Welterweight Championship and the Mexican National Middleweight Championship, two of the top championships in Mexico at the time. While a gifted performer in the ring backstage he was described as more of a quiet, thoughtful person who would often talk about how he would change Lucha Libre and add more character and showmanship to it. In 1980 Peña decided to change wrestling personas, giving the Espectro Jr. outfit and name to his cousin Jose Elías Pinceno, who has wrestled as Espectro Jr. since then. Instead of working as Espectro Jr., Peña came up with a totally original character of his own called Kahoz (sometimes spelled Kahos or Khaoz), a sinister masked rudo character who invoked various dark spirits as part of his pre-match ritual. Many have likened the Kahoz character to one of Lucha Libre original showmen, Murciélago Velázquez. Kahoz would often carry a bag of live pigeons to the ring with him, releasing them at his opponent and then making it seem like he ripped the head of one of the pigeons and smeared the fake <b>blood</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> himself or his opponent. To Peña the Kahoz character was not about winning championships, but about the psychology of the character and actually scaring the audience, so while he did not win any titles as Kahoz it was considered a huge success and he main evented shows all over Mexico. While Peña had the mind for wrestling his body could not handle the heavy main event schedule that he wrestled as Kahoz and by 1985 he gave up the gimmick to work as Espectro de Ultratumba ("The Ghost from Beyond the grave"), giving the Kahoz gimmick to Astro Rey instead. Astro Rey's Kahoz was nowhere nearly as important nor as successful as Peña as Astro Rey lacked the charisma and theatrics of the original. Peña only worked as Espectro de Ultratumba for a short period of time, giving the gimmick to his cousin in 1986. Peña tried working as [...] "Dalia Negra" [...] but his body could not take the strain, forcing Peña to retire in 1986. Peña would briefly wrestle as [...] "the Rose" [...] in 1994 but only worked a handful of matches. Peña's final match at the 2001 Guerra de Titans where he wrestled, and lost to Cibernético.|$|E
