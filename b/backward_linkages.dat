The results of the analyses suggest a distinct characteristic between the industries generating <b>backward</b> and forward <b>linkages</b> respectively. This study found that there is a high correlation between the total and net forward linkage, suggesting the low import requirements for those industries generating forward linkage. These are in contrast with the results found for those industries generating <b>backward</b> <b>linkage,</b> where the correlation between the total and net <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> is lower.

30|$|The <b>backward</b> {{and forward}} <b>linkage</b> {{analysis}} was constructed {{to figure out}} the key sector in the economy. Industries have effects on the whole economy through their demand and supply relations with other industries.

Generally, the <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> is derived from the Leontief model (Jones 1976; Cella 1984; Miller and Blair 2009). Leontief inverse matrix B shows the direct and indirect requirements of domestic output per unit of final demand in each sector, and it is also referred as the output multiplier. Output multiplier defines the total <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> as b_j^t = ∑_i = 1 ^nb_i,j. The superscript t refers to as the “total linkage” of each industry.|$|R

It examined {{the effect of the}} Leontief inverse on emissions changes into the specific effects of forward <b>linkage,</b> <b>backward</b> <b>linkage,</b> the average of forward/backward linkage and kernel structure. Our SDA method solves the problem of parameter independence completely. The accuracy of those effects has been improved mathematically compared with conventional methods. For example, it was detected that <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> contributes to an increase in GHG emissions, while conventional methods erroneously determine a decrease. The results of the SDA confirmed that forward linkage and kernel structure contributed to a rise in GHG emissions, and that <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> consistently increased emissions in the three periods. Some sectors have robust linkage in the supply chain with consistently increasing emissions, which should be preferentially improved to mitigate their indirect GHG emissions in Japan.|$|R

A forward linkage is created when investment in a particular project encourages investment in subsequent stages of production. A backward linkage is created when a project encourages investment in facilities that enable the project to succeed.

Information concerning to integration of Upstream- downstream in Cassava agribusiness at Sub-Province of Ponorogo is very needed, conducted by that reason, it’s important to have research about “Integrate Analysis of Upstream-downstream in Cassava agribusiness at Sub-Province of Ponorogo". Target of this Research are (1) to analyze input and output of cassava agribusiness at upstream (farming exertion) in Sub-Province of Ponorogo. (2) To analyze input and output of cassava agribusiness at downstream (Agro-Industry) in Sub-Province of Ponorogo. (3) To analyze integration of upstream-downstream in cassava agribusiness at Sub-Province of Ponorogo. (4) To analyze the impact of cassava Agro-Industry growth to cassava farming exertion (<b>backward</b> <b>linkage)</b> in Sub-Province of Ponorogo. The research place determined by purposive in Sub-Province of Ponorogo, because the area represent the central of cassava commodity in East Java, and Ponorogo also a cassava industry to take place. Determination of industrial perpetrator sample conduct by purposive methods, that is fresh cassava industry processing to become tapioca flour, furthermore it takes to be unit analyze in course of research. Intake of perpetrator of cassava Farming sample exertion got by multistage sampling method, passing by following phases: 1. Choose one district of centre producer cassava, that is District of Ngrayun 2. Choose one countryside with high production, that is Countryside of Baosankidul and one countryside with low production, that is Countryside of Temon 3. Taking 10 responder of cassava Farming exertion at each countryside. Source of secondary data is Statistical Bureau Center, cassava industry processor and district office. Primary data obtained by direct responder (perpetrator of cassava Farming exertion and cassava industry processor), passing interview use spacious observation and questionnaire. Analysis of Input-Output used to predict Integration of Upstream-downstream in Cassava agribusiness. Analysis process obtained by descriptive quantitative methods, by mean of verbal with table’s description. Input and of output of upstream and downstream sector expressed in set of the amount at rupiah (Rp) value and physical value, while result of analysis expressed in the tables form with value of <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> and forward linkage. The conclusion from result of research is to following: (1) Input of agribusiness of cassava upstream sub-system (Farming exertion) in Sub-Province of Ponorogo consist of input of Farming exertion from Farming exertion, input of Farming exertion from industry and input of Farming exertion from society. The biggest input proportion come from society in the form of labors, so that farming exertion represent labors intensive sector. (2) Input of agribusiness of cassava downstream sub-system (Agro-Industry) in Sub-Province of Ponorogo consist of industrial input from agriculture, industrial input from industrial and industrial input from society. The biggest Input proportion comes from agricultural sector in the form of raw material (fresh cassava). The Output of cassava Agribusiness at downstream sub-system in Sub-Province of Ponorogo is flour of tapioca (Starch). (3) Integration of Upstream-downstream in Cassava agribusiness at Sub-Province of Ponorogo, can be seen from <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> index and forward <b>linkage</b> index. <b>Backward</b> <b>linkage</b> index of agricultural sector higher than forward linkage index, this means that agricultural sector more capable to stimulate its downstream industry than upstream industry. Forward linkage index of industrial sector higher than <b>backward</b> <b>linkage</b> index, this means that industrial sector more capable to stimulate its upstream sector than downstream sector. (4) downstream Sector (Cassava industrial processing) in Sub-Province of Ponorogo had proven at significant level to influence growth of upstream sub-sector (Farming exertion) with value make an index to equal to 1, 35. So that downstream sub-sector (Cassava industrial processing) can be made as key sector, its meaning if processing industrial sector developed will be able to pull other sectors...|$|R
