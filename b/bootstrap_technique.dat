40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to propose one {{practical}} approach to use non-parametric <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> in risk management processes especially for analyzing risk factor data, because of the fact that in most decision making cases data sizes and expert`s comments are too small for analyzing risk factor data or often there are no parametric distributions on which significance can be estimated; therefore, standard statistical techniques do not always provide answers to complex risks questions. The non-parametric bootstrap is a powerful technique for assessing the accuracy of a parameter estimator in situations where conventional techniques are not valid and also non-parametric <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> is extremely valuable in situations where data sizes are too small. <b>Bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> for decreasing the SD of risk factor data is described as well. Confidence intervals for risk factors are also obtained by means of bootstrap resampling technique. To make it more understandable, an application example is also provided.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a <b>Bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> for {{multistage}} sampling with large entropy samplingdesigns at each stage. Our method enables easy variance estimates for both linear and non linearstatistics. It consists in a correction of the method originally proposed by Gross (1980) for simplerandom sampling, and known not to be consistent for multistage sampling. The idea consists in buildinga pseudo-population of pseudo Primary Sampling Units, based on the original sample. The first stagedrawing is performed, but the second stage drawing is corrected to get the usual variance estimate in thelinear case. Two stage sampling with simple random sampling at each stage and self-weighted two stagesampling are covered by the proposed <b>Bootstrap</b> <b>technique.</b> The method is evaluated through a limitedset of simulations. ...|$|E

If the distributions of the classes are independent Normal distributions, and their parameters are known, the Bhattacharyya Bound can be calculated explicitly.

Both the theory and simulation results indicate that the estimator of the Bhattacharyya Bound given by traditional methods is seriously biased especially when the training sample size is small. By applying the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> to the problem of estimating the Bhattacharyya Bound, we introduce several bootstrap schemes for this purpose.

40|$|The main role of {{a modern}} {{electric}} power system is to provide cost-effective electrical energy to its customers {{with a high degree}} of reliability. Hence, power system utility must ensure that they could provide adequate and quality energy supply to customers. However, this has been a major challenging issue experienced by most countries as the power system blackout is unexpectedly occurs. There are various approach used to prevent from the occurrence of power system blackout in order to ensure the sustainability and efficiency of energy supply. Generally, power system blackout can be mitigating by having risk assessment analysis. There are various methods used in evaluating the risk of a power system. This research focuses on a method to perform risk assessment of power system that takes into account the system failure indices and uncertainty of unavailable load variations estimated by using the <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> and fuzzy set technique. The risk of the system is measured by using the expected energy not supplied (EENS) index as well as the probability of load curtailment (PLC). The <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> is a sampling method which provides simplest way to perform risk assessment of a power system. Furthermore, it also requires very little assumptions to carry-out the risk analysis and it is imperative for a small size of available information. The application of <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> is important to assess the risk indices at every level of system uncertainty. The IEEE 24 -bus Reliability Test System (RTS) and 2737 -bus Polish system are used as a case study in the analysis of system risk severity based EENS and PLC. Comparative studies have been made on the risk assessment of the power system determined by using <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> and fuzzy set which has been developed by other researcher...|$|E
40|$|Student {{surveys of}} {{classroom}} climate can provide teachers and researchers with valuable information about instruction. These surveys {{are becoming a}} critical component in policy efforts to assess and improve teaching. Advocates note that students are natural observers of their classroom environments, have extensive and rich knowledge of their teachers, and that student ratings of teacher practice can be predictive of important outcomes, such as student academic and socio-emotional development. Inferences about a teacher's instructional practice are often based on aggregated student survey responses, and a key step in assessing the appropriate uses of the information collected from student surveys is to understand the dimensions of classroom climate or instructional practice that are discernible when looking at student responses aggregated by classroom. This dissertation proposes a new approach for exploring the dimensionality of aggregated student ratings. This approach also {{has the potential to}} provide validity evidence supporting the use of student surveys as measures of instructional practice in both formative and summative evaluation. Specifically, this dissertation applies a non-parametric cluster <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> to a multilevel covariance structure analysis framework that allows researchers to evaluate and investigate psychometric models when data is collected from students and teachers are the objects of measurement. This approach is extended to applications where teachers are clustered within schools. The cluster <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> is demonstrated on a realistic dataset to illustrate how the methods may be used to investigate the dimensions of teacher professional practice that are discernible on a state-wide student survey of instructional practice. The results of this dissertation demonstrate that the proposed cluster <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> can be used in conjunction with maximum likelihood estimation to yield accurate parameter estimates, and that for sufficiently large sample sizes, test statistics and standard errors based on the cluster <b>bootstrap</b> <b>technique</b> will yield valid inferences about the psychometric properties of aggregated survey responses...|$|E
