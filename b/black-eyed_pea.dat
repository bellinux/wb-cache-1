25|$|The <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea,</b> black-eyed bean or goat pea, a legume, is a {{subspecies}} of the cowpea, grown {{around the}} world for its medium-sized, edible bean.|$|E
25|$|The first {{domestication}} probably {{occurred in}} West Africa, but the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> is widely grown {{in many countries}} in Asia; it was introduced into the Southern United States {{as early as the}} 17th century in Virginia. Most of the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> cultivation in the region, however, took firmer hold in Florida and the Carolinas during the 18th century, reaching Virginia in full force following the American Revolution. The crop would also eventually prove popular in Texas. Throughout the South, the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> is still a widely used ingredient in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States. The planting of crops of black-eyed peas was promoted by George Washington Carver because, as a legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. Black-eyed peas contain calcium (41mg) folate (356 mcg), protein (13.22 g), fiber (11.1 g) and vitamin A (26 IU), among other nutrients, all for less than 200 Calories, in a 171-g, one-cup serving.|$|E
500|$|Cultivated cowpeas {{are known}} by the common names <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea,</b> {{southern}} pea, yardlong bean, catjang, and crowder pea. They were [...] domesticated in Africa and {{are one of the}} oldest crops to be farmed. A second domestication event probably occurred in Asia, before they spread into Europe and the Americas. The seeds are usually cooked and made into stews and curries, or ground into flour or paste.|$|E

50|$|Hoppin' John, {{also known}} as Carolina Peas and Rice is a peas and rice dish served in the Southern United States. It is made with <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> (or red cowpeas such as iron and clay peas in the Southeast US) and rice, chopped onion, sliced bacon, and {{seasoned}} with salt. Some people substitute ham hock, fatback, or country sausage for conventional bacon; additionally, a popular and healthy modern alternative to pork {{is the use of}} smoked turkey parts. A few use green peppers or vinegar and spices. Smaller than <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas,</b> field peas are used in the Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia; <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> are the norm elsewhere.|$|R

500|$|The first written {{reference}} of {{the word}} 'cowpea' appeared in 1798 in the United States. The name was most likely acquired due to their use as a fodder crop for cows. <b>Black-eyed</b> <b>pea,</b> a common name used for the unguiculata cultivar group, describes {{the presence of a}} distinctive black spot at the hilum of the seed. Black-eyed peas were first introduced to the southern states in the United States and some early varieties had peas squashed closely together in their pods, leading to the other common names of southern pea and crowder-pea. Sesquipedalis in Latin means [...] "foot and a half long", and this subspecies which arrived in the United States via Asia is characterised by unusually long pods, leading to the common names of yardlong bean, asparagus bean and Chinese long-bean.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> — While these peas {{are almost}} never {{referred}} to as [...] "soup beans", the preparation in the Appalachian region is almost identical. <b>Black-eyed</b> <b>Peas,</b> sometimes called blackeye peas, are most common where Appalachian culture intersects with lowland soul-food and coastal food cultures. Like Hoppin' John, <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> became common as a new year's dish. However, since rice was {{not a part of}} mountain culture, the peas were cooked with pork (usually hog jowls) like soup beans and served with stewed tomatoes and collard greens. This dish becomes less common as you move into more isolated mountain communities.|$|R

2500|$|The common {{commercial}} {{variety is}} called the California Blackeye; it is pale-colored with a prominent black spot. In the American South there are countless varieties, many of them heirloom, that vary in size from the small lady peas to very large ones, as {{may be seen in}} the state and municipal farmers' markets. [...] The color of the eye may be black, brown, red, pink or green. [...] All the peas are green when freshly shelled and brown or buff when dried. [...] A popular variation of the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> is the purple hull pea; it is usually green with a prominent purple or pink spot. The currently accepted botanical name for the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> is Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, although previously it was classified in the genus Phaseolus. [...] Vigna unguiculata subsp. dekindtiana is the wild relative and [...] Vigna unguiculata subsp. sesquipedalis is the related asparagus bean. Other beans of somewhat similar appearance, such as the frijol ojo de cabra (goat's eye bean) of northern Mexico, are sometimes incorrectly called black-eyed peas, and vice versa.|$|E
