40|$|We {{studied the}} {{long-term}} impact of wildfire on the vegetation dynamics of sand grasslands in a forest-steppe vegetation mosaic in Central Hungary (Kiskunság). Long-term permanent quadrat monitoring {{was carried out}} from 1997 to 2008. We sampled the forest-steppe mosaic both in burnt and unburnt areas in 100 patches altogether using 1 m × 1 m quadrats. The effect of fire and precipitation on vegetation dynamics was characterized by patch type transitions between years. Patch types were defined by means of Cocktail method. Nine patch types of sand grasslands were altogether identified. The least productive patch types, bare soil and cryptogam dominance, did not occur in the <b>burnt</b> <b>patches,</b> while annual dominated patch type appeared only in <b>burnt</b> <b>patches.</b> The frequencies of patch type changes were significantly higher in <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> than in unburnt ones, independently on time after fire. All the eight patch types found in the unburnt patches proved permanent, while in the <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> only four of seven were so. The relative frequency of patch type changes did not correlate with precipitation in the vegetation period in the unburnt patches, while positively correlated in the <b>burnt</b> <b>patches.</b> It was concluded that the long-term difference in grassland dynamics between the unburnt and <b>burnt</b> <b>patches,</b> i. e., the excess of the patch type transitions in the burnt grasslands, is due to increased drought sensitivity of the grassland, which is the consequence of {{the elimination of the}} woody component of the forest-steppe vegetation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test remotely sensed indicators of burning efficiency for savanna and forest fires in Central Africa. The timing of fire with respect to vegetation senescence, the rate of post-fire recovery of vegetation and the spatial pattern of burning were potential indicators of burning efficiency. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess whether the values of a vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (T-s) were different at different stages of the burning season for burnt and unburnt areas, fragmented and continuous <b>burnt</b> <b>patches,</b> and early and late fires. Results show that fires affect areas with the lowest NDVI and highest T-s values. Continuous and fragmented <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> are associated with vegetation covers in,different states prior to a fire. The rate of recovery of vegetation after a fire depends on ecotypes (periforests recover more slowly than savannas), burning intensity and completeness (areas affected by fragmented <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> recover more quickly than areas affected by continuous <b>burnt</b> <b>patches)</b> and timing of the fire (areas affected by early fires recover more quickly than areas affected by late fires). The results suggest that combustion efficiency is lower for fragmented burnt areas compared to continuous burnt areas. It would thus be possible to decrease uncertainties in estimates of trace gas emissions from fires by replacing fixed burning efficiency values in emission models by values that would vary in space and time, based on measures of the spatial pattern of burnt areas as detected by remote sensing...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how {{different}} herbivores make forage patch use choices explains how they maintain an adequate nutritional status, {{which is important}} for effective conservation management of grazing ecosystems. Using telemetry data, we investigated nonruminant zebra (Equus burchelli) and ruminant red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus subspecies camaa), use of <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> in a landscape mosaic of nutrient-poor, old grassland interspersed with young, recently burnt, nutrient-rich grass patches. The Mkambati Nature Reserve landscape {{on the east coast}} of South Africa provided large grazers with a challenge in finding and using appropriate patches in which to forage to meet their nutritional requirements. In Mkambati, grassland fires, mostly ignited by poachers, induce regrowth of young nutrient-rich grass, which subsequently attract grazers. We tested if the study animals foraged more in <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> than in the unburned grassland and whether burnt patch use was related to the distance to the previously visited burnt patch, burnt patch size, burnt patch age, and distance to areas with high poaching risk using MANOVA. In general, zebra moved faster than red hartebeest, and both species moved faster in unburnt grassland than in <b>burnt</b> <b>patches.</b> Red hartebeest and zebra patch selection were influenced by interpatch distance, patch age, patch size, and poaching risk. A limited set of intrinsic traits, i. e., body mass, digestion strategy, and muzzle width, yielded different patch use rules for the two species. Large ungulates patch use behaviour varied among species and across conditions and was influenced by anthropogenic impacts such as poaching and changed fire regimes.

5000|$|To {{support a}} large {{population}} of grouse, gamekeepers employ heather burning techniques. This involves burning patches of heather on the moorland. A <b>burnt</b> <b>patch</b> allows fresh shoots to come through which are ideal nutrition for grouse. Burning is done in patches {{so that there is}} a variety of heather heights, on a rotation of between 8 and 12 years. While the short new shoots provide food, the taller, older heather provides cover and shelter for the grouse. Proponents claim that not only does heather burning help the grouse population thrive but it encourages other wildlife by creating a variety of habitats in moorland areas. However, one study suggests that burning heather has a large number of negative consequences on the diverse moorland environment, the underlying water table and the associated downstream rivers. The study suggested burning reduces Sphagnum moss growth and the density of macroinvertebrates which {{play a vital role in}} aquatic food webs by feeding on algae, microbes and detritus at the base of food chains before they themselves are consumed by birds, fish and amphibians and that it reduces the water content of the upper layers of peat which results in the peat being less able to retain exchangeable cations which are important for plant growth and resist acid rain. The study found that rivers draining burned catchments were characterised by lower calcium concentrations and lower pH relative to rivers draining unburned catchments and had higher concentrations of silica, manganese, iron and aluminium. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) are undertaking trials of controlled heather burning on their reserves at Loch Garten and Hobbister in order to “increase the suitability of the reserves for key breeding birds such as hen harriers, short-eared owls, merlins and curlews.” ...|$|R
30|$|Lespedeza cuneata is a {{perennial}} legume that was {{introduced into the}} USA as a forage species specifically because the species has persistence mechanisms that maintain its dominance under grazing.

30|$|Human-induced {{fire risk}} is usually checked by the {{distances}} to human infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, villages, and others. Chang et al. (2013) and Zhang et al.

At that, Knorr et al. (2014) showed that increasing population density can reduce fire frequency.

(2017): the authors showed that over the past 18  years, the globally burnt area declined by 25 % and the decrease has been largest in savannas and grasslands because of the agricultural expansion and intensification there. In our study, the presence of settlements was a rather important factor that increased the fire odds, while all spatial-temporal clusters of <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> occurred adjacent to settlements or roads.|$|E

40|$|The {{relatively}} recent exodus of Aboriginal people from {{parts of the}} Western Desert region of Australia has coincided with an alarming decline in native mammals and a contraction of some fire sensitive plant communities. Proposed causes of these changes, in what is an otherwise pristine environment, include an altered fire regime resulting from the departure of traditional Aboriginal burning, predation by introduced carnivores and competition with feral herbivores. Under traditional law and custom, Aboriginal people inherit, exercise and bequeath customary responsibilities to manage their traditional country. Knowledge of the fire regime during an estimated 40 000 years of Aboriginal occupation of these lands and the involvement of Aboriginal communities in contemporary land management are important issues to be addressed if conservation lands are to be managed appropriately.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study that investigates the implications of bushfires for the pattern of vegetation in the tropical savannas of northern Australia. Fire history maps for a dry season were produced using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for an area containing typical savanna landscape characteristics, and analysis of pattern was conducted using GIS and landscape ecological measures. Three images captured in the early, middle and late dry season in 1997 were used to produce an unsupervised classification which delineated the extent of <b>burnt</b> <b>patches.</b> These patches were labelled by using a mixture of ground truthing and on-screen assessment of the raw data and signature files for previously confirmed fire scars.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to understand the role of fires on land-cover changes, and conversely the role of vegetation cover as a controlling factor of fires. The study, which was conducted in a region at the savannah/forest transition in the southwestern part of the Central African Republic, explores the differential impact on land cover of early- and late-season fires and analyses burning regimes as a function of human use of the land. This was addressed using multivariate regression models between maps of land-cover change derived from remote sensing data, maps of burnt areas and a detailed map of ecotypes. In dense forests, burning is strongly associated with land-cover changes, while in savannahs the occurrence of (mostly) early fires does not lead to land-cover change. Fires associated with continuous and fragmented <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> have similar impacts on vegetation cover. Dense semi-humid forests in the study area were affected by a high level of burning due to land uses at their peripheries. The results confirm recent findings concerning human control on the timing of burning in savannahs. Early fires fragment the landscape and prevent the spatial diffusion of later damaging fires. Where no human settlements are present, late fires become more prevalent. Finally, the study measured an increase in vegetation cover in a few areas affected by very early burning. Using burnt area rather than active fire data allowed a better analysis of the spatial association between landscape attributes and burning events. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Serra Tombador Natural Reserve (STNR) is the largest private reserve located in Goiás State, and the fourth largest in the Cerrado biome. The present study aimed to map the burnt areas and to describe the spatial patterns of fire recurrence and its interactions with the classes of land-cover that occurred in STNR and its surroundings in the period between 2001 and 2010. Several Landsat TM images acquired around the months of July, August and September, coinciding with the region’s dry season when fire events intensify, were employed to monitor burnt areas. Fire scars were mapped using the supervised Mahalanobis-distance classifier and further refined using expert visual interpretation. Burnt area patterns were described by spatial landscape metrics. The effects of fire on landscape structure were obtained by comparing results among different land-cover classes, and results summarized in terms of fire history and frequencies. During the years covered by the study, 69 % of the areas analyzed had fire events. The year with the largest burnt area was 2004, followed by 2001, 2007 and 2010. Thus, the largest fire events occurred in a 3 -year cycle, which is compatible with {{other areas of the}} Brazilian savanna. The regions with higher annual probabilities of fire recurrence occur in the buffer zone around the park. The year 2004 also had the highest number of <b>burnt</b> area <b>patches</b> (831).

40|$|This {{study has}} {{examined}} {{the effect of the}} Department of Environment and Conservation's (DEC) prescribed burning on the leaf litter invertebrates of the Northern Jarrah Forrest in southwestern Australia. These burns are an important management practice to reduce fuel loads in forests, minimizing damaging wildfires. The fires are lit in either spring or autumn, and are intended to be cool and to leave a mosaic of <b>burnt</b> and unburnt <b>patches.</b> Although the invertebrate biota of Western Australia has evolved in a fire-prone environment the response of the leaf litter invertebrates to such regular burning is not well understood. The leaf litter of eucalypt forests supports a diverse invertebrate fauna which is essential for nutrient recycling, and a critical component of Western Australia's biodiversity. This study examines the effect of autumn and spring burns on the invertebrate fauna generally, but with particular reference to Apocrita (Insecta: Hymenoptera). The Apocrita are a keystone group that controls the other invertebrate populations through predation and parasitism and, although often present in low numbers, is considered to be possibly the most speciose invertebrate group (Saaksjarvi et al. 2004). Due to their low numbers Apocrita are considered to be vulnerable to events like burning, but little research has been conducted to confirm this hypothesis (Lasalle and Gauld 1993). Due to their host specificity, an analysis of apocrita can be used to determine other invertebrate populations and assess changes (Stephens 2005) ...|$|R
30|$|Veld {{fires are}} {{normally}} classified according {{to where they}} are burning e.g., surface fires which burn along the ground and crown fires which burn the upper parts of trees (Trollope et al. 1990; WWF 2001). The temperature of burning or intensity {{can also be used}} for further classifying fires, as fires can be classified as either cool or hot. Intensity {{is a measure of the}} release of heat energy per unit time, per unit length of fire front. Cool fires usually occur early in the dry season (late April to June) when there is still moisture in the grass and leaves, and are typically of low intensity (~ 2000 kW m- 1 of energy is released), while late dry season fires (August to September) occur when the grass and trees are very dry, and heat energy of up to 8000 k Wm- 1 is released, (Williams et al. 1998). Trollope & Tainton (1986) classified cool fires as fires with and intensity of < 1000 kJ s- 1 m- 1, while hot fires have intensity > 2001 kJ s- 1 m- 1. Hot fires are often made hotter and more destructive by the windy conditions in August, September and October and they are a combination of surface and crown fires (WWF 2001). Hot fires which occur during the driest part of the year are often very destructive; they completely wipe out all ground cover, unlike the cool fires which leave a mosaic of <b>burnt</b> and unburnt <b>patches</b> (van Wilgen 2009).|$|R
40|$|Savannah {{ecosystems}} exhibit constant transitions {{between states}} dominated by trees and states {{dominated by a}} combination of trees and grasses. Transitions between these states are driven by interactions between fire and herbivory. Bush encroachment (i. e. an increase in the density of woody vegetation) is often caused by anthropogenic disturbance such as climate change, invasive plants, fire control and livestock practices. Since bush encroachment alters the dynamics between fire and herbivory, it may have significant impact on savannah ecosystems. Two of the most common measures to mitigate bush encroachment are prescribed burning and bush clearing by mechanical treatments. We studied the effects of these two mitigation measures on ungulate space use in Lapalala Wilderness, a private conservation area within the Waterberg Biosphere Reserve, northern South Africa. Burning and bush clearing affected both the overall abundance and the species composition of ungulates at particular patches, but these effects were influenced by habitat and the type of bush clearing treatment. Contrary to our expectations, most species occurred less frequently in <b>burnt</b> <b>patches,</b> and also less frequently in patches that had been bush cleared. Our results suggest that combined effects of fire and bush clearing may have positive effects on grazers and negative effects on browsers. Although our sampling design did not allow us to fully resolve interactive effects of burning and bush clearing treatments across habitats, our study highlights {{the fact that there are}} complex ecological consequences of habitat alterations in savannah ecosystems.

40|$|Retrieve {{original}} file from: [URL] High herbivore densities and re-occurring {{fires are}} natural phenomenons that determine {{the structure and}} functioning of African savannas. Traditional burning practices have been intensified {{over the past years}} due to increased herbivore numbers. Insight how animals respond to fire is important to understand ecosystem functioning and for the use of fire as management tool. Until now studies have centred mainly on spatial relationships between herbivores and fires. Very little information exists on effects of temporal fire patterns on herbivore communities. To assess the effect of fire succession on herbivore species greatly differing in body mass we conducted experiments and observational studies on smaller scales and landscape scales. We investigated the response of herbivores on both short-term and long-term succession patterns. Rodent densities were affected by the presence of larger herbivores rather than by seasonal patterns and increased with the absence of large herbivores and increasing vegetation height. Both middle-sized and large herbivore species responded on short-term post-fire patterns with large species being the pioneer species on <b>burnt</b> <b>patches,</b> whereas buffalo was the only species that also responded on long-term post-fire patterns. Our results indicate that larger herbivores in interaction with fire influence rodents by both increasing and prolonging the predation risk they experience in these habitats. Furthermore grazer presence and the amount of rainfall may be two interacting factors that prolong fire patterns in the landscape. Particularly buffalo responded to fire patterns, most likely due to the higher intake levels of digestible plant material and increased forage efficiency. Herbivore response to fire histor...|$|E
30|$|In {{the study}} area, the {{occurrence}} of grass ignition is accidental and depends on man, but the area of fire spread is essentially determined by climatic parameters {{and the presence of}} inflammable material, i.e., dry grass. High March temperatures cause a rapid snowmelt and then a low sum of precipitation in April increases the inflammability of the abundant dry grasses on the former fields: the less the density of the tree layer, the higher the abundance of grass and the quantity of inflammable material. Similar results were obtained in studies on savanna–grassland communities in Africa and south-central Brazil: tree cover was found {{to be one of the}} main factors limiting fire there and the predominance of grassy fuel was the primary cause of the high inflammability of these communities (Archibald et al. 2009; Hoffmann et al. 2012; Baudena et al. 2015). A strong association of wildfire risk with an earlier spring snowmelt, and increasing spring and summer temperatures, was also shown for mid-elevation Northern Rockies forests (USA) (Westerling et al. 2006), where grassy inflammable material may be scarce, but the ignition process is similarly related to climatic parameters. Prichard et al. (2017) showed for several fire-prone ecosystems that fire odds are higher in places burnt before. For the Mediterranean region, Moreria et al. (2011) concluded that with increase of fire frequency, homogeneous landscapes covered by fire-prone vegetation are formed. Our results indirectly confirmed these findings: in our area, fire odds increased along the series A 12 -A 13 -A 14, and in that sequence also the area of burning and the frequency of fires increased; fire odds also increased with the extent of the patch size (log transformed) and the increase in the number of <b>burnt</b> <b>patches</b> in the surroundings.|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{allometry}} {{are important}} in explaining effects of fire and herbivory, for estimating biomass in forests, and so on. There has been extensive research on plant allometry in temperate and tropical forests, showing that plant architecture often adjusts to the elastic similarity model, but not in Brazilian savannas (cerrado). We studied allometry of Dalbergia miscolobium, Diospyros hispida, Erythroxylum suberosum, Miconia albicans, M. ligustroides, Schefflera vinosa, and Xylopia aromatica in a cerrado sensu stricto area that was affected by a fire in August 2006. We expected that the study species would not adjust {{to any of the}} allometric models considered common for forest species ("constant stress", "elastic similarity", and "geometric growth"), and that there would be differences in allometry in <b>burnt</b> and unburnt <b>patches.</b> We sampled two species in 60 5 × 5 m contiguous plots placed in three transects, and five species in 100 5 × 5 m contiguous plots placed in five transects, where we measured the diameters at soil level (DSL) and the heights of all shoots. We used standardized major axis regressions on log-transformed data. The regression slope between the height and DSL was higher than 1. 0 (p < 0. 05) for four species, showing a greater height than would be expected under geometric growth, not predicted by theoretical models. We found significant differences (p < 0. 05) in regression slopes and/or correlation coefficients between burnt and unburnt plots for five species, indicating that fire may influence plant allometry in the Brazilian cerrado, and that such a response is highly variable between species...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{selection}} by animals influences individual fitness, {{the abundance}} of local populations, {{and the distribution of}} species. Further, the degree to which individuals select particular resources can be altered by numerous factors including competition, predation, and both natural- and human-induced environmental change. Understanding the influence of such factors on the way animals use resources can guide species conservation and management in changing environments. In this study, we investigated the effects of a prescribed fire on small-scale (microhabitat) resource selection, abundance, body condition, and movement pathways of a native Australian rodent, the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes). Using a before-after, control-impact design, we gathered data from 60 individuals fitted with spool and line tracking devices. In unburnt forest, selection of resources by bush rats was positively related to rushes, logs and complex habitat, and negatively related to ferns and litter. Fire caused selection for spreading grass, rushes, and complex habitat to increase relative to an unburnt control location. At the burnt location after the fire, rats selected patches of unburnt vegetation, and no rats were caught at a trapping site where most of the understory had been burnt. The fire also reduced bush rat abundance and body condition and caused movement pathways to become more convoluted. After the fire, some individuals moved through burnt areas but the majority of movements occurred within unburnt patches. The effects of fire on bush rat resource selection, movement, body condition, and abundance were likely driven by several linked factors including limited access to shelter and food due to the loss of understory vegetation and heightened levels of perceived predation risk. Our findings suggest the influence of prescribed fire on small mammals will depend on the resulting mosaic of <b>burnt</b> and unburnt <b>patches</b> and how well this corresponds to the resource requirements of particular species...|$|R
40|$|Keywords: African savanna, biodiversity, Dichrostachys cinerea, different-sized {{herbivore}}s, fire, herbivore interactions, murid rodents, spatial heterogeneity Mankind {{has caused}} species extinction of many groups of organisms through the transformation and fragmentation of once continuous natural habitats. In {{order to protect}} and restore natural biodiversity hotspots such as the African savannas {{we need to understand}} the determinants of their community structure and species diversity. Evidence has accumulated that body size differences that balance species facilitation and competition interactions as well as spatial heterogeneity may be key factors in the functioning of these ecosystems. This study explores the ecological consequence of the interplay between murid rodents and large herbivore species in a South African savanna and investigates the effect of abiotic factors on community interactions. The herbivores studied showed strong interactions that were influenced by both fire and rainfall. Exclusion of large herbivores resulted in plant species composition changes and grass cover modifications, leading to higher rodent abundances. Middle-sized and large herbivore species responded to short-term postfire succession patterns with large species being the pioneers on recently <b>burnt</b> vegetation <b>patches.</b> Both middle-sized and large species affect murid rodents in the time of recolonisation burnt areas, mostly through increasing and prolonging their predation risk via grass cover changes. Additionally, the grass cover {{played a major role in}} the habitat selection and space use of grass-eating rodents, although the availability of high quality food resources was also important, especially with male and females having different priorities. Furthermore, the recruitment of the encroaching woody species Dichrostachys cinerea was not only positively (less competition for water and light with grasses) and negatively (higher risk of being trampled or desiccation) affected by large herbivores and rainfall but also influenced through predation by invertebrates and murid rodents. The findings of this study suggest that herbivore communities from very small (murid rodents) to very large (elephant) potentially interact in a South African savanna and that this interplay is of importance for the maintainance of the biodiversity in these ecosystems. Large herbivores influence murid rodents mainly through top-down effects (via grass cover modifications) rather than through competitive and facilitative interactions for food (bottom-up). Additionally, by changing the vegetation structure large herbivores may have an impact on the woody species recruitment, but to what extent this imposes a feedback on them remains unclear. Furthermore, the study supports the hypothesis that herbivores, in interaction with abiotic factors, strongly modify African savanna ecosystems. Under low rainfall conditions woody species recruitment is mostly limited by seed predators and browsers, while fire plays a bigger role under high rainfall conditions. However, fire seems to be one possible management tool to maintain spatial heterogeneity in savannas in order to sustain coexistence opportunities for different-sized herbivore species...|$|R
