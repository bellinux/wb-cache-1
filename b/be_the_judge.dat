2500|$|Taxation {{was also}} the subject of Federalist No. 33 penned {{secretly}} by the Federalist Alexander Hamilton under the pseudonym Publius.

[...] The Court found that it had a [...] "textually demonstrable commitment" [...] to interpret the clause, which, in this case, the Court did. The Court's interpretation was that the subject clause meant that the process that led to the expulsion of a member, duly sworn and enrolled upon the body's rolls, was the only method for a House to give effect to its power to determine the qualifications of its members.|$|E

2500|$|In 1841, the Admiralty in England {{decreed that}} the chief justice should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> in admiralty. This changed the {{previous}} practice of directing appointing a person to be judge. However, under Chief Justice Alfred Stephen, the vice-admiralty commission was given to Justice Samuel Milford instead. [...] Milford regularly sat in the court {{at least one day}} a week. However, when Milford was appointed the Resident Judge at Moreton Bay (being the precursor of the Supreme Court of Queensland, Stephen offered to resign his commission as judge in vice-admiralty. [...] The British authorities declined that request and advised that if Stephen was to resign his admiralty commission, by necessity, he would have to resign his commission as chief justice of the Supreme Court.|$|E
2500|$|... {{refers to}} [...] "God the Judge of all" [...] {{and the notion}} that all humans will {{eventually}} [...] "be judged" [...] is an essential element of Christian teachings. A number of New Testament passages (e.g., [...] and [...] ) and later credal confessions indicate that the task of judgement is assigned to Jesus. [...] states that [...] "neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment unto the Son". [...] refers to the resurrected Jesus as: [...] "he who is ordained of God to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>Judge</b> of the living and the dead." [...] The role played by Jesus in the judgement of God is emphasized in the most widely used Christian confessions, with the Nicene Creed stating that Jesus [...] "sits on the right hand of the Father; shall come again, with glory, to judge the living and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end". The Apostle's Creed includes a similar confession.|$|E
2500|$|The Union army {{managed to}} escape {{complete}} disaster because of the stout defense organized by Thomas on Horseshoe Ridge, heroism that earned him the nickname [...] "Rock of Chickamauga." [...] The army withdrew that night to fortified positions in Chattanooga. Bragg had not succeeded in his objective to destroy the Army of the Cumberland, but the Battle of Chickamauga was nonetheless the worst Union defeat in the Western Theater. Thomas urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted {{to prop up the}} morale of his general, telegraphing [...] "Be of good cheer. ... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers.

2500|$|Lines 53–57 {{feature the}} image of a singing poet, which is {{reminiscent}} of how the eclogue began. The poet himself will compete in a rustic environment against Orpheus and Linus, and Pan will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge.</b> Virgil's reference to Linus in this section symbolizes [...] "the symbiosis of Hesiodic song culture and erudite, 'bookish' poetics of the so-called Alexandrian poets", resulting in a [...] "uniquely Virgilian pastoral aesthetic." [...] Once the Golden Age will have arrived, the need for arms and soldiers will be obviated, and the competitive drive that—in the past—had fueled war will now fuel [...] "harmless [...] competition for rustic prizes." [...] Lines 60–61 address the birth of the supposed savior, featuring the poet speaking directly to the child; he urges the baby to smile at his mother, since she had just bore him. Lines 60–63 have proven throughout the ages to be a [...] "fascinating problem", and there is no clear consensus as to what exactly they mean. Nisbet claims that the final line is most likely a reference to a story about Hercules, who dined with Jupiter and took Juventas as his wife, although he noted it could also be a reference to a general Roman nursery saying.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the climax}} of the feud came during Fred Allen's parody of popular quiz-and-prize show Queen for a Day, which was barely a year old when Allen decided to have a crack at it on The Fred Allen Show—an episode that has survived for today's {{listeners}} to appreciate. Calling the sketch [...] "King for a Day", Allen played the host and Benny a contestant who sneaked onto the show using the alias Myron Proudfoot. Benny answered the prize-winning question correctly and Allen crowned him [...] "king" [...] and showered him with a passel of almost meaningless prizes. Allen proudly announced, [...] "Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where you will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> in a chicken-cleaning contest," [...] to which Benny joyously declared, [...] "I'm king for a day!" [...] At this point a professional pressing-iron was wheeled on stage, to press Benny's suit properly. It didn't matter that Benny was still in the suit. Allen instructed his aides to remove Benny's suit, one item at a time, ending with his trousers, each garment's removal provoking louder laughter from the studio audience. As his trousers began to come off, Benny howled, [...] "Allen, you haven't seen the end of me!" [...] At once Allen shot back, [...] "It won't be long now!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Frogs, Aristophanes {{attacks the}} new tragedy of Agathon and Euripides, {{opposing}} {{it to the}} old tragedy of Aeschylus. [...] In Aristophanes’ comedy, Dionysus, the god of theatre and wine, descends into Hades and observes a heated dispute between Aeschylus and Euripides over who {{is the best in}} tragedy. [...] Dionysus is engaged to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge,</b> and decides the outcome, not based on the merits of the two tragedians, but based on their political stance regarding the political figure, Alcibiades. [...] Since Aeschylus prefers Alcibiades, Dionysus declares Aeschylus the winner. [...] That contest provides the basic structure on which the Symposium is modeled as a kind of sequel: [...] In the Symposium Agathon has just celebrated a victory the day before, and is now hosting another kind of debate, this time it is between a tragedian, a comic poet, and Socrates. [...] At the beginning of the Symposium Agathon asserts that “Dionysus will be the judge”, and Dionysus is, though Alcibiades performs as surrogate for the god. [...] So the character, Alcibiades, who was the deciding factor in the debate in The Frogs, becomes the judge in the Symposium, and he now rules in favor of Socrates, who had been attacked by Aristophanes in The Frogs. [...] The Symposium is a response to The Frogs, and shows Socrates winning not only over Aristophanes, who was the author of The Frogs, but also over the tragic poet who was portrayed in that comedy as the victor.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{withdrew the}} {{remainder}} of his units to positions around Rossville Gap after darkness fell. His personal determination to maintain the Union position until ordered to withdraw while his commander and peers fled earned him the nickname Rock of Chickamauga, derived from a portion of a message that Garfield sent to Rosecrans, [...] "Thomas is standing like a rock." [...] Garfield met Thomas in Rossville that night and wired to Rosecrans that [...] "our men not only held their ground, but in many points drove the enemy splendidly. Longstreet's Virginians have got their bellies full." [...] Although the troops were tired and hungry, and nearly out of ammunition, he continued, [...] "I believe we can whip them tomorrow. I believe we can now crown the whole battle with victory." [...] He urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga.

2500|$|On December 31, 2012, Cole {{revealed}} that Born Sinner {{would not be}} released on January 28, 2013, as previously expected. Cole said that he [...] "needed {{a little more time}} than that to get things done." [...] In promotion of Born Sinner, Cole released an EP titled Truly Yours on February 12, 2013, the project consisted of five tracks Cole knew would not appear on Born Sinner. On February 14, 2013, he released the artwork for the first single via Instagram. [...] "Power Trip" [...] was released on February 14, 2013, marking Cole's second collaboration with R recording artist Miguel. Following the originally planned release date of January 28, 2013, Cole had announced a set release date of June 25, 2013 for Born Sinner. However, when it was announced that Kanye West's Yeezus would be released just one week earlier on June 18, Cole moved the release date of Born Sinner up a week in order to compete with West. He later commented, [...] "This is art, and I can't compete against the Kanye West celebrity and the status that he's earned just from being a genius... But I can put my name in the hat and tell you that I think my album is great and you <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> and you decide." [...] Cole released the second installment in the Truly Yours series on April 30, 2013, the EP featured guest appearances from Bas, Young Jeezy and 2 Chainz. Born Sinner sold 297,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, finishing approximately 30,000 copies short of Kanye West's Yeezus. He released three more singles in support of the album, [...] "Crooked Smile" [...] featuring TLC, [...] "Forbidden Fruit" [...] featuring Kendrick Lamar, and [...] "She Knows". As of December 2016, the album had sold 796,000 copies in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The innings began {{well for}} England as Wally Hammond caught Arthur Morris in the slips and Alec Bedser had Don Bradman {{struggling}} {{in his third}} over, the Australian captain twice edging {{the ball to the}} close fielders. He was protected by Sid Barnes who controlled the strike and hooked the England bowlers until [...] "Big Al" [...] jumped up like a goalkeeper, knocked up the ball and took the catch on the rebound. Barnes (31) was officially reprimanded for using the hook and eliminated this stroke from his repertoire {{for the rest of the}} series. At 72/2 Bradman was still struggling on 28 after an hour at the crease when he gave his famous catch to Jack Ikin off Bill Voce. The England players were so sure it was out (along with half the Australian team in the dressing room) that they did not immediately appeal and did so only after Bradman refused to walk. In a controversial umpiring decision Umpire Borwick gave him not out and Bradman later said he thought he had jammed the ball into the ground before it went to Ikin and that he was willing to let the umpire <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>judge.</b> Hammond was furious at what he saw as gamesmanship that only spoke to the Australian captain when calling the toss for the rest of the series. After this incident Bradman recovered his confidence and with Bedser off the field due to a stomach ailment (a legacy of his service in Italy) made 159 runs in 160 minutes. His vice-captain Lindsay Hassett dug himself in for 128 and they added 274 for the third wicket. Hassett's brother was getting married that day and agreed to wait until he was out before they began the service. They gave up when he was 97 and he was still on 98 when they finished. Bradman was bowled by Bill Edrich (3/107) early on the second day and Hassett added another 106 runs with his fellow-Victorian Keith Miller who hit 6 fours and a six in his 79. Hassett also hit a six, but was dropped three times before he was caught by Norman Yardley off Bedser (2/159). The English leg-spinner Doug Wright (5/167) had Miller lbw, but the wicketkeeper Paul Gibb dropped Colin McCool off Bedser for 1 and McCool (95) and Ian Johnson (47) took the score to 595/5 by the end of the second day. Most of the third day was lost to heavy rain and bad light. When play resumed it was thought that Australia would declare, but Bradman gave 'a crooked little smile..."I remember when England made 900 against us and kept us in the field for three days"' and 10 minutes before play he told Hammond that he was going to bat on. [...] "Bradman adopted his grim Napoleonic pose, as if the fate of his country rested on the retention of 'the Ashes'" [...] and as the batting captain told the ground staff not to cut the grass on the pitch and had a three-ton roller pulled over the wicket to draw up the moisture. Australia would not be batting for long and this increased the pace of the wicket for his fast bowlers, but a former Australian player called it [...] "kicking a beaten opponent when he is down". The last 5 Australian wickets fell for 50 runs, mostly from Ray Lindwall who hit 3 fours and 2 sixes in his 31. Australia's 645 was their highest total at home, overtaking the 604 made in their previous home Test at Melbourne in 1936-37.|$|E
