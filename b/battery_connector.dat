50|$|The Traxxas Slash was {{introduced}} in 2008 and is a two-wheel drive 1/10 scale short course electric race truck. This Traxxas model comes Ready-To-Run (RTR). The Slash shares many of its parts with the Rustler, Stampede and Bandit. Differences include a raised chassis (though {{not as high as}} the Stampede's) that is also much longer, wider and rectangular, 4.3 inch (diameter) x 1.7 inch (width) all-terrain style tires mounted on 2.2/3.0 inch wheels (now a point in short course rc trucks), though first production runs did sell with the non-sc style wheel (2.2) traxxas believed it would save on production to use the 2.2/3.0 design from the slayer, with a 12mm hex.

5000|$|Released in December 2010, the Traxxas Spartan {{is a new}} {{single drive}} Radio-controlled boat. The Spartan {{represents}} Traxxas' first all-new boat design in several years. Like the Villain series, it is a sport/power boat configuration with a long, sleek [...] "deep V" [...] style hull. Unlike the Villain series, the Spartan is significantly longer (by 9.8 inches) and has a slightly wider beam (by 1.25 inches), which combine to give the Spartan a much sleeker overall profile. The Spartan also has an abundance of modern features which set it apart from earlier Traxxas boats. The most noticeable is Traxxas' new marine version of its Castle Powered Velineon brushless system, consisting of the new VXL-6s brushless ESC, and Velineon 540XL (1410 castle motor)brushless motor. Both the ESC and the motor are water-cooled, with the motor featuring a unique sealed composite water jacket that allows cooling water to directly contact the motor case, rather than the simple coiled metal tubing water jackets used on other Traxxas boats. The drive system is also {{a departure from the}} steerable outdrive system (the prop and rudder are one unit and are steered together) traditionally used on Traxxas boats. Instead, power on the Spartan is routed via direct drive (no reduction gears) to a single fixed surface piercing prop and steering is controlled by an aluminum rudder operated by a high torque waterproof servo. The Spartan is also uses Traxxas' 2.4GHz radio system (a first on Traxxas boats) with a 5-channel receiver located inside a watertight box. Other notable features include stainless steel trim tabs and turn fins (which help improve stability and turning performance), Traxxas high current <b>battery</b> <b>connectors,</b> 12 gauge power wire, and stainless steel hex hardware. The claimed top speed is 30 mi/h kn with the included dual 8.4 volt NiMH batteries. However, the top speed rises to 50 mi/h kn with optional double 3S LiPo battery packs, which Traxxas claims as the fastest top speed for any RTR (ready to race) radio controlled boat.|$|R

50|$|Another type of coating called parylene {{is applied}} with a vacuum {{deposition}} process versus a spray or needle application. The parylene is applied {{at the molecular}} level by a vacuum deposition process at ambient temperature. Film coatings from 0.100 to 76 Î¼m can be easily applied in a single operation. The advantage of parylene coatings is that they cover hidden surfaces and other areas where spray and needle application are not possible. Coating thickness is very uniform, even on irregular surfaces. The three main disadvantages are that (i) any desired contact points such as <b>battery</b> contacts or <b>connectors</b> must be carefully covered with an air-tight mask to prevent the parylene from coating the contacts, (ii) it is a batch process and does not lend itself to high volume processing, and (iii) the cost per PCB can be highly prohibitive due to the capital investment costs and the cost per batch.|$|R
40|$|With the {{continued}} miniaturisation of portable embedded systems, wireless EEG recording techniques {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent in animal behavioural research. However, {{in spite of their}} versatility and portability, they have seldom been used inside water-maze tasks designed for rats. As such, a novel 3 D printed implant and waterproof connector is presented, which can facilitate wireless water-maze EEG recordings in freely-moving rats, using a commercial wireless recording system (W 32; Multichannel Systems). As well as waterproofing the wireless system, <b>battery,</b> and electrode <b>connector,</b> the implant serves to reduce movement-related artefacts by redistributing movement-related forces away from the electrode connector. This implant/connector was able to successfully record high-quality LFP in the hippocampo-striatal brain regions of rats as they undertook a procedural-learning variant of the double-H water-maze task. Notably, there were no significant performance deficits through its use when compared with a control group across a number of metrics including number of errors and speed of task completion. Taken together, this method can expand the range of measurements that are currently possible in this diverse area of behavioural neuroscience, whilst paving the way for integration with more complex behaviours...|$|R
50|$|The Revo was {{notorious for}} battery and {{charging}} problems. Unlike the Series 5mx, which used 2 user-replaceable AA batteries, the Revo {{is powered by}} 2 built-in rechargeable AAA 700 mAh NiMH batteries, which typically {{need to be replaced}} after about 3 years of service. After backing up all data, the batteries can be accessed by closing the unit, peeling off the Revo logo (using a screwdriver or similar if necessary), moving the 2 small pins that are behind it, and lifting up the silver part of the casing. The batteries are wrapped in black tape, which can be removed starting from the left, taking care not to break the thermistor that it also encloses. It may not be possible to separate the <b>batteries</b> from their <b>connectors</b> without damaging the latter, which would then need to be replaced. Injury could result if separation is attempted with a blade. Replacement batteries must be taped in just as securely, otherwise resets could occur due to intermittent power loss. After replacing, the unit should be charged uninterrupted for at least 6 hours, so that the hardware can re-calibrate (as per instructions for a new unit).|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the firm's founding, {{electric}} lighting for the stage was in its infancy. Held finds no catalog of stage lighting equipment earlier than Kliegl's catalog of 1898. as cited in Rubin. Indeed, it may be inferred that the use of [...] "Electric" [...] in the company's name was intended to distinguish its products from the illuminating gas or acetylene fueled equipment they would replace. Many of what became common devices, such as the stage [...] "shoe" [...] or thrust plug and the disappearing footlight were patented by the Kliegls, and many others were developed into the forms still familiar todayInitially they continued the Myerhofer business as [...] "contractors and manufacturers", as noted in their Catalog G of 1913. In 1903 they furnished and installed the complete stage lighting system for the Metropolitan Opera Company's new home on West 37th Street (John was at the time an electrician for the Met). In 1933 they would be again called to provide a complete new stage lighting system, although not as installers. Catalog G also displayed the carbon arc floodlight, developed by the firm in 1911, as the iconic Klieglight. A diverse assortment of lighting and electrical products were also cataloged, such as exit signs, backup <b>batteries,</b> dimmer boards, <b>connectors,</b> effect projectors, chandeliers, marquee lights (and complete marquees), charging outlets for electric cars, switchboards, etc. Featured was a [...] "Skyrocket" [...] sign for Tilyou's Steeplechase Park in Coney Island.The development of electrical standards was spurred, in part, by the Iroquois Theatre fire of 1903. Kliegl Brothers' Catalog E states that [...] "plugs and receptacles are in accordance with Underwriter's requirements and pass city inspections". The Kliegls maintained a direct interest in the development of standards for theatre electrical systems. From 1950 to his death, Herbert Kliegl {{was a member of the}} National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code making panel No. 115.A precursor of today's spotlights, the [...] "baby spotlight", their first using an incandescent lamp, was introduced in their Catalog E of 1906 as cited in Rubin [...] The takeover of the incandescent lamp would be inexorable. as cited in Rubin [...] From about 1908, motion picture studios were using the company's floor-stand arc lamps, which allowed for point-source lighting, including some of the first low-light effects; the shadow produced by the two pairs of carbon rods can be seen in some early films.In their 1922 catalog, the company was still featuring its motion picture studio equipment, but by 1926, references to motion picture applications had dwindled to a single line of type on the first page. In 1924 they introduced the use of glass rondels as color media in border and footlights, eliminating coloring of individual lamps.Kliegl Brothers introduced its Fresnel lens spots in 1929, and by 1935 were ordering their own Fresnel lenses from Corning. as cited in Rubin ...|$|R
40|$|The {{hazards of}} lead in the {{environment}} have {{been a matter of}} increasing concern over the past several years. The most common sources of lead contaminated soils are those related to abandoned lead battery reclamation sites. There are over 200 such sites in the United States and several real and potential sites in Minnesota. Under present regulations such contaminated soil must be removed and placed in an approved and licensed landfill. The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate that by applying conventional mineral dressing techniques it is possible to detoxify a significant percentage of the soil and thereby reduce the cost of landfill disposition. Prior test work at the Natural Resources Research lnstitute's Coleraine Minerals Research Laboratory (CRL) on a sample from a battery reprocessing site in Wisconsin demonstrated that partial detoxification of the soil was practical. The object of this study was to apply similar techniques to material from a Minnesota site. The Shafer Metal site on north Plymouth avenue in Minneapolis was selected for this study after consultation with personnel from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Minnesota Department of Transportation who own the property. The lead contamination at the Shafer Metal battery reprocessing site occurs in three principal modes: lead metal fragments, surficial coatings of precipitated lead sulphate and lead dioxide, and lead incorporated into fused plastic material. The lead metal consists primarily of fragments of <b>battery</b> plates and <b>connectors.</b> The precipitated lead compounds occur as coatings on the rock and sand particles in the soil. The fused plastic material could have resulted from melting and casting of the lead, or operation of an incinerator. After preliminary sampling to confirm the distribution of lead contaminated soil at the site, three bulk samples of about 800 pounds each were collected for testing. These three samples were subjected to a series conventional mineral processing techniques involving attrition scrubbing, screening, and gravity separation. The tests demonstrated that over 60 % of the material can be separated as a clean rock and sand product that can be disposed of on site. About 5 % to 10 % of the material can be recovered as a lead-rich product that would be acceptable feedstock to a lead smelter. About 25 % of the weight would contain so much lead that it would have to be treated as hazardous material. Some 5 % to 10 % of the material would be rejected as a coarse trash product eligible for disposal in conventional landfills. The EPA Synthetic Precipitation Leach Test for Soils (Method 1312) was run on the rock and clean sand portion which represents over 60 % of the material. The tests demonstrated that this material had been effectively detoxified and could be disposed of on site. Based on these test data a treatment flow sheet to detoxify the material represented by the bulk samples taken at the Shafer Metal site was developed. The flow sheet includes the following process steps: I) Coarse screening to remove tramp trash; 2) attrition scrubbing to remove the lead compounds from the coarser rock and sand particles; and 3) gravity concentration to separate a high lead product, a clean rock and sand reject, and a lead-bearing fused plastic product. A minus 165 mesh fines fraction is also produced containing the natural fines from the soil and the lead released by the attrition scrubbing. The recommended treatment flow sheet is based on using conventional mineral processing equipment. The equipment could be sized small enough to be truck mounted, or set up as semi-portable units for on-site treatment. Engineering such a portable treatment plant was included in the extended project, but is beyond the scope of this abbreviated study. Whether treatment of the Shafer Metal site is practical depends upon the cost of building and operating such a treatment plant on site as opposed to direct disposal. It is recommended that this study be extended to include the design and engineering of a portable or semi-mobile treatment plant and that further continuous pilot plant operations be supported to confirm some of the coarse gravity separation steps. There are other similar sites in Minnesota that are contaminated by lead that would be amenable to similar treatment. Costing out the plant required and demonstration of the viability of the treatment flow sheet would make it possible to offer alternatives to the expensive disposal of such hazardous material in a licensed disposal site.
