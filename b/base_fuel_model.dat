40|$|Management {{planning}} for fires becomes increasingly difficult as scale increases. Stratification provides land managers with multiple scales {{in which to}} prepare plans. Using statistical techniques, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and meetings with land managers, we divided a large landscape of over 2 million acres (White Sands Missile Range) into parcels useful in fire management. Within this hierarchy, 8 fire management areas (FMA), with major roads or drainages forming boundaries, were identified. Within these FMAs were 106 burn units (BU) defined by natural or human fire breaks. BUs {{can be used as}} prescribed burn areas or maximum allowable perimeters for fires. An intermediate level was needed between these two units. Using cluster analysis of vegetation data, 22 fire management zones were identified. Using this hierarchy, a large-scale vegetation map, and GIS, we were able to incorporate simplistic risk <b>models</b> <b>based</b> on <b>fuel</b> <b>models,</b> topography, and sites of concern for natural resource managers. The resulting maps provide a landscape view of the fire risk to natural and human resources and allow land managers to take a heads up approach in preventative fire management...|$|R

40|$|Reducing fuel {{consumption}} of ships against volatile fuel prices and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} resulted from international shipping are the challenges that the industry faces today. The potential for fuel savings is possible for new builds, {{as well as for}} existing ships through increased energy efficiency measures; technical and operational respectively. The limitations of implementing technical measures increase the potential of operational measures for energy efficient ship operations. Ship owners and operators need to rationalise their energy use and produce energy efficient solutions. Reducing the speed of the ship is the most efficient method in terms of fuel economy and environmental impact. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) predict ship {{fuel consumption}} for various operational conditions through an inexact method, Artiﬁcial Neural Network ANN; (ii) develop a decision support system (DSS) employing ANN <b>based</b> <b>fuel</b> prediction <b>model</b> to be used on-board ships on a real time basis for energy efficient ship operations. The <b>fuel</b> prediction <b>model</b> uses operating data -‘Noon Data’ - which provides information on a ship’s daily fuel consumption. The parameters considered for fuel prediction are ship speed, revolutions per minute (RPM), mean draft, trim, cargo quantity on board, wind and sea effects, in which output data of ANN is fuel consumption. The performance of the ANN is compared with multiple regression analysis (MR), a widely used surface ﬁtting method, and its superiority is conﬁrmed. The developed DSS is exemplified with two scenarios, and it can be concluded that it has a promising potential to provide strategic approach when ship operators have to make their decisions at an operational level considering both the economic and environmental aspects...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the fire}} {{prediction}} capabilities of <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> {{is vital to}} forest fire management. Various <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> have been developed in the Great Xing’an Mountains in Northeast China. However, the performances of these <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> have not been tested for historical occurrences of wildfires. Consequently, the applicability of these models requires further investigation. Thus, this paper aims to develop standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models.</b> Seven vegetation types were combined into three <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> according to potential fire behaviors which were clustered using Euclidean distance algorithms. <b>Fuel</b> <b>model</b> parameter sensitivity was analyzed by the Morris screening method. Results showed that the <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> parameters 1 -hour time-lag loading, dead heat content, live heat content, 1 -hour time-lag SAV(Surface Area-to-Volume), live shrub SAV, and fuel bed depth have high sensitivity. Two main sensitive fuel parameters: 1 -hour time-lag loading and fuel bed depth, were determined as adjustment parameters because of their high spatio-temporal variability.

40|$|Changing {{frequencies}} of extreme weather events and shifting fire seasons call for enhanced capability to forecast {{where and when}} forested landscapes switch from a nonflammable (i. e., wet fuel) state to the highly flammable (i. e., dry fuel) state required for catastrophic forest fires. Current forest fire danger indices used in Europe, North America, and Australia rate potential fire behavior by combining numerical indices of fuel moisture content, potential rate of fire spread, and fire intensity. These numerical rating systems lack the physical basis required to reliably quantify forest flammability outside the environ- ments of their development or under novel climate conditions. Here, we argue that exceedance of critical forest flammability thresholds {{is a prerequisite for}} major forest fires and therefore early warning systems should be based on a reliable prediction of fuel moisture content plus a regionally calibrated model of how forest fire activity responds to variation in fuel moisture content. We demonstrate the potential of this approach through a case study in Portugal. We use a physically <b>based</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture <b>model</b> with historical weather and fire records to identify critical fuel moisture thresholds for forest fire activity and then show that the catastrophic June 2017 forest fires in central Portugal erupted shortly after fuels in the region dried out to historically unprecedented levels.

40|$|Forest {{fires in}} the Alps can have severe impacts on {{mountain}} forests reducing their protection capacity against rock falls and avalanches and increasing flood runoff, mud and debris flows (Moody and Martin 2001, Robichaud et al. 2007). Due to climate change, several {{studies have shown that}} the impact of forest {{fires in the}} Alpine environment will increase in the coming decades (Elkin et al. 2013, Lorz et al. 2010, Wastl et al. 2012). A key issue in modern forest fire management is the accurate mapping of forest fuels in order to determine spatial fire hazard, plan mitigation efforts, and active fire management (Krasnow et al. 2009). Several surface fuel description systems are currently used by land management agencies in the USA, Europe, Canada and Australia, and most of these systems have the same categories, components and description variables (Sandberg et al. 2001, Scott and Burgan 2005). A generalized description of <b>fuels</b> <b>based</b> upon average <b>fuel</b> properties is called a “fuel model”. A <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> is a set of fuelbed inputs (e. g. load, bulk density, fuel particle size, heat content and moisture of extinction) used by a specific software for predicting the fire behaviour (e. g. FARSITE). Standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> were developed in the USA by Anderson (1982) and more recently by Scott and Burgan (2005). Standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> that fit the main local vegetation characteristics can be used as input for fire spread modelling and in combination with custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> when available (Duguy et al. 2007, Arca et al. 2009, Jahdi et al. 2015). However, the Standard or custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> have seldom been applied in the Alps. In this study we tested the possibility of defining some custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> for the Eastern Italian Alps, which might allow a more reliable fire behaviour prediction when fire simulator systems are used. The custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> definition was done by means of three steps: In the first step we studied local fire regime and fire behaviour and we tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. In the second step fuel properties were measured in the field and analyzed. In the third step we made three <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> sets <b>based</b> on three different approaches (Forest type association, Prometheus classification, Cluster classification). Then, using FARSITE (Finney 2004), we simulated ten fires that occurred in the Veneto Region from 2003 to 2013. Every fire was simulated using the three custom model sets and the Standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005). Lastly, the <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> set having the higher accuracy was adjusted in order to improve its performance in simulating real fire behaviour. In the Veneto Region, there was a decreasing number of fires per year from 1981 to 2004 and a much more evident decrease in the annual burned area. Fires in both mountain areas and the lowlands usually behave as surface fires and the burned area is seldom larger than ten hectares. We tested the hypothesis that the decrease in burned area is related to an improvement in fire-fighting efficiency since the beginning of the 3 rd millennium. The power-law distribution of burned areas seems to confirm that suppression efficiency has been improved because the exponent of the power-law distribution was much higher in the last decade than in the previous two. In mountain areas fuel load paralleled what is reported in the literature for similar forests, but in the lowlands fuel load appeared much higher, probably because those forests are affected by phytosanitary problems that cause a higher amount of deadwood. We found significant differences in fuel load among vegetation types (chestnut, hop hornbeam forests, conifer plantations and shrubland), The most significant difference was litter load (p< 0. 001 in the lowlands; p= 0. 0015 in mountain areas). Significant differences were also found between forest managements (coppiced, high forest, unmanaged). Mainly shrubs load (p< 0. 0018 in the lowlands) and herbs (p= 0. 0029 in mountain areas). The fuel distribution in size classes was never normal but, as commonly reported in the literature, it followed a logarithmic or a power-law trend. The tests on fire behaviour <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> showed that Prometheus and Cluster <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> sets led to inaccurate fire behaviour predictions. Standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> (Anderson 1982, Scott and Burgan 2005) generally performed well and Forest type <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> were the best in predicting fire behaviour, despite a frequent underestimation of flame height and rate of spread. By using a calibration process, we modified the Forest type <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> and improved the performance in FARSITE. The resulting Calibrated <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> could be suggested for further fire behaviour applications in the Eastern Italian Alps. ...|$|R

Eight custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> were developed including a custom <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> for a spruce bark beetle impacted forest type. NEXUS simulations indicate that the custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> better describe forest structure and predict fire behavior than do parameterized standard <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> previously used by local fire managers.

The use of FARSITE on areas different from those where the simulator was originally developed requires a local calibration to produce reliable results.

It was observed that the fine particle number emissions with the two <b>base</b> <b>fuels</b> were quantitatively different but qualitatively similar. The gravimetric (mass basis) measurement also showed higher total particulate matter (TPM) emissions with the MGO. The smoke emissions, which were part of TPM, were also higher for the MGO. No significant changes in the mass flow rate of fuel and the brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were observed between the two <b>base</b> <b>fuels...</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>Fuel</b> <b>Model</b> is {{a stylized}} set of fuel bed {{characteristics}} {{used as input}} {{for a variety of}} wildfire modeling applications. Wildfire behavior models, such as those of Rothermel, take into account numerous empirical variables. While these inputs are important for equation outputs, they are often difficult and time-consuming, if not impossible, to measure for each fuel bed. A <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> defines these input variables for a stylized set of quantitative vegetation characteristics that can be visually identified in the field. Depending on local conditions, one of several <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> may be appropriate. As Anderson states “Fuel models are simply tools to help the user realistically estimate fire behavior. The user must maintain a flexible frame of mind and an adaptive method of operating to totally utilize these aids". Furthermore, depending on the application, the user must choose a <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> classification system. The major classification systems for use in the United States include the National Fire Danger Rating System, the 13 ‘original’ <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> of Anderson and Albini, the subsequent set of 40 fuels produced by Scott and Burgan, and the Fuel Characteristics Classification System.|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{the spread}} of {{wildland}} fire is growing concern in the Netherlands, where fire events at the wildland urban interface {{is a growing concern}} with a changing climate. A multi-year project was initiated in 2012 to obtain field-based fuel measurements to be used to estimate wildland fire spread for surface fire. The overall objective was to develop either custom <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> or utilize existing Northern American <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> to <b>fuel</b> conditions in some of the hazardous vegetation in the Netherlands. Over a four-year period, 96 plots were established, a wide variety of fuel parameters measured, and ANOVA (p ≤ 0. 1) and Duncan’s MRT used to place these into 56 different vegetation communities. Following multiple permutations in Behaveplus, the 56 communities were consolidated into 28 different <b>fuel</b> <b>models.</b> It was then attempted to use these <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> as input variables in a Dutch-developed wildland fire spread <b>model.</b> Some <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> produced similar fire spread, and since they were within relatively similar communities, were combined, resulting in 21 working <b>fuel</b> <b>models.</b> The results of this project will provide land managers, fire brigades and landowners more accurate wildland fire spread estimations, improving safety of the public in this densely populated country. The results of this project will contribute to more accurate and detailed calculations of the NBVM (Dutch wildfire spreadmodel). The NBVM will provide necessary information, to be able to reduce the risk on uncontrollable wildfires, via wildfire prevention measurements and during an incident, to support decision making...|$|R

40|$|Transitions {{from one}} type of fire {{behavior}} to another cause difficulty in modeling fire behavior in some shrubland fuelbeds. Under different environmental conditions, some shrub fuel complexes may burn benignly in only surface litter, grass, or low shrubs, or more intensely in the taller main shrub canopy as well. With current surface fire modeling methods, simulating fire behavior in these fuels requires ex ante knowledge of which fuels will carry the fire so that the appropriate fire behavior <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> can be selected. A conifer crown fire simulation technique has been adapted to simulate the transition between surface and shrubcanopy fire. Simulations {{are based on the}} Rothermel surface spread model; however, the technique can be adapted to other spread models. Two surface fire behavior <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> are specified—a “low ” <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> representing the grass, low shrub or litter fuels that support relatively benign fire behavior when the fire remains beneath the main canopy, and a “high” <b>fuel</b> <b>model</b> that represents fire behavior in the main shrub canopy. The method also requires an experience-based estimate of the flame length at which the transition to shrub-canopy fire begins. Standard or custom fire behavior <b>fuel</b> <b>models</b> may be used. Interpretation is similar to that for conifer crown fires...|$|R
