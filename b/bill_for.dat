5|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{elections}} of 1970, Tydings faced criticism from both parties for his actions as senator. In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left stemmed from his support of a crime <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at the <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E

He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone, Kent.

[...] Public healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are especially conducive to fraudulent activities, as they are often run on a fee-for-service structure. [...] Physicians use several fraudulent techniques to achieve this end. [...] These can include “up-coding” or “upgrading,” which involve <b>billing</b> <b>for</b> more expensive treatments than those actually provided; providing, and subsequently <b>billing</b> <b>for,</b> treatments that are not medically necessary; scheduling extra visits for patients; referring patients to other physicians when no further treatment is actually necessary; [...] "phantom billing," [...] or <b>billing</b> <b>for</b> services not rendered; and “ganging,” or <b>billing</b> <b>for</b> services to family members or other individuals who are accompanying the patient but who did not personally receive any services.|$|R

5|$|In late 1902, the PC plans {{collapsed}} after {{a falling}} {{out between the}} scheme's promoters led to {{a crucial part of}} the planned route coming under the control of a rival, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), which withdrew it from parliamentary consideration. With the PC scheme out of the way, the CLR resubmitted its bill in 1903, although consideration was again held up by Parliament's establishment of a Royal Commission on London Traffic tasked to assess the manner in which transport in London should be developed. While the Commission deliberated, any review of bills for new lines and extensions was postponed, so the CLR withdrew the bill. The CLR briefly re-presented the <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the 1905 parliamentary session but withdrew it again, before making an agreement with the UERL in October 1905 that neither company would submit a <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> an east–west route in 1906. The plan was then dropped as the new trains with driving positions at both ends made it possible for the CLR to reduce the minimum interval between trains to two minutes without building the loop.|$|E

The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E
