5|$|The North East line {{originated}} from a suburban line to Essendon in 1860, being extended to Wodonga by 1873, connecting with the New South Wales Government Railways at Albury at a break-of-gauge in 1883. A standard gauge track was completed {{parallel with the}} <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> track from Albury to Melbourne in 1962. The <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> track has been converted to standard gauge between Seymour and Albury.|$|E

5|$|George Thomas Clark {{played an}} {{important}} role as an engineer on the project, reputedly taking the management of two divisions of the route including bridges over the River Thames at Lower Basildon and Moulsford and of Paddington Station. Involvement in major earth-moving works seems to have fed Clark's interest in geology and archaeology and he, anonymously, authored two guidebooks on the railway: one illustrated with lithographs by John Cooke Bourne; the other, a critique of Brunel's methods and the <b>broad</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Southern Railway {{connected}} Mangalore with Calicut (Kozhikode) {{along the}} coastline. This railway line helped connect the district with other places of the Madras presidency {{during the colonial}} rule. The Konkan Railway (1998) connects Dakshina Kannada with Maharashtra, Goa, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala by train. There are direct trains from Mangalore to Mumbai, Thane, Chennai, Goa and Trivandrum. Train services operate daily to Bangalore via Hassan and Kukke Subramanya after the conversion from metre gauge to <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> track.|$|E

25|$|Secunderabad Station has the {{standard}} station layout {{with a perfect}} traction inside the station. All the tracks in the station are <b>broad</b> <b>gauged</b> and electrified. The Manmad-Secunderabad line that passes through is non-electrified, so diesel trains are common.|$|R
5|$|Victoria's first railway was a 4km Victorian <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> {{line between}} the Melbourne (or City) Terminus (on the site of modern-day Flinders Street station) and Sandridge (now Port Melbourne), {{constructed}} by the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company and opened in September 1854. Today, Melbourne's suburban railway network consists of 16 electrified lines, the central City Loop subway, and 200 stations, with a total length of 372km of the electrified lines, operated by Metro Trains Melbourne under franchise to the Government of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, and boats were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E
5|$|As over 86% of Uttarakhand's terrain {{consists}} of hills, railway services are very limited {{in the state}} and are largely confined to the plains. In 2011, the total length of railway tracks was about 345km. Rail, being the cheapest mode of transport, is most popular. The most important railway station in Kumaun Division of Uttarakhand is at Kathgodam, 35 kilometres away from Nainital. Kathgodam is the last terminus of the <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> line of North East Railways that connects Nainital with Delhi, Dehradun, and Howrah. Other notable railway stations are at Pantnagar, Lalkuan and Haldwani.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{particular}} interest to many observers were the Military Road Switchers designated MRS-1 and built specifically for the US Army Transportation Corps. These engines were constructed by the Electromotive Division of General Motors and by the American Locomotive Company (Alco) with trucks that could adjust to accommodate selected track gauges between [...] and <b>broader</b> <b>gauges</b> up to [...] The reason for this was the potential use of these locomotives on the railroad networks of Europe and the USSR where <b>broader</b> <b>gauges</b> precluded the use of unmodified US locomotives {{in the event of}} a major war. While built to the same specifications, there were external differences between the EMD and Alco MRS-1s as can be seen in the rooflines.|$|R

The city is well connected to the neighboring states through rail links.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007 Pacific National {{announced}} plans to sell or close its grain transport and Portlink rural container business operations in Victoria. The decision has been criticised as it will force grain growers to use higher cost road transport to transport the annual grain harvest from rural silos to the ports. The decision has seen many commentators accuse Pacific National of only acquiring the operations of Freight Australia in 2004 {{for the purposes of}} asset stripping and eliminating competition in rail freight. In 2008 El Zorro took over the Warrnambool - Melbourne container service from Pacific National, and moved into <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> grain services, while Aurizon has taken over the Melbourne - Horsham container service.|$|E
5|$|Opened in 2010, Green Line (Line 5) is {{the fifth}} line of the Delhi Metro network and the first line on {{standard}} gauge, as opposed to previous <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> lines. It runs between Inderlok (station on the Red Line) and Mundka with a branch line connecting the line's Ashok Park Main station with Kirti Nagar station on the Blue Line. The completely elevated line, built {{as part of the}} Phase-II of Delhi Metro runs mostly along the busy NH 10 route in West Delhi.

The city has two railway stations—Mangalore Central (at Hampankatta) and Mangalore Junction (at Kankanadi). A railway track, built through the Western Ghats, connects Mangalore with Hassan. The <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> track connecting Mangalore to Bangalore via Hassan was opened to freight traffic in May 2006 and passenger traffic in December 2007. Mangalore is also connected to Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, and Kollam through the Southern Railway and to Mumbai, Bhatkal, Karwar, Gujarat, Ajmer and Goa via the Konkan Railway.|$|E
5|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} given the name Great Western. The first was an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's Swindon locomotive works. This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive in the same class was given the same name; this was withdrawn four years later when the <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E
5|$|The {{last four}} wheeled open wagons {{were built in}} 1958, but were not {{scrapped}} in large numbers until the 1980s when new bogie wagons replaced them. In 1987 the bogie wagon fleet numbered 5000, with approximately 700 grain hoppers, 800 container flats, 1000 louvred vans, 700 open wagons, 400 tank cars, and 300 flat wagons. Today the <b>broad</b> <b>gauge</b> intrastate fleet numbers 2600, {{with large numbers of}} louvred vans, open and flat wagons, and tank cars stored or scrapped due to the transfer of traffic to road following years of apathy by Governments.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{before the start of the}} {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the far side of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially <b>broad</b> <b>gauge.</b> Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E
5|$|As on 31 March 2015, the Company has a {{total of}} 1306 coaches (220 trains). Apart from {{extensions}} on various existing lines, two new lines viz. Line 7 & 8 are proposed in Phase III. 486 coaches (81 six-car trains) being procured for these two new lines will have advance feature of Unattended Train Operation (UTO). Additional 258 <b>Broad</b> <b>gauge</b> (BG) coaches for Line 1 to 4 and 138 Standard Gauge (SG) coaches for Line 5 & 6 are proposed to be procured for augmentation/extensions to cater to the increased traffic. Resultantly, {{at the end of}} Phase III, there would be 2188 coaches (333 trains). Barring a few 4-car trains on Line 5, 93% of the trains would operate either in 6 car or 8 car configuration at the end of Phase III.|$|E
50|$|In 1863 the Parliament of Queensland {{passed the}} {{controversial}} Railway Bill, which committed Queensland {{to the use}} of a narrow gauge for the development of its Main Line railway in Queensland.
