25|$|The torrid scoring pace slowed {{during much}} of the third quarter, as both teams began to assert {{themselves}} on the defensive side of the ball. But late in the quarter, a 12-yard punt return by Cowboys receiver Butch Johnson gave Dallas good field position on their 42-yard line. The Cowboys subsequently drove down to the Steelers 10-yard line, mostly with Dorsett's rushing. Then on third down with less than three minutes remaining in the period, Staubach spotted 38-year-old reserve tight end Jackie Smith wide open in the end zone and threw him the <b>ball.</b> <b>Head</b> coach Tom Landry said Staubach tried to throw the ball soft when he saw how wide open Smith was and that it came in low, and that when Smith tried to stop, his feet seemed to come out from under him. Jackie Smith states that it was still a catchable ball and that he should have made the play. Instead, Smith dropped the pass and the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal from kicker Rafael Septién, cutting their deficit to 21–17. Though Smith played 16 years in the league and is now enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he is perhaps best known for this dropped touchdown, particularly in a championship game that was ultimately decided by four points.|$|E
500|$|Field {{markings}} dictate player positioning {{during a}} face-off. A face-off is how play is {{started at the}} beginning of each quarter and after each goal. During a face-off, there are six players (without considering goalkeepers) in each of the areas defined by the restraining lines. Three midfielders from each team occupy the midfield area, while three attackmen and three of the opposing team's defensemen occupy each offensive area. These players must stay in these areas until possession is earned by a midfielder or the ball crosses either restraining line. Wing areas are marked on the field on the midfield line [...] from each sideline. This line indicates where the two nonface-off midfielders per team lineup during a face-off situation. These players may position themselves on either side of the midfield line. [...] During a face-off, two players lay their sticks horizontally next to the <b>ball,</b> <b>head</b> of the stick inches from the ball and the butt-end pointing down the midfield line. Once the official blows the whistle to start play, the face-off midfielders scrap for the ball to earn possession and the other midfielders advance to play the ball. If possession is won by the face-off player, he may move the ball himself or pass to a teammate.|$|E

Due to this serious risk when perform repetitive <b>ball</b> <b>heading,</b> this study was conducted to assist head impact (soccer heading) experimental setup by developed a significant method in building neck dummy that can perform like real human neck.

40|$|P. McLeod, N. Reed, and Z. Dienes (2002) {{argued that}} the linear optical {{trajectory}} (LOT) strategy incorrectly cues fielders to run forward for <b>balls</b> <b>headed</b> beyond them. The authors of this article explain that the downward optical curvature found for balls landing beyond the fielder’s initial position occurs because the balls reorient the direction the fielder is facing during pursuit. Thus, when downward optical curvature begins, the <b>ball</b> is <b>headed</b> to land in front of where the fielder is facing and running. This investigation of open-loop failure conditions has led to new insights such as the reorientation of the fielder, and it supports the use of maintaining matching rates of vertical and lateral optical ball movement consistent with primacy of the LOT control mechanism even when interception is unachievable. In a recent article, McLeod, Reed, and Dienes (2002) high-lighted an interesting feature of the optical trajectories of balls being pursued by fielders, as presented by Shaffer and McBeath (2002). They noted that there is downward optical curvature of the trajectories for <b>balls</b> <b>headed</b> beyond fielders. They sug-gested that this conflicts with the maintenance of linearit...|$|R
