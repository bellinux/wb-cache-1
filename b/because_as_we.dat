500|$|In {{response}} to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello {{during the first week}} of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic-Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that: [...] "From [...] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [...] judgment but <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> should never think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves." [...] Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role [...] "in softening Jefferson's more extreme views." ...|$|E

He wrote: [...] " [...] there are still ten minutes of late Ingmar Bergman to go. The film keeps showing us Chiron's handsome, inscrutable face. The silence doesn't tell us anything, it just asks us {{to feel sorry for}} him... All is not lost, though, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> gaze at Chiron, we can think of something else: his resemblance to Juan (his father figure). Does it mean that Juan was once a Chiron... Not quite that perhaps, but the last shot of the film is of the young Chiron sitting on the beach... looking out at the ocean... His wide eyes suggest all the desolation and promise that Juan saw in him at the beginning. If we started again, would things be different?" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{simulation}} of facial movements {{is a difficult}} task because the complex and sophisticated structure of the human head involves the motion, deformation, and contact handling between bio-tissues that are viscoelastic, nonlinear, anisotropic, and structurally heterogeneous.

We work well, make money, and have lots of moral qualities. A fair inside is better than a fair outside.

But the earlier (if not Aryan!) root 'dip,' must be taken good heed to, also, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> further study the customs of aquatic chickens, we shall find that they really mass themselves under the three great heads of 'Duckers,' birds that duck their heads only, and stick up their tails in the air;--'Dippers,' birds that take real dips under, but not far down, in shallow water mostly, for things at the bottom, or else to get out of harm's way, staying down about as long as we could ourselves, if we were used to it;--and 'Divers,' who plunge like stones when they choose,--can go nobody knows how deep in the deep sea,--and swim under the water just as comfortably as upon it, and as fast, if not faster.|$|E
60|$|Taking {{the plants}} {{of the three}} generations altogether, the crossed show no superiority over the self-fertilised, and I can account for this fact only by supposing that with this species, which is {{perfectly}} self-fertile without insect aid, most of the individuals {{are in the same}} condition, as those of the same variety of the common pea and of a few other exotic plants, which have been self-fertilised for many generations. In such cases a cross between two individuals does no good; nor does it in any case, unless the individuals differ in general constitution, either from so-called spontaneous variation, or from their progenitors having been subjected to different conditions. I believe that this is the true explanation in the present instance, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> shall immediately see, the offspring of plants, which did not profit at all by being crossed with a plant of the same stock, profited to an extraordinary degree by a cross with a slightly different sub-variety.|$|E
60|$|With pigeons, however, we {{have another}} case, namely, the {{occasional}} appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars on the wings, a white rump, a bar {{at the end of}} the tail, with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds. We may I think confidently come to this conclusion, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> have seen, these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.|$|E

(b) IMAGES.--I {{shall have}} much to say about images in a later lecture; for the present I am merely {{concerned}} with them in so far as they are [...] "copies" [...] of past sensations. When you hear New York spoken of, some image probably comes into your mind, either of the place itself (if you have been there), or of some picture of it (if you have not). The image is due to your past experience, {{as well as to the}} present stimulus of the words [...] "New York." [...] Similarly, the images you have in dreams are all dependent upon your past experience, as well as upon the present stimulus to dreaming. It is generally believed that all images, in their simpler parts, are copies of sensations; if so, their mnemic character is evident. This is important, not only on its own account, but also <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> shall see later, images play an essential part in what is called [...] "thinking." ...|$|E

In short, he seemed to consider himself an ill-used man, decidedly; but there was no help for it, as the woman had escaped into a state which never will give up a fugitive,--not even at the demand of the whole glorious Union.

He lists judgements about an individual’s choice or agency in producing economic disadvantage, the sense of common identity and belonging to a shared society, norms of reciprocity between current and future beneficiaries, and attitudes of civic friendship. Unfortunately, Kymlicka does not then link each of these elements to the progressive’s dilemma he began with, nor the posited solution of liberal, multicultural nationalism on which he ends.
