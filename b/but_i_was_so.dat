500|$|... "My Back Pages" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bob Dylan and {{included}} on his 1964 album Another Side of Bob Dylan. [...] It is stylistically similar to his earlier folk protest songs and features Dylan's voice with an acoustic guitar accompaniment. [...] However, its lyrics—in particular the refrain [...] "Ah, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much older then/I'm younger than that now"—have been interpreted as a rejection of Dylan's earlier personal and political idealism, illustrating his growing disillusionment with the 1960's folk protest movement with which he was associated, and his desire to move in a new direction. Although Dylan wrote the song in 1964, he did not perform it live until 1988.|$|E
500|$|At age 17 in 1902, Roosevelt {{completed}} her formal education {{and returned to}} the United States; she was presented at a debutante ball at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel on December 14. She was later given her own [...] "coming out party". She said of her debut in a public discussion once (as later recounted in her New York Times obituary), [...] "It was simply awful. It was a beautiful party, of course, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> unhappy, because a girl who comes out is so utterly miserable if she does not know all the young people. Of course I had been so long abroad that I had lost touch with all the girls I used to know in New York. I was miserable through all that." ...|$|E
500|$|The American {{rock band}} The Byrds {{released}} {{a recording of}} [...] "My Back Pages" [...] on February 6, 1967, {{as part of their}} fourth album, Younger Than Yesterday. The title of Younger Than Yesterday was itself directly inspired by the song's refrain of [...] "Ah, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much older then/I'm younger than that now." [...] "My Back Pages" [...] was subsequently issued as a single by The Byrds on March 13, 1967, with the version included on the single being a radio edit that omitted the song's second verse, {{in order to reduce the}} playing time from 3:08 to 2:31. The single reached #30 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom. [...] "My Back Pages" [...] was the last single by The Byrds to reach the Top 40 of the U.S. charts.|$|E

500|$|Leandersson {{lives in}} Falun with her mother, stepfather, and two younger sisters. She is of Swedish and Iranian descent. Leandersson has always liked {{to dance and}} play theatre. Though there are several athletes in her family, she is not {{particularly}} fond of sports. [...] "I was on a football team when I was in third grade. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> bad that I wasn't allowed {{to play in a}} match", she recalled. She has stated on several occasions that she wants to continue acting, and has indicated that she would like to try different types of roles to challenge herself. Leandersson was a student at Gruvrisskolan. In an interview, she identified history as her favorite subject, because she finds it [...] "interesting to know how people lived and died in the past". She does not see school as a hindrance to continue acting, saying that she [...] "will just have to work harder than everyone else. But school isn't that difficult, it's quite easy." [...] She is a fan of the Twilight film series. In 2011-2014 years she is studying theatre at [...] ,a school for performing arts in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

Chisholm spoke of her eating disorder to Contact Music, stating: [...] "I'd hammered the gym {{for three hours}} a day. It {{was a way of}} running away, not thinking. I felt like a robot. When the papers started calling me 'Sumo Spice', I was only a size 10. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> upset by all the criticism, it got worse and I went up to a size 14".|$|E
2500|$|When {{war crime}} {{prosecutors}} later sought Avey's testimony for the Nuremberg Trials, {{they were unable}} to locate him. He kept the traumatic events about his wartime past a complete secret from everyone, including his first and second wives, along with his daughter. [...] "I knew there was something," [...] said his wife, Audrey. [...] "Naturally, you ask questions. But I never got an answer." [...] Avey explains: [...] "The sad irony was that I went in there to find out the truth, so I could tell everybody about the horrors of the Nazi regime. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> traumatised at my whole experience of the Auschwitz camps it took me 60 years to be able to recount the horrors I saw." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lady Annabel is {{the mother}} of Rupert, Robin and India Jane Birley and Jemima, Zac and Ben Goldsmith. [...] She has {{referred}} to herself as [...] "an incredible mother, rather a good mistress, but not a very good wife". With six children and five miscarriages, her primary vocation was motherhood, which prompted her to say: [...] "I'm not judgmental about women who work, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> besotted with my children I never wanted them out of my sight." [...] She was also considered a mother figure by her nieces, Ladies Cosima and Sophia Vane-Tempest-Stewart, and Diana, Princess of Wales. As the wife and ex-wife of two unfaithful men, she explained her marriage philosophy to the Times in 1987: [...] "I can never understand the wives who really mind, the wives who set such store by fidelity. How extraordinary, and how mad they are. Because, surely, if the man goes out and he comes back, it's not actually doing any harm." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Artists {{from the}} metal and hard rock {{community}} also paid homage to Jackson. Metallica {{paid tribute to}} Jackson during its encore at the Sonisphere Festival. Honoring Michael Jackson during its July 4 headlining appearance at the event, the band played a portion of 'Beat It' before easing into a riotous cover of Queen's 'Stone Cold Crazy'. Boston hard rockers Extreme performed a cover version of Jacksons's [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] at the Midnight Rodeo in Amarillo, Texas. Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill, spoke about Jackson in an interview for an internet blog: [...] "He was an immense star, wasn't he? Let's face it. He's a worldwide superstar really and the grief that everybody's is showing, it doesn't surprise me at all. He was a very, very talented man." [...] Members of the legendary metal band Black Sabbath released official statements regarding Jackson's death. Drummer Bill Ward: [...] "For those in heartache today, I wish you all wellness in healing. A great entertainer has died. I think those who experienced and heard his heart are more enlightened people for it than before. I believe you're all most fortunate to have connected to Michael Jackson." [...] Bassist Geezer Butler: [...] "Saddened and shocked to hear of the passing of Michael Jackson. He truly was, and always will be, a true icon. 'Thriller' {{was one of the}} greatest pop masterpieces of all time. A sad day for our world. R.I.P." [...] Legendary shock rocker, Alice Cooper released the following statement: [...] "Michael Jackson was easily as influential as James Brown, and that's saying a lot. We had Vincent Price in common. I used him first on 'Welcome To My Nightmare' in 1975, and he later used him on 'Thriller'. Nobody moved like Michael, he was truly the King of Pop." [...] Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen, who worked with Jackson during the recording of Thriller, stated: [...] "I am really shocked; as I'm sure the world is, to hear the news. I had the pleasure of working with Michael on 'Beat It' back in '83 — one of my fondest memories in my career. Michael will be missed and may he rest in peace." [...] Queen guitarist Brian May stated in his official website: [...] "Hard to know what to say — what to feel. I find myself wondering what might have happened on his tour... The number of dates in the U.K. that he had committed to was insane. I did have a feeling it was impossible, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> shocked to hear that he went so suddenly. Very sad. Of course, I still think of him as a boy — he used to come and see us (Queen) play when we were on tour in the States, and he and Freddie Mercury became close friends, close enough to record a couple of tracks together at Michael's house. Tracks which have never seen the light of day. Michael was the boy star of the Jackson Five, and always the most screamed at. I remember in their show, they tried very hard to make all the brothers equal in the presentation, but it was abundantly obvious that all most of the girl fans really wanted to see was little Michael. It was Michael who heard our track 'Another One Bites the Dust' when he came to see us on 'The Game' tour ... and told us we were mad if we didn't release it as a single." [...] Former Guns n' Roses guitarist Slash, who played guitar on Jackson's single [...] "Give In to Me" [...] stated: [...] "Really sad news about Michael. He was a talent from on high." [...] Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Audioslave performed a cover version of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] on June 27, 2009, at the Peace & Love festival in Borlänge, Sweden. Steve Vai and Andy Timmons of Danger Danger performed an instrumental version of [...] "Beat It" [...] at the Meinl Guitar Festival 2009 on June 27 in Gutenstetten, Germany. Former Skid Row frontman, Sebastian Bach commented: [...] "Another angel down... I am very sorry for my friend Jermaine's loss. I lived with Jermaine for three weeks last year (during the filming of the second season of CMT's hit series, 'Gone Country'), and we talked about his brother frequently. He said to me, 'When you cut up my brother, you're cutting up me'. I feel for the Jackson family, because I know all too well how they feel. Unfortunately." [...] Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche stated: [...] "I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, watching him and his brothers perform on television. He made performing seem easy and inspired my generation with his music and his grace. He was one of a kind and will be missed but his music will live forever." [...] Legendary Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen recorded [...] "Beat It" [...] with ex-Judas Priest/Iced Earth frontman Tim [...] "Ripper" [...] Owens on vocals. Guitarist Buckethead wrote a song entitled [...] "The Homing Beacon", inspired by Jackson's 3-D film, Captain EO. Alternative metal band CKY performed [...] "Beat It" [...] for the duration of their [...] "Carver City" [...] Tour. In some instances, guitarist Chad I Ginsburg wore T-shirts depicting Jackson during the performances.|$|E
