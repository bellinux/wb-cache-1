25|$|The first {{development}} of the modern ceramic brake was made by British engineers working in the railway industry for TGV applications in 1988. The objective was to reduce weight, the number of <b>brakes</b> per <b>axle,</b> {{as well as provide}} stable friction from very high speeds and all temperatures. The result was a carbon-fibre-reinforced ceramic process which is now used in various forms for automotive, railway, and aircraft brake applications.|$|R
5000|$|To combat {{these issues}} the Railway Clearing House (an {{organisation}} originally {{set up to}} share out revenue from joint services between companies) introduced minimum standards for private owner wagons in 1887. Companies that were signed up to the RCH refused to allow wagons that {{did not meet the}} standards in their trains, although there was a lengthy grace period for owners to upgrade or replace their older wagons. New and stricter standards were introduced by the RCH in 1909 which required hydraulic buffers and oil-lubricated bearings as well as numerous other details {{in the construction of the}} frame, <b>brakes,</b> <b>axles,</b> and suspension that made the RCH's design the basis for virtually every British mineral and goods wagon for the next 30 years. Wagons that complied with the standards carried a plate saying 'RCH'. Although the 1909 design standards were supposed to be fully enforced by 1914 the advent of World War I meant that they were suspended and many non-compliant wagons actually remained in service until well after the Grouping of 1921.|$|R

50|$|The steam {{locomotives}} of DRG Class 34.73, {{formerly the}} Mecklenburg Class P 3.1 were passenger train locomotives {{operated by the}} Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway and {{were based on the}} Prussian P 3.1. They were sometimes used in express train services to begin with. Of the 41 examples belonging to this administration, which were built between 1888 and 1908, two originally came from the Lloyd Railway (Neustrelitz-Warnemünde).

50|$|The {{coaches in}} these trains are of crash-worthy design from Alstom-LHB, built by Rail Coach Factory at Kapurthala. These Alstom-LHB coaches can be pulled to {{a speed of}} 160 km/h without any modification. New fast-express coaches are made partly or {{completely}} of stainless steel, primarily motivated by lower maintenance, and higher availability. Stainless steel construction also reduces empty weight, enabling more passengers per coach. The bogies, design from Fiat, has 2 disk <b>brakes</b> per <b>axle</b> essential for safe operations especially {{at the speed of}} fast-express trains.|$|R
5000|$|Unfortunately, the {{failures}} during the preliminary tests were indicative {{of how the}} vehicles would perform on the actual course. Two of the fifteen vehicles had to be withdrawn before the final race began and one car flipped upside down in the starting area {{and had to be}} withdrawn. Three hours into the event that was scheduled to last ten hours, only four vehicles remained operational. The vehicles suffered from a variety of mechanical problems, including [...] "stuck <b>brakes,</b> broken <b>axles,</b> rollovers, and malfunctioning satellite navigation equipment." ...|$|R
50|$|All {{units have}} four braking systems - electro-operating {{regenerative}} brakes and an electromagnetic brake {{on the drive}} chassis and an electro-mechanical brake and a spring parking <b>brake</b> on all <b>axles.</b> Air suspension is used to minimize the transmission of vibration from the chassis to the passenger compartment.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} some {{problems}} using disc brakes with certain frame designs. Under hard braking, the front wheel can come out from the dropouts. The problem has occurred when the brake pads and dropouts are aligned so the brake reaction force tends to eject the wheel from the dropout. Under repeated hard <b>braking,</b> the <b>axle</b> moves in the dropout {{in a way that}} unscrews the quick release. Riders should make sure the skewers are properly tightened before riding. Forks that use different brake/dropout orientations or through-axles are not subject to this problem.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars were}} {{initially}} handmade {{and based on}} Triumph Motor Company components. The first cars used the 832 cc side-valve engine from the Triumph Super 7 fitted to a chassis bought in from Rubery Owen, semi-elliptic leaf springs all round, and the hydraulic <b>brakes</b> and <b>axles</b> from the Triumph. The top speed was only 65 mph (105 km/h), which was too slow for serious sporting events: so from 1933 a 1098 cc, overhead-inlet, side-exhaust, four-cylinder, Coventry Climax engine was offered, followed in 1934 by the 1476 cc six-cylinder {{version of the same}} engine.|$|R
5000|$|Named {{to evoke}} {{memories}} of the Sunbeam Tiger, the Avenger Tiger concept began as a publicity exercise. Avenger Super (four-door) cars were modified by the Chrysler Competitions Centre under Des O' Dell and the Tiger model was launched in March 1972. Modifications included the 1500 GT engine with an improved cylinder head with enlarged valves, twin Weber carburetors and a compression ratio of 9.4:1. The engine now developed [...] at 6,100 rpm. The suspension was also uprated, whilst <b>brakes,</b> rear <b>axle,</b> and gearbox are directly from the GT.|$|R

50|$|On September 13, 2007, at the Defence Systems and Equipment International trade show, Chrysler LLC {{unveiled}} a Wrangler Unlimited version designed for military use dubbed the J8. The unarmored Jeep J8 {{is equipped with}} larger <b>brakes,</b> <b>axles</b> and suspension components than the civilian version and has a payload capacity of 1,339 kg (2,952 lb). The J8 also differs from the civilian model by utilizing heavy-duty rear leaf springs for carrying heavier payloads. The Jeep J8 {{is powered by a}} VM 2.8-liter (169 CID) four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine that produces 118 kW (158 hp) and 400 N·m (295 lbf·ft) of torque, providing towing capability of up to 3,500 kg (7,700 lb). The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission. The J8 also features a unique air-intake system with special filtration and a hood-mounted snorkel that enables the J8 to wade in water up to 762 mm (30 in) deep and tackle sandstorm conditions for up to five hours. Available as a two-door with an extended pickup bed for personnel or equipment transport, or a four-door multipurpose vehicle, it may be produced with numerous vehicle-body and seating configurations in either right-hand- or left-hand-drive. Targeted for use by the militaries in overseas markets, the J8 is not available in the United States because it will not meet U.S. emissions requirements. The J8 will be produced in Egypt.|$|R

Both were produced over many years. The 20.9 with a 3-litre engine producing 70 bhp shared components with the 3-litre Super Sports (<b>brakes,</b> suspension, steering, <b>axles,</b> gearbox, transmission).|$|R
50|$|Although the Aerostar used a {{dedicated}} platform, {{it was designed}} {{with a high degree}} of parts commonality with other Ford light-truck products of the time (initially, the Ford Ranger/Bronco II and the later Ford Explorer/Mazda Navajo). Components such as the <b>brake</b> rotors, <b>axle</b> bearings, wheels were all interchangeable and essentially any light-truck powertrain and suspension upgrades were also available to the Aerostar. One notable exception is that the Aerostar's rear suspension was designed with a 3-link coil spring rear suspension with a live rear axle. This rear suspension design was similar to that used by the Ford LTD Crown Victoria and Fox-body Mustang.|$|R
