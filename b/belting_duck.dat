The area has trees, shrubs, streams and ponds; and a habitat for heron, <b>belted</b> kingfisher, <b>ducks</b> and geese. The forested area {{is ideal for}} the crane-fly orchid, a rare species in Ohio. The site includes a wetland that contains spotted turtles, an endangered species in Ohio.|$|R

Before Sheamus could cash in, Kane appeared and performed Chokeslams on Rollins and Sheamus. Kane then executed a Tombstone Piledriver on Rollins and stood over him as the event ended.|$|R

Bald eagle, heron, <b>duck,</b> <b>belted</b> kingfisher and hawks are known to inhabit the refuge. [...] Restoration projects also improved sport fishing opportunities by providing better breeding habitat.

5000|$|A {{variety of}} bird species inhabit the area, {{including}} great blue heron, green-backed heron, mallard, wood <b>duck,</b> <b>belted</b> kingfisher, marsh wren, common yellowthroat, red-winged blackbird, and swamp sparrow. Eighteen Mile Creek is particularly significant because large concentrations of Coho and Chinook salmon and brown trout migrate from Lake Ontario into the creek each fall. In addition, steelhead migrate into Eighteen Mile Creek {{during the fall}} and between late February and April. Due {{to the importance of}} this area, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has determined that, [...] "Disturbances of wetland vegetation, including submergent beds, through dredging, filling, or bulkheading Olcott Harbor, would result in a direct loss of valuable habitat area." ...|$|R

50|$|In the {{earliest}} applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating {{mostly from the}} 18th century. Flat belts on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton <b>duck</b> <b>belts</b> usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The New Age Outlaws {{came out}} ostensibly {{accompanied}} by Dean Smith, {{which turned out}} to be merely a blow up doll. A large amount of ducking clotheslines prevented either competitor to take early advantage, with Animal also reversing a double-team move from both Outlaws. Animal then tagged in Hawk who dominated both Road Dogg and then Billy Gunn through various slams and running strikes. The Outlaws began to control the match after Gunn struck Animal's leg as LOD 2000 tried to finish Road Dogg with a Doomsday Device. Animal's knee became a target as both Outlaws frequently tagged, keeping their opponent mostly on the ground and focusing moves on the knee. After a collision that saw both Road Dogg and Animal grounded, both wrestlers tagged in their respective partners and Hawk came in with a flurry of clotheslines but as he pinned Road Dogg from a top rope splash, the referee had to help Animal back to his corner. This allowed Gunn to attack Hawk with the title belt. Hawk kicked out though, and with the referee again distracted, Hawk was held up to be struck again with the <b>belt</b> but <b>ducked,</b> leaving Road Dogg to strike Gunn and as Road Dogg looked on in shock, Hawk used a German suplex pin. However, the Outlaws were announced as winners as the referee was actually counting Hawk, whose shoulders were also on the mat under Road Dogg's legs. Hawk then clotheslined the referee, and LOD attacked the referee with a Doomsday Device.|$|R
