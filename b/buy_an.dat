40|$|AbstractTo better {{understand}} the reasons why households have no intention to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, a sample of 980 respondents, living in Xian, China was asked to specify the reasons why they do not wish <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car. A probit model was estimated to identify households {{who did not have}} the intention to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, based on their socio-demographic profile and living conditions. Because only these respondents could give the reasons why they do not wish to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, this selection model was linked with a multinomial logit model to estimate the probability that a particular reason for not <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> car mentioned. Results indicate that socio-demographic variables, type and size of the house and non-availability of parking space have significant effects on car purchase decisions. Main reasons for not <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> car are related to costs considerations, parking difficulties and congestion...|$|R

5|$|Nintendo {{targeted}} a wider demographic profile {{with the}} first Nintendo DS (2004) than it had with the Game Boy line.

30|$|Interestingly, the {{triangular}} structure is often exploited for rhetorical reasons, {{in particular in}} advertisements. A commercial slogan (popular in the 1980 s) such as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car, <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> Saab” has a real impact. Here the sentence initially understood as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 0 … ” yields a contradiction as a Saab is a car 0. Reinterpreted as “Don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car 1 …” (in which car 1 is the class of cars that are not Saab), it gets the exclusive interpretation. The cognitive effort is worthwhile in terms of effect as the hearer ends up with “buy a Saab” and “don’t <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> car {{that is not a}} Saab”.|$|R
