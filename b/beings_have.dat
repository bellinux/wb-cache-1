50|$|The {{concept of}} {{positive}} eugenics to produce better human <b>beings</b> <b>has</b> existed {{at least since}} Plato suggested selective mating to produce a guardian class. The idea of negative eugenics to decrease the birth of inferior human <b>beings</b> <b>has</b> existed at least since William Goodell (1829-1894) advocated the castration and spaying of the insane.|$|R

5|$|Weather {{forecasting}} is {{the application}} {{of science and technology}} to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given location and time. Human <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about {{the current state of the}} atmosphere at a given place and using meteorology to project how the atmosphere will change.|$|E
5|$|Ahimsa {{is one of}} the {{cardinal}} virtues and an important tenet of Jainism, Hinduism, and Buddhism. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has karmic consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, Mahatma Gandhi strongly believed in the principle of ahimsa.|$|E
5|$|Human <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> {{played a}} role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E

5|$|In {{his opinion}} all human <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> the same {{abilities}} {{with regard to}} reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in different ways and in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E
5|$|Nonviolent Communication {{is based}} on the idea that all human <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others when they do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Tales of the undead {{consuming}} {{the blood}} or flesh of living <b>beings</b> <b>have</b> {{been found in}} nearly every culture {{around the world for}} many centuries. Today we know these entities predominantly as vampires, but in ancient times, the term vampire did not exist; blood drinking and similar activities were attributed to demons or spirits who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the devil was considered synonymous with the vampire. Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, from the ghouls of Arabia to the goddess Sekhmet of Egypt. Indeed, some of these legends could have given rise to the European folklore, though they are not strictly considered vampires by historians when using today's definitions.|$|E
