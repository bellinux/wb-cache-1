25|$|Intense {{columns of}} Auroral {{ionization}} at 100km altitudes within the auroral oval backscatter radio waves, including those on HF and VHF. Backscatter is angle-sensitive—incident ray vs. magnetic field {{line of the}} column must be very close to right-angle. Random motions of electrons spiraling around the field lines create a Doppler-spread that broadens the spectra of the emission to more or less noise-likedepending on how high radio frequency is used. The radio-auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to middle latitudes. The occurrence of radio-auroras depends on solar activity (flares, coronal holes, CMEs) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima. Radio aurora includes the so-called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang-minima, the late-night radio aurora (sub-storming phase) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread. The propagation range for this predominantly <b>back-scatter</b> mode extends up to about 2000km in east-west plane, but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes.|$|E

40|$|<b>Back-scattered</b> {{surface waves}} can be {{migrated}} to detect near-surface reflectors with steep dips. A robust surface-wave migration requires the prior {{separation of the}} <b>back-scattered</b> surface-wave events from the data. This separation {{is often difficult to}} implement because the <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves are masked by the incident surface waves. We mitigate this problem by using a super-virtual interferometric method to enhance and separate the <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves. The key idea is to calculate the virtual <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves by stacking the resulting virtual correlated and convolved traces associated with the incident and <b>back-scattered</b> waves. Stacking the virtual <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves improves their signal-to-noise ratio and separates the <b>back-scattered</b> surface-waves from the incident field. Both synthetic and field data results validate the robustness of this method...|$|R

A monochromatic, i. e. fixed frequency, <b>back-scattering</b> kernel {{measured}} at all angles does not uniquely determine {{the index of}} refraction in an inhomogeneous medium, nor can it guarantee any upper bound on {{the support of the}} inhomogeneity. We show {{that it is possible to}} associate with any such kernel its convex <b>back-scattering</b> support, a convex set which must be a subset of the convex hull of the support of any inhomogeneity with that <b>back-scattering</b> kernel. For the Born approximation, we further demonstrate that there is an inhomogeneity supported in any neighborhood of the convex <b>back-scattering</b> support which has exactly that <b>back-scattering</b> kernel. Lastly, we discuss a practical implementation of these results and include a numerical example...|$|R

The different FE polarization states in the domains correspond to altered crystalline environments for the impingent primary beam electrons. We postulate that the resultant <b>back-scattered</b> electron domain contrast arises as a result of either differential absorption (through a channelling effect) or through back-diffraction from the sample, which leads to a projected diffraction pattern super-imposed with the diffuse conventional <b>back-scattered</b> electron intensity.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{simulate}} the ultrasonic image of a non-homogeneous biologic tissue reconstituted from the <b>back-scattered</b> echoes. These are due to the local variation of the volume density and of the compressibility of the medium. The theoretical approach for the derivation of the <b>back-scattered</b> field is based on Bloomfield generalization [1] of Jensen formalism [2]. The <b>back-scattered</b> signals are obtained by spatially convolving the spatial distribution of the inhomogeneity with the temporal auto-convolution function of the transmitted impulse response calculated. A spatial one-dimensional convolution is first operated in the depth direction.

Also, the scattered radiation is polarized {{in the same}} sense as the incident radiation. In the small-particle (or long-wavelength) limit, conditions can occur for zero forward scatter, for complete polarization of scattered radiation in other directions, and for asymmetry of forward scatter to backscatter.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that diffraction stack migration {{can be used}} to discover the distribution of near-surface faults. The methodology {{is based on the assumption}} that near-surface faults generate detectable <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves from impinging surface waves. We first isolate the <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves by muting or FK filtering, and then migrate them by diffraction migration using the surface wave velocity as the migration velocity. Instead of summing events along trial quasi-hyperbolas, surface wave migration sums events along trial quasi-linear trajectories that correspond to the moveout of <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves. We have also proposed a natural migration method that utilizes the intrinsic traveltime property of the direct and the <b>back-scattered</b> waves at faults. For the synthetic data sets and the land data collected in Aqaba, where surface wave velocity has unexpected perturbations, we migrate the <b>back-scattered</b> surface waves with both predicted velocity profiles and natural Green's function without velocity information. Because the latter approach avoids the need for an accurate velocity model in event summation, both the prestack and stacked migration images show competitive quality. Results with both synthetic data and field records validate the feasibility of this method. We believe applying this method to global or passive seismic data can open new opportunities in unveiling tectonic features...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>back-scattered</b> {{light by}} textile {{surfaces}} mainly {{depends on their}} surface state, which is often periodic and directional. The analysis of the reflectance spectra in <b>back-scattering</b> conditions of two hypes of structures (yarn, plain and twill weaves) shows {{the influence of the}} orientation of these surfaces as well as the <b>back-scattered</b> angle. In fact, the declination of the yarn orientation in relation to the incidence plane involves an increase of the reflectance factor to reach a maximum value when the Yarns are perpendicular to this plane. For woven fabrics, the backscattering of surface according to a given orientation primarily depends on its geometrical characteristic in this direction and consequently the used yarn densities. The computation of the ratio of mean quadratic surface roughness h to correlation length I for various used orientations shows the close link between this parameter and the evolution of <b>back-scattering.</b> The effect of the variation of backscattered angle on the <b>back-scattered</b> light varies with the value of h/l. The comparison between these experimental results and a theoretical study based on Gaussian and isotropic surfaces shows a satisfactory correlation between these two elements with the presence of some cases of discrepancy due to the different natures of the two types of surfaces.
