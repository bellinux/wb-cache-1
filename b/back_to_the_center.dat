500|$|Wallace Harrison's assistant, {{architect}} George Dudley, later stated: [...] "It literally {{took our}} breath away {{to see the}} simple plane of the site kept open from First Avenue to the River, only three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind them along the river’s edge... also said, ‘beauty {{will come from the}} buildings being in the right space!’. The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition {{seemed to me to be}} in everyone’s mind..." [...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. [...] This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.|$|E

[...] A Perfect Circle, another band featuring Keenan as lead vocalist, recorded a rendition of Mitchell's [...] "The Fiddle and the Drum" [...] on their 2004 album eMOTIVe, a collection of anti-war cover songs.|$|E
2500|$|Dexter filed {{a similar}} countersuit against Martin and Bernice on August 18, 2008, {{claiming}} they breached their duties to the King Center and their father's estate, misused assets {{belonging to the}} center and kept money that should have gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> and estate. Among the claims in the suit were that Martin improperly kept a $55,000 Lincoln Navigator SUV donated to the King Center for his own personal use, and that he [...] "commandeered a reception" [...] being held at the King Center and [...] "turned it into his own wedding reception." [...] Dexter claimed he made numerous attempts to get his siblings to stop such misuses of power but was unsuccessful. King III's lawyer, Jock Smith, denied the allegations as petty and misguided, and said the suit demonstrates Dexter King's misuse of power and his history of making poor decisions involving the Center without seeking proper input from his siblings.|$|E

She expressed {{having so much}} sacrifices for her singing career, stating [...] "I always order Halo-halo without ice. If I want to eat ice cream, I have to let it melt first or else microwave it. I also don’t eat spicy food or mint candies." [...] She explained, [...] "Of course, {{it was hard for}} me [...] But you get used to it." [...] She also sings twenty songs a day for practice. She takes good care of her voice and maintains a healthy diet, and swore it takes her only three days or less to recover from throat infections. In her 2011 documentary on TvN Asia, it was revealed that despite all the fame and success, Nina still regularly comes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Center</b> for Pop Music to train her vocals and make it even stronger. She is also known for doing covers of popular hits. She expressed herself in a statement, saying [...] "I can say that the songs I sing in my albums very much represent who I am [...] I try to make it my own even if it was done originally by another artist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wrapping legs {{requires}} {{care and}} skill. [...] A too loose bandage will fall off, potentially tangling in the horse's legs, causing panic or injury. [...] A too tight bandage may cause injury to tendons, ligaments and possible circulation problems. [...] Commercial boots for riding or shipping are simpler to apply as they attach with a {{hook and loop}} fastening, or, less often, with adjustable buckles. [...] Leg bandages require more attention. [...] A bandage is usually applied over a protective padding of roll cotton or a premade quilted pad. [...] The bandage is started {{on the outside of}} the leg, in the middle of the cannon bone, then wrapped down to either the fetlock or the hoof, depending on the purpose for which it is used, then back up to just under the knee, then <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the cannon just above the starting point, ending {{on the outside of the}} leg. [...] When wrapping a horses leg the left leg is wrapped in a counter-clockwise direction, and the right leg is wrapped in a clockwise direction, starting on the outside, moving front to back. [...] Legs may be bandaged with either disposable stretchable wrap that sticks to itself, or with washable fleece or cotton wraps that are reusable and fasten at the ends with a hook and loop closure. [...] Bandages may also be taped with medical tape to help them stay on.|$|E
2500|$|The Mask vs. Hair {{match between}} L.A. Park and El Mesías, {{which had been}} billed as the top match of the event, took place next, with L.A. Park being {{accompanied}} to the ring by his son El Hijo de L.A. Park and the wheelchair-bound Pierroth, neither of whom were working for AAA. Just like in their previous bout at December's Guerra de Titanes, both wrestlers were bloodied and L.A. Park's mask was torn to pieces during the brawl around the arena. With the match in his control following a Skull Bomb and a topé suicida, Park pulled out a table from under the ring, set it up inside the ring and climbed {{on top of it}} for his signature dance, but was then surprised by a diving spear through the table from El Mesías, which was however only good for a two count. El Mesías followed up with a double knee backbreaker and a Mesías Splash for another two count, before locking Park in a sharpshooter. Eventually, Park managed to reach the ropes, but El Mesías pulled him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the ring and re-applied the hold. Park feigned submission by lightly tapping El Mesías on the back, which led to him releasing the hold as he believed he had won the match. El Mesías climbed to the top rope to celebrate his [...] "win" [...] and when referee Piero tried to explain that Park had not in fact submitted, El Mesías swung his leg back and accidentally kicked him in the head. Park took advantage of the distraction, hit El Mesías with brass knuckles, made the pin and scored a three count to win the match. After the match, El Mesías had his hair shaved off with L.A. Park mocking Marisela Peña Roldan, who was seated in the front row. At this point the event had lasted over three and a half hours, which led to many in attendance leaving the arena after the match, not sticking around for the main event of the evening.|$|E

But his teeth only shut the tighter as the knives clashed together, and he thrust or eluded with a coolness born of conscious strength. At first he felt compassion for his enemy; but this fled before the primal instinct of life, which in turn gave way to the lust of slaughter. The ten thousand years of culture fell from him, and he was a cave-dweller, doing battle for his female.|$|E
