50|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>Coupler</b> - A brief {{description}} of <b>Bus</b> <b>Coupler.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>coupler</b> is {{a device}} {{which is used}} to couple one bus to the other without any {{interruption}} in power supply and without creating hazardous arcs. <b>Bus</b> <b>coupler</b> is a breaker used to couple two busbars in order to perform maintenance on other circuit breakers associatedwith that busbar.|$|E
50|$|Actuators {{receive data}} telegrams {{which are then}} {{converted}} into actions. This can include controlling blinds, dimming lights or controlling {{heating and air conditioning}} systems. Actuators are also selected depending on the required application and consist of a <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> and an application module with the corresponding application program.|$|E
50|$|The bus {{hardware}} encompasses (1) cabling, (2) <b>bus</b> <b>couplers,</b> (3) terminators and (4) connectors.|$|R
50|$|Terminating {{resistors}} {{values of}} 78.7 ohms 2 watt 1% are {{used on the}} MIL-STD-1553 bus. At the two ends of the bus, resistors connect between the positive (high) and negative (low) signal wires either in internally terminated <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> or external connectorized terminators.|$|R
5000|$|A Pluribus {{consisted}} {{of two or more}} standard 19" [...] electronic equipment racks, each divided into four bays. Each bay contained a backplane bus and an independent power supply. A bay might contain a processor bus, a shared memory bus, or an I/O <b>bus.</b> Custom-built <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> connected the bays to one another so that the processors could reach the shared memory and the I/O devices.|$|R
50|$|Stubs for RTs, the BC, or BMs, are {{generally}} {{connected to the}} bus through coupling boxes, which may provide a single or multiple stub connections. These provide the required shielding (≥ 75 percent) and, for transformer coupled stubs, contain the coupling transformers and isolation resistors. They have two external connectors through which the bus feeds, and one or more external connectors to which the stub or stubs connect. These stub connectors should not be terminated with matching resistors, but left open circuit when not used, with blanking caps where necessary. One of the bus connectors may be terminated where the <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> is physically {{at the end of}} the bus cable, i.e. it is not normally considered essential to have a length of bus cable between the last <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> and the termination resistor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>coupler</b> {{configurations}} {{are available}} as non-terminated or internally terminated. If {{two or more}} non-terminated couplers are used on a bus, then the couplers {{at each end of}} the bus must be terminated externally with 78 ohm terminators on the unused bus connections of the end couplers. Alternately, internally single terminated couplers (with or without the non-functional bus connectors) can be supplied.|$|E
50|$|The 400 kV {{substation}} interconnects four generator circuits, six feeders, two inter-bus transformers {{and includes}} two <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> switches and one main busbar section. The circuits {{are back to}} back and are arranged with the generator and interbus transformer connections on the power station side and the line entries {{on the opposite side}} of the substation. The current line entries are Bicker Fen-Walpole, Bicker Fen-Spalding North, Keadby 2, High Marnham, Cottam, and Keadby 1.|$|E
50|$|Even if {{only one}} non-terminated coupler acts as the bus because all devices (bus controller, remote terminals, etc.) are {{connected}} to the couplers stubs, the external bus connections of the coupler must be terminated. A dual-terminated coupler (with or without non-functional bus connectors) can be employed where the coupler acts as the <b>bus</b> without other <b>couplers.</b> RFI dust caps (with or without safety chains) are recommended for all unused stub ports. Data <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> are readily available in 2 through 8 stubs and in various sizes and shapes of boxes and slim inline models. Also a variety of connectors are offered with couplers.|$|R
50|$|MIL-STD-1553B {{specifies}} the transformer {{characteristics and}} turns ratio of 1.4:1 {{with the higher}} turns on the isolation resistor side of the stub. The MIL-STD-1553B also specifies the isolation resistors that are placed in series with each connection to the <b>bus.</b> Normally <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> are available with 1.4:1 transformer ratios and 59 ohm (2 watt 1%) resistors. For special applications, couplers can be supplied with different transformer ratios (e.g., 1:1) and other resistance values (e.g., 54.9 ohms).|$|R
5000|$|On August 9, 2012, {{the lander}} tipped over, crashed, caught fire, and {{exploded}} twice during its initial free-flight test at the Kennedy Space Center. The fire was extinguished after the tanks had exploded. No one was injured but the vehicle {{was not in}} a recoverable condition. [...] Following the accident about 70 different upgrades to the vehicle design and ground systems were made including adding some redundant instrumentation and mitigating the launch vibroacoustic environment. [...] Military-grade cable connectors and <b>bus</b> <b>couplers</b> have been fitted to the replacement vehicles as well as creating a flame trench on the launch-pad to reduce vibration. [...] A paper acting as an investigation report was published at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics: SPACE 2013 conference.|$|R

30|$|It can {{complete}} the redundancy protection functions of 110 kV single set configuration protection, including the redundancy protection of single-ended electrical quantity protection of 110 kV circuits (including reclosing, excluding pilot protection), and 110 kV <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> (bus sectioned) overcurrent protection. Redundancy is unnecessary in case both main protection and backup protection are configured for 110 kV main transformer.|$|E
40|$|The vast {{majority}} of work on waveguide-coupled reso-nators focuses on decreasing losses in the waveguide and coupling region. Here we present fully integrated reso-nators based on an ultralow-loss Si 3 N 4 waveguide plat-form. By tailoring the directional coupler excitation to the resonators, {{we are able to}} achieve lower loss single-mode coupling to multimode waveguide widths com-pared to straight <b>bus</b> waveguide directional <b>couplers.</b> This allows us to demonstrate record-high integrated waveguide coupled intrinsic quality factor (Qint) values of 81 million at a 9. 65 mm bend radius, with a future direction to both stronger and lower loss waveguide– resonator coupling. This result opens up integration possibilities for narrow linewidth integrated diode lasers, low noise feedback systems, microwave photonic research, and the ultrastable timing referenc...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} an {{industrial}} application of UPPAAL, {{in which a}} commercial field bus protocol (AF 100) is modelled and analysed using the tool. During the case study, a number of imperfections in the protocol logic and its implementation are found and their sources are debugged based on abstract models of the protocol; respective improvements have been suggested. In this paper, we shall summarize our experiences {{in dealing with the}} complexity of the protocol using various modelling and abstraction features provided in UPPAAL. As an example, we study the <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> of AF 100, which serves as the data link layer of the protocol. 1...|$|E
30|$|It can {{optimize}} and {{supplement the}} backup protection function, including supplementing the tripping failure protection function of 110 kV circuit breaker, adding the accelerated overcurrent protection on low-voltage {{side of the}} main transformer, and shortening the time for fault elimination of backup protection. Also, the simple bus protection functions of 35 kV and 10 kV buses are constructed based on the GOOSE information on the protection starting and operation of each bay. According to circuit breaker operating mode in the substation, one zone of transformer backup protection operation logic is added: if this logic judges that the <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> (or bus sectioning) CB is in trip state before protection tripping, the time delay of tripping circuit breakers at both sides of transformer will be shortened.|$|E
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the ESRF both the machine and the beamline control instrumentations were based on VME bus diskless crates equipped with Motorola CPU boards running OS- 9. Several modernization steps were performed to migrate from OS- 9 to Linux running either on the VME CPU or on a remote industrial PC, connected to the crate using PCI/VME <b>bus</b> <b>coupler.</b> An initial implementation of a generic VME driver interface was developed for Linux 2. 4 which allowed the same VME driver code to work on the different platforms. This paper presents the complete re-writing of the above VME layer to fully conform to the abstract bus/device interface provided in Linux 2. 6 kernel. The new subsystem separates the rolls of the VME hosts, controlling the targe...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis {{deals with}} use of {{electronic}} instrument transformers (sensors) in the protection system in medium-voltage substation. Substation consists of 2 incoming feeders, 2 outgoing feeders for motors, 2 outgoing feeders for power transformers, measuring, <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> and bus riser feeder. Incoming feeders are connected to distribution system E. ON by cable lines which were proposed. Protected machines (power transformers and motors with rated power) are connected to switchgear panels of UniGear ZS 1 type by cable lines too. Proposed protection system {{is based on the}} short-circuit conditions, standard CSN 33 3051 recommendations as well as theoretical backgrounds acquired from technical papers and other publicated literature according to the bibliography. For selected protection functions are defined their parameters. Control, monitoring and protection functions provides REF 542 plus relay. Consequently, secondary tests which are part of the commissioning, are given in the practical part of thesis. Secondary tests were performed by relay test system FREJA 300 by Megger.

40|$|The {{design and}} testing of {{laboratory}} hardware (a command decoder unit) used in evaluating space shuttle instrumentation, data processing, and ground check-out operations is described. The hardware was a modification of another similar instrumentation system. A data <b>bus</b> <b>coupler</b> was designed and tested to interface the equipment to a central bus controller (computer). A serial digital data transfer mechanism was also designed. Redundant power supplies and overhead modules were provided to minimize {{the probability of a}} single component failure causing a catastrophic failure. The command decoder unit is packaged in a modular configuration to allow maximum user flexibility in configuring a system. Test procedures and special test equipment for use in testing the hardware are described. Results indicate that the unit will allow NASA to evaluate future software systems for use in space shuttles. The units were delivered to NASA and appear to be adequately performing their intended function. Engineering sketches and photographs of the command decoder unit are included...|$|E
