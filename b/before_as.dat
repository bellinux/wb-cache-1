5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on {{instruction}} from Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in contravention of a standing IDF order, to clean and paint the compound that was burned three days <b>before.</b> <b>As</b> they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which had been called to extract the others.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} during the 1990s, it {{appeared}} that Jackson had become dependent on prescription drugs, mainly painkillers and strong sedatives. The drug use was later linked to second- and third-degree burns he had suffered years <b>before.</b> <b>As</b> more and more difficulty emerged in his life, he gradually became dependent on these drugs, and his health deteriorated. He went into rehabilitation in 1993 with the help of Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John.|$|E
5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} <b>before,</b> <b>as</b> he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E

5|$|By far {{the largest}} single cost was the {{purchase}} of the ship Terra Nova, for £12,500. Terra Nova had been in Antarctica <b>before,</b> <b>as</b> part of the second Discovery relief operation. Scott wanted to sail her as a Naval vessel under the White Ensign; to enable this, he obtained membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron for the sum of £100. He was thus able to impose Naval discipline on the expedition, and as a registered yacht of the Squadron, Terra Nova became exempt from Board of Trade regulations which might otherwise have deemed her unfit to sail.|$|E
5|$|In July, Spears {{announced}} her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, {{whom she had}} met three months <b>before.</b> <b>As</b> Federline had only recently ended his relationship with actress Shar Jackson, who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement {{was the subject of}} extensive media coverage. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.|$|E

His colleagues now shun him, the Bone War feud having alienated them, and he is forced to go to Barnum to try to obtain a loan, with the very Mexican antiquities he'd outbid Barnum on <b>before</b> <b>as</b> collateral.|$|E

5|$|Stroheim wrote {{a highly}} {{detailed}} 300-page script that contained camera movements, composition and tint cues. Among {{the changes that}} he made to Norris's novel was giving McTeague the first name of John and omitting Norris's anti-Semitism. McTeague had been filmed once <b>before</b> <b>as</b> Life's Whirlpool, a five-reel short by William A. Brady's World Pictures, starring Broadway star Holbrook Blinn as McTeague, which had been released in 1916. Film critics disliked this version and Stroheim later criticized Blinn's performance. According to film historian Kevin Brownlow, Life's Whirlpool was also shot on location in Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|The 2002–03 {{season was}} Linden's first full {{season with the}} Canucks since 1996–97, though Linden sprained his knee in the season opener and had to miss two weeks. He {{returned}} in time to be honoured for his 1,000th career game, which he achieved the season <b>before.</b> <b>As</b> {{he did not want}} to distract the team from the playoff race, Linden asked for the ceremony to be delayed. On November 25, 2002, against the Minnesota Wild, Linden scored his 263rd goal with the Canucks, breaking former captain Stan Smyl's team record for most goals. He finished the year with 19 goals and 22 assists for 41 points, his highest goal total in seven seasons, and his highest points total since 1998–99.|$|E

5|$|The {{letter to}} Æthelburg {{makes it clear}} that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald's {{conversion}} reached Rome. This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald's acceptance of Christianity, and it has been suggested in Bede's defence that Æthelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome, and that the letter was written while she was in Kent. However, it would appear from Boniface's letter that Boniface thought of Æthelburg as being at her husband's side. It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and Æthelburg, rather than <b>before,</b> <b>as</b> Bede has it; Boniface's letter to Edwin and Æthelburg indicates he had the news from messengers, but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself.|$|E
5|$|The wreck timbers {{were found}} under a {{sediment}} that preserved {{the remains of}} the wooden vessel, without which the wreck would have been lost due to marine worms. Wrecks of this age are rare finds and this particular one was in such a good condition that much of the hull was preserved. This has given us an insight into how ships of this period were constructed—something which has not been seen <b>before</b> <b>as</b> no Arabian ship of this type had previously been found, nor any with their cargo intact.|$|E
5|$|To {{construct}} the new Central line platforms, the larger diameter station tunnels were manually excavated around the existing running tunnels whilst trains continued to run. When the excavations were complete, the original segmental tunnel linings were dismantled. The new platforms came into use on 25 September 1933 replacing those of British Museum, which had closed the day <b>before.</b> <b>As</b> {{part of the}} modernisation the station was renamed Holborn (Kingsway) on 22 May 1933, but the suffix gradually dropped out of use and no longer appears on station signage or tube maps. The new platforms at Holborn led {{to the number of}} passengers switching between the lines increasing tenfold by 1938.|$|E
