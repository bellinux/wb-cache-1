40|$|While photospheric {{magnetic}} elements appear {{mainly as}} Bright Points (BPs) at the disk center and as faculae near the limb, high-resolution images reveal the coexistence of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae over {{a range of}} heliocentric angles. This is not explained by a "hot wall" effect through vertical flux tubes, and suggests that the transition from BPs to faculae needs to be quantitatively investigated. To achieve this, we made the first recorded attempt to discriminate <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae, using a statistical classification approach based on Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA). This paper gives {{a detailed description of}} our method, and shows its application on high-resolution images of active regions to retrieve a center-to-limb distribution of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae. Bright "magnetic" features were detected at various disk positions by a segmentation algorithm using simultaneous G-band and continuum information. By using a selected sample of those features to represent <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae, suitable photometric parameters were identified in order to carry out LDA. We thus obtained a Center-to-Limb Variation (CLV) of the relative number of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae, revealing the predominance of faculae at all disk positions except close to disk center (mu > 0. 9). Although the present dataset suffers from limited statistics, our results are consistent with other observations of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae at various disk positions. The retrieved CLV indicates that at high resolution, faculae are an essential constituent of active regions all across the solar disk. We speculate that the faculae near disk center as well as the BPs away from disk center are associated with inclined fields...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis and {{depression}} are prevalent among older postmenopausal women 65 years or older. Bisphosphonates (<b>BPs)</b> <b>and</b> selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) {{are commonly used}} medications to treat these conditions. Inhibitory effects of BPs on osteoclasts {{are responsible for the}} reduction in fracture risk. SSRIs, however, are associated with increased fracture risk through decreasing osteoblasts and increasing osteoclastic activity. These effects of SSRIs could attenuate the beneficial effects of BPs. This dissertation describes the concomitant use of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> SSRIs among postmeopausa women and reports findings from examining the association between concomitant use of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> SSRIs and fracture risk. Separate cross-sectional analyses were performed using data from the 2004 - 2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and Medicare Part D prescriptions claims data (2008 - 2010) to examine usage patterns of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> SSRIs/SNRIs for women aged ≥ 45 years and ≥ 65 years, respectively. For our second objective, a nested-case control was conducted using Medicare claims data (2008 - 2010). Data from Medicare inpatient claims were linked to Medicare Part D data for all female BP users 65 years or older. We used Cox proportional hazards model to assess the increased risk of osteoporotic-related fractures among propensity score matched (1 : 1 ratio) cohorts of concomitant users of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> SSRIs <b>and</b> <b>BP</b> alone users. Concomitant use of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> SSRIs was prevalent and increased with age for each timeframe examined. Findings showed that approximately 12 % (using MEPS) and 28 % (using Medicare data) of women on BPs were also on SSRIs. For the second objective, 4, 214 propensity score matched pairs (average age= 80. 4 years) of subjects were analyzed. Findings showed that concomitant use of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> SSRIs was associated with statistically significant increased risk for any fracture (HR= 1. 29, 95 % CI, 1. 07 - 1. 57), but statistically non-significant increased risk for hip (HR= 1. 16, 95 % CI, 0. 92 - 1. 47) and vertebral fractures (HR= 1. 55, 95 % CI, 0. 97 - 2. 48). Current findings indicate that concomitant use of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> SSRIs is not uncommon among postmenopausal women and suggest potential attenuation of antifracture efficacy of BPs by SSRIs. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical impact of concomitant use of these medications among older postmenopausal women...|$|R

5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast. During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast. During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years <b>BP,</b> <b>and</b> a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern Atlantic coast seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E

40|$|Taken {{at a high}} spatial {{resolution}} of 0. 1 arcsec, Bright Points (BPs) are found to coexist with faculae in images and the latter are often resolved as adjacent striations. Understanding the properties of these different features is fundamental to carrying out proxy magnetometry. To {{shed light on the}} relationship between <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae, we studied them separately after the application of a classification method, developed and described in a previous paper) on active region images at various heliocentric angles. In this Paper, we explore different aspects of the photometric properties of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae, namely their G-band contrast profiles, their peak contrast in G-band and continuum, as well as morphological parameters. We find that: (1) the width of the contrast profiles of the classified <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae are consistent with studies of disk center <b>BPs</b> at <b>and</b> limb faculae, which indirectly confirms the validity of our classification, (2) the profiles of limb faculae are limbward skewed on average, while near disk center they exhibit both centerward and limbward skewnesses due to the distribution of orientations of the faculae, (3) the relation between the peak contrasts of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae and their apparent area discloses a trend reminiscent of magnetogram studies. The skewness of facular profiles provides a novel constraint for 3 D MHD models of faculae. As suggested by the asymmetry and orientation of their contrast profiles, faculae near disk center could be induced by inclined fields, while apparent BPs near the limb seem to be in fact small faculae misidentified. The apparent area of <b>BPs</b> <b>and</b> faculae could be possibly exploited for proxy magnetometry...|$|R

5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When the BP gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, a chosen character can Default, which accumulates <b>BP</b> <b>and</b> reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is in sleep mode or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E
