5|$|RNAi has varying {{effects in}} {{different}} species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Possibly because their saliva and gut juice is <b>better</b> <b>at</b> breaking down RNA, the cotton bollworm, the beet armyworm and the Asiatic rice borer have {{so far not been}} proven susceptible to RNAi by feeding.|$|E

50|$|Originally from St Peters, Shaw played senior {{football}} with St Kilda {{for three}} seasons. He had his best year in 1994, when he amassed 365 disposals from his 21 appearances, which only Nathan Burke and Robert Harvey <b>bettered</b> <b>at</b> St Kilda.|$|R
5|$|Triceratops were herbivorous, {{and because}} of their low head, their primary food was {{probably}} low growth, although {{they may have been}} able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk. The jaws were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been <b>better</b> <b>at</b> grasping and plucking than biting.|$|E
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got <b>better</b> <b>at</b> preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{was born}} in Vancouver and raised in Burnaby, British Columbia. His father, Magnus, {{is the son of}} a Norwegian immigrant, and his mother, Anne, is of Ukrainian origin. He has two {{brothers}} (Allan and David) and a sister (Pam). As a young child, Anderson did not enjoy the game of ice hockey. His first ever goal was in his own net. However, as he grew older, and <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the game, Anderson's love of the game increased.|$|E

5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly <b>better</b> <b>at</b> identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking about how you sometimes know that you would be <b>better</b> <b>at</b> love if only you were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Grosmont's early years, {{but that he was}} born at Grosmont Castle in Grosmont, Monmouthshire, Wales, and that he was born c. 1310, not {{around the turn of the}} century as {{previously}} held. According to his own memoirs, he was <b>better</b> <b>at</b> martial arts than at academic subjects, and did not learn to read until later in life. In 1330 he was knighted, and represented his father in parliament. The next year he is recorded as participating in a royal tournament at Cheapside.|$|E

MRI {{has the advantage}} of being <b>better</b> <b>at</b> detecting damage to the brain itself {{as a result of the}} increased pressure on the obstructed veins, but it is not readily available in many hospitals and the interpretation may be difficult.|$|E
5|$|Original Tulipa {{species can}} be {{obtained}} for ornamental purposes, such as Tulipa tarda and Tulipa turkestanica. These {{are referred to as}} species, or botanical, tulips, and tend to be smaller plants but <b>better</b> <b>at</b> naturalising than the cultivated forms. Breeding programs have produced a wide range of tulip types, enabling blooming through a much longer season by creating early, mid- and late spring varieties. Fourteen distinct types are available in addition to botanical tulips, including Lily-flowered, Fringed, Viridiflora and Rembrandt. In addition to blooming season, tulip varieties differ in shape, and height, and exhibit a wide range of colours, both pure and in combination.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't be <b>better</b> <b>at</b> these endgames {{than someone who}} had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E

5|$|Smalls Paradise had {{no cover}} charge and stayed open longer {{than most of the}} others, {{including}} the Cotton Club. At Smalls Paradise, patrons could also reserve a seat at the club by paying a yearly fee. Many regular visitors of Harlem's night clubs also found the food <b>better</b> <b>at</b> Smalls Paradise than at either The Cotton Club or Connie's Inn. While most of the night spots shut their doors between 3 and 4 am, Smalls Paradise began breakfast dances at 6 am with a floor show of up to 30 dancers and a full jazz band.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurs were herbivorous dinosaurs; they {{probably}} fed mostly on low growth {{because of the}} position of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller plants with their horns, beak, and bulk.

5|$|The American sailors {{participated in}} Fleet {{sporting}} events, as well, giving excellent account of themselves. At the Fleet track meet, Battleship Division Nine finished second, and did even <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the annual boxing championships, {{the pinnacle of}} the Grand Fleet sporting year. An engineman from Florida won the lightweight title, a chief carpenter's mate from New York won the middleweight title, and a fireman from the same ship reached the heavyweight finals.|$|E

5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with few or no problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, the autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found to be <b>better</b> <b>at</b> maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} birds to {{navigate}} during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, {{even with the}} help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are <b>better</b> <b>at</b> making corrections for wind drift.|$|E
5|$|The fourth- and second-to-last {{riders to}} leave the starthouse, Levi Leipheimer and Denis Menchov, put up the best rides of the day, with Menchov between 30 seconds and a minute better than Leipheimer at the three {{intermediate}} time checks, and 20 seconds <b>better</b> <b>at</b> the line for the stage win. Menchov's ride propelled him into the pink jersey, while Leipheimer narrowly missed taking enough time out of Di Luca to move past him in the general classification. Di Luca finished sixth on the stage.|$|E
