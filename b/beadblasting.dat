5000|$|Strider uses a {{proprietary}} heat treatment originally developed by Paul Bos of Buck Knives. [...] This resulted in knives with blades of ATS-34 or BG-42 {{coming back from}} heat treat with a very dark colored blade which would then be bead blasted a flat grey color. After masking a blade before <b>beadblasting,</b> Mick Strider found it resulted in a striping or camouflage effect {{and it has become}} a part of the design. [...] As the newest steel Strider uses, CPM S30V does not darken after heat treating, a black oxide coating is applied beforehand.|$|E
