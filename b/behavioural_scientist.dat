40|$|Introduction The {{increasing}} importance {{accorded the}} social and behavioural sciences in medical education presents opportunities for developing new and innovative forms {{of teaching and learning}} in this field. Yet social and <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientists</b> often feel isolated and marginalized. This research was designed to build a network of such practitioners to share and compare current practice, and to develop better models and resources. Methods Questionnaire survey and workshop discussions describe current practice among social and <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientists</b> in UK medical education, and identify current and future issues. Results Most UK medical curricula feature a significant social and behavioural science component, often in multidisciplinary contexts. Questions of core content, and how this relates to desired learning outcomes, particularly in the attitudinal sphere, remain unresolved. Identity problems result from differing perspectives of medics and social and <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientists,</b> staffing constraints, assessment regimes, and relationships with external examiners. Discussion This project identified barriers and opportunities for providing adequate training in {{the social and}} behavioural sciences in medical schools. Some of the barriers are common to higher education generally. Through our network, a database of core cases and assessments can be developed that would be available to all for teaching purposes. Conclusion Social and <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientists</b> involved in medical education show commonality and difference in the extent and scope of their input. While they have made great progress, there remains much to achieve. ...|$|R

First, social capital is not equally {{available}} to all, {{in much the same way}} that other forms of capital are differently available. Geographic and social isolation limit access to this resource. Second, not all social capital is created equally. The value of a specific source of social capital depends in no small part on the socio-economic position of the source with society. On top of this, Portes has identified four negative consequences of social capital: exclusion of outsiders; excess claims on group members; restrictions on individual freedom; and downward levelling norms.|$|E

Frisch {{was disappointed that}} his commercially very successful plays Biedermann und die Brandstifter and Andorra had both been, in his view, widely misunderstood. His answer was {{to move away from}} the play as a form of parable, in favour of a new form of expression which he termed [...] "Dramaturgy of Permutation" [...] ("Dramaturgie der Permutation"), a form which he had introduced with Gantenbein and which he now progressed with Biographie, written in its original version in 1967. At the centre of the play is a <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientist</b> who is given the chance to live his life again, and finds himself unable to take any key decisions differently the second time round. The Swiss premier of the play was to have been directed by Rudolf Noelte, but Frisch and Noelte fell out in the Autumn of 1967, a week before the scheduled first performance, which led to the Zürich opening being postponed for several months. In the end the play opened in the Zürich Playhouse in February 1968, the performances being directed by Leopold Lindtberg. Lindtberg was a long established and well regarded theatre director, but his production of Biografie: Ein Spiel neither impressed the critics nor delighted theatre audiences. Frisch ended up deciding that he had been expecting more from the audience than he should have expected them to bring to the theatrical experience. After this latest disappointment it would be another eleven years before Frisch returned to theatrical writing.|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of complexity, {{a new kind of}} {{explanation}} has been developed for social behaviour. It shows how patterns of social behaviour can arise as a side-effect of the interaction of individuals with their social or physical environment (e. g. by self-organization). This development may influence our ideas about the direct causation and evolution of social behaviour. Furthermore, it may influence our theories about the integration of different traits. This new method has been made possible by the increase in computing power. It is now applied in many areas of science, such as physics, chemistry, sociology and economics.

40|$|One of the {{essential}} considerations in architectural design is how people use the built environments. Adequate study of environmental behaviour can reveal significant information about that use. This research suggests applying new computing technologies to enhance environmental behaviour study, in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, this project will develop an integrated system of automatic video tracking and video-quality virtual reality. The integrated system will provide designers and <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientists</b> with substantial statistical measurements of end user behaviour patterns. Furthermore it {{will enable them to}} walk through the virtual reality of the environments and interactively observe details of the behaviours from various viewpoints. Thus, this project can help obtain behaviour data in different levels of details, and in a structured and planned way that can facilitate analysis of the data with maximum automation. The major significance of this project is an introduction of a rigorous new methodology into environmental behaviour study to enhance first-person observation with state-of-the-art computing technologies. This research will be a novel application of virtual reality in environmental behaviour study. We expect that it will fundamentally advance the methods <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientists</b> use to study human environmental behaviour, and the ways architects evaluate architectural design in terms of human behaviour...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, many <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientists</b> {{have come}} to see {{imitation}} as an important manifestation of intelligence in nonhuman species. This is a remarkable sea change in at-titude, because less than a generation ago imitation was re-garded as more of a nuisance. True intelligence, it used to be thought, is indicated by insight. The “cheap trick ” of im-itating allowed nonhuman species to simulate intellectual capacities they did not have. Even now, this remains the lay view: imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, {{but it is not a}} sign of intelligence. (A tradition of distinguishing certain kinds of imitation as cognitively complex can be traced back to the last century, as we note in sect. 1. 1, so the sea change is in some ways more of a renaissance.) Im-itation’s recent promotion to the status of an intellectual as-set in cognitive science has been accompanied by a wealth of evidence that many nonhuman species are unable to learn by imitating the actions they see others perform, whereas even newborn humans are now reported to show imitation.

It is reported that 60 – 80 per cent of diagnosis is based on history taking, yet there is little published data advising on the best method for medical students to initially attain and further refine these core skills during their medical degree. Methods Medical students interviewed two patients: using an open interview first, based on the Calgary–Cambridge approach, and then using a structured pro forma. The students' medical data were assessed by a senior lecturer, and their communication skills were assessed by a <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientist</b> and by the patients. Results An exact Wilcoxon paired signed rank test was conducted {{to determine whether there}} was a difference between the open interview and pro forma methods for history taking and communication skills.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was funded by}} the EPSRC (EP/K 012797 / 1). Purpose: To examine dentists' views of a novel video review technique to improve communication skills in complex clinical situations. Materials and Methods: Dentists (n = 3) participated in a video review known as Video Interaction Guidance to encourage more attuned interactions with their patients (n = 4). Part of this process is to identify where dentists and patients reacted positively and effectively. Each dentist was presented with short segments of video footage taken during an appointment with a patient with intellectual disabilities and communication difficulties. Having observed their interactions with patients, dentists were asked to reflect on their communication strategies with the assistance of a trained VIG specialist. Results: Dentists reflected that their VIG session had been insightful and considered the review process as beneficial to communication skills training in dentistry. They believed that this technique could significantly improve the way dentists interact and communicate with patients. The VIG sessions increased their awareness of the communication strategies they use with their patients and were perceived as neither uncomfortable nor threatening. Discussion: The VIG session was beneficial in this exploratory investigation because the dentists could identify when their interactions were most effective. Awareness of their non-verbal communication strategies and the need to adopt these behaviours frequently were identified as key benefits of this training approach. One dentist suggested that the video review method was supportive because it was undertaken by a <b>behavioural</b> <b>scientist</b> rather than a professional counterpart. Conclusion: Some evidence supports the VIG approach in this specialist area of communication skills and dental training. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
