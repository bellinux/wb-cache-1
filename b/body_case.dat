The orbits of all planets are to high accuracy Kepler orbits around the Sun.

The orbits of the artificial satellites around the Earth are, with a fair approximation, Kepler orbits with small perturbations due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, the moon and the oblateness of the Earth. In high accuracy applications for which the equation of motion must be integrated numerically with all gravitational and non-gravitational forces (such as solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag) being taken into account, the Kepler orbit concepts are of paramount importance and heavily used.|$|E

40|$|We propose an {{extension}} of a recent non-perturbative method suited for solving the N-body problem in (2 + 1) -gravity {{to the case of}} Chern-Simons supergravity. Coupling with supersymmetric point particles is obtained implicitly by extending the DJH matching conditions of gravity. The consistent solution of the interacting case is obtained by building a general non-trivial mapping, extending the superanalytic mapping, between a flat polydromic X M supercoordinate system and a physical one x N, representing the DJH matching conditions around the superparticles. We show how to construct such a mapping in terms of analytic functions, and we give their exact expressions for the two <b>body</b> <b>case.</b> The extension to the N <b>body</b> <b>case</b> is also discussed. In the Minkoskian coordinates the superparticles move freely, and in particular the fermionic coordinates Θ(ξN (i)) are constants, whose values can be fixed by using the monodromy properties. While the bosonic part of the supergeodesic equations are obtained, as in gravity, by measuring the bosonic distance in Minkowskian space-time...|$|E

Using linear, exponential and power regressions we analyzed the relationship between <b>body</b> and <b>case</b> dimensions and the biomass of Phylloicus elektoros Prather, 2003. Furthermore, we used cross-validation to evaluate the predictions of our models and of the models developed for Phylloicus sp. from southeastern Brazil. We measured four body dimensions (head capsule width, interocular distance, body and pronotum length) of 152 larvae and two case dimensions (width and length) of 45 cases. Case width provided better fit with biomass than case length in all model classes. Body length provided the best biomass prediction. Biomass predictions using models proposed in the literature were 75 % lower than the observed values. The power model provided the best fit between <b>body</b> and <b>case</b> dimensions with biomass. However, exponential models also provided good biomass estimates. We observed a close fit between <b>body</b> and <b>case</b> dimensions and biomass, but the predictive power of the models was low (~ 40 %). The predictive power of models proposed in the literature was much worse than those built from local data and thus we do not recommend their use to predict the biomass of organisms from different regions...|$|R
40|$|What is queer? What is queer? What is queer theory? Where can it go from here? This thesis {{sets out}} to explore the origins and {{influences}} of queer theory before investigating {{the present and the}} future spaces (ie, bodies and settlements) it can potentially move into. Three distinct experiments of fieldwork and ethnographic filmmaking test the truths and potentialities of queer theory when relating to queer bodies and settlements. That is to say that each chapter balances a film and its supporting text by embracing the value and urgency of practice led research. 	The first chapter questions queer history and details the importance of emerging trans politics in the post-gender, leftist, avant-garde, queer activist and militant space of Bologna. Queer <b>bodies,</b> <b>case</b> one: transgender and transsexual perspectives. Settlements, case one: Bologna and Lido di Classe (Italy). The second chapter considers the interface between disability theory and queer theory with particular attention paid to the practical theory of â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 curative educationâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9. Defined by Rudolf Steiner in 1922 and further developed by Karl KÃ¶nig with the foundation of the Camphill movement in 1944, curative education privileges the social model over the medical model in the field of disability so that disability is in fact ability. Queer <b>bodies,</b> <b>case</b> two: learning differences and disabilities perspectives. Settlements, case two: Berlin (Germany), Chatou and La Rochelle (France), Barry and Glasallt Fawr (Wales, United Kingdom). The third chapter uses queer perspectives to promote the relevance of quantum physics to the human body, thus involving contemporary dance, physical theatre and the arts more generally to address and redress the chiasm between science and technology on the one hand, and arts, humanities and socio-cultural sciences on the other. Queer <b>bodies,</b> <b>case</b> three: the inescapably queer reality of the physical world. Settlements, case three: multiple locations in Tuscany (Italy), and Thamesmead, London (England, United Kingdom).

40|$|Hydrodynamic flow {{around a}} {{simplified}} hull form {{has been investigated}} using numerical simulations in OpenFOAM. The flow in question is three-dimensional and turbulent at a Reynolds number of 26, 400. The base geometry is a rectangular cylinder (or box) with an aspect ratio of 5 : 1, and flow in longitudinal (x-) direction (cross-flow width is 1 and in-flow length is 5). The height {{of the body is}} 1 in the z-direction, hence it is quadratic in the y-z plane. Simulations have been run in parallel on the supercomputer Vilje at NTNU. Three different cases have been investigated. Two of the cases are concerned with double-body flow. This means the geometry is "doubled" (mirrored across the x-y plane), and fully submerged with fluid on all sides. The difference between these two cases is the turbulence modelling; one uses Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS), while the other uses Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The third case is called the floating <b>body</b> <b>case.</b> This is not a double-body, but a "single" body next to a simple free-slip approximated free surface boundary. The floating <b>body</b> <b>case</b> uses RANS. Both the RANS and the LES approaches are based on decomposing the field variables. In RANS, variables are decomposed into a mean and a fluctuating part. In LES, they are decomposed into a filtered and a residual part based on a filter width. In short, RANS decomposition is based on statistical averaging, while LES decomposition is based on spacial filtering. LES is generally much more detailed, and requires a much finer grid. RANS is relatively simple, and much faster to run. Increased accuracy from LES must be paid for in increased computational effort. For both RANS cases, the grid used was the same (only doubled in the double-body case). Wall functions were applied to reduce cell count near the wall and hence simulation time. The LES grid was much finer, as is required when the whole boundary layer is to be resolved. Applied turbulence models were the realizable k-epsilon model (RANS) and the Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model (LES). These models proved to be well suited to describe the flow in question. The results showed some differences between the cases. One difference was higher force coefficients in the floating <b>body</b> <b>case</b> than in the double-body case. This was likely caused by the restrictive free-slip free surface boundary in the floating <b>body</b> <b>case.</b> A grid sensitivity study for the double-body RANS case showed that the applied grid is fine enough for this application. Due to limited time and computational resources, the LES case could not be run long enough to achieve satisfying statistical convergence. Therefore, the comparison between RANS and LES in this project has some shortcomings. It was, however possible to draw some conclusions from it. LES is clearly better at capturing the vortex shedding, and maintaining it further downstream. The RANS simulations also captured vortex shedding, but not as accurately. Another result of the comparison was that RANS seemed to under predict the drag coefficient...|$|E
