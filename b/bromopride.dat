40|$|To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>bromopride</b> in the prophylaxis of nausea during fluorescein angiography, when compared with a placebo. The study was a double-masked random clinical trial, between December of 2004 and April of 2005. Examinations were performed with 20 % intravenous fluorescein sodium in a single dose of 2. 5 ml. The patients {{were divided into two}} groups: group 1, patients who received a 2 ml intravenous dose of 5 mg/ml <b>bromopride</b> and group 2, patients who received a 2 ml intravenous dose of 0. 9 % sodium chloride (placebo), both 20 minutes before the dye injection. Cases of nausea were observed during and after the examination. 352 patients were enrolled, 176 in each group. Cases of nausea were observed in 12 (6. 8 %) patients of the <b>bromopride</b> group and in 11 (6. 3 %) patients of the placebo group (p< 0. 829 - relative risk= 1. 05). <b>Bromopride</b> did not prevent the occurrence of nausea in fluorescein angiography, when compared with a placebo...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Evaluate {{the effects}} of <b>bromopride</b> on {{abdominal}} wall healing of rats with induced peritoneal sepsis after segmental colectomy and colonic anastomosis. METHODS: Forty rats underwent sectioning of the left colon and end-to-end anastomosis and {{were divided into two}} groups of 20 animals for the administration of <b>bromopride</b> (<b>bromopride</b> group - B) or saline solution (control group - C). Each group was divided into subgroups of 10 animals each to be killed on the third (GB 3 and GC 3) or seventh postoperative day (GB 7 and GC 7). It was analyzed the following characteristics: breaking strength of the abdominal wall's wound; surgical and histopathological features of the abdominal wall; and clinical features of the rats. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups in relation to the weight of the rats and the breaking strength of the abdominal wall's wound. The GB 7 group presented less edema and less quantity of fibrin during histopathological evaluation compared to the GC 7 group. CONCLUSION: <b>Bromopride</b> did not have harmful effects on the healing of abdominal wall in rats...|$|E
40|$|Anastomotic {{dehiscence}} is {{the most}} severe complication of colorectal surgery. Metalloproteinases (MMPs) and interleukins (ILs) {{can be used to}} analyze the healing process of anastomosis. To evaluate the effects of <b>bromopride</b> on MMP and cytokine gene expression in left colonic anastomoses in rats with or without induced abdominal sepsis, 80 rats were divided into two groups for euthanasia on the third or seventh postoperative day (POD). They were then divided into subgroups of 20 rats for sepsis induction or not, and then into subgroups of 10 rats for administration of <b>bromopride</b> or saline. Left colonic anastomosis was performed and abdominal sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. A colonic segment containing the anastomosis was removed for analysis of gene expression of MMP- 1 &# 945;, MMP- 8, MMP- 13, IL-&# 946;, IL- 6, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor-&# 945; (TNF-&# 945;), and interferon-&# 947; (IFN-&# 947;). On the third POD, <b>bromopride</b> was associated with increased MMP- 1 &# 945;, MMP- 13, IL- 6, IFN-&# 947;, and IL- 10 gene expression. On the seventh POD, all MMP transcripts became negatively modulated and all IL transcripts became positively modulated. In the presence of sepsis, <b>bromopride</b> administration increased MMP- 8 and IFN-&# 947; gene expression and decreased MMP- 1, TNF-&# 945;, IL- 6, and IL- 10 gene expression on the third POD. On the seventh POD, we observed increased expression of MMP- 13 and all cytokines, except for TNF-&# 945;. In conclusion, <b>bromopride</b> interferes with MMP and IL gene expression during anastomotic healing. Further studies are needed to correlate these changes with the healing process...|$|E
40|$|Reproducibility of {{the tablet}} {{manufacturing}} process {{and control of}} its pharmaceutics properties depends on the optimization of formulation aspects and process parameters. Computer simulation such as Design of Experiments (DOE) {{can be used to}} scale up the production of this formulation, in particular for obtaining sustained-release tablets. <b>Bromopride</b> formulations are marketed in the form of extended-release pellets, which makes the product more expensive and difficult to manufacture. The aim {{of this study was to}} formulate new <b>bromopride</b> sustained release formulations as tablets, and to develop mathematical models to standardize the scale up of this formulation, controlling weight and hardness of the tablets during manufacture according to the USP 34 th edition. DOE studies were conducted using Minitab(tm) software. Different excipient combinations were evaluated in order to produce <b>bromopride</b> sustained-release matrix tablets. In the scale-up study, data were collected and variations in tableting machine parameters were measured. Data were processed by Minitab(tm) software, generating mathematical equations used for prediction of powder compaction behavior, according to the settings of the tableting machine suitable for scale-up purposes. <b>Bromopride</b> matrix tablets with appropriate characteristics for sustained release were developed. The scale-up of the formulation with the most suitable sustained release profile was established by using mathematical models, indicating that the formulation can be a substitute for the pellets currently marketed...|$|E
40|$|A reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (LC) and {{ultraviolet}} (UV) spectrophotometric {{methods were}} developed and validated for the assay of <b>bromopride</b> in oral and injectable solutions. The methods were validated according to ICH guideline.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} <b>bromopride</b> on the healing of left colonic anastomoses in rats with induced abdominal sepsis. METHODS: Forty rats {{were divided into two}} groups to receive either <b>bromopride</b> (experimental group- E) or saline (control group- C). Each group was divided into subgroups of ten animals each to be euthanized on third (E 3 and C 3) or seventh day (E 7 and C 7) after surgery. Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The rats underwent segmental left colon resection and end-to-end anastomosis. Adhesion formation, tensile strength and hydroxyproline concentration were assessed. Histomorphometry of collagen and histopathological analysis were also performed. RESULTS: On postoperative third day, anastomoses in bromopride-treated animals showed lower tensile strength (p= 0. 02) and greater reduction in hydroxyproline concentration (p= 0. 04) than in control animals. There was no statistical difference in these parameters on seventh day, and the remaining parameters were similar across subgroups. Collagen content was also similar across subgroups. CONCLUSION: In the presence of abdominal sepsis, the administration of <b>bromopride</b> was associated with decreased tensile strength and hydroxyproline concentration in left colonic anastomoses in rats three days after surgery...|$|E
40|$|Six benzamides {{could be}} {{detected}} by gas chromatography with surface ionization detection (GC-SID) with high sensitivity. They were classified into two groups, a higher response group (Group I: tiapride, <b>bromopride</b> and metoclopramide) {{and a lower}} response group (Group II: sultopride, trimethobenzamide and nemonapride). The detection limits were 0. 02 to 0. 17 pmol on column (1 to 8. 5 pmol/ml) in Group I drugs and 0. 2 to 0. 9 pmol on column (10 to 45 pmol/ml) in Group II drugs.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} effect of prokinetic agents on {{abdominal}} wall wound healing in rats submitted to segmental colectomy and colonic anastomosis. METHODS: Sixty rats were randomly allocated into three groups according to the agents they would receive in the postoperative period: M (metoclopramide); B (bromopride); and C (control, saline 0. 9 %). Surgical procedures were performed identically in all animals, and consisted of a midline laparotomy followed by resection of a 1 -cm segment of large bowel with end-to-end anastomosis. The abdominal wall was closed in two layers with running stitches. Abdominal wall samples were collected on the 3 rd or 7 th postoperative day for measurement of breaking (tensile) strength and histopathological assessment. RESULTS: There were {{no statistically significant differences}} in tensile strength of the abdominal wall scar between groups M, B, and C, nor between the three and seven days after surgery subgroups. On histopathological assessment, there were no statistically significant between-group differences in collagen deposition or number of fibroblasts at the wound site CONCLUSION: Use of the prokinetic drugs metoclopramide or <b>bromopride</b> had no effect on abdominal wall healing in rats submitted to segmental colectomy and colonic anastomosis...|$|E
