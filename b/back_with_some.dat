5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And Then There Were None, and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{defeated}} the wider insurgency at the Battle of Maidstone {{at the start}} of June, and then sent a force under the command of Colonel Nathaniel Rich to deal with Deal and the other castles along the Downs. Walmer Castle was the first to be besieged, and surrendered on 12 July. Deal, which had been resupplied by the Royalists from the sea, was besieged in July. A Royalist fleet bombarded the Parliamentary positions and temporarily landed a force 1,500 Flemish mercenaries in support of the revolt, but a shortage of money forced their return to the Continent. The garrison then carried out a surprise attack on their besiegers but were fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> losses. The fleet, under the command of Prince Charles, attempted to land a fresh force in August, but despite three attempts the operation failed and suffered heavy losses. After news arrived of the Royalist defeat at Preston, Deal surrendered on 20 August, and artillery assaults then began on Sandown, leading to the surrender of the remaining fortification.|$|E
5|$|Both {{male and}} female mallards have {{distinct}} iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the <b>back</b> (<b>with</b> <b>some</b> yellow spots) {{all the way to}} the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period. The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty.|$|E

25|$|Joseph Frazer {{had been}} {{operating}} with John Bell {{for a number}} of years and on 11 April 1875, he was operating a pearling boat, for the John Bell, and based at Jervis Island (now Mabuiag Island) in the Torres Strait, he was anchored off Night Island (Queensland) and some men were sent ashore to find water. The landing party came across a group of Aborigines accompanied by a white man and reported the encounter to the captain. Joseph Frazer sent his men <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> things to barter in exchange for the white man. It was found that Narcisse Pelletier had been a castaway for 17 years.|$|E
25|$|On October 7, Buell's army, {{in pursuit}} of Bragg, converged on the small {{crossroads}} town of Perryville in three columns. Union forces first skirmished with Confederate cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the fighting became more general, on Peters Hill, when the Confederate infantry arrived. Both sides were desperate {{to get access to}} fresh water. The next day, at dawn, fighting began again around Peters Hill as a Union division advanced up the pike, halting just before the Confederate line. After noon, a Confederate division struck the Union left flank—the I Corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook—and forced it to fall back. When more Confederate divisions joined the fray, the Union line made a stubborn stand, counterattacked, but finally fell <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> units routed.|$|E

Despite McGrath not getting nearly as much swing, Hoggard departed for an eight-ball duck, cutting a delivery from Shane Warne to Hayden in the slips. Throwing caution to the wind, Pietersen launched himself into his natural game, taking 21 runs off seven deliveries before finally being out caught by Damien Martyn, a splendid catch just metres off the ropes, as England looked to subside for 130. However, in yet another twist, Simon Jones and Harmison fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> streaky accumulation, pairing up for 33 to reduce Australia's lead to 35 runs. England also got a good start fielding, Pietersen having a flat throw at the stumps to run out Langer for 6, but Hayden and Ricky Ponting rebuilt well.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} 2 {{years of the}} Republic Comín focused on buildup of the local Requeté {{organization}}; in mid-1935 Zaragoza was able to field only 2 companies; a year later the organization expanded by leaps and bounds; the city could have presented one battalion and {{emerged as one of}} the most mobilized Carlist centers in Spain. Amidst standoff during the first few days of the rebellion in Zaragoza Comín travelled twice to Pamplona to secure reinforcements and came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> 1,200 Navarrese requetés. The Carlist militiamen helped to overwhelm pockets of workers' resistance in the city, overran the surrounding province and met the Anarchist column advancing from Barcelona some 22km East of the Aragon capital. As a result, Zaragoza, one of the national anarchist strongholds, remained firmly in Nationalists' hands.|$|E

500|$|Horii {{wanted to}} expand on the {{adventure}} game genre with his own ideas. One such concept was to create [...] "a program in which the story would develop through entering a command and by receiving an answer to it." [...] His idea was for [...] "a game that progresses through conversations between a human and a computer." [...] He [...] "started to get more ambitious," [...] and thought he [...] "could make the computer converse" [...] if enough data is entered, attempting to create an artificial intelligence language algorithm. However, he realized this wasn't possible on computers at the time, so he created [...] "dialogue for the computer beforehand" [...] where the player [...] "could type in some words, and the computer would reply <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> reaction." [...] Another concept was that, in contrast to other [...] "very linear" [...] stories in adventure games at the time, his idea was for branching, non-linear storytelling, where [...] "the main scenario should only take up about 20% of the game’s content, and the remaining 80% should be {{in response to the}} various actions of the player." [...] However, due to PC memory limitations, he was only able to create several short branching scenarios, which he still found more interesting than one long linear scenario. He also conceived of a graphical format, with a picture on-screen representing what's happening and a command menu system to select an action, which later became the standard format for Japanese adventure games.|$|E
2500|$|The {{morning of}} 17 November came with rain and mist {{but not the}} {{expected}} Serbian attack. By 10 in the morning, Alexander ordered three battalions to advance on the right. They surprised the Danube division, who eventually rallied and pushed them back. The main Serbian attack began on the centre largely unsupported by artillery which had insufficient range. The weight of Bulgarian fire forced them <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> 1,200 casualties.

2500|$|The plan {{of attack}} could now be {{characterized}} as one of [...] "single envelopment," [...] with Abercromby's column intended to turn the French left wing by marching along the beach. To this end {{the start of the}} advance had to be delayed until 6.30 AM, when low tide allowed Abercromby to use the beach. The Anglo-Russian centre advanced slowly but steadily, much hindered by the difficult terrain of the dunes on the right and the water-course-ridden plain between the dunes and the Alkmaar canal on the left. The Franco-Batavians fought a steady rear-guard action, falling back on Bergen (the French) and Koedijk (the Batavians), where they made a stand. In the afternoon the British brigade in Essen's column (General Coote) seemed to make a sudden dash in the dunes, but got too far ahead of the remainder of Essen's column, which followed far more slowly, and the French launched a spirited counter-attack from Bergen in two columns under Generals Gouvion and Boudet to exploit the gap. They were driven <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> difficulty, but managed to retain the village of Bergen {{for the remainder of the}} day, despite continued Anglo-Russian attacks.|$|E
