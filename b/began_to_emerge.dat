A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E

5|$|In October 2006, as details {{surrounding}} {{the crash of}} Flight 1907 <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>emerge,</b> the investigation seemed {{to be at least}} partly focused on possible air traffic control errors. This led to increasing resentment by the controllers and exacerbated their already poor labor relations with their military superiors. The controllers complained about being overworked, underpaid, overstressed, and forced to work with outdated equipment. Many have poor English skills, limiting their ability to communicate with foreign pilots, which played a role in crash of Flight 1907. In addition, the military's complete control of the country's aviation was criticized for its lack of public accountability.|$|E
