40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will focus}} on a 2003 survey of Utah and Western U. S. community water rate and service charge structures and some implications that varying rates have on water use and the possibilities for conservation. The survey includes a range of in service area size amongst communities ranging from a large City of Los Angeles system to smaller systems such as Corvallis, Oregon and St. George, Utah. Though each water provider faces unique circumstances that affect the cost of water deliver, this broad sample illustrates current trends in water rate structures and provides implications for water use changes based on alternative rate structures of communities located within western and mostly arid climates. Decreasing and increasing block systems as well as systems with base water allowances {{are included in the}} sample and are analyzed in order to project implications for water conservation capabilities, or lack thereof. A review of the data from the survey suggest a not altogether unknown fact that Utah water suppliers lag behind most water providers in implementing conservation measures either through changing the <b>base</b> <b>allowance</b> or employing conservation pricing. There are also some interesting pseudo marginal cost pricing examples contained in the data set...|$|E
40|$|A 5. 8 mile {{section of}} Dubuque County (Iowa) Road D- 53 was {{selected}} for this project, the objective of which were to: 1. identify a cost effective asphalt emulsion bound macadam typical cross section; 2. determine the effectiveness of engineering fabric placed under macadam roadbeds; and 3. evalaute the use of emulsions in surface seal coats. A number of conclusions were reached: 1. The minus # 200 sieve material for the macadam stone should be held to a minimum. For the emulsion used on this project, the minus # 200 material had less than 4 percent to achieve satisfactory coating of the macadam stone. 2. The placement of the emulsion treated macadam required no additional equipment or time than the plain macadam placement. 3. Emulsion treating the macadam stone for the shoulder base appears unnecessary. 4. The emulsion treated macadam base beneath an asphaltic concrete wearing surface yielded a higher structural rating than the plain macadam beneath a comparable ashaltic concrete surface. 5. The performance of the fabric between the subgrade and the macadam base to prevent soil intrusion into the base could not {{be determined by the}} non-destructive testing conducted. 6. When no choke stone is used over the macadam <b>base,</b> <b>allowance</b> for ac mix overrun should be made. 7. Use of an emulsion instead of a cutback asphalt saved money and energy. However, the poor performance of the seal coat negated any real savings...|$|E

Similarity {{between two}} image sequences e. g. shots, {{is determined by}} selection and comparison of representative images from the sequences, where the images lies outside of transitions. The sequences are selected such that the selected images are spaced from each other. A film grammar and probability <b>based</b> <b>allowance</b> {{of all types of}} transitions are provided with respect to separation and/or connectivity action on the sequences surrounding the transitions. USE - Method for temporal segmentation of videos e. g. fictional, narrative videos e. g. motion picture, sitcom and animated film, and non-fictional videos such as news, documentary film, educational film, sports program and music program, into scenes. ADVANTAGE - The image sequence boundaries are recognized as the scene boundaries, thus facilitating proper combination of the image sequences. The film grammar and the probability <b>based</b> <b>allowance</b> of all types of transitions are provided with respect to separation and/or connectivity action on the sequences surrounding the transitions, thus optimally reducing failure rate in recognition of the image sequence boundaries, and hence improving accuracy and robustness of automatic segmentation of the videos into scenes. The method considers differently weighted applications of effects of the transitions in collation of the image sequences into the scenes...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedOver {{the years in}} an attempt to create cost savings, the Navy has changed its ways of determining parts allowances. Originally, the Navy used Demand <b>Based</b> <b>Allowancing,</b> in which parts <b>allowances</b> were assigned <b>based</b> upon Original Equipment Manufacturer recommendations, and fleet demand. In the late 1980 's, the Navy changed its parts <b>allowancing</b> to Readiness <b>Based</b> Sparing. During this same time, the parts managers at the Navy Inventory Control Points (ICPs) have received reduced funding for parts support. As a result, parts have been transferred from one deploying unit to the next deploying unit. This thesis studied the possibility of using incentive contract types {{in an attempt to}} ensure the allowances provided to the fleet are accurate and meaningful. Additionally, the use of an incentive-type contract can be used to ensure the parts required to fill the assigned allowances are available to the fleet at Material Support Date (MSD). This study conducted a comparative analysis of past (post MSD) and present (at MSD) weapon systems to identify costs and benefits {{associated with the use of}} incentive-type contracts. Lastly, this study identified a system that has not reached MSD (future) which could possibly benefit from an incentive-type contract[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

30|$|In Chinese societies, teacher {{compensation}} {{consists of}} four components - <b>base</b> salary, <b>allowance,</b> bonus (incentives), and deferred compensation (including cash benefits and non-cash compensation) (Li et al. [2013]). Base salary is often calculated by the qualification, ranking, service, and contribution. Allowances are monetary subsidies for additional expenses teachers may incur in their jobs and daily lives, including transportation, education of employee offspring, and general living expenses. Bonus (incentives) is additional reward given to teachers who excel in their performance, often taking the form of money or of gifts to motivate them to perform well in their jobs. Finally, cash-based benefits include the protections and perks given to teachers such as research and wedding fees, whereas non-cash compensation {{comes in the form}} of retirement pay (Li et al.

30|$|In this study, we {{reviewed}} the public (non-profit) kindergarten teacher compensation systems across four featured {{cities in the}} following three ways. First, we compared the existing compensation systems to identify the most comprehensive and inclusive structure, checking whether these systems include <b>base</b> salary, <b>allowance,</b> incentives, and cash-based benefits. Second, we used a common currency (U.S. dollars) to compare the actual salaries of early childhood teachers to understand which city provides the best pay for early childhood teachers. Third, we calculated the real purchasing power of teacher monthly income using both the BMI (The Economist [2013]) {{as well as the}} HPI (Li et al. [2013]). Through these comparisons, both across the featured cities as well as in relation to the two indices, we aim to provide an introductory as well as preliminary examination into the compensation of Chinese early childhood teachers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn our work, {{we tried}} to {{determine}} the asset value of water from natural resources. During the research we decided that a method <b>based</b> on <b>allowance</b> capitalization {{can be the most}} effective. Thus, the developed method is able to estimate water property value in a nationally uniformed system by utilizing final products. It has been decided that the determined method of Water Allowance Coefficient (WAC) is based on water footprint results of domestic wheat production. Water footprint was chosen because it is able to refer to water availability by also considering both direct and indirect usage of water. It covers absolute volume of our freshwater needs, which also can be determined as the availability potential of freshwater resources. Methodological statement, because changes in AWVs (Adjusted Water Value) vary among regions, the distances of regional values would disappear by ranking. To eliminate this, the WAC values were directly used...|$|R
40|$|The {{extremely}} asymmetrical scattering (EAS) of {{bulk and}} guided electromagnetic waves in nonuniform periodic Bragg arrays with steplike {{variations of the}} grating amplitude is analyzed theoretically {{by means of a}} recently developed approach <b>based</b> on <b>allowance</b> for the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave. Arrays of finite and infinite widths are investigated. It is shown that, for thin non-uniform arrays, EAS has the same pattern as for uniform arrays with mean grating amplitude. On the contrary, for wide nonuniform arrays, the scattered wave amplitudes are well determined by local values of the grating amplitude. In this case, the energy of the scattered wave is shown to concentrate mainly in regions with smaller grating amplitude. The sensitivity of EAS to small imperfections of periodic arrays is investigated theoretically. The physical explanation of the observed effects is based on the diffractional divergence of the scattered wave...|$|R
