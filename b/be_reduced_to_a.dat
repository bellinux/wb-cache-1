5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract solar systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not possible, as well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small shrub.|$|E

5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss {{had planned to}} operate with a ten-minute headway until August, but had a 15-minute headway until 16 August. To compensate, none of the parallel bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, {{the first part of}} the line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E

25|$|A Y-Δ transform, an {{operation}} that replaces a degree-three vertex in a graph by a triangle connecting its neighbors, is sufficient (together with the removal of parallel edges) to reduce any Apollonian network to a single triangle, and more generally the planar graphs that can <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single edge by Y-Δ transforms, removal of parallel edges, removal of degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices are exactly the planar partial 3-trees. The dual graphs of the planar partial 3-trees form another minor-closed graph family and are exactly the planar graphs that can <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single edge by Δ-Y transforms, removal of parallel edges, removal of degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices.|$|E

25|$|This {{follows from}} the {{classical}} theorem {{that there is only}} one Archimedean complete ordered field, along with the fact that all the axioms of an Archimedean complete ordered field are expressible in second-order logic. This shows that the second-order theory of the real numbers cannot <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> first-order theory, in the sense that the second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model but the corresponding first-order theory has many models.|$|E
25|$|Economist Benjamin Klein {{has criticized}} the {{economic}} methodological work of Austrian economist Israel M. Kirzner.

Economist Tyler Cowen has written that Kirzner's theory of entrepreneurship can ultimately <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> neoclassical search model and is thus not in the radical subjectivist tradition of Austrian praxeology. Cowen states that Kirzner's entrepreneurs can be modeled in mainstream terms of search.|$|E

25|$|A {{reducible}} configuration is {{an arrangement}} of countries that cannot occur in a minimal counterexample. If a map contains a reducible configuration, then the map can <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> smaller map. This smaller map has the condition that {{if it can be}} colored with four colors, then the original map can also. This implies that if the original map cannot be colored with four colors the smaller map can't either and so the original map is not minimal.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sufficient}} to prove the theorem when the conic is a circle, because any (non-degenerate) conic can <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> circle by a projective transformation. This was realised by Pascal, whose first lemma states the theorem for a circle. His second lemma states that what is true in one plane remains true upon projection to another plane. Degenerate conics follow by continuity (the theorem is true for non-degenerate conics, and thus holds {{in the limit of}} degenerate conic).|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} {{descriptions of}} diffraction {{are those in}} which the situation can <b>be</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of}} the water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E
