Cowdrey (79) added 99 with Hutton looking certain for a century before he smashed the ball into Alan Davidson's <b>back,</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> lobbed up for an easy, if painful, catch. Colin Cowdrey and Denis Compton (44) took the score to 230/3 {{by the end of}} the day and England were {{confident}} of a first innings lead, but they both fell early next morning and though the lower middle order all got going the tail collapsed again and the last four wickets fell for 20 runs and the last seven wickets for 111. Still 341 was England's highest score so far in the series and gave them a slim 18 run lead, the leg-spinner Richie Benaud (4/120) doing most of the work.|$|E

Under her Cheerleader gimmick, she beat Nikki Roxx and later {{appeared}} as Raisha Saeed also winning against Ariel.

Adding to his guilt is when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are upset as well, telling Bart that they would attack the culprit {{critically}} as they did not actually mean what they said about the statue before. Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would face if his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular {{was the most important thing}} in the world that Homer told him. It was then Homer realized that he inspired Bart of his popularity advice that caused him to commit the crime in the first place, and feels extremely guilty of doing so.

500|$|In ancient Greece, long male {{hair was}} a symbol of wealth and power, while a shaven head was {{appropriate}} for a slave. The ancient Greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long, including Zeus, Achilles, Apollo, and Poseidon. Greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle. Such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off. [...] Also, in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle, they were known to cut the front short, but leave it long in the <b>back,</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> was more out of reach. A widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long, and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies' reach. The ponytail method allowed warriors, who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches, to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife to cut the back to length with one simple slice. Around the sixth century, however, the Greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles, {{with the exception of the}} Spartans. Women in the culture remained with the longer style, which for them showed freedom, health, and wealth, as well as good behavior. In men, it was considered a sign of false pride by this time.|$|E
