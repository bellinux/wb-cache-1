60|$|One {{chilling}} day in November, when an icy {{rain was}} {{falling on the}} black mud of the streets, Virginia looked out of the window. Her eye was caught by two horses which were just skeletons with the skin stretched over them. One had a bad sore on his flank, and was lame. They were pulling a rattle-trap farm wagon with a <b>buckled</b> <b>wheel.</b> On the seat a man, pallid and bent and scantily clad, was holding the reins in his feeble hands, while beside him cowered a child of ten wrapped in a ragged blanket. In {{the body of the}} wagon, lying on a mattress pressed down in the midst of broken, cheap furniture and filthy kitchen ware, lay a gaunt woman in the rain. Her eyes were closed, and a hump {{on the surface of the}} dirty quilt beside her showed that a child must be there. From such a picture the girl fled in tears. But the sight of it, and of others like it, haunted her for weeks. Through those last dreary days of November, wretched families, which a year since had been in health and prosperity, came to the city, beggars, with the wrecks of their homes. The history of that hideous pilgrimage across a state has never been written. Still they came by the hundred, those families. Some brought little corpses to be buried. The father of one, hale and strong when they started, died of pneumonia in the public lodging-house. The walls of that house could tell many tales to wring the heart. So could Mr. Brinsmade, did he choose to speak of his own charities. He found time, between his labors at the big hospital newly founded, and his correspondence, and his journeys of love,--between early morning and midnight,--to give some hours a day to the refugees.|$|E

5000|$|Jip concludes his {{narration}} {{by saying}} [...] "We're all fucked {{up in our}} own way, y'know, but we're all doing it together. We're freestylin' on the <b>buckle</b> <b>wheel</b> of life, trapped {{in a world of}} internal dialogue. Like Bill Hicks said: 'It's an insane world, but I'm proud to be part of it.'" ...|$|R
25|$|German cyclist Marcus Burghardt {{collided}} with a Labrador Retriever during Stage 9. The bike struck the dog on its backside, which <b>buckled</b> the front <b>wheel</b> and threw Burghardt over the handlebars onto the road. Remarkably the dog was unhurt by the collision, and it was grabbed by a spectator before it could cause any more damage.|$|R
50|$|A {{rotating}} system of mass is in dynamic balance when the rotation {{does not produce}} any resultant centrifugal force or couple. The system rotates without requiring the application of any external force or couple, other than that required to support its weight. If a system is initially unbalanced, to avoid the stress upon the bearings caused by the centrifugal couple, counterbalancing weights must be added.This is seen when a bicycle <b>wheel</b> gets <b>buckled.</b> The <b>wheel</b> will not rotate itself when stationary due to gravity as it is still statically balanced, but will not rotate smoothly as the centre of mass is {{to the side of}} the centre bearing. The spokes on a bike wheel need to be tuned in order to stop this and keep the wheel operating as efficiently as possible.|$|R
50|$|From Châteaudun, {{the route}} headed south-easterly towards Orléans. Along this section, at Saint-Jean-de-la-Ruelle, Charron hit a gutter that {{ran across the}} road whilst {{travelling}} at speeds in excess of 50 mph, bending the back axle of his Panhard. Spectators warned the cars that followed of the hazard, by holding a green flag 30 yards in advance to give the cars time to slow down before reaching the danger. Winton became the first driver to retire from the race, stopping at Orleans with a <b>buckled</b> <b>wheel.</b> The race order at Orléans, 173 km from the start, was Giradot leading by 17 minutes from Charron, with de Knyff third and a further 39 minutes behind, and Jenatzy fourth and three minutes further back.|$|E
60|$|In {{the end he}} {{got three}} in succession, {{but none of them}} turned out well. The first strayed off into the infinite, heeding no appeals; the second was killed in the night by a fruit motor-waggon which fled before Grubb could get down; the third got itself {{entangled}} in the front wheel of a passing cyclist, who came through the plate glass, and proved to be an actor out of work and an undischarged bankrupt. He demanded compensation for some fancied injury, would hear nothing of the valuable dog he had killed or the window he had broken, obliged Grubb by sheer physical obduracy to straighten his <b>buckled</b> front <b>wheel,</b> and pestered the struggling firm with a series of inhumanly worded solicitor's letters. Grubb answered them--stingingly, and put himself, Bert thought, in the wrong.|$|R
5000|$|... "Mr Baird {{was seated}} in the machine and on the engine being started the plane {{travelled}} along the sands at good speed. Naturally, on clearing the ground, the swerving influence of the axle ceased {{and the influence of}} the steering wheel brought the machine sharply round to the right causing it to swoop to the ground. The contact was so sharp that the right <b>wheel</b> <b>buckled</b> and the right plane suffered some abrasion by scraping along the beach." ...|$|R
5000|$|St. Baruc’s well {{can also}} be found 300 yard south of the chapel, this well was used as a wishing well [...] It was {{believed}} if a votive offering was dropped into this well and a wish or prayer was privately expressed and the wisher did not speak to anyone till after a stranger spoke to them then what they wished would come true. On September 1895 the well was cleaned out and numerous offerings were found, offerings that were found included: bent pins, a brass <b>buckle,</b> a <b>wheel</b> of a small clock, and a number of bits of rags, tape and string. The normal offering was pins that were either bent or straight. To the south and east of the chapel an extensive grave was found, trenches cut across in different places gave indications that several thousand bodies had been at one time or other buried there. This large number of bodies in an island that certainly never contained more than two inhabited houses, seems to point out that Barry Island, had somewhat the reputation of a holy island, and that bodies had, therefore, been brought from elsewhere for interment here.|$|R
5000|$|Roland Stobbart {{was born}} at Aspatria, Cumberland, England in 1909; the eldest of two sons to an haulage contractor. Even before he reached {{maturity}} one Cumberland newspaper was describing him as, [...] "probably the finest racing motorcyclist in Cumberland. A clever, daring rider who does not {{know the meaning of}} the word fear." [...] He was at that time attached to the Workington Motor Cycling Club. By the age of twenty he had met with considerable success on Dirt tracks and Grasstracks throughout the north of England and had successfully taken part in sand races in Scotland. When they introduced grass track racing at Whitehaven he became the principal prize-winner. In 1930 he entered the senior Manx Grand Prix on the Isle of Man, formerly known as the Manx Amateur Motorcycle Road Race. Although he <b>buckled</b> his front <b>wheel</b> half-a-mile from the start he continued the race and the distance of over 200 miles with a soft tyre and a badly bent wheel. His average speed was 64.7 miles per hour, and he did the fastest lap at 68 miles per hour. Stobbart entered the race in the following two years but despite doing good times in the practice laps he failed to complete either of the races. In 1932 he retired after the first lap when he suffered a puncture.|$|R
