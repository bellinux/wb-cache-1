5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal {{beds in the}} watershed include the Lower Red Ash <b>bed,</b> <b>the</b> Upper Red Ash <b>bed,</b> <b>the</b> Lower Ross <b>bed,</b> <b>the</b> Upper Ross bed, and the Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|New {{collections}} at the Induan/Olenekian boundary GSSP {{candidate at}} Mud (Himachal Pradesh, Northern India) {{lead to the}} recognition of several well preserved ammonoid faunas that significantly improve the biostratigraphic resolution in <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> underlying <b>the</b> proposed GSSP level.

Seen from an evolutionary point of view, the Dienerian/Smithian boundary can therefore be placed just below Bed 10. Ideally, the stage boundary should also be intercalibrated with other biological, chemical or physical proxies as additional tools for world-wide correlations. Four new species (Flemingites bhargavai, Kingites korni, ?Kingites parkashi and Xenodiscoides variocostatus) and two new genera (Mudiceras, Vercherites) are described...|$|R

However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
5|$|Brooke {{does not}} marry Noel, but rather spends {{a brief period}} in Munich where he tries to become {{intimate}} with a Belgian girl in order to lose his heterosexual virginity. This relationship also fails, and he returns to England confused about his sexuality. He and Nell continue to remain close until he goes on a vacation with his friends, where he again proposes to another of his friends. Brooke is refused resulting in a psychological breakdown and an extended absence from Grantchester while he is treated by a London doctor. After a few more months, Brooke returns to the Old Vicarage briefly before departing {{on a trip to}} Tahiti via Canada and the United States.

The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, {{again at}} the {{invitation}} of the Prince of Wales, he joined HMS Serapis, which conducted the Prince on an official tour of India, 1875–76. Louis sketched some of the events of the tour and his drawings were published in the Illustrated London News. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 May 1876. The Prince asked Louis to stay with him at Marlborough House for the summer of 1876, but wishing to gain further experience at sea, Louis instead accepted an offer to join Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as a lieutenant on board HMS Sultan. In addition to acting as the Duke's equerry, Louis continued his naval duties. He did not enjoy the position, as the Duke was rather touchy and Louis's cabin was infested with rats, one of which he caught with his bare hands as it ran across his chest as he lay in <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> Sultan toured the Mediterranean from July 1876.|$|E
5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of <b>bed,</b> <b>the</b> sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E

30|$|In {{the field}} of combustion, the air flow rate plays a number of {{important}} roles; primarily providing a cushion of air which <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> will sit upon as well as mixing <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> material. This high mixing is the key factor in achieving a uniform combustion temperature {{as well as in the}} oxidation of combustion materials. In practice, the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials in <b>the</b> combustor is almost controlled and limited by the pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> hydrodynamic properties such as <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> pressure drop and minimum fluidization velocity are the most important parameters studied in the numerical modelling of fluidized beds. To achieve and maintain a stable fluidization, knowledge about the pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and minimum fluidization velocity of the gas flow introduced from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> are required. Therefore the minimum fluidization air velocity to fluidize the sand particles and pressure drop are crucial hydrodynamic parameters for analysing the operation and design of fluidized <b>bed</b> combustors. <b>The</b> minimum fluidization velocity was determined experimentally by measuring the pressure drop through <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of particles. <b>The</b> pressure drop is defined as the difference of absolute pressure under <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to that of the area above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> which is called the freeboard [16, 17].|$|R

5|$|The {{education}} of Pedro II began {{while he was}} still heir to throne, and he learned to read and write in Portuguese at age five.

Pedro II passed the entire day studying with only two hours reserved for amusements. He would wake up at 6.30a.m. and begin studies at seven, continuing until 10p.m., after which he would go to <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> disciplines were diverse, including everything from languages, history, philosophy, astronomy, physics, geography and music, to hunting, equestrianism and fencing.|$|E
