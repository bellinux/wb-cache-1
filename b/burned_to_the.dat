5|$|A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its {{assault in}} 161 AD, {{defeating}} two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD {{to counter the}} resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Fairbanks' two-story school, {{built in}} 1907, <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. A new, $150,000 three-story {{concrete}} art deco building was proposed as a replacement, and after heated debate, a $100,000 bond measure was approved in 1933. On January 22, 1934, {{the new school}} opened. It had space for about 500 students, but the town's growth required renovation and expansion in 1939 and 1948.|$|E

In 1870 the trustees of the local Second Baptist Church of Raleigh sued Tupper on charges of defrauding its members in relation to his fundraising for Shaw College. The suit was settled in his favor in 1875.|$|E
5|$|At its 1902 opening, the Briarcliff Lodge was {{a premier}} resort hotel. The Tudor Revival-style {{building}} {{was surrounded by}} dairy barns and greenhouses (built by Law), and hosted numerous distinguished guests, including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. The hotel declined during the 1930s but the lodge remained in use, housing the Edgewood Park School (1936–1954) and The King's College (1955–1994). The original 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground on September 20, 2003, and contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E

5|$|Himeji {{was heavily}} bombed in 1945, {{at the end}} of World War II, and {{although}} most of the surrounding area was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, the castle survived intact. One firebomb was dropped {{on the top floor of}} the castle but failed to explode. In order to preserve the castle complex, substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956, with a labor expenditure of 250,000 man-days and a cost of 550 million yen. In January 1995, the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake, but Himeji Castle again survived virtually undamaged, demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance. Even the bottle of sake placed on the altar at the top floor of the keep remained in place.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Big Butte Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans {{inhabited}} the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, all the women and children were captured, and the camp was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers first arrived in the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Little Butte Creek.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Whitehall, to {{the east}} of the road, was {{originally}} named York Palace, but was renamed during the reign of Henry VIII. The palace was redesigned in 1531–32 and became the King's main residence later in the decade. He married Anne Boleyn here in 1533, followed by Jane Seymour in 1536, and died at the palace in 1547. Charles I owned an extensive art collection at the palace and several of William Shakespeare's plays had their first performances here. It ceased to be a royal residence after 1689, when William III moved to Kensington Palace. The palace was damaged by fire in 1691, following which the front entrance was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1698, most of the palace <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground accidentally after a fire started by a careless washerwoman.|$|E

5|$|The bishopric of Aarhus {{dates back}} to at least 948 when Adam of Bremen {{reported}} the bishop Reginbrand attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany. The bishopric and the town's geographical location propelled prosperous growth {{and development of the}} early medieval town. The finding of six runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000, as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them. The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city, such as Harald Hardrada's assault around 1050, when the Holy Trinity Church was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
5|$|Within {{hours of}} the results, {{paramilitary}} groups had begun attacking people and setting fires around the capital Dili.

Islamic gangs attacked Dili's Catholic Diocese building, killing two dozen people; the next day, the headquarters of the ICRC was attacked and <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. Almost one hundred people were killed later in Suai, and reports of similar massacres poured in from around East Timor. The UN withdrew most of its personnel, but the Dili compound had been flooded with refugees.|$|E
5|$|At age {{seventeen}} he apprentices as {{a blacksmith}} and learns to fight, {{and it is}} during his period his mother dies. He then moved to the city-state of Wide where he insinuates himself with the ruler and overthrows him. Five years later, Gustaves father dies, and {{at the behest of}} his best friend Kelvin decides to claim the throne. A war then breaks out between Gustave XIII and his half-brother in which Gustave conquers Finney and becomes the ruler of all the surrounding kingdoms except Na. This one holdout is controlled by Phillip, Gustave's brother, who blames Gustave for their mother's death. During the subsequent conflict, Gustave admits he lacks magical powers, and abdicates in favor of Phillip. Gustave then build a city of his own called Hahn Nova, but it is overrun by monsters and <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. The fate of Gustave and his friends is left a mystery.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Laser {{photocoagulation}} is {{a standard}} interventional tool in vitreoretinal surgery. Commonly applied treatments such as grid photocoagulation and panretinal photocoagulation involve the application of hundreds of dotlike laser <b>burns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> retina. In order <b>to</b> enhance <b>the</b> accuracy and reduce the tedium of this procedure, we are developing a robot-assisted technique for retinal laser photocoagulation that includes software for planning patterns of laser burns on a retinal image and uses an active handheld micromanipulator known as Micron in order <b>to</b> apply <b>the</b> pattern of <b>burns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> retina. The paper describes the system and presents preliminary results. In a sample 7 x 7 pattern of lesions applied to an artificial surface, the system demonstrated a mean position error of 43 ± 23 μm.

5|$|The {{discovery}} of 11 Bronze Age cist burials which date from 2500 BC and 500 BC {{suggests that this}} is the most ancient funerary site in the area. What probably made this location ideal was its natural terraces stretching away from the sand bay, and the close proximity of <b>the</b> East <b>Burn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and <b>the</b> West (Tiel) <b>Burn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. Four Bronze Age burials dating from around 4000 BC have also been found around the site of the unmarked Bogely or Dysart Standing Stone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the present A92 road. Although there are few Roman sites in Fife, a Roman camp was known to exist at Carberry Farm on the town's outskirts.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to describe a case of an electric <b>burn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genitalia causing scrotal and testicular lesion, and the subsequent reconstruction using a skin graft. The patient was a 10 -year-old boy who was victim of an electric burn that harmed the genitalia. There was extended skin loss, penile, scrotal and partial testicular lesion. The treatment consisted of plastic surgery <b>to</b> reconstruct <b>the</b> genitalia with skin flaps grafted on the left thigh, the scrotum and the base of the penis. The patient recovered well and was discharged after two weeks. We concluded that in severe cases of electric <b>burns</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genitalia, skin graft offer a good therapeutic option...|$|R
5|$|Before other British {{outposts}} {{had learned}} about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts {{in a series of}} attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was Fort Sandusky, a small blockhouse on the shore of Lake Erie. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local Wyandots, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed {{in the early stages of}} the war. The dead were ritually scalped and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
5|$|During the {{remainder}} of the day, the Italians collected the bodies of their dead from the rebel ambush on 28 June, and rescued some Home Guard troops that had escaped Avtovac, but then returned to Plana, just north of Bileća. The value of further operations in the Gacko and Avtovac areas was brought into question when the Italians reported that both towns had been <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, and all the inhabitants had been massacred. The Italians blamed Montenegrins attached to the rebels for the destruction and killings in the two towns. The Italian estimate of rebel strength was around 3,000 armed with machine guns, artillery and anti-aircraft guns. A German intelligence officer from Sarajevo arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to receive a briefing on the situation. The small garrison of Gacko was anticipating an attack by rebels during the night, but in the afternoon 180 Home Guardsmen that had withdrawn from Avtovac arrived to bolster their position, and the night passed without incident.|$|E
