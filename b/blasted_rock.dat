25|$|On November18, 1931, {{construction}} was accelerated between Madoc and Perth {{as a major}} depression-relief project when eight contracts were set to build the new route. Over 2700 men <b>blasted</b> <b>rock,</b> dredged muskeg and endured a constant barrage of blood-sucking insects in order to construct this new link. The majority of it followed along a Canadian Pacific right-of-way (now abandoned past the town of Havelock) which had been cleared in 1881, deviating at times to provide a better alignment, avoid large muskeg or to lessen excavation work, most of which was performed by hand.|$|E

Planning of the tunnel was completed at the end of 2008. The tender for construction was completed in March 2009, and won by Mika. The construction will extract [...] of <b>blasted</b> <b>rock,</b> that is transported out of the tunnel. The last blast was detonated on 12 August 2010, completing the tunneling proper on time and on budget without injuries. The first revenue train ran through the tunnel on 15 August 2011. But because schedules only change twice a year, the time saving cannot be incorporated until 2012. Further plans include building a second track at Trondheim Airport Station. Due to the capacity increase created by the tunnel, this will allow dedicated airport trains to operate from Trondheim.|$|E

60|$|In vain, {{both going}} and coming, by sunlight, and again by moonlight, when the cane-fields gleamed white below and the hills were pitch- black above, did {{we try to}} catch a sight of this crater-peak. One fact alone we ascertained, that like all, as far as I have seen, of the West Indian volcanoes, it does not {{terminate}} in an ash-cone, but in ragged cliffs of <b>blasted</b> <b>rock.</b> The explosion of April 27, 1812, must have been too violent, and too short, to allow of any accumulation round the crater. And no wonder; for that single explosion relieved an interior pressure upon the crust of the earth, which had agitated sea and land from the Azores to the West Indian islands, the coasts of Venezuela, the Cordillera of New Grenada, and the valleys of the Mississippi and Ohio. For nearly two years the earthquakes had continued, when they culminated in one great tragedy, which should be read at length {{in the pages of}} Humboldt. {43b} On March 26, 1812, when the people of Caraccas were assembled in the churches, beneath a still and blazing sky, one minute of earthquake sufficed to bury, amid the ruins of churches and houses, nearly 10,000 souls. The same earthquake wrought terrible destruction along the whole line of the northern Cordilleras, and was felt even at Santa Fe de Bogota, and Honda, 180 leagues from Caraccas. But the end was not yet. While the wretched survivors of Caraccas were dying of fever and starvation, and wandering inland to escape from ever-renewed earthquake shocks, among villages and farms, which, ruined like their own city, could give them no shelter, the almost forgotten volcano of St. Vincent was muttering in suppressed wrath. It had thrown out no lava since 1718; if, at least, the eruption spoken of by Moreau de Jonnes took place in the Souffriere. According to him, with a terrific earthquake, clouds of ashes were driven into the air with violent detonations from a mountain situated at the eastern end of the island. When the eruption had ceased, {{it was found that the}} whole mountain had disappeared. Now there is no eastern end to St. Vincent, nor any mountain on the east coast: and the Souffriere is at the northern end. It is impossible, meanwhile, that the wreck of such a mountain should not have left traces visible and notorious to this day. May not the truth be, that the Souffriere had once a lofty cone, which was blasted away in 1718, leaving the present crater-ring of cliffs and peaks; and that thus may be explained the discrepancies in the accounts of its height, which Mr. Scrope gives as 4940 feet, and Humboldt and Dr. Davy at 3000, a measurement which seems to me to be more probably correct? The mountain is said to have been slightly active in 1785. In 1812 its old crater had been for some years (and is now) a deep blue lake, with walls of rock around 800 feet in height, reminding one traveller of the Lake of Albano. {44} But for twelve months it had given warning, by frequent earthquake shocks, that it had its part to play in the great subterranean battle between rock and steam; and on the 27th of April 1812 the battle began.|$|E

50|$|Long hole stoping as {{the name}} {{suggests}} uses holes drilled by a production drill to a predetermined pattern as designed by a Mining Engineer. Long hole stoping is a highly selective and productive method of mining and can cater for varying ore thicknesses and dips (0 - 90 degree). It differs from manual methods such as timbered and shrinkage as once the stope has begun blasting phase it cannot be accessed by personnel. For this reason the <b>blasted</b> <b>rock</b> is designed to fall into a supported drawpoint or removed with remote control LHD (load, haul, dump machine).|$|E
50|$|Initial {{construction}} {{started in}} 1892, {{focused on the}} north mole and blasting the rock bar across the river mouth. Because of its proximity to Fremantle blasting was slow. Construction of the south mole commenced in August 1894 using rock from Arthur Head and Rocky Bay. It was not until late 1896 that dredging of the <b>blasted</b> <b>rock</b> harbour began; spoil from the dredging work was used to fill the embankment for Victoria Quay. With the gold rush putting pressure on Fremantle harbour, a temporary wharf 91 metres in length {{was added to the}} south mole as well as a temporary 304-metre wharf on the north mole.|$|E
50|$|Shrinkage stoping, is most {{suitable}} for steeply dipping ore bodies (70°—90°). In shrinkage stoping, mining proceeds from the bottom upwards, in horizontal slices (similar to cut and fill mining), with the broken ore being left in place for miners to work from. Because <b>blasted</b> <b>rock</b> takes up a greater volume than in situ rock (due to swell factor), some of the blasted ore (approximately 40%) must be removed to provide working space for the next ore slice. Once {{the top of the}} stope is reached all the ore is removed from the stope. The stope may be backfilled or left empty, depending on the rock conditions.|$|E

40|$|Rock {{fragmentation}} {{can occur}} by crushing, relative radial motion, release of load, spalling, gas extension of strain wave-induced and pre-existing fractures, shear and in-flight collisions. The {{relative importance of}} each mechanism, as yet undefined, depends upon explosive properties, rock properties, blast geometry and initiation sequence. The effect of explosive energy and presence of natural fractures on fragmentation are studied. Design of blasts in a copper porphyry ore body were altered to give powder factors between 0. 26 and 0. 71 kg/m³ in three different types of rock. The rock units in the ore body for this study are classified according to the size distribution of the blocks formed by natural fractures and discontinuities. Block size distribution curves are produced from the core logs and the ore body is divided into six rock classes. Arbitrarily, a representative size distribution curve is assigned to each class. These curves are {{used to determine the}} specific surface area (surface area per unit volume of rock) for each rock class. The specific surface area of <b>blasted</b> <b>rock</b> was measured by photo-analysis and correlated closely with the explosive energy and rock type. The explosive energy is calculated in terms of total energy per unit volume of <b>blasted</b> <b>rock,</b> from the powder factor. The results clearly show the effect of natural block sizes on fragmentation. It is shown that most of useful explosive energy goes into opening the pre-existing fractures. Almost the entire product size is controlled by the natural fractures at energy levels below 2 MJ/m³ (powder factor of 0. 5 kg/m³). At higher energy levels of 2. 85 MJ/m³ (powder factor of 0. 71 kg/m³) about 70 to 80 percent of the surface area of the <b>blasted</b> <b>rock</b> is controlled by the pre-existing fractures. The <b>blasted</b> <b>rock</b> is also analyzed using the scale invariant methods {{as an alternative to the}} conventional size distribution analysis. The fractal dimension of each blast at different energy level and rock class is determined. The variations of fractal dimensions depends on the energy levels and the rock conditions. At higher energy levels higher fractal dimensions are obtained and more fractured rock showed higher fractal dimension at the same energy level. The fractal concept can be a useful tool to describe rock masses and fragmenting behavior of different rocks...|$|E
