25|$|Although cheek kissing is not {{as widely}} practiced in the United Kingdom or Ireland as {{in other parts of}} Europe, it is still commonplace. Generally, a kiss on one cheek is commonplace, however a kiss on each cheek is also practiced by some {{dependant}} on relation or reason. It is mostly used as a greeting and/or a farewell, but can also be offered as a congratulation or as a general declaration of friendship or love. Cheek kissing is acceptable <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>children,</b> family members (though not often two adult males), couples, two female friends or a male friend and a female friend. Cheek kissing between two men who are not a couple is unusual but socially acceptable if both men are happy to take part. Cheek kissing is associated with the middle and upper classes, as they are more influenced by French culture. This behaviour was traditionally seen as a French practice.|$|E

40|$|Child maltreatment is a {{critical}} public health problem with risk factors that directly hinder the quality of interactions <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child.</b> These interactions, guided {{by the quality of}} parenting behaviors, form the foundation through which a child develops physically, psychologically, and emotionally. This study examined the quality of 12 parenting behaviors during interactive play <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> their association to the potential of child maltreatment with the interactive effect of demographic variables. It was hypothesized that poor interactive <b>parenting</b> behaviors <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> would be associated with higher maltreatment potential. Participants were 99 high-risk families drawn from the first cohort of an ongoing cluster randomized research trial. The 12 <b>parenting</b> behaviors <b>and</b> their interaction with family demographic characteristics were not predictive of the potential for child maltreatment among participant families. Although, the proposed hypothesis was not supported, the findings suggest the need for further investigation of other familial factors influencing maltreatment potential among participant families...|$|R
60|$|Of course, {{parents can}} reply that their love, however intense, is pure, and has {{absolutely}} no sensual element. Maybe--and maybe not. But admit that it is so. It does not help. The intense excitement of the upper centers of sympathy willy-nilly arouses the lower centers. It arouses them to activity, even if it denies them any expression or any polarized connection. Our psyche is so framed that activity aroused on one plane provokes activity on the corresponding plane, automatically. So the intense pure love-relation <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> inevitably arouses the lower centers in the child, the centers of sex. Now the deeper sensual centers, once aroused, should find response from the sensual body of some other, some friend or lover. The response is impossible <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child.</b> Myself, I believe that biologically there is radical sex-aversion <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child,</b> at the deeper sensual centers. The sensual circuit cannot adjust itself spontaneously between the two.|$|R
25|$|All human {{societies}} organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities {{and expectations of}} solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship {{is the ability to}} form descent groups, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as clans. Another function {{is the way in which}} kinship unites families through marriage, forming kinship alliances between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited—such rules vary widely between cultures. Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either cross or parallel cousins. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of kinship terminology in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity (nurture kinship).|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect of}} cultural capital that sometimes {{comes into play}} in immigrant families is familiarity with American laws. Parents may find that U.S. law is in conflict with their traditional means of disciplining their children. While parents may be accustomed to certain parental rights in their home country, these rights may not be protected in American society. There may be cases in which outside agents—either school officials, police officers, or government officials—become involved in conflicts <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> This is particularly true in cases of alleged physical abuse. Children, who may be more familiar with American laws, can use this knowledge to gain assistance from individuals outside of the family. The involvement of outside agents may tip the traditional power balance within the family and affords family members who are {{more familiar with the}} rules and norms of the United States a certain degree of power over family members who are not as familiar with these laws. Among immigrants who come from cultures with strict hierarchies based on age, such interventions can be devastating to parents who may feel that their authority has been undermined. Family members who are better assimilated into American culture are more able, and probably more likely, to utilize their knowledge of American laws to change the dynamics of family relations. This generates inequality based on degree of assimilation since those who are less assimilated are more likely to lose face {{as the result of the}} penetration of such laws into the traditionally private domain of the family.|$|E

50|$|Conversely, high SES {{individuals}} occupy {{high power}} positions {{that call for}} greater expressivity. High SES parents encourage their children to question the world around them. In addition to asking their children more questions, these parents push their children to create questions of their own. In contrast with low SES parents, these individuals often view the power disparity <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> as detrimental to the family. Opting instead to treat children as equals, high SES conversations are characterized by a give <b>and</b> take <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child.</b> These interactions help prepare these children for occupations that require greater expressivity.|$|R

500|$|Hoping {{to divert}} {{herself from the}} grief of Cazale's death, Streep {{accepted}} a role in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) as the chirpy love interest of Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on [...] "automatic pilot". She performed the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew for Shakespeare in the Park, and also played a supporting role in Manhattan (1979) for Woody Allen. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue. In the drama Kramer vs. Kramer, Streep was cast opposite Dustin Hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as [...] "too evil" [...] and insisted {{that it was not}} representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career, and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions <b>between</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>children.</b> The director Robert Benton allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who [...] "hated her guts". Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, [...] "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing." [...] The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic Stephen Farber believed displayed Streep's [...] "own emotional intensity", writing that {{she was one of the}} [...] "rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery".|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{examine how}} parental stress and {{pediatric}} cancer might jointly predict child HPA function using a non-invasive method of cortisol assessment (hair samples). Methods: <b>Parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>children</b> from healthy control and pediatric cancer survivor families participated. Multilevel modeling {{was applied to}} data from a nested-design study (85 children, 5 - 18 years old, from 64 families, healthy controls: n= 32; cancer survivors: n= 32) to determine the relationship <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> salivary <b>and</b> <b>child</b> hair cortisol measures. Results: No main effect of the cancer experience on child cortisol was found. Parental cortisol positively correlated with child cortisol levels within healthy controls, while there was no association within pediatric cancer survivor families. For cancer survivor children given corticosteroids, there was a negative association <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> cortisol levels. Among cancer survivor children not given corticosteroids, the relationship <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> {{was the same as}} for healthy control families. Conclusion: Only when children are exposed to corticosteroids, the relationship <b>between</b> <b>parent</b> <b>and</b> <b>child</b> HPA function is significantly changed by the cancer experience. This study provides no evidence that the cancer illness alone alters child HPA function. However, direct perturbation of the child’s HPA axis by corticosteroid exposure may have lasting effects on children’s stress physiology. PsychologyDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.
