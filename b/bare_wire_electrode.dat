Background. Atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery is a significant clinical problem. Methods. Twelve dogs with sterile pericarditis were studied. In the first group (6 dogs, bilateral thoracotomy group), a <b>wire</b> <b>electrode,</b> insulated except for the distal 6 cm, was placed on the epicardial free wall of each atrium. Each end of the <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> was then sutured to the parietal pericardium. In the second group (6 dogs, median sternotomy group), the <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> were kept in place by a double loop of Prolene placed around the distal tip of the <b>bare</b> <b>wire</b> and sewn to the overlying parietal pericardium. In the bilateral thoracotomy group, atrial defibrillation thresholds (defined as 10 % successful defibrillation of 20 shocks at a given delivered energy) were obtained in anesthetized dogs using the <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> with the chest closed and open and using two transvenously placed catheters with coil electrodes in the distal 6 cm (one in the coronary sinus and the other in the right atrial appendage) with the chest open. In the median sternotomy group, thresholds were obtained in minimally sedated animals without reopening the chest. A 25 % increase above threshold shock was also used to determine a new percent success. After 4 days, the <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> were removed by pulling on the external ends. At the time of removal, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored for 30 min, after which dogs were killed and their hearts sent for histopathologic study. For all dogs, chest radiographs were obtained postoperatively and on study days. Results. Atrial defibrillation using the <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> was successful in all dogs at a mean (±SE) voltage of 112 ± 9 V, with an energy level of 0. 46 ± 0. 07 J and an impedance of 59. 3 ± 5 ohms. The mean percent success at the atrial defibrillation threshold was 36 ± 5 %. The 25 % increase in defibrillation voltage improved the mean percent success to 73 % (mean energy 0. 66 ± 0. 19 J). No clinical or hemodynamic complications were observed during shock delivery, and no ventricular arrhythmias were induced during the shocks. No complications followed <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> removal. Histopathologic analysis showed no structural damage. Conclusions. The atrial defibrillation threshold obtained using temporary epicardial <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> for atrial defibrillation is < 1 J in dogs. Atrial defibrillation using temporary epicardial <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> can be performed safely, quickly and reliably without the need for anesthesia or antiarrhythmic agents. The <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> can be removed without adverse hemodynamic or structural consequences. These data provide a basis for testing atrial defibrillation using epicardial <b>wire</b> <b>electrodes</b> in patients after open heart surgery...|$|R
5|$|The {{principles}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding began to be understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It was not until the 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a <b>bare</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>wire</b> and direct current, and used arc voltage to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{high-speed}} and medium-speed wire {{electrical discharge machines}} {{which are}} originally developed in China are playing {{an important role in}} mold making. However, the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> wear is a universal problem in the machining process because the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> is used repeatedly. Considering the relative motion between the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> and the workpiece, the heat transfer model of <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> under moving heat source was established, and the temperature field of <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> was simulated in single pulse discharge by FEM. The results indicated that the size of the melted zone along the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> axial direction increased remarkably while the depth size, the width size and the volume of the melted zone reduced apparently when the wire running speed increased. It can be concluded that the high relative speed between the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> and the workpiece is beneficial to reduce the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> wear in radial direction. Furthermore, when the wire running speed is higher than a certain value, the discharge column will slide over the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> surface before the wire material reaches its melting point, thus the melting and ablation of the <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> material does not happen, which can almost realize no <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> wear...|$|R

The substrate steel hardfaced with flux cored <b>wire</b> <b>electrode</b> resulted in high microhardness as compare to solid <b>wire</b> <b>electrode.</b> The erosion study was conducted, using an air jet erosion test rig at a particle velocity of 50 m/s. Ductile erosion behavior is observed in the case when the substrate steels is hardfaced with solid wire whereas brittle erosion behavior is observed when the substrate steels is hardfaced with flux cored wire. At a low angle of impingement, the abrasive type cutting is the dominating factor for material removal, and at a higher angle of impingement, impact-type as well as abrasive-type cutting actions play critical roles. Plastic deformation characterized by pitting and cutting action was also observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique was used to analyze the eroded surface. It was concluded that damaged surfaces of Pulverized coal burner nozzle material can be successfully hardfaced and improvement in erosion resistance was observed. ...|$|R
