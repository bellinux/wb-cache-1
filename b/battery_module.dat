Each <b>battery</b> <b>module</b> {{is made of}} 6 individual 1.2V 6.5Ah Prismatic NiMH cells in series forming a 7.2V 6.5Ah module with 46Wh/kg energy density and 1.3kW/kg output power density.

These modules are connected 28 in series to form a 201.6V 6.5Ah battery (traction battery), {{also known as the}} energy storage system. The computer controlled charge controller and battery management computer systems keep this battery between 38% and 82% state of charge, with a tendency to keep the average state of charge around 60%. By shallow cycling the battery {{only a small portion of}} its net available energy storage capacity is available for use (approximately 400Wh) by the hybrid drive system, but the shallow computer controlled cycling dramatically improves the cycle life, thermal management control, and net long term calendar life of the battery. Active cooling of this battery is achieved by a blower motor and air ducting, while passive thermal management was accomplished through the metal case design.|$|E

Beginning the spacewalk at 12:20 UTC, the pair first worked on removing an aging <b>battery</b> <b>module,</b> {{and replaced it with}} a new pack, which combined with the battery replacement performed during the second spacewalk, gave the telescope all new nickel-hydrogen batteries.

NASA engineers liken the new FGS to being able to keep a laser beam focused on a U.S. dime coin that is [...] away. Both the new batteries, and the FGS passed both aliveness and functional testing. The mission's final EVA concluded at 19:22 UTC, after seven hours and two minutes. The total time spent during the mission in extra-vehicular activity was thirty-six hours, fifty-six minutes. The twenty-third and final spacewalk to service Hubble brought the total time spent in EVA working on the telescope to one hundred and sixty-six hours, six minutes. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that the final EVA was also the last planned spacewalk from a shuttle airlock.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a centralized recursive optimal scheduling method for a battery system {{that consists of}} parallel connected <b>battery</b> <b>modules</b> with different open circuit voltages and battery impedance characteristics. Examples of such a battery system {{can be found in}} second-life, exchangeable or repurposed battery systems in which batteries with different charge or age characteristics are combined to create a larger storage capacity. The proposed method in this paper takes advantage of the availability of buck regulators in the battery management system (BMS) to compute the optimal voltage adjustment of the individual modules to minimize the effect of stray currents between the parallel connected <b>battery</b> <b>modules.</b> Our proposed method recursively computes the optimal current scheduling that balances (equals) each module current and maximize total bus current without violating any of the <b>battery</b> <b>modules</b> operating constraints. Recursive implementation guarantees robust operation as the <b>battery</b> <b>modules</b> operating parameters change as the battery pack (dis) charges or ages. In order to demonstrate the capability of this method in real battery system, an experimental setup of 3 parallel placed <b>battery</b> <b>modules</b> is built. The experimental results validate the feasibility and show the advantages of this current scheduling method in a real battery application, despite the fact that each module may have different impedance, open circuit voltage and charge parameters.
