25|$|With the {{publication}} of The Waste Land, modernist poetry appeared {{to have made a}} breakthrough into wider critical discourse and a <b>broader</b> <b>readership.</b> However, the economic collapse of the late 1920s and early 1930s had a serious negative impact on the new writing. For American writers, living in Europe became more difficult as their incomes lost a great deal of their relative value. While Gertrude Stein, Barney and Joyce remained in the French city, much of the scene they had presided over scattered. Pound was in Italy, Eliot in London, H.D. moved between that city and Switzerland, and many of the other writers associated with the movement were now living in the States.|$|E
500|$|Janet Floyd, the {{professor}} of American Literature, identifies that David [...] "showed {{little interest in}} appealing to or engaging with an audience outside a social elite"; Cooper addresses the same point, although points to a positive review of French Provincial Cooking in The Daily Worker—a newspaper that represented the Communist Party of Great Britain—as evidence that David had a <b>broader</b> <b>readership</b> than some give credit for.|$|E
500|$|Before her death, Rückerschöld {{would write}} two more {{books on the}} topic of {{housekeeping}} and cooking: Fattig Mans Wisthus och Kök, ("Poor Man's Larder and Kitchen") and En Liten Hushålls-Cateches ("A Small Household Catechism"). The first book was published in 1796, and [...] aimed for a <b>broader</b> <b>readership</b> than the previous books. This included not just modest urban households, but also peasant wives who made up {{the majority of the population}} in Sweden at the time. Again Rückerschöld stressed the importance that women know proper housekeeping skills, and urged them to take good care of the household economy to keep incompetent husbands from wrecking the family budget. Other than directions for simple dishes, there was money-saving strategies like baking one's own bread or cooperating with neighbors to buy larger quantities of food at lower prices. In the book Rückerschöld portrays herself as going on inspection in a peasant household, being shown the barn, larder, vegetable garden, etc., and having suggestions for improvements everywhere. Fattig Mans Wisthus och Kök was awarded a silver medal by Patriotiska Sällskapet ("The Patriotic Society") for being the first cookbook written for poorer households. Twenty years earlier, the society had issued a challenge with this aim, but no one before Rückerschöld had managed to write such a book. In 1797, one year after the book was first published, a second edition came out.|$|E

50|$|Though {{registered}} as a newspaper, The Record was, and saw itself as, more a magazine than a newspaper.

50|$|He {{first went}} to Leipzig, where he {{attended}} the lectures of Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch (1802-1896), a Herbartian philosopher {{and one of the}} forerunners of the Neo-Kantian revival of the 1860s. He was there {{at the same time that}} Nietzsche was a student, although it does not appear that they met. In 1869, he moved to Tübingen and to Stuttgart in 1871. Here, at the orthodox Church of the Court, he married on 30 January 1872, Elisabeth (Elise) Gatternich and the two had a daughter, Hélène. In Leipzig, Spir befriended the publisher and fellow Freemason Joseph Gabriel Findel, who published most of Spir’s works. His most important book, Denken und Wirklichkeit: Versuch einer Erneuerung der kritischen Philosophie (Thought and Reality: Attempt at a Renewal of Critical Philosophy) was published in 1873. A second edition, which was the one owned by Nietzsche, was published in 1877. In an attempt to reach a <b>broader</b> <b>readership,</b> Spir wrote directly in French his Esquisses de philosophie critique (Outlines of critical philosophy), published for the first time in 1877. A new edition was published forty years after his death, in 1930, with an introduction by the French philosopher and professor at the Sorbonne Léon Brunschvicg.|$|E
