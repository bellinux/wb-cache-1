5|$|In 2006, {{more than}} 200 US {{companies}} restated their financial results {{due to a}} series of investigations into stock <b>backdating</b> practices. Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive <b>backdating</b> practices that benefited its top executives unfairly. In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003. This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.|$|E
5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was {{appointed}} as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk {{was shocked to see}} the use of forced labour and population displacement carried out by the Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively <b>backdating</b> it to 2April 1976.|$|E

25|$|Class action {{securities}} fraud lawsuits rose 43 percent between 2006 and 2007, {{according to the}} Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse. During 2006 and 2007, {{securities fraud}} class actions were driven by market wide events, such as the 2006 <b>backdating</b> scandal and the 2007 subprime crisis. Securities fraud lawsuits remained below historical averages.|$|E
25|$|The {{review was}} {{published}} on 1 April, although many sailors {{learned of the}} details from contacts during the preceding weekend of 29–30 March. While an improvement, the new pay rates were still half that of the Army and Air Force, and most, if not all, of the increase would end up absorbed by increasing tax rates. In addition, several benefits or allowances were either removed (for example, uniformed personnel were no longer allowed free travel on public transport, unless issued a voucher to do so) or were not modified to compensate for inflation (for example, uniform allowances remained at pre-war levels, despite the threefold increase in uniform prices). The promised <b>backdating</b> was {{not mentioned in the}} initial announcement, resulting in great dissatisfaction amongst the sailors. A later announcement clarified that the <b>backdating</b> would occur, but it is unclear if doing so was originally intended, or added in response to the mutiny.|$|E

The three are also required to pay C$9-million to the OSC.|$|E

25|$|Early on, the Superboy feature {{became a}} {{platform}} for <b>backdating</b> first meetings between Superman and members of his supporting cast, nearly always contradicting previously established continuity. Thus, Superboy first meets Perry White in a 1947 story (Adventure Comics #120), and in the following year, meets Lois Lane (Adventure Comics #128), years after the adult Clark Kent had first met his fellow Daily Planet staffers in Superman stories. In a similar vein, Kal-El later meets toddler Jimmy Olsen (Adventure Comics #216, 1955) while still Superboy, as well as meeting a time traveling teenage Jimmy Olsen (Superboy #55, 1957).|$|E
25|$|The {{main cause}} was the poor rates of pay {{compared}} {{to the rest of}} the New Zealand Defence Force (which was overall well behind equivalent civilian wages), and was instigated by the release of a government review on the matter. Complaints were that the new pay rates were still inferior to the other branches of the military, and the increases would be consumed by taxes, inflation, and cancellation of allowances and benefits. The conclusion of the review was a year overdue, but a previously promised <b>backdating</b> of the increase was not initially announced. The poor living and working conditions aboard RNZN ships was another issue, compounded by sailors having no effective way to make dissatisfaction known to the higher ranks (many experienced divisional officers had been discharged as part of post-war demobilisation efforts, and although lower-deck welfare committees had been implemented, they were not permitted to discuss or propose alterations to shipboard conditions). Dissatisfaction with peacetime duties and opportunities also contributed: many sailors were locked into enlistment periods of up to 12 years, and demobilisation efforts had prioritised those enlisted specifically for the duration of World War II.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Comverse Technology was {{involved}} in an options <b>backdating</b> scandal. In May of that year, company founder and CEO Jacob Alexander stepped down from his position. [...] Alexander, finance chief David Kreinberg, and former senior general counsel William Sorin (both of whom had also stepped down) were charged in July 2006 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York with multiple counts of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and making false filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), all related to alleged options <b>backdating</b> or other actions related to stock options between 1998 and 2006. [...] The accusations against the three included the <b>backdating</b> of options to when Comverse stock had been trading at low prices, the use of fake names of option holders, {{and the creation of}} secret funds in which to hold the illicit gains. [...] The SEC also filed civil charges against the three, for filing false annual and quarterly financial reports and proxy statements from 1991 to 2005.|$|E

500|$|Because of the {{accounting}} issues from the option <b>backdating,</b> Comverse Technology was unable to file full or timely financial reports with the SEC. Its stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market on 1 February 2007, and removed from the S 500 and NASDAQ-100 at the same time. The stock then traded on the Pink Sheets. [...] In 2009, the SEC settled its case with Comverse Technology; the company would {{not be subject to}} penalty fines over the <b>backdating</b> matter, but would accept a permanent injunction against itself regarding any future violations of law regarding publicly traded companies. [...] A settlement in a similar case against Ulticom was also reached. [...] The failure to file timely financial reports put the company at risk of having its stock registration revoked; a process deciding this, involving the SEC and an Administrative Law Judge, is still active of 2011.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the other}} two executives, William Sorin pleaded guilty to {{criminal}} charges {{and was sentenced to}} a year in prison in 2007. [...] David Kreinberg cooperated with prosecutors, repaid $2.4 million to the SEC, and in 2011 was sentenced to the [...] "time served" [...] of the minimal period he had originally been in custody. [...] While over a hundred companies were investigated or charged with options <b>backdating,</b> Comverse {{was one of the most}} known cases, and in the words of a pair of financial writers, [...] "Comverse was the poster child for stock option fraud." ...|$|E
500|$|According to The American Lawyer, as of March 2011, the CCAF {{had filed}} {{objections}} to 17 settlements, with eight objections pending in federal district courts, {{and had been}} successful on six of them. The CCAF has objected to settlements throughout the United States, particularly in cases where class action lawyers receive cash payments but the plaintiff class receives only discount coupons for further products and services from the defendant company. It has distanced itself from other firms that make money by holding up class action settlements until they themselves are paid off. The CCAF has raised objections to class action settlements involving the Grand Theft Auto [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame, Honda Civic Hybrids, Apple <b>backdating,</b> A.G.

500|$|In 2006, Comverse was {{involved}} in an options <b>backdating</b> scandal. [...] Alexander and two other top executives were charged in the US with multiple counts of conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and making false filings. [...] Alexander fled the country to Namibia where he engaged in a prolonged fight against extradition. [...] The scandal proved difficult for Comverse Technology to recover from; the company was delisted from Nasdaq, removed from the S 500, {{and spent the next}} several years consumed by the costly need to restate its financial reports for several years. [...] Additionally affected by the financial crisis of 2008 and on and changes in the mobile phone market, the company underwent several rounds of large-scale layoffs and sold off parts of its business. [...] By 2011 the company began a turnaround.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2010, Frank and the CCAF, citing American Law Institute {{guidelines}} on cy-près, objected to Apple's settlement of a securities class action over their <b>backdating,</b> arguing that {{giving money to}} third parties affiliated with the class counsel instead of to the class was a breach of fiduciary duty. Frank stated that [...] "the magnitude of the settlement compared to the original claims demonstrates {{that it is an}} extortionate nuisance settlement, being made because it would cost more to defend the suit than to pay the attorneys to go away." [...] In response to CCAF's objection, the parties amended the settlement by reallocating the $2.5 million originally proposed as cy-près to class members; the court awarded CCAF attorneys' fees for their role in winning $2.5 million for the class.|$|E
500|$|He was {{released}} on bail and subsequently engaged in a long, and so far successful, battle to avoid extradition to the US (in Namibia neither money laundering nor options <b>backdating</b> is a crime). [...] Upon leaving the US he had transferred some $64 million to Israel, with most of that ending up in Namibia; another $50 million was blocked by the US government, which overall sought the forfeiture of $138 million of Alexander's assets. [...] In April 2010, Alexander won {{a victory in the}} Supreme Court of Namibia that allowed him to continue to live and work in that country until the extradition request is finally ruled upon. [...] In November 2010, Alexander agreed to pay the U.S. government $53.6 million to settle the SEC's case against him, with those monies being targeted to settle assorted lawsuits against Comverse by shareholders.|$|E

500|$|Among CCAFs {{cases are}} those {{challenging}} an emerging trend known as cy-près. [...] Created by American {{courts in the}} 1970s as a mechanism to distribute funds to stand-in organizations and causes in cases in which it would be impractical to distribute class action settlement funds directly to the entire class of plaintiffs, the practice has been criticized {{from time to time}} for redirecting funds that would otherwise go to the parties to the case. [...] In one case, CCAF challenged a settlement that would have directed $2.5 million out of a total $16.5 million settlement Apple Inc. was to pay to shareholders for <b>backdating</b> employee stock option grants, to unrelated law school programs on corporate governance. According to Frank, in March 2010, two attorneys from the Kabateck Brown Kellner firm published an op ed in the Los Angeles Daily Journal attacking the litigation against impermissible cy pres awards as part of a [...] "corporate" [...] campaign. Frank firmly stated on the Manhattan Institute run website Point of Law.com that the [...] "Center for Class Action Fairness has never taken a dollar of for-profit corporate money." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission began {{investigating}} {{the conduct of}} the United Health Group's management and directors. [...] Additionally, the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed documents from the company. [...] The investigations came to light after a series of probing articles in The Wall Street Journal in May 2006, which reported on the apparent <b>backdating</b> of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UnitedHealth Group's management. [...] The <b>backdating</b> allegedly occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, including Kean, who sat on the company's compensation committee during three crucial years, according to the Journal.
