40|$|Variable {{tuition fees}} and <b>bursaries,</b> funded by higher {{education}} institutions, {{were introduced in}} England to promote student choice and provider competition, while <b>bursaries</b> would off-set higher fees and safeguard access. Both are central to government reforms of student funding since 2004. This article assesses student perceptions {{of the impact of}} <b>bursaries</b> on their higher education decisions and choices, and considers the implications for the 2012 / 13 National Scholarship Programme. It concludes that most students do not think their choices are affected by <b>bursaries</b> although those who: are cost-conscious; expect to receive higher <b>bursaries</b> especially of £ 1, 000 or more; and attend Russell Group universities are more likely to think <b>bursaries</b> are influential and important. The reconfiguration of institutional aid from 2012 / 13 may overcome some perceived barriers to this financial support’s effectiveness, but is likely to exacerbate others, and create new impediments and inequalities...|$|R

5|$|He {{abandoned}} {{the study of}} medicine and changed to English, history, and theology. Because he switched his field, however, he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees. He received a government <b>bursary,</b> and his family also donated money– his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip home {{from his job as}} a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies. From its inception, the university had a strong Arts faculty; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni.

40|$|The 2004 Higher Education Act {{introduced}} variable {{tuition fees}} {{of up to}} £ 3, 000 for full‐time undergraduates in England. Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) charging the maximum tuition must give low‐income students <b>bursaries</b> of £ 300. On top of this mandatory minimum, HEIs now provide additional discretionary financial support exceeding this level to these and other students. The degree to which these new <b>bursaries</b> and discretionary financial support have become a policy instrument for improving access and widening participation has not, as yet, been documented. Little is known about why the government introduced <b>bursaries</b> and what the government saw as their role. Even less {{is known about the}} type of <b>bursaries</b> HEIs have introduced or how they are being used, because up till now they have not been examined systematically. This article presents the first such analysis. It concludes that, from the evidence currently available, a mismatch exists between government aspirations and HEIs’ actual use of <b>bursaries</b> and scholarships. Moreover, the <b>bursaries</b> and scholarships put in place may perpetuate existing divisions within and across higher education...|$|R

5|$|In 1948, in {{preparation}} for independence, Nigeria's first university opened. Known as University College (now the University of Ibadan), it was an associate college of the University of London. Achebe obtained such high marks in the entrance examination that he was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a <b>bursary</b> to study medicine. It was during his studies at Ibadan that Achebe began to become critical of European literature about Africa. After reading Joyce Cary's 1939 work Mister Johnson about a cheerful Nigerian man who (among other things) works for an abusive British storeowner, he was so disturbed by the book's portrayal of its Nigerian characters as either savages or buffoons {{that he decided to}} become a writer. Achebe recognised his dislike for the African protagonist {{as a sign of the}} author's cultural ignorance. One of his classmates announced to the professor that the only enjoyable moment in the book is when Johnson is shot.|$|E
5|$|The {{school is}} selective; {{admission}} {{is based on}} assessments in English, mathematics and reasoning, an academic reference from the applicant's current school and an interview. The main entry point to enter the Lower School is at age 7 (Year 3), and ages 11 (Year 7), 13 (Year 9) and 16 to enter the Senior School. There are academic, music and other scholarships which reduce school fees by up to one-fifth, as well as means-tested bursaries up to the entirety of school fees. In addition, the charitable trust of the Dyers' provide a <b>bursary</b> to cover half the school fees of one pupil in each academic year. Cathedral choristers also receive bursaries which cover half of school fees through the Norwich Cathedral Choir Endowment Fund. The fees for the 2013/2014 academic year for the Lower School are £11,997 per annum (£3,999 per term), and £13,167 per annum (£4,389 per term) for the Senior School. The school also charges fees for lunches and entries for public examinations.|$|E
5|$|The new {{religious}} orders {{that became a}} major feature of Scottish monastic life in this period also brought new educational possibilities {{and the need to}} train larger numbers of monks. Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had almonry schools, charity schools using funds from the almoner to provide a type of <b>bursary</b> to educate young boys, who might enter the priesthood. At the Cluniac Paisley Abbey, secular chaplains were employed as schoolmasters. Some monasteries, including the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, Sweetheart Abbey and Beauly, opened their doors to a wider range of students to teach the sons of gentlemen. St Andrews, which was both the seat of a bishop and the site of a major Augustinian foundation, had both a grammar school, under the archdeacon, and a song school, under the priory. The foundation of over 100 collegiate churches of secular priests between 1450 and the Reformation would have necessitated the training of large numbers of choristers. Sometimes, as at Lochwinnoch, they were taught both music and grammar. Dominican friars were noted for their educational achievements and were usually located in urban centres, probably teaching grammar, as at Glasgow and Ayr. The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns.|$|E

25|$|Student nurses {{currently}} {{receive a}} <b>bursary</b> {{from the government}} to support them during their nurse training.
