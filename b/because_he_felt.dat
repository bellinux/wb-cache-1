5|$|The {{selection}} {{process for the}} male lead was the longest, {{and a series of}} auditions attracted several celebrities. Giddens chose first-time actor Ko Chen-tung <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he showed great improvement in his acting skills in each successive audition.

5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him.

5|$|He began {{drawing the}} comic book in early 2005 with {{traditional}} art tools such as Mongol pencils and brushes. He took great care while illustrating Elmer <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> his earlier work, Wasted, was poorly drawn.

5|$|Lennon {{started a}} skiffle {{group that was}} very briefly called the Blackjacks, but changed the name before any public performances. Some {{accounts}} credit Lennon with choosing the new name; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> Harrison (still 14 {{when he was first}} introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute.|$|E

Brando sued the Salkinds and Warner Bros. for $50million <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> cheated out of his share of the box office profits. This stopped Brando's footage from being used in Richard Lester's version of Superman II.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{chooses to}} be kept in the dark {{about the future of the}} series, never knowing any farther ahead than his current working script. For Kill or Be Killed, he is using digital tools and the same panel layout he has used on {{previous}} works, but removed the frame from the outside edges <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the full bleed makes the images feel more claustrophobic. Breitweiser, an integral part of the team, is coloring Phillips' art in a moody palette with gritty textures and incorporating color psychology.|$|E

5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want to}} deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E

Other story arcs praised included the Augment arc with Brent Spiner and the return of the genetic supermen made famous by Ricardo Montalbán's Khan in The Original Series. Phillip Chung of AsianWeek bemoaned the loss of the show, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that it had improved over time and due to the franchise's continued progressive stance in showing racial minorities outside of the normal stereotypes.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love (2011), Sukumar {{began working}} on a psychological thriller with Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that Mahesh had universal appeal. An incident in which a bus driver talked about a young boy who said that his parents were murdered on his bus became the story's base.

Although Sukumar could not describe the story well in the noisy restaurant, Mahesh agreed to appear in the film within half an hour. Sukumar worked on 1:Nenokkadine script for two months, and considered it his dream project.|$|E

Clementsdotter recited various biblical teachings to Laestadius. This {{was an important}} meeting for Laestadius <b>because</b> afterwards <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> understood the secret of living faith.
