25|$|The <b>buffet</b> <b>table</b> {{originates}} {{from the}} brännvinsbord (Swedish schnapps, or shot of alcoholic beverage) table {{from the middle}} of 16th century. This custom had its prime during the early 18th century, and was developed into the more modern buffet around the beginning of 19th century. The smörgåsbord buffet did not increase in popularity until the expansion of the railroads throughout Europe.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinion on the}} {{effectiveness}} of the multiple styles of gameplay presented. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times said that while [...] "there are plenty of games that surpass it in each area," [...] that Nier pulled all of the styles together into a [...] "coherent, compelling whole" [...] instead of feeling [...] "disjointed"; he especially praised a section of the game that is presented entirely through text. Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia, however, said that while the different styles were [...] "interesting" [...] and one of the game's biggest strengths, they suffered from poor execution and cohesion and left the game [...] "with split-personality disorder". Clements said that [...] "the developers' ideas sometimes outshine the actual implementation", while highlighting the gameplay elements as part of what made the game fun. Adriaan den Ouden called out the variety as {{the best part of the}} game, likening it to a <b>buffet</b> <b>table,</b> while also acknowledging that none of the sections were [...] "amazing" [...] on their own and could easily be looked upon poorly.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two dogs}} were {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} company of the [...] "Emperor of the United States", the eccentric Joshua A. Norton, and a popular legend made him their owner. However, no contemporary records make any mention of Norton being the owner and only one newspaper report made any connection between him and the dogs. The rumor may have arisen because the cartoonist Edward Jump frequently featured the three together, most notably in The Three Bummers which showed Norton eating from a heavily laden <b>buffet</b> <b>table</b> while the dogs wait patiently for scraps. Norton was apparently outraged when he saw the picture displayed in a shop-front window: the imperial dignity was affronted by the depiction of His Majesty {{in the company of}} lowly dogs. Despite the apparent antipathy felt by Norton for the dogs, the close association was still being claimed in the 1950s: ...|$|E

50|$|New Classics took {{aesthetic}} {{cues from}} the Post-modern architecture Movement, {{which was a}} reaction to the sparseness of modern architecture and design. Jackson—along with architects Robert Venturi and Michael Graves—helped to define the new style with works that referenced traditional architectural features such as classical proportions, columns, and arches. The collection included a dining <b>table,</b> <b>buffet,</b> armoire, coffee <b>table,</b> and desk, each in a post and lintel design that was easier to reproduce than Jackson’s other more sculptural works.|$|R

Aside from Almalbis, members over the years included Rommel de la Cruz who played Bass throughout the band's existence; drummers Franklin Benitez and Wendell Garcia, who were part of the band before and after the release of Music from the <b>Buffet</b> <b>Table,</b> respectively, and Kakoi Legaspi, who took up a second guitar position just prior to the band's dissolution in 2005.|$|E

60|$|Shortly {{after this}} event, {{one of the}} serving men rushed in to Harry {{with the news that}} a strong band of Parliament horse were within three or four miles of the place, and were approaching. Harry at once sent for the steward, and a dozen men were summoned in all haste. On their arrival they set to work to strip the hall of its most valued furniture. The {{pictures}} were taken down from the walls, the silver and plate tumbled into chests, the arms and armor worn by generations of the Furnesses removed from the armory, the choicest articles of furniture of a portable character put into carts, together with some twenty casks of the choicest wine in the cellars, and in four hours only the heavier furniture, the chairs and <b>tables,</b> <b>buffets</b> and heavy sideboards remained in their places.|$|R
5000|$|A {{modified}} form {{of service}} à la française in which several large dishes are brought {{out for each}} diner to help themselves from is known as [...] "family-style" [...] in less formal restaurants, as they replicate the typical way in which small family meals are served. The buffet style is essentially {{a variation of the}} French service in which all of the food is available, at the correct temperature, in a serving space other than the dining table, and guests commute there to be served or sometimes to serve themselves, and then carry their plate back to the <b>table.</b> <b>Buffets</b> vary from the very informal (a gathering of friends in a home, or the serving of brunch at a hotel) to the rather formal setting of a wedding reception, for example. The buffet format is preferred in occasions where {{a very large number of}} guests are to be accommodated efficiently by a small number of service personnel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{contents}} of the house were sold by auction under a marquee outside the house over a five-day period 26 November– 1 December 1956. Described extensively, if a little quaintly, by the auctioneers John D Wood of London as [...] "....including interesting examples of 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, a fine set of George II chairs, Queen Anne and Chippendale mirrors, cabinets, chests, <b>tables,</b> <b>buffets,</b> sets of chairs, clocks, Jacobean needlework, French commodes, vitrines, tables and numerous other period piece...old paintings and a library of books". In truth the collection included items of national importance, but the 1950s were an era of the destruction and dismantling of the British country house and such sales were not uncommon, as was exemplified in the Destruction of the Country House exhibition of 1974. Among the 909 paintings described as old masters were works by Thomas Lawrence including a version of his state portrait of George IV, and his portrait of the 10th Earl of Westmorland, proving the earl's estranged wife did not totally forget him. Also in the sale were numerous works by Kneller, Romney, Lely, Snyders and at least ten attributed to Van Dyke: the paintings {{are listed in the}} [...] "{{contents of}} the house" [...] together with Tudor, Chippendale, Sheraton and Louis XV furniture, and an [...] "assortment of bed sheets", [...] "3 new towels and an [...] "old bedspread".|$|R

5000|$|After {{the full}} {{introduction}} of the standard gauge passenger service, new lounge cars were provided on the new premier train, the Southern Aurora, but the Spirit of Progress was downrated to the second-tier service {{and it was not}} provided with any such service. The Club Car was rendered obsolete in that sense, so the car was returned to Newport Workshops and rebuilt again. It re-entered service on 21 March 1963, renamed Norman. The name and purpose had been recycled from the previous carriage, which had been reserved for use by railway officials on inspection tours around the state, and other high-profile events. The car was extensively rebuilt for the new purpose; a flexible diaphragm was fitted to the flat end in lieu of the full-width, collapsible steel-plated diaphragm, which had been intended to make the Spirit of Progress train look like one unit rather than individual carriages. End windows were cut into the body at that end either side of the doorway. An additional door was also cut into the rounded end of the carriage, allowing access/egress when the carriage was parked in a railmotor dock or similar; and both ends were fitted with external marker lights above the roofline and at around waist height. Internally the car was gutted and nearly everything was replaced. The flat end was refitted with a small 11 ft office/meeting area with four individual seats provided, replacing the former guard compartment and male bathroom. The ladies' bathroom was retained and made unisex. A 14 ft kitchen area with buffet counter was fitted over where the former <b>buffet</b> and semicircle <b>tables</b> were placed, and expanding somewhat into the observation saloon. That saloon was fitted with a central table of 17 ft, surrounded with 21 seats. The three windows adjacent to the kitchen were partially filled in, allowing for a higher cooking surface.|$|R
60|$|Your house {{should not}} command much outlook; {{it should be}} set deep and green, though upon rising ground, or, if possible, {{crowning}} a knoll, {{for the sake of}} drainage. Yet it must be open to the east, or you will miss the sunrise; sunset occurring so much later, you can go up a few steps and look the other way. A house of more than two stories is a mere barrack; indeed the ideal is of one story, raised upon cellars. If the rooms are large, the house may be small: a single room, lofty, spacious, and lightsome, is more palatial than a castleful of cabinets and cupboards. Yet size in a house, and some extent and intricacy of corridor, is certainly delightful to the flesh. The reception room should be, if possible, a place of many recesses, which are ‘petty retiring places for conference’; but it must have one long wall with a divan: for a day spent upon a divan, among a world of cushions, is as full of diversion as to travel. The eating-room, in the French mode, should be ad hoc: unfurnished, but with a <b>buffet,</b> the <b>table,</b> necessary chairs, one or two of Canaletto’s etchings, and a tile fire-place for the winter. In neither of these public places should there be anything beyond a shelf or two of books; but the passages may be one library from end to end, and the stair, if there be one, lined with volumes in old leather, very brightly carpeted, and leading half-way up, and by way of landing, to a windowed recess with a fire-place; this window, almost alone in the house, should command a handsome prospect. Husband and wife must each possess a studio; on the woman’s sanctuary I hesitate to dwell, and turn to the man’s. The walls are shelved waist-high for books, and the top thus forms a continuous table running round the wall. Above are prints, a large map of the neighbourhood, a Corot and a Claude or two. The room is very spacious, and the five tables and two chairs are but as islands. One table is for actual work, one close by for references in use; one, very large, for MSS. or proofs that wait their turn; one kept clear for an occasion; and the fifth is the map table, groaning under a collection of large-scale maps and charts. Of all books these are the least wearisome to read and the richest in matter; the course of roads and rivers, the contour lines and the forests in the maps—the reefs, soundings, anchors, sailing marks and little pilot-pictures in the charts—and, in both, the bead-roll of names, make them of all printed matter the most fit to stimulate and satisfy the fancy. The chair in which you write is very low and easy, and backed into a corner; at one elbow the fire twinkles; close at the other, if you are a little inhumane, your cage of silver-bills are twittering into song.|$|R

That album would be significant for introducing the Christian-themed lyrics that would be Barbie's Cradle's trademark until its disbandment, and of Barbie Almalbis as a solo artist thereafter.|$|E
