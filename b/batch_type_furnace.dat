40|$|AbstractTFA-MOD (Metal Organic Deposition using Trifluoro-acetates) {{process is}} of {{considerable}} practical concern for future applications since it can fabricate high performance coated conductors (CCs) with low cost. We have previously reported the success in fabricating a short sample of BaZrO 3 (BZO) nanoparticles dispersed Y 0. 77 Gd 0. 23 Ba 1. 5 Cu 3 Oy (YGdBCO) thick films with high Ic values under magnetic field (67. 8 A/cm-w, @ 77 K, 3 T). To make thick CCs for long length, {{it is important}} to study the effect of process parameters varying with time. In this study, we investigated the effect of coating solution characteristics such as viscosity etc., which could vary with time due to evaporation of solvent, on the transverse film thickness distribution by using Reel-To-Reel (RTR) -dip coating method. We successfully fabricated BZO doped YGdBCO calcined films with 2. 5 μm thickness without crack and delamination over 200 m in length. The precursor films were crystallized by the <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> <b>furnace</b> at SWCC Showa Cable Systems Co., Ltd. resulting in the 124 m long CC with high Ic minimum value of 50 A/cm-w at 77 K and 3 T...|$|E
40|$|For the {{manufacture}} of high permeability Mn-Zn ferrite cores, the zinc loss {{from the surface of}} sintering cores causes poor yield rate of final products. This experiment uses the atmospherical protection to reduce the evaporation of zinc. The control of the oxygen partial pressure and flow rate precisely can reduce the zinc loss about 20 % to 35 %, but {{it is not enough to}} get a good distribution of permeability of products, i. e. the distribution of initial permeability from 12000 to 15000 per products about 14 % before atmospherical control and 25 % after atmospherical control, respectively. Combination with precise control and zinc vapor compensation can increase the yield rate 9 % to 15 %. Another experiment to manufacture high permeability Mn-Zn ferrite cores for 15000 ± 30 % in a <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> <b>furnace</b> (about 13 Kg / batch), is to use a new engineering method to protect sintering core to avoid vaporizing zinc vapor, the yield rate can be rapidly increased from 25 % to 75 % and the effective capacity of furnace can be at least twofold.

Using a 10 nm thin thermal oxide layer and a SiNx antireflection coating of adapted thickness, we achieve J 0 e values as low as 100 fA/cm 2 (68 /sq., textured surface). Using a simple inline oxidation process in air ambient, solar cells with a conventional Al-BSF rear side and a thermal SiO 2 /SiNx passivated front yield average efficiencies of 18. 1 %, demonstrating 0. 3 % absolute efficiency gain compared to solely SiNx passivated emitter references...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: On {{concrete}} dam construction work, {{it is necessary}} to manufacture a large amount of concrete and CSG (Cemented Sand and Gravel). The manufacture plant of concrete and CSG is operated in very long term, therefore the effect of its environmental impact could be serious. In general, {{there are two types of}} manufacture plant on the process of manufacturing concrete or CSG. The one is <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant; its mixing process is not continuous and {{it is necessary to}} repeat the processes of measuring and mixing every batch. The other is continuous mixing plant; mixing process is completely continuous, at the same time, the measurement and supplement of materials are also carried out continuously. Since continuous mixing plant can manufacture a large amount of products at short time, continuous mixing plant is suitable for manufacture plant of {{concrete dam}} construction. But it is hard to control the quality of products, so <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant used to be adopted as the mixer of the manufacture plant. In recent years, the new continuous mixing plant which can control the quality of products accurately has developed and been put to practical use on several projects of concrete and CSG dam construction. The best feature of this plant is its energy saving effect. This plant is equipped with a static continuous mixer for mixing concrete or CSG. This mixer is set up in vertical direction, and then it is possible to mix materials with no electric power but only by gravity force. In this study, environmental impact due to manufacture concrete and CSG by conventional <b>batch</b> <b>type</b> plant and new continuous mixing plant are estimated and compared, and then the advantage of new continues mixing plant for environment is discussed...|$|R
