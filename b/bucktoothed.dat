2500|$|David Choe (born April 21, 1976) is an American figure painter, muralist, {{graffiti}} {{artist and}} graphic novelist of Korean descent. His figure paintings, which explore themes of desire, degradation, and exaltation, {{are characterized by}} a raw, frenetic tone that he has termed [...] "dirty style."

2500|$|In 1918, Percival {{had been}} {{described}} as [...] "a slim, soft spoken man... with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers" [...] but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival's defenders describing him as [...] "something of a damp squib". The fall of Singapore switched Percival's reputation to that of an ineffective [...] "staff wallah", lacking ruthlessness and aggression, even though few doubted {{that he was a}} brave and determined officer. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as [...] "tall, <b>bucktoothed</b> and lightly built". There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as [...] "his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp".|$|E

2500|$|Orr has a <b>bucktoothed</b> {{smile and}} {{frequently}} puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in {{his cheeks and}} rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960's and before, racially-charged humor was rather {{acceptable}} in American culture, although this general attitude {{began to change}} later in that decade, and more so afterwards. In 1961, The New York Times review of the film said that [...] "Mickey Rooney's <b>bucktoothed,</b> myopic Japanese is broadly exotic." [...] In 1990, The Boston Globe described Rooney's portrayal as [...] "an irascible <b>bucktoothed</b> nerd and an offensive ethnic caricature". In 1993, the Los Angeles Daily News wrote that the role [...] "would have been an offensive stereotype even played by an Asian; the casting of Mickey Rooney added insult to injury".|$|E

50|$|The 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's {{has been}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of the character Mr. Yunioshi, Holly's <b>bucktoothed,</b> stereotyped Japanese neighbor.

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war artists portrayed the Japanese as nearsighted, <b>bucktoothed,</b> harmless children.

5000|$|Rather {{resembling}} a <b>bucktoothed</b> Bruce Lee, Kung Pow is a Chinese chef {{who is also}} skilled in the martial arts. He wears a white gi, and his dialogue is peppered with bland tidbits of dubious [...] "oriental" [...] wisdom. Most of Kung Pow's attacks are named after Chinese food (like Egg foo young, chop suey, etc.), and he uses utensils such as chopsticks, woks and meat cleavers as weapons. His name is a reference to Kung Pao chicken.|$|E
5000|$|Frank:A bipedal, <b>bucktoothed</b> animal of {{uncertain}} {{species with}} a short tail, described by Woodring as a [...] "generic anthropomorph" [...] and [...] "naive but not innocent", [...] "completely naive, capable of sinning by virtue of not knowing what he's really about." [...] The character design is reminiscent of those found in American animated shorts from the 1920s and 1930s, such as from Fleischer Studios. Usually he appears in black and white, but when he appears in color his fur is purple.|$|E

50|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, {{towards the}} end of his reign, Sigurd {{challenged}} a native ruler, Máel Brigte the <b>Bucktoothed,</b> to a 40-man-a-side battle. Treacherously, Sigurd brought 80 men to the fight. Máel Brigte was defeated and beheaded. Sigurd strapped the head to his saddle as a trophy, but as Sigurd rode, Máel Brigte's buck-tooth scratched his leg. The leg became inflamed and infected, and as a result Sigurd died. He was buried in a tumulus known as Sigurd's Howe, or Sigurðar-haugr, from the Old Norse word haugr meaning mound or barrow. The location of Sigurd's Howe is most probably modern-day Sidera or Cyderhall near Dornoch.|$|E
5000|$|The girls {{become friends}} in the second grade and soon are inseparable. Among other things, Martha discovers that Ivy is [...] "absolutely fearless"; not courageous, but fearless. It is implied that this is {{at least in part}} due to abuse by her father or brothers. When Ivy cries, which is rarely, she sheds few tears and makes no sound at all. The {{illustrations}} as well as the text emphasize the contrasts between the girls. Ivy is dark, thin, beautiful, graceful and mature; Martha is blond, overweight, <b>bucktoothed,</b> clumsy, and cries easily. What they have in common is bright imagination, which they soon pool into a shared fantasy, almost a belief system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{story is}} about a young boy named Arashi Ishino who is obsessed with video games. He would spend all his time trying to beat the games and conquer the local arcades. He would meet {{competitors}} like Satoru Daimonji and Ishii, who would try to out match him with higher scores. At {{a certain point in}} each episode, he would display his special skill of unleashing a top which will spin so fast that both the top and his hands would catch on fire. On release, the spin would land on or near the cabinet panels, turning the ordinary button into a turbo button thus giving him a major advantage. His appearance is known for being <b>bucktoothed,</b> and he always wears a hat labeled [...] "Arashi" [...] with a picture of a sprited alien.|$|E

5000|$|The New York Times {{called the}} film a [...] "completely {{unbelievable}} but wholly captivating flight into fancy composed of unequal dollops of comedy, romance, poignancy, funny colloquialisms and Manhattan's swankiest East Side areas {{captured in the}} loveliest of colors". In reviewing the performances, the newspaper said Holly Golightly isas implausible as ever. But {{in the person of}} Miss Hepburn, she is a genuinely charming, elfin waif who will be believed and adored when seen. George Peppard is casual and, for the most part, a subdued citizen who seems to like observing better than participating in the proceedings. Martin Balsam makes a properly brash, snappy Hollywood agent. Mickey Rooney's <b>bucktoothed,</b> myopic Japanese is broadly exotic. Patricia Neal is simply cool and brisk in her few appearances as Mr. Peppard's sponsor and Vilallonga, is properly suave and Continental as Miss Hepburn's Brazilian, while Buddy Ebsen has a brief poignant moment as Miss Hepburn's husband.|$|E

50|$|Clouseau is an inept and incompetent {{police detective}} in the French Sûreté, whose {{investigations}} {{are marked by}} disorder. In The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976), an attempt to interview witnesses leads to him falling down stairs, getting his hand caught in a medieval knight's gauntlet, then a vase; knocking a witness senseless, destroying a priceless piano, and accidentally shooting another officer. Nevertheless, Clouseau successfully solves his cases and finds the correct culprits, entirely by accident. He is promoted to Chief Inspector {{over the course of}} the series, and is regarded by background characters as France’s greatest detective, until they encounter him directly. His incompetence, combined with his luck and his periodically correct interpretations of the situation, eventually transform his direct superior (former Chief Inspector Charles Dreyfus) into a homicidal psychotic. Clouseau appears convinced of his own intelligence, but does show some awareness of his limits, and attempts to appear elegant and refined regardless of what calamity he has just caused. He also insists upon elaborate costumes and aliases that range from the mundane (a worker for the phone company) to the preposterous (a <b>bucktoothed</b> hunchback with an oversized nose); but these are usually overcome by his characteristic mannerisms.|$|E
