40|$|Financial ceiling {{policy is}} one of the most {{important}} budgetary instruments. Ceiling was introdu- ced by the Delors I (1988) to manage the first financial perspective and EU budget stability. Paper is focused on financial ceiling policy of the EU budget expenditures. Financial ceiling is used for the total expenditure size (with relative indicators) and for the individual expenditure headings (with absolute indicators). We designed EU budget models using the methods of financial ceiling, which reflect different total expenditures size (total expenditure ceiling within the range of 2 % EU GNI, 5 % EU GNI, 20 % EU GNI, 1 % EU GNI, and 1, 24 % EU GNI), and new heading structure for total expenditure ceiling of 1, 24 % EU GNI. We tried to design the new <b>budgetary</b> <b>structure</b> to reflect the Lisbon Strategy better than actual EU budget. We strengthened following expenditure headings: 1 a Competitiveness for growth and employment, 3 Citizenship, freedom, security and justice, and 4 EU as a global player. The growth of these headings is compensated by an expenditure decre- ase of the following headings: 2 Preservation and management of natural resources, especially the section of the market-related expenditure and direct payment, and 1 b Cohesion for growth and employment. We made comparative analysis, which compare differences between received expenditures into agriculture and structural operations at individual member states in the case of present and new (our) structure of the EU budgetary expenditures. According to the results of this analysis we can say that new <b>budgetary</b> <b>structure</b> will likely be politically unacceptable...|$|E

40|$|Refereed Journal ArticleIn recent decades, {{high levels}} of {{military}} expenditures have characterized the <b>budgetary</b> <b>structures</b> of most Middle Eastern countries. 1 The basic patterns are well known, and for obvious reasons {{there has been an}} on-going interest among analysts (a) to explain the militarization of the region as a whole and (b) to search for variables to explain the level of defence spending of the major countries. This latter thrust has focused on factors such as economic conditions, population, size of the country, rivalries, and arms races. Here, conventional wisdom stresses regional arms races as the prime culprit in accounting for the staggering military burdens, particularly those accrued by Israel, Egypt and Syria. Unfortunately, most of this analysis in this area has been anecdotal at best. In addition, many of the empirical studies of the region's militarization are based on models built largely on arbitrary and often unrealistic assumptions concerning the action/reaction patterns of the major participants. 2 · The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify from a quantitative perspective the existence of and causation involved in the region's major arms races. To avoid preconceived perceptions and/or biases, the approach is purely atheoretical, and is based on several new statistical developments in the analysis of causation...|$|R

40|$|For {{the coming}} years, WIFO envisages the {{recovery}} in Europe, and specifically in Austria, {{to be rather}} sluggish in nature. It will be primarily the global economy which {{can be expected to}} deliver the requisite momentum for an upswing, which, however, is subject to considerable risks. Both in the EU average and in Austria, the recovery will stay within modest bounds; on average, real GDP will grow by just 2 percent p. a. over 2001 - 2006 (as against some 2. 5 percent in 1996 - 2001). In Austria, demand in the consumer goods and construction sectors will not keep pace with demand in the export and plant and equipment sectors. Employment will rise perceptively, especially in 2004 - 2006. Unemployment, on the other hand, will decline at an inadequate rate, so that by 2006 the jobless rate could stand at 6. 3 percent of the dependently employed or 3. 7 percent of the economically active population as defined by Eurostat. The public financing deficit is set to fall to some 0. 8 percent of GDP by 2006, helped by the economic recovery.

40|$|In today`s {{manufacturing}} environment, {{systems and}} equipment {{are being asked to}} perform at levels not thought possible a decade ago. The intent is to push process operations, product quality, and equipment reliability, availability, and maintainability to unprecedented levels while maintaining <b>budgetary</b> <b>structures</b> consistent with cost reduction initiatives. In light of this, there is a demand to reduce operational and support costs and eliminate or minimize any new capital investments in plant equipment while increasing process efficiency and revenues. In short, manufacturers are trying to invoke new measures to ensure plant performance while minimizing costs and extending operational life of new and/or aging equipment. The only way this can be accomplished is by developing new and innovating approaches in condition-based maintenance. To achieve this while adhering to strict economic constraints requires the development of new sensors, systems, and methods for interrogating, diagnosing, and controlling systems. The old adage, business as usual, will not suffice in this new way of thinking. What will be required is an investment strategy that mitigates R and D risks by developing economic indicators (operational and costs) that qualify the ability of a proposed technology to meet the functional and operational needs of a process. The strategy must, therefore, internalize a methodology and approach that provides control points in the development and implementation cycle. An integral part of this is an economic model that provides a break-even analysis and sensor and system performance assessment based on the concentration of losses and the ability of a proposed sensor to meet systematic needs. This model then becomes a tool for strategizing continued research and development (R and D) for any proposed technology...|$|R

A modified version of Todaro's distributive share index of social welfare is used to quantify the impacts on the growth of primary budget expenditures of Security, Education, Health, General Administration, Infrastructure, and Social Services. We find that defence expenditures dominate overall security expenditures and are less affected in times of bottlenecks in the economy. A systematic pattern of negative budgetary trade-offs of security expenditures in terms of other components is not identified.

40|$|Options {{for health}} {{financing}} reform are often {{portrayed as a}} choice between general taxation (known as the Beveridge model) and social health insurance (known as the Bismarck model). Ten years of health financing reform in Kyrgyzstan, since the introduction of its compulsory health insurance fund in 1997, provide {{an excellent example of}} why it is wrong to reduce health financing policy to a choice between the Beveridge and Bismarck models. Rather than fragment the system according to the insurance status of the population, as many other low- and middle-income countries have done, the Kyrgyz reforms were guided by the objective of having a single system for the entire population. Key features include the role and gradual development of the compulsory health insurance fund as the single purchaser of health-care services for the entire population using output-based payment methods, the complete restructuring of pooling arrangements from the former decentralized <b>budgetary</b> <b>structure</b> to a single national pool, and the establishment of an explicit benefit package. Central to the process was the transformation of the role of general budget revenues – the main source of public funding for health – from directly subsidizing the supply of services to subsidizing the purchase of services on behalf of the entire population by redirecting them into the health insurance fund. Through their approach to health financing policy, and pooling in particular, the Kyrgyz health reformers demonstrated that different sources of funds can be used in an explicitly complementary manner to enable the creation of a unified, universal system...|$|E
40|$|The article {{argues that}} the Congress’s budget process has invisibly {{influenced}} its legislative activities and structurally skewed its policy choices. The <b>budgetary</b> <b>structure</b> and tools as they affect lawmaking are largely unanalyzed. Until they are widely appreciated, they may often be random, inefficient, unrepresentative, and even deceptive. Review, critique, and change are overdue in any case. Inasmuch as the Congress is now, {{after a period of}} budget anarchy, debating how to refocus on the budget, this is a particularly good time for such activities. The article also argues that additional structures are needed to “counter-balance” both the skewing that results from the current rules and the sheer centrality of the budget in policymaking. In a fundamental way, Congress should review its simplistic focus on the restraint of monetary deficits alone. In the long run, future generations may be equally or better served by the creation of budget-like restraints on non-monetary deficits, such as increased disability, diminished public health, or permanent environmental damage. The structures that have shaped financial decisions in the past may offer solutions to these problems in the future. The article is laid out in four parts. Part One provides a brief historical background of the Congressional budget process, including its roots in Public Choice Theory. Part Two consists of an explanation of four non-obvious concepts essential to understanding the basics of the budget process. Part Three is a series of observations of some serious effects of the process in lawmaking. Part Four lays out suggestions for “counter-balancing” the budget process, including extension some of the Public-Choice remedies to non-monetary measures...|$|E

40|$|It is my {{intention}} {{in this paper}} {{to comment on the}} structure of the budget and on Rhodesian fiscal policy in the light of this <b>budgetary</b> <b>structure.</b> I have two basic observations to make. The first is that the 1972 budget is, in structural terms, entirely as was to be expected and it may, in fact, be interpreted as one further budget which has the effect of maintaining a gradual but consistent regressive shift in the fiscal structure. The second is that the structure is not only regressive, but also fairly rigid, and the budgetary principles that have formed the basis of not only this, but also a succession of budgets prior to this, have had the net effect of reducing the impact of fiscal policy on the general level of economic activity. This second observation should not be interpreted as implying a reduction in the influence of the state in the economy but rather as an implication that other, non-fiscal methods, have been increasingly employed in an effort to achieve desired objectives. Generalisations, by definition, seek to simplify complex situations by reference to dominant characteristics. The test of validity, when applied to generalisations, is not whether simplification obscures detail, but whether this suppression of detail is in fact misleading.

40|$|Purpose: The {{organization}} {{of this article}} was subordinated to the connections between the government program documentation related to the state social objectives and their implementation at the budgetary level. The article shows the necessity of perceiving fiscal policy as an instrument toimplement government programming objectives. The aim of the article is to assess the degree of implementation of social objectives on the basis of information resulting from the experience gained in the area of performance budgeting in Poland. Methodology: To assess the scale of financing of social objectives in Poland in comparison with other European countries, the author used Eurostat data from COFOG (Classification of the Functions of Government). To assess the effectiveness of state operations related to the achievement of social objectives, the author used information from the implementation of the performance-oriented state budget.

40|$|The Austrian {{government}} {{is about to}} introduce a new fiscal management framework. The {{first step is to}} introduce a medium-term budgetary framework, including an expenditure rule. The paper focuses on this first step. The purpose is to describe and evaluate the Austrian model in light of other countries'' experiences with their frameworks. An attempt is made to identify features that have proven to be effective elsewhere and that {{can be applied to the}} Austrian case. The paper also identifies potential challenges and possible trade-offs when implementing the framework.

Tajikistan’s {{previous}} IMF-supported program {{went off}} track in mid- 2001 {{largely because of}} poor progress with structural reform and weak management of external debt. To revitalize the reform process, the authorities satisfactorily implemented a Staff-Monitored Program that covered {{the first half of}} 2002. The IMF staff commends the authorities for the progress in economic areas realized over the past few years, and supports the authorities' request for a new three-year PRGF arrangement.

40|$|Purpose of {{research}} – {{this study examines}} the practice of Working Capital Management (WCM) in an organizational context, specifically Malaysian listed companies. Even though many studies of WCM have been undertaken in many countries around the world, the understanding of WCM practices in an organizational context has neither been adequately documented nor understood. Scholars have largely concentrated on developing sophisticated financial models, however managers need easy to use models (Gitman, Moses, & White, 1979). In the event of changes in organizational context, {{it is argued that}} the failure of WCM research to reflect the characteristics and challenges of contemporary organizational settings has led to a lack of understanding and gives rise to the need for a conceptual framework explaining current WCM practices. This study intends to first develop an understanding of the determinants of the various WCM practices currently used in organizations; and secondly to develop a conceptual framework explaining the dynamics of WCM in a Malaysian context. Design and methodology – this research used multiple-case studies of five Malaysian companies listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia. Key informants, representing various functional areas and hierarchical levels, were interviewed to gained insights about how working capital components were managed within the organizational context. The semi-structured interviews were designed to explore the diversity of WCM practices. Data was analyzed using qualitative methods to gain rich narratives and in-depth understanding of WCM practices for each case, then, cross case analysis enabled this research to develop a conceptual framework. Main finding - this study proposes a conceptual framework to provide a comprehensive understanding of WCM in an organizational context. A conceptual framework was developed based on observed patterns in five determining perspectives from multiple case studies which enabled this study to distinguish two differing WCM approaches, namely integrated and non-integrated WCM approaches. This study suggests that the conditions of these determining perspectives influenced the choice of WCM approach. The five determining perspectives were: perceived environmental uncertainty, <b>budgetary</b> control, organizational <b>structure,</b> interdependency and information technology, and organizational culture. Contribution of study – the conceptual framework adds value to the body of WCM knowledge by identifying how Malaysian companies manage their working capital and describes the dynamics of WCM that have previously not been explained. In terms of managerial practice, this study provides practitioners and academicians views about the influence of determining perspectives over the approach taken in WCM practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{budget for}} the {{administration}} of justice in the State of Maine {{is a study in}} contrasts. During the last two decades, the lack of sufficient dollars appropriated to Maine Judicial Branch and the impact that this underfunding has had on people seeking access to justice have created consistent concerns for leaders in the Judicial Branch as well as for those in the Executive and Legislative Branches. Despite these challenges, however, the administrative structure of the Maine Judicial Branch stands as a model for states across the country. Understanding the genesis of this contrast will be critical to planning for the continued budget challenges ahead. The lack of funding for justice in Maine is not a new problem. Issues of courthouse safety, reduced court hours, and the potential for limiting rural access to justice have been the topics of much public conversation, and the lack of funding has affected every aspect of justice in Maine. For example, the security that is present at the front doors of other states’ courthouses, ensuring that weapons are kept out of the courts, is missing in Maine. Additionally, many court facilities are crumbling from lack of maintenance; many judges type their own opinions late at night {{to keep up with the}} caseload; and our clerks of court are exhausted and barely holding on, as a system that was already understaffed has suffered further from forced vacancies. The harm to Maine people and businesses from this chronic underfunding of justice is also evident in the delayed dockets, in the cramped and dangerous court hallways, and in the small businesses and individuals who must wait months to address the simplest of legal problems. From these problems, one could come away with the impression that Maine government has done a poor job of addressing basic <b>budgetary</b> and administrative <b>structures</b> related to justice. That would be wrong. Although the lack of dollars committed to citizens’ access to justice has, in fact, been a consistent problem, there is much about the organization of Maine’s system of justice, and the methods of spending on justice, that is to be commended. Over the course of almost two centuries, Maine legislators and governors, with the guidance and encouragement of judicial leaders, have steadily streamlined and improved court operations, placing Maine in the national forefront for its achievement of efficiencies in the Judicial Branch. Those efficiencies have allowed the Supreme Judicial Court and the chiefs of the trial courts the flexibility to allocate resources where they are most needed and to keep the courthouse doors open (most of the time) despite devastating reductions in total resources available for Maine’s courts. The bottom line is that, in contrast to the common Maine saying, we did get here from there. Much about the administration of justice in Maine is laudable. The purpose of this Article is to put into context the historical development of Maine’s state court system to create a better understanding of the current fiscal structure of the Judicial Branch and to provide hope for meeting the justice needs of Maine citizens in the future...|$|R
