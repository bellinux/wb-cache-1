Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> {{they could not}} have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those workers who have lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.|$|E

That summer he took a week-long trip to visit Bertha in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he became sick with a cold {{and spent most of}} his time in bed nursed by Bertha, learning that her family would be returning to live in Portland in 1883. After returning from the trip, he continued saving money and in 1884 he decided to continue his education by enrolling at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He chose the school because, as it was only eight years old, it had one of the most modern laboratories available. He took courses in chemistry and biology and learned advanced metallurgic techniques. His mother died in May 1885 and he decided to leave the university without completing his second year, as he was not working to attain a degree but only taking courses of [...] interest.

500|$|Vic Aldridge {{was traded}} to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the 1924 season on October 27, 1924, along with George Grantham and Al Niehaus, for Wilbur Cooper, Charlie Grimm and Rabbit Maranville. The change in stadiums {{prompted}} him to rely more on his fastball than his curveball, as he felt he needed to protect himself from home runs in Wrigley Field and its smaller field, thus using the curveball {{to reduce the risk of}} being homered against, but the larger field in Pittsburgh made fastballs safer to use, and thus a better pitch to rely upon. The next year, Aldridge won fifteen games (ninth highest total in the National League in 1925) and lost seven, for a [...]682 winning percentage that was the fourth highest for any NL pitcher that year. His finest moments were in the postseason that year when he pitched two complete game victories against the Washington Senators as the Pirates won the World Series. He won Game 2 of the series 3–2 on October 8, and Game 5 by a score of 6–3, the first two Pirates wins of the Series. Aldridge used the money from the World Series to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> in Terre Haute, Indiana.|$|E
500|$|Doby {{played a}} major role in Cleveland's World Series victory against the Boston Braves. In Game 4 on October 9, Doby hit the first home run by a black player in World Series history. A picture {{featuring}} an embrace between Doby and white teammate Steve Gromek, who had pitched a complete game that day, was on the cover of the next day's Plain Dealer. Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the photograph [...] "a signature moment in the integration of Major League Baseball." [...] Of the picture, Doby said, [...] "The picture was more rewarding and happy for me than actually hitting the home run. The picture finally showed a moment of a man showing his feelings for me." [...] The Indians defeated the Braves in six games and with it, Cleveland had its first World Series championship since the 1920 season. Doby's [...]318 batting average during the Series led the Indians. Nationally syndicated columnist Grantland Rice argued that without Doby and Gene Bearden, who had won 20 games that year, the Indians would have finished in fourth or fifth place. After the Series, Doby received a celebratory parade in Paterson, New Jersey, and during the offseason he, along with other teammates, appeared in the 1949 film The Kid From Cleveland. With additional income available due to the post-season run and Series championship, Doby and his wife attempted to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> in Paterson in an all-white neighborhood but were kept out by a petition from members of the community. The Dobys were allowed to purchase their desired home when the Paterson city mayor intervened on their behalf.|$|E

2500|$|Suburbs in the Los Angeles area grew explosively {{as black}} {{residents}} were desperate {{to live in}} peaceful white neighborhoods. [...] In a thinly-veiled attempt to sustain {{their way of life}} and maintain the general peace and prosperity, most of these suburbs barred black people using a variety of methods. [...] This provided an opportunity for white people in neighborhoods bordering black districts to leave en masse to the suburbs. The spread of African Americans throughout urban Los Angeles was achieved in large part through blockbusting, a technique whereby real estate speculators would <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> on an all-white street, sell or rent it to a black family, and then buy up the remaining homes from Caucasians at cut-rate prices, then sell them to housing-hungry black families at hefty profits.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "thrift" [...] or [...] "building" [...] or [...] "savings {{and loans}} associations" [...] {{industry}} has {{its origins in}} the British building society movement {{that emerged in the}} late 18th century. American thrifts (known then as [...] "building and loans" [...] or [...] "B") shared many of the same basic goals: to help the working class save for the future and purchase homes. Thrifts were not-for-profit cooperative organizations that were typically managed by the membership and local institutions that served well-defined groups of aspiring homeowners. While banks offered a wide array of products to individuals and businesses, thrifts often made only home mortgages primarily to working-class men and women. Thrift leaders believed {{they were part of a}} broader social reform effort and not a financial industry. According to thrift leaders, B not only helped people become better citizens by making it easier to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>home,</b> they also taught the habits of systematic savings and mutual cooperation which strengthened personal morals.|$|E
2500|$|The {{area had}} longstanding de facto {{segregation}} as a whites-only neighborhood. In 1954, black Korean War veteran and electrician Andrew Wade IV {{and his wife}} Charlotte, who had found themselves unable to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>home</b> in a suburban neighborhood due to Jim Crow housing discrimination, got help from activists Carl and Anne Braden. The Wades selected a house in Shively {{that they wanted to}} buy, and the Bradens bought it on their behalf and deeded it over to them. Soon afterwards, the Wades' home was repeatedly attacked—including cross burning on an adjacent lot, rocks through their windows, rifle shots into the house, and ultimately a dynamite bomb that exploded under their daughter's bedroom while they were in the home (although no one was injured). The news made national headlines and {{was the subject of a}} 1958 memoir published by Anne Braden, The Wall Between. No one was ever convicted of the crime, and the Bradens were charged with sedition for their actions. Carl Braden was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison—spending seven months there before state-level sedition convictions were overturned by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a related case in 1956. After the bombing, the Wades left and very few other blacks attempted to move in, and the community remained a largely white [...] "sundown town" [...] well into the 1960s. In the 1970s onwards, the segregation would erode, to the point where Shively now has approximately a 30% black population, according to U.S. Census records—a greater percentage than in the Louisville metropolitan area as a whole, and more than double the percentage in the U.S. population as a whole.|$|E
