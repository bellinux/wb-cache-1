The Lions came back with a 1-yard TD run by Reggie Bush, on a drive that featured a key 54-yard pass from Stafford to Calvin Johnson, cutting the lead to 27-24.

Stafford then hit Calvin Johnson with a 22-yard pass on the next play that got the ball to the Dallas 1, but the clock was still running.

30|$|During embryogenesis, {{reciprocal}} {{interactions between}} the oral epithelium and neural crest-derived ectomesenchyme lead to the initial formation of dental placode and afterward guide {{the building of a}} tooth through sequential morphogenetic events, i.e. bud, <b>cap,</b> <b>bell</b> (Cobourne et al. 2014). This tooth patterning involves a strictly spatio-temporal control of signaling pathways that sustain the interdependent inductive interactions, that is signal exchanges between epithelial and mesenchymal cells (Thesleff 2003). Epithelial cells are at the root of enamel-forming ameloblasts. Ectomesenchymal cells give rise to (i) odontoblasts, which synthesize the dentin extracellular matrix, and (ii) dental pulp cells assuming tooth homeostasis. During tooth organogenesis, odontogenic signals first emanate from the dental epithelium. Then, dental mesenchyme generates signals promoting the maturation of developing ameloblasts. Conceptually, tooth regeneration can thus be approached by taking into account these reciprocal epithelio-mesenchymal interactions.|$|R
