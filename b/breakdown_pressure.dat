We find that the Lagrange approach to estimating constrained likelihood, necessary for inference, often performs poorly. We introduce a penalized likelihood method and it appears to always work well. We use third order likelihood methods to partially offset the issue of small samples. The proposed method is applied to draw inferences on reliability in stress-strength problems with independent exponentiated exponential distributions.

The players showed no increase in generic or episodic knowledge, remained robust under secondary task load, and were unable to differentiate between pre- and post-test video footage of their shots.

We independently examine the influence of in-situ stress ratio, injection rate and fluid viscosity on hydraulic fracturing.

With the increase of stress ratio, the fracture aperture increases almost linearly; with the increase of injection rate and fluid viscosity, the fracture aperture and <b>breakdown</b> <b>pressure</b> increase obviously. A low value of product of injection rate and fluid viscosity (i. e., Qμ) will lead to narrow fracture aperture, low <b>breakdown</b> <b>pressure,</b> and complex or dispersional hydraulic fractures.

Temporal development of the <b>breakdown</b> in low <b>pressure</b> discharges with gaps of the order of 1 cm has been used as the common ground to elucidate details of the breakdown and how one needs to supplement the basic Townsend theory in order to represent the complete phenomenology. In that respect modeling of secondary electron emission including all possible channels is required.

Both require recording and modeling of Volt-Ampere characteristics (V-I) in addition to the Paschen curves. Extrapolation of these results to micro discharges appears to be nontrivial because of the often recorded constant low voltages on the left hand side of the Paschen curve. The dominant processes may be established from the V-I characteristics and observations of emission profiles, if not for the smallest of the micro discharges but for the intermediate sub-millimeter discharges.

40|$|Rock {{formations}} in Glutenite reservoirs typically display {{highly variable}} lithology and permeability, low and complex porosity, and significant heterogeneity. It {{is difficult to}} predict the pathway of hydraulic fractures in such rock formations. To capture the complex hydraulic fractures in rock masses, a numerical code called Rock Failure Process Analysis (RFPA 2 D) is introduced. Based {{on the characteristics of}} a typical Glutenite reservoir in China, a series of 2 D numerical simulations on the hydraulic fractures in a small-scale model are conducted. The initiation, propagation and associated stress evolution of the hydraulic fracture during the failure process, which cannot be observed in experimental tests, are numerically simulated. Based on the numerical results, the hydraulic fracturing path and features are illustrated and discussed in detail. The influence of the confining stress ratio, gravel sizes (indicated by the diameter variation), and gravel volume content (VC) on the hydraulic fracturing pattern in a conglomerate specimen are numerically investigated, and the <b>breakdown</b> <b>pressure</b> is quantified as a function of these variables. Five hydraulic fracturing modes are identified: termination, deflection, branching (bifurcation), penetration, and attraction. The propagation trajectory of the primary hydraulic fractures is determined by the maximum and minimum stress ratios, although the fracturing path on local scales is clearly influenced by the presence of gravels in the conglomerate, particularly when the gravels are relatively large. As the stress ratio increases, the fractures typically penetrate through the gravels completely rather than propagating around the gravels, and the <b>breakdown</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases with increasing stress ratio.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} is {{a useful}} tool for enhancing rock mass permeability for shale gas development, enhanced geothermal systems, and geological carbon sequestration by the high-pressure injection of a fracturing fluid into tight reservoir rocks. Although significant advances have been made in hydraulic fracturing theory, experiments, and numerical modeling, {{when it comes to the}} complexity of geological conditions knowledge is still limited. Mechanisms of fluid injection-induced fracture initiation and propagation should be better understood to take full advantage of hydraulic fracturing. This paper presents the development and application of discrete particle modeling based on two-dimensional particle flow code (PFC 2 D). Firstly, it is shown that the modeled value of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>pressure</b> for the hydraulic fracturing process is approximately equal to analytically calculated values under varied in situ stress conditions. Furthermore, a series of simulations for hydraulic fracturing in competent rock was performed to examine the influence of the in situ stress ratio, fluid injection rate, and fluid viscosity on the borehole pressure history, the geometry of hydraulic fractures, and the pore-pressure field, respectively. It was found that the hydraulic fractures in an isotropic medium always propagate parallel to the orientation of the maximum principal stress. When a high fluid injection rate is used, higher <b>breakdown</b> <b>pressure</b> is needed for fracture propagation and complex geometries of fractures can develop. When a low viscosity fluid is used, fluid can more easily penetrate from the borehole into the surrounding rock, which causes a reduction of the effective stress and leads to a lower <b>breakdown</b> <b>pressure.</b> Moreover, the geometry of the fractures is not particularly sensitive to the fluid viscosity in the approximate isotropic model...|$|E
