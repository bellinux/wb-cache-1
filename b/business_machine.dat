2500|$|As {{the more}} {{versatile}} combination of personal computers and printers became commonplace, and computer software applications for word processing became popular, most <b>business</b> <b>machine</b> companies stopped manufacturing dedicated word processor machines. As of 2009 {{there were only}} two U.S. companies, Classic and AlphaSmart, which still made them. Many older machines, however, remain in use. Since 2009, Sentinel has offered a machine described as a [...] "word processor", but it is more accurately a highly specialised microcomputer used for accounting and publishing.|$|E
2500|$|The post-war years led to {{continued}} rapid company expansion under James Rand, Jr.'s leadership. The Remington Rand plant at Elmira, New York, became the largest <b>business</b> <b>machine</b> manufacturing {{plant in the}} world. [...] Wishing {{to build on the}} company’s expertise in business machines and showing remarkable foresight, Rand pushed the company into purchasing the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in 1950. Founders J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly had conceived and designed the world’s first purely electronic, Turing-complete, digital computer in 1946. [...] They founded Eckert-Mauchly in 1947, and developed the BINAC computer shortly thereafter. Remington Rand purchase the company in March 1950.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, it was {{announced}} that {{over the course of the}} previous eight months, Buffett had bought 64 million shares of International <b>Business</b> <b>Machine</b> Corp (IBM) stock, worth around $11 billion. This unanticipated investment raised his stake in the company to around 5.5 percent—the largest stake in IBM alongside that of State Street Global Advisors. Buffett had said on numerous prior occasions that he would not invest in technology because he did not fully understand it, so the move came as a surprise to many investors and observers. During the interview, in which he revealed the investment to the public, Buffett stated that he was impressed by the company's ability to retain corporate clients and said, [...] "I don't know of any large company that really has been as specific on what they intend to do and how they intend to do it as IBM." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 14 May 1992, The KLF {{announced}} their immediate retirement {{from the music}} industry and the deletion of their entire back catalogue, an act which associate Scott Piering described as [...] " [...] away a fortune". As when he left WEA, Drummond issued an enigmatic press release, this time talking of a [...] "wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path" [...] he and Cauty had been following [...] "...these past five years. The last two of which has [...] led us up onto the commercial high ground—we are {{at a point where}} the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what." [...] There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was {{at the edge of a}} nervous breakdown. Vox Magazine wrote, for example, that 1992 was [...] "the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when The KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music <b>business,</b> ... <b>machine</b> gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony."

60|$|Brilliantly educated {{she always}} has been. At {{eighteen}} she speaks {{two or three}} languages, and has forgotten {{more than the average}} Englishwoman has ever read. Hitherto, this education has been utterly useless to her. On marriage she has retired into the kitchen, and made haste to clear her brain of everything else, in order to leave room for bad cooking. But suppose it begins to dawn upon her that a woman need not sacrifice her whole existence to household drudgery any more than a man need make himself nothing else than a <b>business</b> <b>machine.</b> Suppose she develop an ambition {{to take part in the}} social and national life. Then the influence of such a partner, healthy in body and therefore vigorous in mind, is bound to be both lasting and far-reaching.|$|E
6000|$|But {{there could}} be no mistaking the quality of Sir Isaac's [...] "International" [...] {{organization}} as Susan's dabs of speech shaped it out. It was indeed what we all of us see everywhere about us, the work of the base energetic mind, raw and untrained, in possession of the keen instruments of civilization, the peasant mind allied and blended with the Ghetto mind, grasping and acquisitive, clever as a Norman peasant or a Jew pedlar is clever, and beyond that outrageously stupid and ugly. It was a new view and yet the old familiar view of her husband, but now she saw him not as little eager eyes, a sharp nose, gaunt gestures and a leaden complexion, but as shops and stores and rules and cash registers and harsh advertisements and a driving merciless hurry to get--to get anything and everything, money, monopoly, power, prominence, whatever any other human being seemed to admire or seemed to find desirable, a lust rather than a living soul. Now that her eyes were at last opened Lady Harman, who had seen too little heretofore, now saw too much; she saw all that she had not seen, with an excess of vision, monstrous, caricatured. Susan had already dabbed in the disaster of Sir Isaac's unorganized competitors going to the wall--for charity or the state to neglect or bandage as it might chance--the figure of that poor little [...] "Father," [...] moping hopelessly before his [...] "accident" [...] symbolized that; and now she gave in vivid splotches of allusion, glimpses of the <b>business</b> <b>machine</b> that had replaced those shattered enterprises and carried Sir Isaac to the squalid glory of a Liberal honours list,--the carefully balanced antagonisms and jealousies of the girls and the manageresses, those manageresses who had been obliged to invest little bunches of savings as guarantees and who had to account for every crumb and particle of food stock that came to the branch, and the hunt for cases and inefficiency by the inspectors, who had somehow to justify a salary of two hundred a year, not to mention a percentage of the fines they inflicted.|$|E

Dashew <b>Business</b> <b>Machines</b> produced a variety of machines that embossed identification tags for the military and other industrial uses, including imprinters, which, when combined with the unique embossing machines, formed the foundation for today's credit card industry.
