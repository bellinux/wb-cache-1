500|$|What Separates Me from You {{received}} generally favorable reviews. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic said, [...] " [...] is whiney, petulant, immature, hopeless, {{and thoroughly}} addicting, as the ten songs {{contained within the}} gatefold packaging [...] are as immaculately crafted and engaging as they are blindingly self-absorbed."

500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something a little sad about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

[...] Author Michael DeAngelis describes the theme as being [...] "pride and faithfulness to the individual and authentic self." [...] DeAngelis notes that this theme had particular resonance at the time, when the gay community {{was in the process of}} [...] "coming out" [...] and a general cultural obsession was finding healthy ways to feel good about oneself. [...] Author Frédéric Martel identifies [...] "I Am What I Am" [...] as one of five Village People songs that were touchstones to the gay movement in France when they came out ("San Francisco (You've Got Me)," [...] "Macho Man," [...] "Y.M.C.A."

500|$|Paul Gray {{wrote in}} a review in Time that the {{documents}} that make up Shikasta allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective [...] "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute".

Gray said that Shikasta is closer to Gulliver's Travels and the Old Testament {{than it is to}} Buck Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her [...] "space fiction" [...] as [...] "science fiction". He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans [...] "could not... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little [...] "unsatisfying", <b>but</b> added that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, [...] "even furiously engaging on every page". Gray called Shikasta [...] "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".|$|R
30|$|The paper survey {{indicated}} that 74.1 % of respondents treated water before drinking it, and the interviews substantiate this finding but also reveal some {{skepticism about the}} effectiveness with which home treatment is administered. Of 19 interviewees, 14 were familiar with home water treatment methods, four {{did not mention the}} subject in their interview, and only one interviewee (a resident of Leogane) was not familiar with home water treatment. Fourteen interviewees stated that they treat their water before drinking, though one individual also relayed that some people “drink from the well without treating it.” Three interviewees viewed home water treatment as a solution to the water problem, and only one person did not think it was an appropriate solution. However, even those with a favorable view of home treatment may still be interested in a centralized water supply. One local explained his preferred solution: “divert the water into people’s homes. The water would be treated <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>if</b> it wasn't <b>you</b> could treat it at home.” In the post-workshop survey, > 90 % of participants {{indicated that}} it is important (Likert score 4.87, see Table  4) that training and support be provided for people to treat water at home so it is safe to drink.|$|R

60|$|Given {{these two}} prime luxuries, {{the nature of}} the country where we are to live is, I had almost said, indifferent; after that inside the garden, we can {{construct}} a country of our own. Several old trees, a considerable variety of level, several well-grown hedges to divide our garden into provinces, a good extent of old well-set turf, and thickets of shrubs and ever-greens to be cut into and cleared at the new owner’s pleasure, are the qualities to be sought for in your chosen land. Nothing is more delightful than a succession of small lawns, opening one out of the other through tall hedges; these have all the charm of the old bowling-green repeated, do not require the labour of many trimmers, and afford a series of changes. You must have much lawn against the early summer, so as to have a great field of daisies, the year’s morning frost; as you must have a wood of lilacs, to enjoy to the full the period of their blossoming. Hawthorn is another of the Spring’s ingredients; <b>but</b> it is <b>even</b> best to have a rough public lane at one side of your enclosure which, at the right season, shall become an avenue of bloom and odour. The old flowers are the best and should grow carelessly in corners. Indeed, the ideal fortune is to find an old garden, once very richly cared for, since sunk into neglect, and to tend, not repair, that neglect; it will thus have a smack of nature and wildness which skilful dispositions cannot overtake. The gardener should be an idler, and have a gross partiality to the kitchen plots: an eager or toilful gardener misbecomes the garden landscape; a tasteful gardener will be ever meddling, will keep the borders raw, and take the bloom off nature. Close adjoining, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are in the south, an olive-yard, if in the north, a swarded apple-orchard reaching to the stream, completes your miniature domain; but this is perhaps best entered through a door in the high fruit-wall; so that you close the door behind you on your sunny plots, your hedges and evergreen jungle, when you go down to watch the apples falling in the pool. It is a golden maxim to cultivate the garden for the nose, and the eyes will take care of themselves. Nor must the ear be forgotten: without birds a garden is a prison-yard. There is a garden near Marseilles on a steep hill-side, walking by which, upon a sunny morning, your ear will suddenly be ravished with a burst of small and very cheerful singing: some score of cages being set out there to sun their occupants. This is a heavenly surprise to any passer-by; but the price paid, to keep so many ardent and winged creatures from their liberty, will make the luxury too dear for any thoughtful pleasure-lover. There is only one sort of bird that I can tolerate caged, though even then I think it hard, and that is what is called in France the Bec-d’Argent. I once had two of these pigmies in captivity; and in the quiet, hire house upon a silent street where I was then living, their song, which was not much louder than a bee’s, but airily musical, kept me in a perpetual good humour. I put the cage upon my table when I worked, carried it with me when I went for meals, and kept it by my head at night: the first thing in the morning, these maestrini would pipe up. <b>But</b> these, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can pardon their imprisonment, are for the house. In the garden the wild birds must plant a colony, a chorus of the lesser warblers that should be almost deafening, a blackbird in the lilacs, a nightingale down the lane, so that you must stroll to hear it, and yet a little farther, tree-tops populous with rooks.|$|R
