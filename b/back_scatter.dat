40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} if 3  year treatment of hypercholesterolaemia with simvastatin causes {{an increase of}} lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  METHODS— 160 patients with hypercholesterolaemia in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4 S) were followed for 3  years. Half (80) of the patients took simvastatin and half (80) received placebo. The lens was photographed with a Topcon SL- 45 slit lamp camera {{at the beginning and}} at 1  year intervals. A common lens nuclear area was used for measuring lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b>  RESULTS—Nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased with age and there was more pronounced scattering in women than in men. Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> did not differ significantly between the simvastatin and placebo groups, but the power was low (0. 2). Lens nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> increased during the study period independently of baseline <b>back</b> <b>scattering,</b> age, and sex for both groups.  CONCLUSION—Although no significant difference was found between the simvastatin and placebo groups, the currently available data are insufficient for exclusion of the possibility that taking simvastatin during a 3  year period increases nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b> However, a possible minor increase of nuclear <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> is clinically irrelevant considering known beneficial effects of simvastatin on coronary heart disease. ...|$|R

The OFDR system provides information on the local characteristic only when the backscatter signal detected during the entire measurement time is measured {{as a function of}} frequency in a complex fashion, and then subjected to Fourier transformation. The essential principles of OFDR technology are the quasi continuous wave mode employed by the laser and the narrow-band detection of the optical <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> signal. This is offset by the technically difficult measurement of the Raman scatter light and rather complex signal processing, due to the FFT calculation with higher linearity requirements for the electronic components.|$|E

The opening paragraph of their letter of concern reads: [...] "We, a number of University of California, San Francisco faculty, are writing—see attached memo—to call your attention to our concerns about the potential serious health risks of the recently adopted whole body <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> X-ray airport security scanners.

In the 1960s, Dr. Fried published a series of papers on the optical effects of atmospheric turbulence that provided much of the analytic foundations {{for the development of}} adaptive optics systems, and that resulted in the definition of the quantity now known as Fried’s parameter. In addition, his 1966 paper, [...] "Limiting Resolution Looking Down Through the Atmosphere," [...] was important in showing a basic limit, about five centimeters, to how sharply space-based telescopes can image objects on the ground. In 1981, Dr. Fried carried out the first analysis evaluating and establishing the feasibility of the use of atmospheric laser <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> to control adaptive optics—a concept which now goes by the name of laser guide-star. He then designed, managed the development of the hardware for, and supervised an experiment that successfully demonstrated the validity of the laser guide-star concept.|$|E

Cellulose paper is strongly excited with UV, followed by blue, generating blue to green emissions [83]. Therefore an unwanted background autofluorescence, along with paper’s reflection (<b>back</b> <b>scattering),</b> must be addressed.

50|$|Thin non-resonant or broad {{resonance}} coatings can {{be modeled}} with a Leontovich impedance boundary condition (see also Electrical impedance). This is {{the ratio of}} the tangential electric field to the tangential magnetic field on the surface, and ignores fields propagating along the surface within the coating. This is particularly convenient when using boundary element method calculations. The surface impedance can be calculated and tested separately.For an isotropic surface the ideal surface impedance is equal to the 377 ohm impedance of free space.For non-isotropic (anisotropic) coatings, the optimal coating depends on the shape of the target and the radar direction, but duality, the symmetry of Maxwell's equations between the electric and magnetic fields, tells one that optimal coatings have η0 × η1 = 3772 Ω2, where η0 and η1 are perpendicular components of the anisotropic surface impedance, aligned with edges and/or the radar direction.A perfect electric conductor has more <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> from a leading edge for the linear polarization with the electric field parallel to the edge and more from a trailing edge with the electric field perpendicular to the edge, so the high surface impedance should be parallel to leading edges and perpendicular to trailing edges, for the greatest radar threat direction, with some sort of smooth transition between.|$|E
40|$|Backscatter radio {{wireless}} communication by modulating signals scattered from a radio frequency transponder (RF tag) is {{fundamentally different from}} conventional radio because it involves two distinct links: the power-up (forward) link for powering the passive RF tags, and the <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> (return) link for the describing <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> communication. Because of severe power limitations on the RF tag such as chip sensitivity, antenna gain, antenna polarization and impedance match, a thorough knowledge of the <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> channel is necessary to maximize back scatter-radio andradio-frequency identification (RFID) system performance.

40|$|A {{dissipative}} scale-similarity subgrid {{model was}} recently proposed {{in which only}} the dissipative part of the subgrid stresses {{was added to the}} momentum equations. This was achieved by adding the gradient of a subgrid stress only when its sign agreed with that of the corresponding viscous term. In the present work, this idea is used the other way around as forcing in hybrid large eddy simulation-Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes: only the part of a subgrid stress term that corresponds to <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> is added to the momentum equations. The forcing triggers resolved turbulence in the transition region between the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large eddy simulation regions. The new approach is evaluated for fully developed channel flow at Re(tau) = 4000. It is found that the forcing indeed does increase the resolved turbulence in the transition region. The magnitude of the production (i. e. <b>back</b> <b>scatter)</b> due to forcing in the equation for resolved kinetic energy is of the order of that due to the usual strain-rate production term. The present approach of using <b>back</b> <b>scatter</b> from a scale-similarity model can also probably be useful for triggering transition...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper Mishchenko asserts that soil {{particles}} are strongly forward scattering, whereas particles on {{the surfaces of}} objects {{in the solar system}} have been inferred to be <b>back</b> <b>scattering.</b> Mishchenko suggests that this apparent discrepancy is an artifact caused by using an approximate light scattering model to analyse the data, and that planetary regolith particles are actually strong forward scatterers. The purpose of the present paper is to point out the errors in Mishchenko's paper and to show from both theoretical arguments and experimental data that inhomogencous composite particles which are large compared to the wavelength of visible light, such as rock fragments and agglutinates, can be strongly <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> and are the fundamental scatterers in media composed of them. Such particles appear to be abundant in planetary regoliths and can account for the <b>back</b> <b>scattering</b> character of the surfaces of many bodies in the solar system. If the range of phase angles covered by a data set is insufficient, serious errors in retrieving the particle scattering properties can result whether an exact or approximate scattering model is used.
