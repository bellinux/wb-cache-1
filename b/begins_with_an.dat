5|$|Synchronization Pattern: A USB packet <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> 8-bit {{synchronization}} sequence, 00000001₂. That is, {{after the}} initial idle state J, the data lines toggle KJKJKJKK. The final 1bit (repeated Kstate) {{marks the end of}} the sync pattern {{and the beginning of the}} USB frame. For high-bandwidth USB, the packet begins with a 32-bit synchronization sequence.|$|E
5|$|The book <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{introduction}} by the editor Carol Serling {{and ends with}} brief biographies of all the authors. Each of the 19 self-contained short stories includes an introduction and conclusion with the same tone and style as Rod Serling's narration {{at the beginning and}} end of each Twilight Zone episode.|$|E
50|$|Kierkegaard's pseudonymous works <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> preface. Fear and Trembling <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Preface by Johannes de silentio.

5000|$|At {{the level}} of pronunciation, Arapaho words cannot <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, so where the {{underlying}} form of <b>a</b> word <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, a prothetic [...] is added.|$|R
5|$|The first {{movement}} {{follows the}} standard {{outline of a}} sonata form concerto movement of the Classical period. It <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> orchestral exposition, which {{is followed by a}} solo exposition, a development section, a recapitulation, a cadenza and a coda. Within this conventional outline, Mozart engages in extensive structural innovation.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II is set {{one hundred}} years after Dragon Quest. The story <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon, who seeks to summon the demon Malroth to destroy the world. A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs {{the king of the}} attack before he dies. The king then {{commands}} his son, who is a descendant of Erdrick (known as Loto in Japanese translations and later localizations), to defeat Hargon.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aesthetic}} {{involved with the}} poetry goes much farther {{back in time and}} is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of text to film, Kiarostami often <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike in most Arabic dialects, Egyptian Arabic {{has many}} words that logically <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel (e.g. [...] 'I'), in {{addition}} to words that logically <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glottal stop (e.g. [...] 'very', from Classical [...] 'strong'). When pronounced in isolation, both types of words will be sounded <b>with</b> <b>an</b> initial glottal stop. However, when following another word, words <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel will often follow smoothly after the previous word, while words <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> glottal stop will always have the glottal stop sounded, e.g.: ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the music}} video, it <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{out-of-focus}} view of Wade, seemingly alone, coming {{up a hill}} towards the camera. When he stops and starts singing, the camera comes into focus and the other band members come out from behind him and start lip-synching his vocals. A group of people (In which {{one of them is}} YouTube star, Wendy McColm) pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video. The video's effects allow people to seemingly appear out of nowhere throughout the video.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the iconic}} {{aspects of a}} typical James Bond film were {{established}} in Dr. No: the film <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> introduction to the character through the view of a gun barrel and a highly stylised main title sequence, both created by Maurice Binder. Production designer Ken Adam established an elaborate visual style {{that is one of}} the hallmarks of the film series.|$|E
5|$|SR 115 <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{interchange}} at I-8. It then heads northwest {{through the}} community of Date City and briefly enters the city of Holtville. Near its exit of the city, it intersects a few county roads before turning due north and continuing through rural Imperial County, eventually beginning an overlap with SR 78 and continuing west. East of Alamorio, SR 115 turns due north again, and intersects CR S26. After a few miles, the highway turns due west, reaching its north end in Calipatria at SR 111.|$|E
50|$|Various {{programming}} languages including Prolog, Haskell, Ruby and Go treat identifiers <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{capital letter}} differently from identifiers <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small letter, a practice {{related to the}} use of sigils.|$|R
50|$|The Meditation <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{rational}} moral comparison {{and proceeds}} to a frenzy of increasingly unlikely comparisons. While the satire <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pitch-perfect imitation of the kindly Boyles tone, it ends in a frantic, misanthropistic and misognynistic note of despair and nihilism. Also, while it <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hopeful call to self-examination, it moves eventually into a condemnation of all efforts at improvement.|$|R
50|$|The object prefix has a consonantal and syllabic (in parentheses) form: the consonantal form appears before <b>a</b> verb <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, and the syllabic form appears before <b>a</b> verb <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant.|$|R
5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman. This {{is followed by}} eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries {{began to see the}} tactic of targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|The first barcarolle was {{dedicated}} to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. Caroline Montigny-Rémaury) and premiered by Saint-Saëns at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique in 1882. The piece <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in 6/8 time. It develops into a more elaborate form before {{the introduction of the}} second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass. Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
50|$|Khwarshi verbs {{normally}} {{consist of}} a stem, an agreement prefix indicating noun class and number of the relevant nouns, and a suffix showing tense, aspect, mood, or the like. Only about one fourth of the Khwarshi verbs show agreement, all of them <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel. There is {{a small number of}} verbs <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel that do not show agreement. Verbs <b>beginning</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant do not show agreement.|$|R
50|$|For {{words that}} <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> vowel, {{emphatic}} stress {{falls on the}} first syllable that <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> consonant or on the initial syllable with the insertion of a glottal stop or a liaison consonant.|$|R

5|$|Thomas Aquinas's hymn O salutaris Hostia {{has been}} used in mass {{settings}} close to the Agnus Dei from the Renaissance. It was set to music in the 18th century by Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, Henry Madin, and Jean-Paul-Égide Martini, and by Franz Liszt in the 19th century. Rossini uses the first four lines (out of eight). The melodic line of the soprano soloist <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> upward broken seventh chord.|$|E
5|$|Commencement weekend {{begins on}} Friday {{afternoon}} {{as members of}} the senior class gather in the upper church of Saint Anselm Abbey for the annual honors convocation. The senior academic honors convocation <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> invocation, said by the Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey, and is followed by the conferral of academic awards, read by the Dean of the College. Virtually every academic department has an award to present to a senior of that major. Next the President of the college awards each Summa Cum Laude graduate; within this elite group the Chancellor's medal is awarded to the graduate with the highest academic grade point average.|$|E
5|$|Confusion is a one-song Afrobeat {{album that}} <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> entirely {{instrumental}} first half, which features free form interplay between Kuti's electric piano and drummer Tony Allen. It {{leads to an}} extended mid-tempo section with Allen's polyrhythms and tenor saxophone by Kuti, who subsequently delivers call-and-response vocal passages. In reviews since the record's release by EMI, the album was praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog. In both 2000 and 2010, Confusion was reissued and bundled with Kuti's 1973 Gentleman album.|$|E

5|$|The episode <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{announcement}} by Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) on television {{that he plans}} to travel to outer space, and is willing to pay up to thirty million dollars to do so. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to help Tracy with his dream of traveling in space, promising to call his friends at NASA. Instead of doing this, however, he asks The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to create a fake space experience for Tracy. Pete and the TGS crew construct a model space shuttle and place Tracy in it after disorienting him by flying him in a helicopter blindfolded. The deception is a success, and Tracy believes that he is, in fact, flying in space.|$|E
5|$|The film <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> {{episode in}} 1279AD, when the {{successor}} {{of the last}} great Chola Emperor, pending invasion, sends his people to a mystery location, to survive the threat. The story resumes with an archaeologist, a coolie {{and a member of}} the army going in search of the archaeologist's father to the ruined city that was the place the exiled Chola Prince retreated to. An expedition is promptly arranged, and on the course they stumble on the lost Chola civilization and its king and find unexplained links between them and the culture. The shocking events and the problems that arise forms the crux of the story.|$|E
5|$|The report {{typically}} <b>begins</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> introduction, summarising {{the most}} significant birds occurring during the year, and discussing any current issues relating to the committee's work. This {{is followed by a}} list of accepted records in taxonomic sequence. Records for each taxon are listed by county, followed by comments about its occurrence during the year. Late-accepted records and decisions to reject a previously identified record are included. This section of the report contains painted illustrations and photographs of some of the birds. The report lists records that have not been accepted, often noting {{the most significant}} that remain under consideration.|$|E
