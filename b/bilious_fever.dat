Within months of Lucy's birth, she was stricken with an unknown illness. Stanton put aside his work and spent the summer at baby Lucy's bedside. She died in late 1841. Edwin, however, was healthy and active. The boy's birth refreshed the spirits in the Stanton household after baby Lucy's death. However, grief would return once again to the Stanton household in 1844. Mary Stanton was left bedridden by a <b>bilious</b> <b>fever.</b> Her condition continued to worsen until she died in March 1844. Stanton's sorrow [...] "verged on insanity", say historians Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman. He had Mary's burial attire redone repeatedly, as he demanded she look {{just as she had}} when they were wed seven years prior. In the evenings, Stanton would emerge from his room with his eyes filled with tears and search the house frantically with a lamp, all the while asking, [...] "Where is Mary?" ...|$|E

Coles had left Illinois on election day believing he had lost, and received the news of his victory while in Virginia recovering from <b>bilious</b> <b>fever.</b> He accordingly cleared up his land office accounts in Washington, D.C. and returned to Illinois. Madison sent him a package containing a pedometer, and a note, [...] "As you are about to assume new motives to walk in a straight path, and with measured steps, I wish you to accept the little article enclosed, as a type of the course I am sure you will pursue, and as a token of the affection I have so long cherished for you." ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 96 - 100) The American South in {{the nineteenth}} century was plagued by diseases, including malarial <b>fevers,</b> <b>bilious</b> <b>fevers,</b> and the deadly yellow fever. This study examines how the river-port city of Natchez, Mississippi, the urban hub of a vast slave-plantation hinterland, coped with the yellow-fever epidemics that plagued its people in the 1850 s. It attempts to place the city???s efforts to deal with yellow fever {{in the context of the}} fever???s medical and scientific history before and after the decade in question. The study???s central thesis contends that the white population of Natchez coped with yellow fever in ways shaped and influenced by (1) conventional medical reasoning and prevailing medical ignorance; (2) local concerns rooted in the town???s slave-based, mercantile economy; and (3) the failure of its citizens to abide by even the best, though ill-informed, practices of the day in combating the disease. As a case study, it treats white Natchez as a microcosm of the small-town, slave enshrouded South in the decade leading up to the Civil War...|$|R
40|$|Lantana camara is {{more popular}} as toxic weed rather than {{medicinal}} plant {{in most of}} the countries responsible for infesting pastures, grazing lands, orchards and crops like, tea, coffee, oil palm, coconut and cotton, and reduces the economic viability of the crops. This plant can grow in even in extreme harsh climatic conditions of tropical and sub-tropical areas and has become naturalized worldwide as an ornamental plant including India. The stem, root and leaves contain many of the bioactive compounds responsible for various therapeutic applications such as cancers, chicken pox, measles, asthma, ulcers, swellings, eczema, tumors, high blood pressure, <b>bilious</b> <b>fevers,</b> catarrhal infections, tetanus, rheumatism, malaria, antiseptic, antispasmodic, carminative and diaphoretic.

60|$|This {{long period}} is little checquered with events.

But, {{at the end of}} that time, the loss of his sister gave a shock to his spirits, which they did not speedily recover. That she was a lady of superior talents is probable, from her having been admitted to a friendship and correspondence with Mrs. Montague, then Miss Robinson.

40|$|Abstract Background Stump {{appendicitis}} is {{a delayed}} complication of appendectomy. It is rare and few cases {{reported in the}} paediatric literature. The authors report on another case in a child {{and focus on the}} diagnostic peculiarities of this entity. Case A 9 -year-old boy with previous history of open appendectomy was admitted for a right lower quadrant pain with <b>bilious</b> vomiting and <b>fever.</b> Physical examination demonstrated tenderness in the right lower quadrant and guarding over the appendectomy scar. The white blood cell count was 23. 500 cells/mm 3. Plain abdominal radiograph and ultrasonography revealed fecalith localized in the right iliac fossa. The diagnosis of stump appendicitis was advocated and confirmed at laparotomy. A gangrenous and perforated appendiceal stump was found and completely removed. The post-operative course was uneventful after 18 months follow-up period. Conclusion Stump appendicitis is rare and should be considered in any patient with right lower quadrant pain even if there is a history of appendectomy. Complete removal of the appendix is the only mean to prevent the occurrence of this complication. </p...|$|R

[...] After much {{consideration}} and conference with Herbert (who has had an [...] attack of <b>bilious</b> <b>fever</b> and could not come down, though much better, [...] and soon, I hope, to be out again, but who agreed with me), I [...] determined that I ought to vote last night with Disraeli; and made [...] up my mind accordingly, which involved saying why, at some period of [...] the night. I was anxious to do it early, as I knew Graham would [...] speak on the other side, and did not wish any conflict even of [...] reasoning with him. But he found I was going to speak, and I suppose [...] may have had some similar wish. At any rate, he had the opportunity [...] of following Stafford who began the debate, as he {{was to take the}} [...] other side. Then there was an amusing scene between him and Peel. [...] Both rose and stood in competition for the Speaker's eye. The [...] Speaker had seen Graham first, and he got it. But when he was [...] speaking I felt I {{had no choice but to}} follow him. He made so very [...] able a speech that this was no pleasant prospect; but I acquired the [...] courage that proceeds from fear, according to a line from Ariosto: [...] Chi per virtù, chi per paura vale [one from valour, another from [...] fear, is strong], and made my plunge when he sat down. But the [...] Speaker was not dreaming of me, and called a certain Mr. Scott who [...] had risen at the same time. Upon this I sat down again, and there [...] was a great uproar because the House always anticipating more or [...] less interest when men speak on opposite sides and in succession, [...] who are usually together, called for me. So I was up again, and the [...] Speaker deserted Scott and called me, and I had to make the best I [...] could after Graham. That is the end of the story, for there is [...] nothing else worth saying. It was at the dinner hour from 7 to [...] 7¾, and then I went home for a little quiet. Peel again replied [...] upon me, but I did not hear that part of him; and Disraeli showed [...] the marvellous talent that he has, for summing up with brilliancy, [...] buoyancy, and comprehensiveness at the close of a debate. You have [...] heard me speak of that talent before when I have been wholly against [...] him; but never, last night or at any other time, would I go to him [...] for conviction, but for the delight of the ear and the fancy.
