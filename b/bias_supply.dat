5000|$|The zero {{crossing}} steps of Fig. 1b allow a single bias current {{passing through the}} entire junction array while insuring that every junction in the array is on a constant voltage step. This leads to significant complication in setting the array to a particular desired step. Figure 9a illustrates a simplified diagram of the bias circuit. In this circuit a computer sets the bias voltage [...] with one digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and uses a second DAC to control the bias impedance [...] via optically modulated resistors. Figure 9b shows a graphical solution for the stable operating points of the array and illustrates how control of both the bias voltage and the bias impedance is used to select a particular quantum voltage step.The load line plots the range of voltage and current that are defined by the <b>bias</b> <b>supply.</b> The intersections of this load line with the I-V curve of the array (vertical lines) are possible stable bias points. Changes to [...] shift the load line left and right, whereas changes to [...] change its slope. To select a step at a given voltage , the source voltage is set to [...] and the source impedance is set to about , where [...] is the step height. This makes the load line steep enough to intersect {{only one or two}} steps and forces the array to a step at or very near [...] Applying a damped oscillation to [...] helps move the array to the step closest to [...] After a step is selected, the source impedance is smoothly increased on all four bias connections (load line becomes horizontal) until the array current goes to zero and the array is effectively disconnected from the bias source. This open-bias condition is the most stable state for the array and eliminates the possibility of any errors resulting from a small series resistance in the array - a common array defect. Computer control of this three-step process enables the system to find and stabilize the array voltage on a particular step within a few seconds. High quality Josephson arrays will remain on a selected step for many hours.|$|E
