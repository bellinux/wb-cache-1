Lord Northcliffe, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Beach Thomas would need {{to live in a}} rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Beach Thomas <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.|$|E
25|$|Špegelj {{concluded}} {{that the decision to}} cancel the offensive was political one, but Tuđman did not tell him why was the operation cancelled when Špegelj submitted his report to Tuđman on 15 April. In Špegelj's opinion the offensive should have been carried on and its objective extended to Croatian recapture of entire Baranja, i.e. the municipality of Beli Manastir, which was designated a UN Protected Area under the Vance plan. According to Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo, the offensive caused political damage to Croatia <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that Croatia was either in breach of its obligations towards the UN at the time when it was requesting to be admitted to the UN, or that its political leadership had questionable authority over its military.|$|E
25|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{the rest}} of D.H. Hill's division came up followed by Longstreet, while on the Union side, George Morrell's division arrived and relieved McCall, whose men were nearly out of ammunition. There was not enough daylight remaining to deploy D.H. Hill and Longstreet's divisions. Jackson did not attack, but his presence near Porter's flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain's Swamp, five miles (8km) to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the Richmond and York River Railroad north of the Chickahominy, {{and he decided to}} shift his base of supply to the James River (he also believed that the demonstrations by Huger and Magruder showed that he was seriously outnumbered). This was a strategic decision of grave import <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that, without the railroad to supply his army, he had to abandon his siege of Richmond.|$|E

25|$|Most episcopal {{conferences}} set {{the first}} Sunday in Advent (27 November) 2011 as the date {{when the new}} translation would come into use. However, the Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference (Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland) put into effect {{the changes in the}} people's parts of the revised English translation of the Order of Mass from 28 November 2008, when the Missal as a whole was not yet available. Protests were voiced on grounds of content and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that Southern Africa was thus out of line with other English-speaking areas. One bishop claimed that the English-speaking conferences should have withstood the Holy See's insistence on a more literal translation. However, when in February 2009 the Holy See declared that the change should have waited until the whole of the Missal had been translated, the bishops' conference appealed, with the result that those parishes that had adopted the new translation of the Order of Mass were directed to continue using it, while those that had not were told to await further instructions before doing so.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, the American Football League {{agreed to}} a merger with its older and more {{established}} rival, the National Football League. Among {{the terms of the}} merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise. One of the reasons the NFL agreed to this was that they wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added that brought the combined total number clubs in the merged league to twenty-six teams. The NFL was content for that team to be in the American Football League <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that the existing nine AFL clubs were the ones that had to provide players in the ensuing expansion draft and the NFL owners preferred for the ensuing dilution of talent to occur in what they had always considered to be an inferior league. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million–400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement.|$|E

In 1817, he, William McDowell and William Beauchamp collectively founded the city of Mount Carmel, Illinois. All three men were ministers.

5000|$|The Plymouth Pronto Spyder was a 2-door {{roadster}} {{concept car}} revealed in 1998. It never went into production, {{partly because of}} the discontinuation of the Plymouth brand, but largely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was <b>meant</b> as a rolling test of styling and mechanical concepts.|$|R
500|$|Once the set {{concepts}} {{were approved}} by Carter, Bowman, Sackheim and Ryan, they {{were sent to the}} blueprint stage so that construction of the sets could begin under the supervision of construction coordinator Bill Liams. All the major sets were constructed [...] "simultaneously" [...] because of the schedule. However, this proved to be a challenge for the production team, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> they had to pay the rent on all the stages at the same time. The set construction started seven weeks before filming.|$|E
500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want to hear my songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly {{prepares to}} present the parks {{department}} budget proposal, or [...] "master plan". However, city manager Paul (Phil Reeves), announces due to Pawnee's huge budget deficit, all proposals will be postponed indefinitely. State auditors have been sent by the governor to solve the impasse, which makes Leslie fear severe cuts. Ron (Nick Offerman) is delighted because he hates any government spending, which leads him to heated arguments with Leslie. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) is turning 21 and is having her birthday party at Tom's (Aziz Ansari) favorite nightclub, the Snakehole Lounge. Andy (Chris Pratt) debates whether to ask April to be his girlfriend, but worries about the age difference because he is 29. Ann (Rashida Jones) has broken up with Mark (Paul Schneider), and they meet at the diner to discuss {{the end of their}} relationship. Mark is quietly stunned by Ann's decisions and says [...] "We never even fought", but Ann points out that NEVER fighting was a bad thing <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> their relationship had no passion, and she adds that Mark isn't used to dating anyone {{for a long period of}} time and over-stated the relationship's strength for that reason.|$|E

500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but I always had a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|In late 1942, Como {{made the}} {{decision}} to quit the Weems band, even if it meant giving up singing. He returned to Canonsburg, his family, and his trade, tired of life on the road without his wife and young son. Como received an offer to become a Frank Sinatra imitator, but chose to keep his own style. While Perry was negotiating for a store lease to re-open a barber shop, he received a call from Tommy Rockwell at General Artists Corporation, who also represented Ted Weems. Como fielded many other calls that also brought offers, but he liked and trusted Rockwell, who was offering him his own sustaining (non-sponsored) Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) radio show and offering to get him a recording contract. The offers were also appealing <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> staying in New York with no more road tours. As Perry pondered the job offer, Roselle told him, [...] "You can always get another barber shop if it doesn't work out!" [...] Until the radio show and recording contract offers, he did not really view singing as his career, believing the years with Carlone and Weems had been enjoyable, but now {{it was time to get}} back to work. Como said in an 1983 interview, [...] "I thought I'd have my fun and I'd go home to work." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the basis}} of Austen's {{reputation}} as a serious author, the producers were able to rely on high-brow publications to help market their film. Near {{the time of its}} US release, large spreads in The New York Review of Books, Vanity Fair, Film Comment, and other media outlets featured columns on Lee's production. In late December, Time magazine declared it and Persuasion to be the best films of 1995. Andrew Higson referred to all this media exposure as a [...] "marketing coup" [...] <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> the film [...] "was reaching one of its target audiences." [...] Meanwhile, most promotional images featured the film as a [...] "sort of chick flick in period garb." [...] New Market Press published Thompson's screenplay and film diary; in its first printing, the hard cover edition sold 28,500 copies in the US. British publisher Bloomsbury released a paperback edition of the novel containing film pictures, same title design, and the cast's names on the cover, whilst Signet Publishing in the US printed 250,000 copies instead of the typical 10,000 a year; actress Julie Christie read the novel in an audiobook released by Penguin Audiobooks. Sense and Sensibility increased dramatically in terms of its book sales, ultimately hitting tenth place on The New York Times Best Seller list for paperbacks in February 1996.|$|E

500|$|System Shock {{was first}} {{conceived}} {{during the final}} stages of [...] development, between December 1992 and January 1993. Designer and programmer Doug Church spent this period at the Texas headquarters of publisher Origin Systems, and discussions about Looking Glass Technologies' next project occurred between him and producer Warren Spector, with input from designer Austin Grossman and company head Paul Neurath in Massachusetts. According to Church, the team believed that they had made [...] "too many dungeon games"; and Neurath later explained that they were experiencing burnout after the rushed development of Ultima Underworld II. As a result, they decided to create another [...] "immersive simulation game", but without a fantasy setting. They briefly considered placing the game in modern day, but Church said that the idea was rejected because [...] "it [...] just beg so many questions: why can't I pick up the phone, why can't I get on the train, and so on". Church returned to Looking Glass in Massachusetts, where he, Neurath and Grossman brainstormed possible science fiction settings for the game. According to Spector, the game was initially titled [...] "Alien Commander" [...] and was a spin-off of the Wing Commander series; however, this idea was soon replaced entirely. Spector said that they enjoyed not being attached to an existing franchise, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that they [...] "could basically do whatever [...] liked".|$|E

2500|$|A fast bowler will {{typically}} use the leg cutter as {{a variation}} ball {{as it is}} most effective when it surprises the batsman. The leg cutter action can also produce a significantly slower ball with little obvious change in the bowler's arm speed, making the delivery doubly deceptive. On the other hand, the lack of pace of the delivery may be disadvantageous. Former Australian captain Ian Chappell described Jeff Thomson's leg cutter thus: [...] "He had this leg cutter, and you were usually pretty happy to see it, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> that the ball wasn't coming at your head at 95 miles an hour." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{bridge was}} built {{as part of}} a wider urban {{renovation}} of the town during the administration of the mayor Ivan Hribar. It replaced an old oak bridge named Butchers' Bridge (...) , which was constructed in 1819 and damaged by a severe earthquake in 1895. For economic reasons, the municipal authorities took the decision to finance a reinforced concrete construction of the new bridge instead of a more expensive and less fashionable stone one. Janez Koželj, a professor of urban design, expressed in 2010 his opinion that the new technology of reinforced concrete and new static calculations were used in Ljubljana instead of Vienna, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>meant</b> minor consequences if they had not worked.|$|E
