5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT {{was the beginning of}} digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it was found to be unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
5|$|In the {{synthesis}} of CMOS circuits, the function to be synthesized is represented as a formula in <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra.</b> Then this formula is translated into two series-parallel multigraphs. These graphs {{can be interpreted as}} circuit diagrams in which the edges of the graphs represent transistors, gated by the inputs to the function. One circuit computes the function itself, and the other computes its complement. One of the two circuits is derived by converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into series and parallel compositions of graphs, respectively. The other circuit reverses this construction, converting the conjunctions and disjunctions of the formula into parallel and series compositions of graphs. These two circuits, augmented by an additional edge connecting the input of each circuit to its output, are planar dual graphs.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} unique {{homomorphism}} from the two-element <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> 2 to every <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra,</b> since homomorphisms must preserve the two constants {{and those are}} the only elements of 2.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to two {{different}} generalizations of projective Boolean algebras: openly generated <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> and tightly sigma-filtered <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras.</b> We show that for every uncountable regular cardinal kappa there are 2 ^kappa pairwise non-isomorphic openly generated <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> of size kappa > aleph_ 1 provided there is an almost free non-free abelian group of size kappa. The openly generated <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> constructed here are almost free. Moreover, for every infinite regular cardinal kappa we construct 2 ^kappa pairwise non-isomorphic <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> of size kappa that are tightly sigma-filtered and c. c. c.

Extending recent {{investigations}} on {{the structure}} of Tukey types of ultrafilters on P(ω) to <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> in general, we classify the spectra of Tukey types of ultrafilters for several classes of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras.</b> These include the classes of free <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras,</b> superatomic <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> generated by almost disjoint families, interval algebras, tree algebras, and pseudo-tree algebras.

25|$|Although every {{concrete}} <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> is a <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra,</b> {{not every}} <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> need be concrete. Let n be a square-free positive integer, one not divisible by {{the square of}} an integer, for example 30 but not 12. The operations of greatest common divisor, least common multiple, and division into n (that is, ¬x = n/x), can be shown to satisfy all the Boolean laws when their arguments range over the positive divisors of n. Hence those divisors form a <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra.</b> These divisors are not subsets of a set, making the divisors of n a <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> that is not concrete according to our definitions.|$|E
25|$|The {{semantics}} of {{propositional logic}} rely on truth assignments. The essential {{idea of a}} truth assignment is that the propositional variables are mapped to elements of a fixed <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra,</b> and then the truth value of a propositional formula using these letters is the element of the <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> that is obtained by computing {{the value of the}} Boolean term corresponding to the formula. In classical semantics, only the two-element <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> is used, while in Boolean-valued semantics arbitrary Boolean algebras are considered. A tautology is a propositional formula that is assigned truth value 1 by every truth assignment of its propositional variables to an arbitrary <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> (or, equivalently, every truth assignment to the two element <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra).</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{go beyond}} power set algebras we need another construct. A subalgebra of an algebra A is any subset of A closed under the {{operations}} of A. Every subalgebra of a <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> A must still satisfy the equations holding of A, since any violation would constitute a violation for A itself.

40|$|Summary. In the paper, {{two short}} axiom systems for <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> are introduced. In {{the first section}} we show that the single axiom (DN 1) {{proposed}} in [2] in terms of disjunction and negation characterizes <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras.</b> To prove that (DN 1) is a single axiom for Robbins <b>algebras</b> (that is, <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> as well), we use the Otter theorem prover. The second section contains proof that the two classical axioms (Meredith 1), (Meredith 2) proposed by Meredith [3] may {{also serve as a}} basis for <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras.</b> The results will be used to characterize ortholattices.

25|$|The nonexistence of free {{complete}} Boolean algebras can {{be traced}} to failure to extend the equations of Boolean logic suitably to all laws that should hold for infinitary conjunction and disjunction, in particular the neglect of distributivity in the definition of complete <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra.</b> A complete <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> is called completely distributive when arbitrary conjunctions distribute over arbitrary disjunctions and vice versa. A <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> is a CABA if and only if it is complete and completely distributive, giving a third definition of CABA. A fourth definition is as any <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> isomorphic to a power set algebra.|$|E

25|$|The laws {{listed above}} define <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra,</b> {{in the sense}} that they entail the rest of the subject. The laws Complementation 1 and 2, {{together}} with the monotone laws, suffice for this purpose and can therefore be taken as one possible complete set of laws or axiomatization of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra.</b> Every law of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebra</b> follows logically from these axioms. Furthermore, Boolean algebras can then be defined as the models of these axioms as treated in the section thereon.|$|E
50|$|In {{mathematical}} logic, algebraic semantics is {{a formal}} semantics based on algebras studied {{as part of}} algebraic logic. For example, the modal logic S4 {{is characterized by the}} class of topological <b>boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> - that is, <b>boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> with an interior operator. Other modal logics are characterized by various other algebras with operators. The class of <b>boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> characterizes classical propositional logic, and the class of Heyting algebras propositional intuitionistic logic.|$|R

40|$|A typical (nontrivial) {{first order}} theory is undecidable. According {{to an early}} result of Tarski [15], the theory of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> {{is one of the}} lucky ex-ceptions. This was {{extended}} by Ershov to the decidability (of the theory) of relatively complemented distributive lattices as well as to <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> with a distinguished ultrafilter or prime ideal in [6], and to Post algebras in [7]. As shown by Rabin [13], even the second order theory of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> with quantification over ideals is still decidable, implying the decidability of the first order theory of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> with a sequence of distinguished ideals. On the other hand, several seemingly moderate generalizations of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> are already undecidable. They include (bounded) distributive lattices (Grzegorczyk [8]), Boolean pairs, i. e., <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> with a distinguished subalgebra (Rubin [14]), all varieties of Heyting algebras properly extending the variety of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> (Burris [3]), etc. In our contribution we pursue examining the borderline between decidabil-ity and undecidability in the close vicinity of <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras.</b> Iterating Ka-triňák’s version of the Chen-Grätzer triple construction applied consecutively to n <b>Boolean</b> <b>algebras</b> (see [10], [4], [5]) we introduce the finitely axiomatizable classes SAn of n-th degree Stone algebras as follows.
