500|$|In June 2010, Tim Ferguson {{revealed}} that the break-up was {{due in large part}} to personal health issues. [...] Unknown to the public at the time, Ferguson had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996 after experiencing symptoms for several years including a few severe episodes while touring in 1993. [...] The symptoms affected his mobility, causing him to struggle with choreography and physical routines onstage and eventually, he says, [...] "it was clear I couldn't remain a Doug Anthony Allstar with whatever this was". Still coming to terms with his diagnosis, Ferguson chose to keep it private, telling few people outside of his close friends and family. [...] "I didn't want other people to know," [...] he says. [...] "I didn't want it to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> in conversation with strangers." ...|$|E
500|$|Nell on {{the other}} hand is a smart and {{responsible}} girl, age seventeen {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She too goes through character development. Initially, as one reviewer put it, Nell is filled with a [...] "maelstorm of angst" [...] as she tries to figure out her relationship with Brooke and both [...] "shocked and intrigued" [...] by Brooke's eccentric behaviour. Though she expresses herself as in the control of most situations, in fact she is not, especially when Brooke is involved. One reviewer noted that Nell's voice in the novel is not altogether convincing, saying [...] "the levels of diction and spelling here seem rather high to <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> from the kitchen". The centrality of Nell in the novel was inspired by a postcard that Dawson bought which showed the maids from The Orchard during Brooke's stay. Though inspired by real individuals, Nell's character primarily draws inspiration from many individuals in Dawson's own life. The name Nell Golightly is a mix of two names: Izzie Golightly, a close friend of Dawson's mother, and Nelly Boxall, Virginia Woolf's servant.|$|E
500|$|Nobuo Uematsu's usual {{influences}} include Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Simon and Garfunkel, and Elton John. In {{regard to}} Final Fantasy VIII, Uematsu did not {{prefer to use}} multiple sources to find MIDI instruments—"I could <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with a great melody in the very moment"—instead using a Roland SC-88 synthesizer for the entire score. Uematsu wrote notes based on character designs and screenplays, creating a general picture of the pieces' moods. He could not express a character's emotions solely with plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In {{response to a question}} by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game".|$|E

500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up.</b> I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E
2500|$|GamePro's McKinley Noble {{commented that}} he {{anticipated}} the English release of Platinum. 1UP.com commented that fans {{will not be}} left [...] "wanting", stating [...] "once you venture back down the Pokémon rabbit hole, you won't <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> again for a while." [...] IGN's Craig Harris commented that those looking for something particularly new in Platinum such as a new method of control would be disappointed, adding that the controls felt [...] "clumsy". However, he noted that those who played Diamond and Pearl will enjoy it for its new features and available Pokémon. In another preview, Harris commented {{that those who have}} played Diamond or Pearl will have to decide whether the new features are worth buying the game for, while those who have not should buy it if interested in playing a Pokémon game.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting {{one foot in front of}} the other. The song reminds us of the early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E

2500|$|The {{imperial}} collection had {{its origins}} {{in the first century}} BC, and had gone through many vicissitudes of fire, civil wars and foreign invasions in the centuries that followed. But it was Qianlong who lavished the greatest attention on it, certainly of any of the Manchu rulers... One of the many roles played by Qianlong, with his customary diligence, was that of the emperor as collector and curator. ...how carefully Qianlong followed the art market in rare paintings and antiquities, using a team of cultural advisers, from elderly Chinese literati to newly fledged Manchu connoisseurs. These men would help the emperor spot which great private collections might <b>be</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> for sale, either because the fortunes of some previously rich merchant family were unraveling or because the precious objects acquired by Manchu or Chinese grandees during the chaos of the conquest period were no longer valued by those families' surviving heirs. Sometimes, too, Qianlong would pressure or even force wealthy courtiers into yielding up choice art objects: he did this by pointing out failings in their work, which might be excused if they made a certain [...] "gift", or, in a couple of celebrated cases, by persuading the current owners that only the secure walls of the forbidden City and its guardians could save some precious painting from theft or from fire.|$|E
