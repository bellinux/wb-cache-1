But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
500|$|The regular Football League {{restarted}} in {{time for}} the 1946–47 season. Ramsey moved into club-owned lodgings in Southampton with a close friend from the army, Alf Freeman, an inside-forward who had also signed for the club. Ramsey started the season in the reserve team, selected at centre-forward, and scored in each of the first three games. After five matches, Dodgin and the club trainer Sydney Cann made a decision that changed the course of Ramsey's entire professional playing career: deciding that neither centre-half nor centre-forward truly suited him, they moved him to right-back. McKinstry calls this [...] "exactly the right place for Alf", citing Ramsey's tactical knowledge and fine passing. A close master-and-pupil relationship developed between Ramsey and Cann, who had played at full-back for Torquay United, Manchester City and Charlton Athletic. During training sessions, the two had long discussions about tactics and individual techniques. [...] wanted to learn about the game from top to bottom," [...] Cann recalled; [...] "I have never known anyone with the same quickness of learning as Alf Ramsey. He would never accept anything on its face value... He was the type of player who was a manager's dream <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> talk about a decision and he would accept it and there it was, in his game." ...|$|E
500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> learn from him, no matter how long you had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, only a little more than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days. Yet Ripken's example makes you wonder if the century, not Senior, has lost its way." [...] Since his death, no Oriole has worn Cal Sr.'s number 7, although the number has not been officially retired.|$|E

Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have the best intentions but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hunt {{was known}} as a fast driver with an aggressive, tail-happy driving style, but one prone to {{spectacular}} accidents, hence his nickname of Hunt the Shunt.

In the book, James Hunt: The Biography, John Hogan said of Hunt: [...] "James was the only driver I've ever seen who had the vaguest idea about what it actually takes to be a racing driver." [...] Niki Lauda stated that [...] "We were big rivals, especially {{at the end of the}} [...] season, but I respected him <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> drive next to him—2 centimetres, wheel-by-wheel, for 300 kilometres or more—and nothing would happen.

The documentary recorded antisemitism and monkey noise taunts of black players in Poland. In Ukraine, the documentary recorded Nazi salutes and FC Metalist Kharkiv fans violently assaulting a group of Asian students at the Metalist Oblast Sports Complex, one of the stadiums hosting matches in Ukraine. Panorama filmed former England defender Sol Campbell watching these clips, and then asked him whether he would recommend families go to the Championship.

[...] However, that fan-base was cut dramatically when the Jets arrived in the 1960s. [...] Many argue that this group of Mets/Giants fans were split into Mets/Jets fans <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not get a seat at a Giants game in Yankee Stadium, while you could get season tickets to the NY Jets who now played in the Mets ballpark (Shea Stadium).

[...] There were then two distinct groups: Mets/Giants fans and Mets/Jets fans.|$|E
