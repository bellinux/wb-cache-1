5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty/has to flourish in the light/wild horses run unbridled/or their spirit dies/you have given me the courage/to be all that I can/and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was {{going to go back to}} the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back.

500|$|Minogue is {{regarded}} as a gay icon, which she has encouraged with comments including [...] "I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits" [...] and [...] "My gay audience has <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> from the beginning ... they kind of adopted me." [...] Minogue has explained that she first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. She said that she felt [...] "very touched" [...] to have such an [...] "appreciative crowd", and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining the 1994 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Minogue has one of the largest gay followings in the world. Minogue's sister, Dannii, also has a large gay following and has been regarded as a gay icon. In September 2007, Kylie Minogue was hailed the greatest gay icon of all time by The Sun.|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 2017, Disney {{announced}} that Groban had recorded {{a cover of}} [...] "Evermore" [...] – still entitled [...] "For Evermore", at the time – and revealed that his version would be included on the remake's soundtrack {{in addition to being}} played during the film's end credits. Groban released a statement, saying: [...] "I am honored to sing this beautiful new song by two of my absolute favorites, Alan Menken and Tim Rice. Beauty and the Beast has <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> since my childhood and to have a musical connection to this new film makes me so happy." [...] The announcement coincided with the studio's release of a new promotional poster for the film, which Disney allowed the singer to premiere using his official Twitter account. A 30-second sample of the track was uploaded to SoundCloud on February 14, 2017, which Groban also shared on Twitter. Groban's version was released as the second single from Beauty and the Beasts soundtrack on March 3, 2017, several days before the album, on which Stevens' original rendition appears, was released. Groban promoted the song with a performance on Good Morning America on March 14, 2017. The occasion marked both the song's first televised performance, as well as the first time an original song from the remake was performed live on television.|$|E

500|$|Baba himself {{maintained}} an ambiguous profile, unwilling {{to identify with}} {{either of the two}} religions. His Muslim devotees were fully convinced that he belonged to their fold, identifying him as an avaliā. The Hindu bhaktas also viewed him as one of them, since he often identified himself with their gods and customs. Sai Baba wanted to belong to all and be shared by all. When pressed on whether he was Hindu or Muslim, he would often get very angry. Once he told a devotee: [...] "You have <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> for eighteen years now. Does Sai mean for you only these three and a half cubits of height?" [...] Sai Baba was able to avoid clashes between the two communities, and, in fact, succeeded in unifying them in an atmosphere of general harmony. In a verse of the midday arti, devotees sing: Baba would often talk about the Hindu gods, quoting from sacred texts or even commenting upon passages of the Bhagavadgita, the Isha Upanishad, and so forth. The names of Krishna and Rama seem to have been particularly dear to him. With his Muslim followers, Baba would always talk of Allah and the Koran, often quoting Persian verses. One of his favorite expressions was [...] "Allah rakhega vaiia rahena", that is, [...] "Let us be content with what we have, and submit our will to Allah." [...] On several occasions, Sai reassured his listeners by saying that he, like them, was but a devotee of Allah, a humble faqir with two arms and two legs. In later years, Parsis and even a few Christians would come to Shirdi. Sai Baba respected all creeds, true to his conviction that all religions are but particular paths leading to one ineffable goal.|$|E

In response, Governor Brisbane proclaimed martial law on 14 August 1824 to end [...] "...the Slaughter of Black Women and Children, and unoffending White Men...". It remained in force until 11 December 1824, when it was proclaimed that [...] "...the judicious and humane Measures pursued by the Magistrates assembled at Bathurst have restored Tranquillity without Bloodshed...". There is a display of the weaponry and history of this conflict at the National Museum of Australia. This includes a commendation by Governor Brisbane of the deployment of the troops under Major Morisset: [...] "I {{felt it necessary to}} augment the Detachment at Bathurst to 75 men who were divided into various small parties, each headed by a Magistrate who proceeded in different directions in towards the interior of the Country ...

2500|$|Thérèse {{was taught}} at home {{until she was}} eight and a half, and then entered the school kept by the Benedictine nuns of the Abbey of Notre Dame du Pre in Lisieux. Thérèse, taught well and {{carefully}} by Marie and Pauline, found herself {{at the top of}} the class, except for writing and arithmetic. However, because of her young age and high grades, she was bullied. The one who bullied her the most was a girl of fourteen who did poorly at school. Thérèse suffered very much as a result of her sensitivity, and she cried in silence. Furthermore, the boisterous games at recreation were not to her taste. She preferred to tell stories or look after the little ones in the infants class. [...] "The five years I spent at school were the saddest of my life, and if my dear Céline had not <b>been</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> I could not have stayed there for a single month without falling ill." [...] Céline informs us, [...] "She now developed a fondness for hiding, she did not want to be observed, for she sincerely considered herself inferior." [...] On her free days she became more and more attached to Marie Guérin, the younger of her two cousins in Lisieux. The two girls would play at being anchorites, as the great Teresa had once played with her brother. And every evening she plunged into the family circle. [...] "Fortunately I could go home every evening and then I cheered up. I used to jump on Father's knee and tell him what marks I had, and when he kissed me all my troubles were forgotten...I needed this sort of encouragement so much." [...] Yet the tension of the double life and the daily self-conquest placed a strain on Thérèse. Going to school became more and more difficult.|$|E
