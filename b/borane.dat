5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called <b>borane,</b> but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Borane</b> adducts with phosphines and amines {{are also}} available. <b>Borane</b> makes a strong adduct with triethylamine; using this adduct {{requires}} harsher conditions in hydroboration. This can be advantageous for {{cases such as}} hydroborating trienes to avoid polymerization. More sterically hindered tertiary and silyl amines can deliver <b>borane</b> to alkenes at room temperature. A few examples are shown below. Another advantage of these <b>borane</b> complexes {{is that it is}} possible to recover the amine carriers.|$|E

50|$|Diborane is made industrially by the {{reduction}} of BF3. It is the precursor to the higher <b>boranes.</b> It has been studied extensively. The higher <b>boranes</b> are thought to arise via thermal cracking of diborane. The resulting reactive monomer BH3 combines with diborane to produce higher <b>boranes</b> and H2.|$|R
40|$|Phosphine oxides are {{lithiated}} {{much faster}} than phosphine sulfides and phosphine <b>boranes.</b> Phosphine sulfides are in turn lithiated much more readily than phosphine <b>boranes.</b> It was possible to trap a phosphine sulfide THF in one case which upon treatment with t-BuOK gave cyclopropane, showing that phosphine sulfides readily undergo both phosphinoyl transfer and cyclopropane ring closure just like their phosphine oxide counterparts. The obtained data show that phosphine oxides are easily lithiated and undergo phosphoryl transfer much more readily and faster than phosphine sulfides and phosphine <b>boranes.</b> The observations suggest {{that it would be}} possible to perform reactions involving phosphine oxides in the presence of phosphine <b>boranes</b> or phosphine sulfides, potentially allowing regioselective alkylation of phosphine oxides in the presence of phosphine <b>boranes</b> or phosphine sulfides...|$|R
40|$|New methodologies {{have been}} {{developed}} for the synthesis of 2, 5 -disubstituted tetrahydropyrans and for the asymmetric synthesis of P-stereogenic phospholene <b>boranes.</b> Synthesis of 2, 5 -disubstituted tetrahydropyrans in a racemic fashion was achieved via Grignard addition, O-alkylation, ring-closing metathesis and hydrogenation. Using this route, seven potential perfumery compounds were produced in good overall yield. Olfactory evaluation of the potential perfumery molecules accessed the majority of products as having a predominant characteristic of citrus note and others having a floral note. In addition, asymmetric synthesis of two saturated cyclic ethers was achieved using an asymmetric deprotonation approach. An alternative route to an enantioenriched alcohol using catalytic asymmetric deprotonation and trapping with Andersen’s sulfinate was briefly studied and proved successful. The asymmetric synthesis of P-stereogenic phospholene <b>boranes</b> was investigated. First, three chiral diamines were synthesised and their asymmetric induction was tested in the asymmetric lithiation of t-butyl phosphine <b>boranes.</b> Subsequently, the asymmetric synthesis of P-stereogenic vinylic phospholene <b>boranes</b> was carried out. Using s-BuLi/(_) -sparteine as a base, alkylated phosphine <b>boranes</b> were isolated with good yield and high enantioselectivity. A telescoped regioselective deprotonation/trapping of paraformaldehyde and elimination reaction was developed {{to gain access to the}} dienes. Finally, ring-closing metathesis afforded the desired vinylic phospholene <b>boranes.</b> The application represents the first example of asymmetric synthesis of P-stereogenic vinylic phospholene <b>boranes.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Corey-Itsuno {{reduction}}, {{also known}} as the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction, is an enantioselctive reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine catalyst and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant. The Corey group first demonstrated the synthesis of the catalyst using <b>borane</b> and chiral aminoalcohols. The reaction uses the chiral amino acid proline and in the presence of <b>borane</b> leads to the CBS catalyst (scheme 9).|$|E
25|$|A way of {{producing}} <b>borane</b> in situ {{is to reduce}} BF3 with NaBH4 (see for Flavopiridol).|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Hirao and {{co-workers}} {{have found that}} asymmetric reduction of prochiral armomatic ketones with chiral amino alcohols and <b>borane</b> afforded the corresponding secondary alcohols with 60% ee. They {{found out that the}} chiral amino alcohols would react with <b>borane</b> to form aloxyl-amine-borane complexes. The complexes are proposed to contain a relatively rigid five member-ring system which makes them thermal and hydrolytic stable and soluble {{in a wide variety of}} protic and aprotic solvents.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of nonpolar E–H bonds across C≡C is general for silanes, <b>boranes,</b> and related hydrides. The hydroboration of alkynes gives vinylic <b>boranes</b> which oxidize to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone. In the thiol-yne reaction the substrate is a thiol.|$|R
40|$|The Wade n+ 1 rule$^{[1]}$ and the mno rule$^{[2]}$ {{describe}} the electronic {{requirements for the}} stability of polyhedral <b>boranes</b> (e. g., 1) and macropolyhedral <b>boranes</b> (e. g., 2 and 3), respectively (see Figure 1). Though useful in explaining and designing structures, electron-counting rules provide {{a yes or no}} answer; not all molecules having the stipulated numbers of electrons are equally stable. It is desirable to have a qualitative understanding, wherever possible, of the factors that control the relative stability of a family of molecules. We formulated the concept of compatibility of orbitals to explain the relative stability of polyhedral <b>boranes,</b> carboranes, and metallaboranes. $^{[3]}$ Herein we demonstrate that similar concepts can be used to determine the best combination of polyhedra for the formation of condensed macropolyhedral <b>boranes...</b>|$|R

25|$|NHCs and boranes form stable NHC <b>borane</b> adducts. Triethylborane adducts can be {{synthesised}} {{directly from}} the imidazolium salt and lithium triethylborohydride. Members of this compound class are investigated for use as reagent or catalyst.|$|E
25|$|The simple {{oxidation}} of Grignard reagents to give alcohols is {{of little}} practical import as yields are generally poor. In contrast, two-step sequence via a <b>borane</b> (vide supra) that is subsequently oxidized to the alcohol with hydrogen peroxide is of synthetic utility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Borane</b> {{hydrides}} such as 9-BBN and L-selectride (lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride) are reducing agents.

40|$|P-chirogenic {{phosphine}} ligands can {{be prepared}} via desymmetrization of prochiral phosphine <b>boranes</b> using s-BuLi. (-) -sparteine complexes. One limitation of this method, however, has been that (+) -sparteine is not easily accessible. Herein, we show that derivatives of another alkaloid, (-) -cytisine, are useful surrogates for (+) -sparteine in the desymmetrization of prochiral phenyl-, cyclohexyl- and tert-butyl dimethyl phosphine <b>boranes,</b> yielding chiral phosphine <b>boranes</b> in up to 92 % ee. Other chiral diamines were also tested but did not give as high enantioselectivity as the (-) -cytisine derivatives...|$|R

25|$|Dimesitylborane (C6H2Me3)2BH is a {{particularly}} bulky secondary <b>borane.</b> Because of severe steric hindrance, it does not react readily even with simple terminal alkenes. Prolonged reaction time is required at room temperature. On the other hand, alkynes undergo monohydroboration with Mes2BH easily to produce alkenylboranes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step of the {{reaction}} sequence, the nucleophilic hydroperoxide anion attacks the boron atom. Alkyl migration to oxygen gives the alkyl <b>borane</b> with retention of stereochemistry (in reality, the reaction occurs via the trialkyl borate B(OR)3, rather than the monoalkyl borinic ester BH2OR).|$|E
25|$|In organic {{synthesis}} the hydroboration reaction is taken further to generate other functional {{groups in the}} place of the boron group. The hydroboration-oxidation reaction offers a route to alcohols by oxidation of the <b>borane</b> with hydrogen peroxide or to the carbonyl group with the stronger oxidizing agent chromium oxide.|$|E
5000|$|Jemmis mno rules {{represent}} a unified rule for predicting and systematizing structures of compounds, usually clusters. The rules involve electron counting. They were formulated by Eluvathingal Devassy Jemmis {{to explain the}} structures of condensed polyhedral <b>boranes</b> such as B20H16, which are obtained by condensing polyhedral <b>boranes,</b> by sharing a triangular face, an edge, a single vertex or even four vertices. These rules are addition and extensions to Wade’s rules and polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory. [...] Jemmis mno rule provides the relationship between polyhedral <b>boranes,</b> condensed polyhedral <b>boranes</b> and β-rhombohedral boron. This {{is similar to the}} relationship between benzene, condensed benzenoid aromatics and graphite, brought by Hückel’s 4n+2 rule, as well as that between tetracoordinate tetrahedral carbon compounds and diamond. The Jemmis mno rule reduces to Hückel rule when restricted to two dimensions and reduces to Wade’s rules when restricted to one polyhedron.|$|R

25|$|If BH3 {{is used as}} the hydroborating reagent, {{reactions}} typically proceed {{beyond the}} monoalkyl <b>borane</b> compounds, especially for less sterically hindered small olefins. Trisubstituted olefins can rapidly produce dialkyl boranes, but further alkylation of the organoboranes is slowed because of steric hindrance. This significant rate difference in producing di- and tri-alkyl boranes is useful in the synthesis of bulky boranes that can enhance regioselectivity (see below).|$|E
50|$|Heteroboranes are {{classes of}} <b>boranes,</b> {{at least one}} boron atom is {{replaced}} by another element. Like many of the related <b>boranes,</b> these clusters are polyhedra and are similarly classified as closo-, nido-, arachno-, hypho-, etc. based on whether they represent a complete (closo-) polyhedron, or a polyhedron that is missing one (nido-), two (arachno-), or more vertices.|$|R

Such aromatic systems can be classified according to the nodality of overlapping atomic orbitals. In particular the three-dimensional deltahedral <b>boranes</b> BnH - and carboranes Bn _ 2 C 2 Hn (6 n 12) are examples of anodal orbital aromatic systems since the delocalization in their bonding arises from overlap of anodal radial boron OI 2 ̆ 7 carbon sp hybrids. The concept of Kekule structures for two-dimensional benzenoid hydrocarbons can·be extended to delocalized three-dimensional polyhedral <b>boranes</b> by using three-center B-B-B bonds instead of carbon-carbon double bonds.

25|$|Most of the {{elements}} in the boron group show increasing reactivity as {{the elements}} get heavier in atomic mass and higher in atomic number.

25|$|In {{part because}} its lower electronegativity, boron often forms {{electron-deficient}} compounds, {{such as the}} triorganoboranes. Vinyl groups and aryl groups donate electrons and make boron less electrophilic and the C-B bond gains some double bond character.
