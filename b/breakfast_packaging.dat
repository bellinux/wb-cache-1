40|$|Food {{packaging}} {{has evolved}} from simply a container to hold food to something today that can {{play an active role}} in various aspects. As we all know, packaging today {{plays an important role in}} the quality of food products by providing protection from environmental. Food packaging itself can retard product deterioration, retain the beneficial effects of processing, extend shelf-life, and maintain or increase the quality and safety of food. Besides that, packaging is a communication device providing details about the product, including price, contents, Ingredients and nutritional value as well as cooking instructions and recommended use by dates (Ahmed, Ahmed & Salman 2005). Furthermore, a package is the face of a product and often' is the only product exposure consumers experience prior to purchase. Consequently, distinctive or innovative packaging can boost sales in a competitive environment. The package may be designed to enhance the product image and/or to differentiate the product from the competition. The package also can be design to make foods to be easier and faster to consume as we are living in a generation where time flew very fast. With that purpose, this current study focuses on an exploration in people's views on the product design that will very much benefit in a person's busy lifestyle. This study adopts questionnaire research method which 'is often seem a logical and easy option as a way of collecting information from people. In addition, large amounts of information can be collected from a large number of people in a short period of time and in a relatively cost effective way. The result of this study indicates that innovation in <b>breakfast</b> <b>packaging</b> should be done, because it make life more easier and help student to get the nutrition in early in the morning...|$|E

Beets may turn feces different hues of red. Artificial food coloring in some processed foods, such as highly colorful <b>packaged</b> <b>breakfast</b> cereals, can cause unusual coloring of feces if eaten in sufficient quantities.|$|R

40|$|What are the {{symbolic}} meanings of {{breakfast in the}} context of one of Australia’s largest childhood obesity intervention programs? Utilizing a range of theoretical insights into the morality of food and eating and the anthropology of food, we trace how <b>breakfast</b> is <b>packaged</b> and promoted to families in an Australian community as a ‘healthy start’ to the day. Through ethnographic and historic investigation, we argue that eating breakfast and certain types of breakfast foods are symbolic of a classed, healthy lifestyle pattern, embodying parental knowledge and bodily regulation to routinely structure daily life. In communities where poverty and unemployment are harsh realities, well-intentioned programs that encourage people to eat a healthy breakfast are encoded with an assemblage of moral values - of knowledge, foods, families, and times and spaces - that are often difficult to reconcile with the wider sociocultural context in which many people live.

40|$|How is {{a product}} that is {{essentially}} in the colour range of beige to brown presented through packaging? How do colours of package graphics enhance the product and differentiate it from its competitors? How do companies that market breakfast cereal present their products and ranges, to successfully compete for consumer choice from the supermarket shelf? In investigating these questions the use of colour in <b>breakfast</b> cereal <b>packaging</b> in Australia was assessed, visually and numerically, to identify colour characteristics, the most often used and the most proportionally used colours. Nineteen mixed cereals were selected; and included four brands Uncle Toby's, Kellogg's, Sanitarium and Vogel's. Visual analysis of the cereal packaging front face identified significant characteristics. The predominant colour reflected the content or {{the context of the}} cereal, while the brand range identity remained consistent. The numerical analysis assessed both the most often used and most proportionally used colours. The results showed that the two top ranked colours in both categories were white/cream and 'cereal' (brown/beige). Arts, Education & Law Group, Queensland College of ArtNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} ‘tail-greedy’, {{bottom-up}} transform for one-dimensional data, {{which results in}} a nonlinear but conditionally orthonormal, multiscale decomposition of the data with respect to an adaptively chosen Unbalanced Haar wavelet basis. The ‘tail-greediness’of the decomposition algorithm, whereby multiple greedy steps are taken {{in a single pass}} through the data, both enables fast computation and makes the algorithm applicable in the problem of consistent estimation of the number and locations of multiple changepoints in data. The resulting agglomerative change-point detection method avoids the disadvantages of the classical divisive binary segmentation, and offers very good practical performance.

40|$|Excess {{added sugar}} {{consumption}} {{is tied to}} poor health outcomes in children. The sugar content of beverages and foods children are exposed to is mostly unknown, yet this information is imperative for understanding potential risks from overconsumption of sugars in early life. We determined actual sugar content by conducting a blinded laboratory analysis in infant formulas, <b>breakfast</b> cereals, <b>packaged</b> baked goods and yogurts. One hundred samples were sent to an independent laboratory for analysis via gas chromatography. Sugar content and composition was determined and total sugar was compared against nutrition labels. Of the 100 samples analyzed, 74 % contained ≥ 20 % of total calories per serving from added sugars. Nutrient label data underestimated or overestimated actual sugars and ~ 25 % of all samples had actual total sugar values that were either 10 % of labeled total sugar. Many products that are frequently marketed to and consumed by infants and young children contain sugars in amounts that differ from nutrition labels and often in excess of recommended daily levels. These findings provide further support for adding more comprehensive sugar labeling to food and beverage products, specifically those marketed to, or commonly consumed by, children...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{processes}} {{have many}} sources of variation; {{most of them}} are minor and may be ignored. If the dominant sources of variation are identified, however, resources for change can be focused on them.If the dominant assignable sources of variation are detected, potentially they can be identified and removed. Once removed, the process is said to be [...] "stable". When a process is stable, its variation should remain within a known set of limits. That is, at least, until another assignable source of variation occurs.For example, a <b>breakfast</b> cereal <b>packaging</b> line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500 grams of cereal. Some boxes will have slightly more than 500 grams, and some will have slightly less. When the package weights are measured, the data will demonstrate a distribution of net weights.If the production process, its inputs, or its environment (for example, the machines on the line) change, the distribution of the data will change. For example, as the cams and pulleys of the machinery wear, the cereal filling machine may put more than the specified amount of cereal into each box. Although this might benefit the customer, from the manufacturer's point of view, this is wasteful and increases the cost of production. If the manufacturer finds the change and its source in a timely manner, the change can be corrected (for example, the cams and pulleys replaced).|$|R
6000|$|He {{said the}} {{objection}} to advertising signs {{was only a}} rich man's aristocratic hobby, {{and that it could}} not be indulged in a democratic community of honest people. His own firm, he said, bought thousands of bushels of oats from the farmers and converted them into the celebrated Eagle-Eye <b>Breakfast</b> Food, three <b>packages</b> for a quarter. They sold this breakfast food to thousands of farmers, to give them health and strength to harvest another crop of oats. Thus he [...] "benefited the community going and coming." [...] What! Should he not advertise this mutual-benefit commodity wherever he pleased, and especially among the farmers? What aristocratic notion could prevent him? It was a mighty good thing for the farmers to be reminded, by means of the signs on their barns and fences, of the things they needed in daily life.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Packaged</b> <b>breakfast</b> cereals were {{considerably}} more convenient than {{a product that}} had to be cooked {{and as a result of}} this convenience (and clever marketing), they became popular. Battle Creek, Michigan was a center both of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and of innovation in the ready-to-eat cereal industry. And indeed, the church had a substantial impact on the development of cereal goods through the person of John Harvey Kellogg (1851-1943). Son of an Adventist factory owner in Battle Creek, Kellogg was encouraged by his church to train in medicine at Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York City in 1875. After graduating, he became medical superintendent at the Western Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek, established in 1866 by the Adventists to offer their natural remedies for illness. Many wealthy industrialists came to Kellogg's sanitarium for recuperation and rejuvenation. They were accustomed to breakfasts of ham, eggs, sausages, fried potatoes, hot biscuits, hotcakes, and coffee.|$|R
5000|$|The Food Scandal {{took the}} {{findings}} of the NACNE report and popularised them for a general audience. Prefiguring Michael Pollan, Walker and Cannon argued that the [...] "basic message about food and health" [...] could be stated in one sentence: [...] "For good health, eat whole, fresh food; and prefer food of vegetable origin." [...] The book pointed out how far the British diet in 1984 departed from this ideal, noting for example that since the 1950s the British ate half as much porridge and twice as much <b>packaged</b> <b>breakfast</b> cereal. They also noted that the British ate a [...] "miserable 2 1/2 ounces of fresh fruit" [...] per day and just 4 ounces of fresh vegetables. [...] "Think what that might look like: the odd onion, a couple of carrots, a few sprouts." [...] The Food Scandal also exposed adulterations, such as the addition of water to sausages and bacon; and exposed the prevalence of mechanically recovered meat in the British food supply.|$|R

40|$|Background: Portion size {{of foods}} is {{reported}} {{to contribute to the}} rise in obesity prevalence. However, evidence of changes in portion size for commonly consumed foods in Australia is lacking. The aim was to evaluate whether Australian child and adolescent portion sizes of selected foods changed from 1995 to 2007. Methods: Time-series study, comparing dietary data from two national cross-sectional surveys in nationally representative population survey of Australian households. The dietary data was from children aged 2 – 16 years who participated in the 1995 National Nutrition Survey (n[*]=[*] 2198) and 2007 Australian National Children’s Nutrition and Physical Activity Survey (n[*]=[*] 4799). Results: Differences were found across survey years in median portion size of common foods and beverages assessed by 24 -hour recalls for age and sex categories. Of the 61 foods items evaluated across the whole population sample, portion size increased in 18 items, decreased in 22, with no change in 20, although the magnitude of change varied by age and sex. Decreases in portion size were detected for most dairy products, <b>breakfast</b> cereal, some <b>packaged</b> snack foods and vegetables, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001. Increases were detected for cooked chicken, mixed chicken dishes, bacon and ham (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001), cooked meat (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), fish (p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and pizza (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). No significant changes were detected for many items including white and wholemeal bread, mincemeat, chocolate and soft drink. Conclusions: Small changes in portion sizes were detected over 12 years in Australian children and adolescents with the degree of change varying by sex, age and food group. Knowledge of usual portion sizes could inform programs targeting appropriate serving sizes selection in children and adolescents...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} the rate and costs of labour turnover in the five star hotel industry in Tanzania. This research study is conducted in Serena hotel as one of the big five rated star hotel in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. The study adopted descriptive survey research design. Simple random sampling method was used to pick respondents for this study. In this research, data were collected from 120 hotel employees in Serena hotel. Total number of respondents were required to answer the questionnaires and other data regarding total number of hotel employees, annual turnover number, annual replacement costs and hotel department line budgets for meeting the costs of replacing employees were provided by Human resource manager by filling data form and through in depth interview. The results indicated that, labour turnover was lower for (5 %) in the five star-rated hotels. The hotel manages to control the supervision and administration cost by reducing the number of employees who are less reliable, low committed and poor performers through dismissal and redundancy. Also the researcher found that, there are strategies for human resource employment in Serena hotel that has been taken for attracting, developing and retaining employees such as hiring employees with good qualifications and working experience that fit the right person to the job. Providing different extra off, <b>breakfast</b> and lunch <b>package,</b> welfare loan system and compensation package. The research will assist larger and smaller hotels to reduce high labour turnover by adopting systematic HRM strategies, to monitor their costs closely and use the research findings information to manage human capital more effectively, to allocate resources well and to adopt better ways of managing and retaining employees...|$|R
40|$|THE {{nutritive value}} of cereal foods has been {{extensively}} studied in the past, but {{since the publication of}} Woods and Snyder's bulletin (1906) and Harcourt's paper (1907) there has been no general sur vey of the cereal breakfast foods in common use in comparison with one another and scarcely any study exists where the human subject has been used for comparison of these articles with other staple articles of diet. Meantime many new methods of study have been devised and new concep tions of food values have been acquired. The modern conception of the bio logical value of protein dates from 1909, and the entire, enormous litera ture on the vitamins has accumulated since 1912. Many conclusions re garding the vitamin values and protein values of cereal foods have been established by means of experiments on lower mammals;but there remains a considerable number of questions of nutritive value, both within and without these fields, which can be appropriately studied on the human subject. In the semi-scientific literature on foods and diets there are found not infrequently hints that the "super milling " and other processing, such as the sterilization with heat, steaming in preparation for rolling, crushing, toasting, crisping, and the like, to which our <b>package</b> <b>breakfast</b> foods are subjected, are really devitalizing in their effects and therefore destructive of important nutritive properties Is this a correct picture, or to what extent have the nutritive properties been affected by the modern milling and packing methods?
