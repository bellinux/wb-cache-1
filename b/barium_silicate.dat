Both silicates are found in a black organic-rich chert sequence in close association with baryte. No replacement textures are observed between the three Ba-minerals. The hydrated Ba-silicate in the unmetamorphosed rock sequence of the Navarana Fjord area is considered to represent a member in a sequence of Ba-silicates from the unknown Ba-silicate with four H 20 in the structure (BaAI 2 Si 2 Os- 4 H 20), through cymrite with one H 20 (BaA 12 -Si 20208 -H 20) to celsian with none (BaAl_~Si 2 Os).
