5000|$|Classification of the Xanthomonas {{species that}} cause <b>bacterial</b> leaf <b>spot</b> is {{currently}} in flux. Up {{until a few years}} ago, <b>bacterial</b> leaf <b>spot</b> causing Xanthomonads were divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D, based on pathogenicity and physiological characteristics.

50|$|Environment plays a {{large role}} in <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> of pepper and tomato. The {{bacterium}} requires high levels of humidity {{to such an extent that}} infected plants may not begin to show symptoms until several days after infection if ambient humidity is low. Xanthamonas campestris pv. Vesicatoria is a large problem in greenhouses and nurseries where very high humidity and warm temperatures provide a good environment for the bacteria to grow and wet soils easily transmit the disease from plant to plant. Overcrowding in propagation facilities also increases the likelihood of spreading this disease when an infected plant comes into physical contact with its neighbors.|$|E
50|$|The avrBs2 {{effector}} gene from Xanthomona perforans is {{the causal}} agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> disease of pepper and tomato. The first “effector-rationalized” {{search for a}} potentially durable R gene followed the finding that avrBs2 is found in most disease-causing Xanthomonas species and is required for pathogen fitness. The Bs2 NLR gene from the wild pepper, Capsicum chacoense, was moved into tomato, where it inhibited pathogen growth. Field trials demonstrated robust resistance without bactericidal chemicals. However, rare strains of Xanthomonas overcame Bs2-mediated resistance in pepper by acquisition of avrBs2 mutations that avoid recognition but retain virulence. Stacking R genes that each recognize a different core effector could delay or prevent adaptation.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment for <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> of pepper and tomato {{is a combination of}} chemical applications. Diseased seeds may be treated with sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, or trisodium phosphate to kill bacteria {{on the surface of the}} seed. Treating internal seed infection is harder but can be done with other chemical or heat treatments. Infected fields are treated with multiple application approach involving spraying a mixture of copper and mancozeb, which prevents further infection and kills a variety of pathogens present at the time of spraying. Finally, there is some research being done into the foliar application of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to control the disease but this approach has been met with some resistance and is not currently a widely used method.|$|E
50|$|The insecticidal toxin {{from the}} {{bacterium}} Bacillus thuringiensis has been inserted into a tomato plant. When field tested they showed {{resistance to the}} tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), tomato fruitworm (Heliothis zea), the tomato pinworm (Keiferia lycopersicella) and the tomato fruit borer (Helicoverpa armigera). A 91-day feeding trial in rats showed no adverse effects, but the Bt tomato has never been commercialised. Tomatoes resistant to a root knot nematode have been created by inserting a cysteine proteinase inhibitor gene from taro. A chemically synthesised ceropin B gene, usually found in the giant silk moth (Hyalophora cecropia), has been introduced into tomato plants and in vivo studies show significant resistance to bacterial wilt and <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot.</b> When the cell wall proteins, polygalacturonase and expansin are prevented from being produced in fruits, they are less susceptible to the fungus Botrytis cinerea than normal tomatoes.

5000|$|Apricots are {{susceptible}} to various diseases whose relative importance is different in the major production regions {{as a consequence of}} their climatic differences. For example, hot weather as experienced in California's Central Valley will often cause pit burn, a condition of soft and brown fruit around the pit. Bacterial diseases include <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> and crown gall. Fungal diseases include brown rot caused by Monilinia fructicola: infection of the blossom by rainfall leads to [...] "blossom wilt" [...] whereby the blossoms and young shoots turn brown and die; the twigs die back in a severe attack; brown rot of the fruit is due to Monilinia infection later in the season. Dieback of branches in the summer is attributed to the fungus Eutypa lata, where examination of the base of the dead branch will reveal a canker surrounding a pruning wound. Other fungal diseases are black knot, Alternaria spot and fruit rot, and powdery mildew. Unlike peaches, apricots are not affected by leaf curl, and bacterial canker (causing sunken patches in the bark which then spread and kill the affected branch or tree) and silver leaf are not serious threats, which means that pruning in late winter is considered safe.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> of tomato, {{caused by}} Xanthomonas spp., {{is a common}} disease in tomato fields that causes {{significant}} economic losses. Due to the difficulty with control of <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> by conventional methods, new techniques such as biological control and induction of resistance are gaining prominence. This study aimed to select saprobe fungi from semi-arid regions of the Brazilian Northeast for the biological control of <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> of tomato. To select the best isolates to control <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot,</b> a greenhouse experiment was initially conducted. Tomato plants (‘Santa Cruz Kada’) were treated with filtrates of 25 saprobe fungi and inoculated three days later with Xanthomonas euvesicatoria. Filtrates of Memnoniella levispora, Periconia hispidula, Zygosporium echinosporum, and Chloridium virescens var. virescens were selected as the most effective. Filtrates and volatile compounds from these four isolates were tested for their antibacterial activity in cultures of X. euvesicatoria and in tomato plants (‘Santa Cruz Kada’) inoculated with X. euvesicatoria. In vitro, the addition of nonvolatile fungal metabolites into the culture medium at 5 % and 50 % (v/v) inhibited bacterial growth by 28. 9 % and 53. 8 %, respectively. The volatile compounds produced by C. virescens var. virescens {{reduced the number of}} colony-forming units of X. euvesicatoria by 25. 9 %. In vivo, all treatments reduced from 62. 4 to 71. 3 % the area under <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> progress curve, showing the same control efficacy as the commercial resistance inducer used as a positive control (acibenzolar-S-methyl). Systemicity of the fungal filtrates was confirmed in a separate experiment, where application of the treatments exclusively to the third leaf decreased the severity of the disease on the fourth leaf (except for C. virescens var. virescens). These results show that M. levispora, P. hispidula, Z. echinosporum, and C. virescens var. virescens are potential biocontrol agents against <b>bacterial</b> <b>spot</b> of tomato.
