5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover with a visual reference for the divers' position.

5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). <b>Bars</b> <b>are</b> thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E

5|$|Treaties {{with the}} Maasai in 1904 and 1911 {{forced them to}} give up all of their {{northern}} grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya.

Some of the park's revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park.

25|$|Marimba <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} made {{of either}} wood or synthetic material. Rosewood {{is the most}} desirable, while Padauk is a popular affordable alternative. Bars made from synthetic materials generally fall short in sound quality in comparison to wooden bars, but are less expensive and yield added durability and weather resistance, making them suitable for outdoor use; marimbas with wooden <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> usually played inside because the <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to pitch change due to weather. Bubinga (Guibourtia demeusei) and mahogany have also been cited as comparable to rosewood in quality for use as marimba bars. The specific rosewood, Dalbergia stevensonii, only grows in Southern Guatemala and Belize, formerly the British Honduras. This wood has a Janka rating of 2200, which is about three times harder than Silver Maple. The <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> wider and longer at the lowest pitched notes, and gradually get narrower and shorter as the notes get higher. During the tuning, wood is taken from the middle underside of the bar to lower the pitch. Because of this, the <b>bars</b> <b>are</b> also thinner in the lowest pitch register and thicker in the highest pitch register.|$|E
