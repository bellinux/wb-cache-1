30|$|A {{total of}} 7 {{patients}} (4 non idiopathic feet and 3 idiopathic feet) had pressure-related {{problems in their}} <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> bars, 5 with EPUAP (European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel) stage 1 and 2 with stage 3 sores {{at the back of}} their heels. Both stage 3 sores resolved with dressings and time out of <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> bars. The majority of non-idiopathic feet were managed in the soft Mitchell <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> bars (C-Pro Direct Ltd, Kent, UK) as the feet were held securely and the position of the heel could be checked easily. Semeda <b>boots</b> <b>and</b> bars (Semeda E.K., Stoetze, Germany) with soft heel inserts were used if pressure problems were experienced. Idiopathic feet were generally held in the Markell boots (Kettering Surgical Appliances Ltd, Northampton, UK) as they were more cost-effective and similar clinical results were seen with this patient group [23].|$|R
