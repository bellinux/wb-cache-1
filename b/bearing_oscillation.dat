40|$|The {{vibration}} of a statically loaded, inherently compensated {{hydrostatic journal}} bearing due to oscillating supply pressure is investigated. Both angular and radial vibration modes are analyzed. The time-dependent Reynolds equation governing the pressure distribution between the oscillating journal and the sleeve is solved numerically {{together with the}} journal equation of motion to obtain the response characteristics of the bearing. The Reynolds equation and the equation of motion are simplified by applying regular perturbation theory for small displacements. The results presented include Bode plots of <b>bearing</b> <b>oscillation</b> gain and phase for a particular bearing configuration for various combinations of parameters over a range of frequencies, including the resonant frequency. The results are compared {{with the results of}} an earlier study involving the response of a similar bearing to oscillating exhaust pressure...|$|E

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{equations}} well describe averaged {{parameters of}} turbulent steady flows, {{at least in}} pipes where boundary conditions can be estimated. The equations might outline the parameters fluctuations as well, if entry conditions at current boundaries were known. This raises, in addition, the more comprehensive problem of the primary perturbation nature, noted by H. A. Lorentz, which still remains unsolved. Generally, any flow steadiness should be supported by pressure waves emitted by some external source, e. g. a piston or a receiver. The wave plane front in channels quickly takes convex configuration owing to Rayleigh's law of diffraction divergence. The Schlieren technique and pressure wave registration were employed to investigate the wave interaction with boundary layer, while reflecting from the channel wall. The reflection induces boundary-layer local separation and following pressure rapid increase within the perturbation zone. It propagates as an acoustic wave packet of spherical shape, <b>bearing</b> <b>oscillations</b> of hydrodynamic parameters. Superposition of such packets forms a spatio-temporal field of oscillations fading as 1 /r. This implies a mechanism of the turbulence. Vorticity existing in the boundary layer does not penetrate in itself into potential main stream. But the wave leaving the boundary layer carries away some part of fluid along with frozen-in vorticity. The vorticity eddies form another field of oscillations fading as 1 /r 2. This implies a second mechanism of turbulence. Thereupon the oscillation spatio-temporal field and its randomization development are easy computed. Also, normal burning transition into detonation is explained, and the turbulence inverse problem is set and solved as applied to plasma channels created by laser Besselian beams...|$|R
40|$|Analysis and {{operation}} of prototype 500 -Wh flywheel at low speeds have shown that many factors affect the correct functioning of the magnetic bearings. An examination is made {{of a number of}} these, including magnetic bearing control system nonlinearities and displacement transducer positioning, and their effects upon the successful operation of the suspension system. It is observed that the bearing control system is extremely sensitive to actuator parameters such as coil inductance. As a consequence of the analysis of <b>bearing</b> relaxation <b>oscillations,</b> the <b>bearing</b> actuator design methodology which has previously been used, where coil parameter selection is based upon static considerations, has been revised. Displacement transducer sensors which overcome the collocation problem are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which can be}} used to calculate dynamic gear tooth force and bearing forces. The model includes elastic bearings. The gear mesh stiffness and the path of contact are determined using the deformations of the gears and the bearings. This gives contact outside the plane-of-action and a time-varying working pressure angle. In a numerical example it is found that the only important vibration mode for the gear contact is the one where the gear tooth deformation is dominant. The bearing force variation, however, will be much more affected by the other vibration modes. The influence of the friction force is also studied. The friction has no dynamic influence on the gear contact force or on the bearing force in the gear mesh line-of-action direction. On the other hand, the changing of sliding directions in the pitch point is a source for critical <b>oscillations</b> of the <b>bearings</b> in the gear tooth frictional direction. These <b>bearing</b> force <b>oscillations</b> in the frictional direction appear unaffected by the dynamic response along the gear mesh line-of-action direction. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A simple linear {{dynamical}} model {{shows that}} at normal running speeds of freight wagons, forced oscillations due to periodic track compliance are {{transferred to the}} overlying unsprung mass and significantly amplified. Due to these oscillations, a small gap opens and closes between the collar of a journal bearing and the axle box many times every second. The forces between these components reach peaks of over 10 tonnes. This is {{an environment in which}} wear of the soft spherical graphite iron of the axle box will eventually take place. Due to repeated unloadings of the weight on the <b>bearing</b> during <b>oscillations,</b> the <b>bearing</b> collar may slowly slip against the axle box wall. Although our calculations show that abrasive wear due to this slippage is negligible, the calculation raises general principles that apply to other possible wear mechanisms. If lifetime is proportional to hardness, we can estimate relative lifetimes of refurbished and new boxes. Although the resleeve material is softer than the original, the cost to lifetime ratio would favour refurbishment under this assumption. Important unanswered questions are identified and a specific integrated program of field, laboratory, and theoretical study is suggested...|$|R
40|$|To {{make the}} hydro power {{application}} more environmentally adapted new EALs such as synthetic esters {{will replace the}} existing mineral oils. This study aims to exploit the EALs potential in boundary lubrication, especially in slow sliding journal <b>bearings</b> with shaft <b>oscillation</b> as those supporting the Kaplan turbine blades. In order to evaluate the performance of different lubricated environmentally adapted journal bearings a test rig was built. Many test rig parameters were set to simulate water turbine conditions. Tests were performed with different bearing and shaft materials and different lubricants suited for water turbine application, EALs, water with and the present used mineral oil reference. Additional lubricated tests in oscillating motion were conducted with a roller on disc and a pin on disc. All tests were performed with oscillating motion. The results showed that synthetic esters affect the contact material to a larger extent than the tested mineral oil. The synthetic esters were also sensitive to the selection of bearing and shaft material. Highly alloyed bronzes were more prone to corrosive wear. A coated shaft showed excellent performance with a low alloyed tin bronze. The comparison of self lubricated bearings with water lubrication to an EAL lubricated tin bronze on stainless steel showed large performance differences between the water lubricated materials. They showed both better and worse friction and wear results than the EAL lubricated tin bronze. The oscillating pin on disc can generate similar contact mechanisms as in a journal bearing. The most important conclusion of this work {{is that it is}} possible to find self lubricated journal bearings better suited for shaft oscillation than EAL lubricated bronze bearings in water turbine application. Water lubricated design of the bearings are the most environmentally adapted solution. EALs such as the tested synthetic esters have a promising future in the hydraulic systems controlling the turbines and can under certain boundary lubrication conditions with bronze show excellent performance.
