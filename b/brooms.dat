5|$|Tunbridge Wells town {{historically}} {{had three}} railway stations: {{two of these}} are still in use by National Rail services. Tunbridge Wells station is, as its former name of Tunbridge Wells Central suggests, centrally located within the town {{at the end of}} the High Street, whilst High <b>Brooms</b> station is situated in High <b>Brooms,</b> to the north of the town. Both stations are located on the double-tracked electrified Hastings Line; services are operated by the Southeastern train operating company.|$|E
5|$|Nearby villages {{have been}} subsumed into the {{built-up}} {{area of the}} town, so that now it incorporates High <b>Brooms</b> to the north, Hawkenbury to the south, and Rusthall (whose name resonates with the iron content of the rocks) to the west.|$|E
5|$|During ashfall events large {{demands are}} {{commonly}} placed on water resources for cleanup and shortages can result. Shortages compromise key {{services such as}} firefighting {{and can lead to}} a lack of water for hygiene, sanitation and drinking. Municipal authorities need to monitor and manage this water demand carefully, and may need to advise the public to utilise cleanup methods that do not use water (e.g., cleaning with <b>brooms</b> rather than hoses).|$|E
50|$|Species of <b>broom</b> {{popular in}} {{horticulture}} are purple <b>broom</b> (Chamaecytisus purpureus; purple flowers), Atlas <b>broom</b> (or Moroccan <b>broom)</b> (Argyrocytisus battandieri, with silvery foliage), dwarf <b>broom</b> (Cytisus procumbens), Provence <b>broom</b> (Cytisus purgans) and Spanish <b>broom</b> (Spartium junceum).|$|R
50|$|Biological {{control for}} <b>broom</b> has been {{investigated}} since the mid-1980s {{with a number of}} species being trialled. They include the <b>broom</b> twig miner (Leucoptera spartifoliella), the <b>broom</b> seed beetle (Bruchidius villosus), the <b>broom</b> gall mite (Aceria genistae), the sap-sucking <b>broom</b> psyllid (Arytainilla spartiophila), the Scotch <b>broom</b> seed weevil (Exapion fuscirostre) and recently the <b>broom</b> leaf beetle (Gonioctena olivacea) and the <b>broom</b> shoot moth (Agonopterix assimilella).|$|R

5|$|Three {{days after}} the hurricane, the American Red Cross sent an initial {{donation}} of $25,000 (1997USD), and also sent plastic sheets for temporary roofing and cleaning supplies such as mops, <b>brooms,</b> buckets, sponges, bleach, and cleaning chemicals. Local chapters also offered assistance. The chapter in San Antonio, Texas sent cleaning kits, and the chapter in Los Angeles delivered 2,000comfort kits containing hygiene supplies and crossword puzzles for children. The German Red Cross also offered assistance.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{is used to}} {{construct}} carts, farm implements, boats, dugout canoes and in shipbuilding. It is used for making furniture, tool handles, boxes, ladders, musical instruments, bows, weapons, matches, clothes pegs, <b>brooms,</b> shoes, baskets, turnery, carving, toys, pencils, rollers, cogs, wooden screws, barrels, coffins, skittles, veneers, artificial limbs, oars, skis, wooden spoons, sports equipment and wooden balls.|$|E
5|$|The {{branches}} of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's <b>brooms</b> growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists {{the growth of the}} tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.|$|E
50|$|Cytisus scoparius, {{the common}} <b>broom</b> or Scotch <b>broom,</b> syn. Sarothamnus scoparius, is a {{perennial}} leguminous shrub native to western and central Europe. In Britain and Ireland, the standard name is <b>broom,</b> but this name {{is also used}} for {{other members of the}} Genisteae tribe, such as French <b>broom</b> or Spanish <b>broom,</b> and the term common <b>broom</b> is sometimes used for clarification. In other English-speaking countries, the most prevalent common name is Scotch <b>broom</b> (or Scot's broom); English <b>broom</b> is also occasionally used.|$|R

5000|$|The {{village has}} two pubs, <b>Broom</b> Hall Inn and <b>Broom</b> Tavern, with <b>Broom</b> Hall Inn being larger in size. Many reviewers have stated the local village as [...] "peaceful, tranquil, yet {{surprisingly}} popular". Reviews of <b>Broom</b> Hall are given as 8.6/10. <b>Broom</b> Tavern {{has recently been}} re-furbished and is now re-open.|$|R
5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and <b>brooms</b> cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is sprinkled over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous tree that owes its common {{name to the}} white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, {{and one of the}} first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and <b>brooms.</b> Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.|$|E
25|$|There {{are other}} {{variants}} of real-life Quidditch, notably played in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Hungary amongst other places. These variants often play with rules {{similar to the}} fictional sport within the Harry Potter universe but differ wildly from the IQA rules, including but not limited to: playing without <b>brooms,</b> <b>brooms</b> serving a different purpose, referees throwing balls to act as snitches, differing bludger and beater roles, riding bicycles instead of <b>brooms,</b> etc.|$|E

50|$|On {{the east}} and west coasts of North America, common <b>broom</b> was {{introduced}} as an ornamental plant (i.e.:California since the 1860s). It is known in much of the pacific northwest as Scotch <b>broom.</b> It has become a naturalised invasive weed, and due to its aggressive seed dispersal <b>broom</b> removal has proved very difficult. Similarly, it is a major problem species in the cooler and wetter areas of southern Australia and New Zealand. Biological control for <b>broom</b> in New Zealand has been investigated since the mid-1980s. On the west coast of the United States, French <b>broom</b> (Genista monspessulana), Mediterranean <b>broom</b> (Genista linifolia) and Spanish <b>broom</b> (Spartium junceum) are also considered noxious invasives, as <b>broom</b> quickly crowds out native vegetation, and grow most prolifically in the least accessible areas.|$|R
