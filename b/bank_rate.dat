5|$|In {{multiple}} steps during 2012–2013, the ECB {{lowered its}} <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> to historical lows, reaching 0.25% in November 2013. Soon after the rates were shaved to 0.15%, then on 4 September 2014 {{the central bank}} shocked financial markets by cutting the razor-thin rates by a further two thirds from 0.15% to 0.05%, the lowest on record. The moves were designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that lower cost of money would {{be passed on to}} businesses taking out loans, boosting investment in the economy. The lowered borrowing rates caused the euro to fall in relation to other currencies, which it was hoped would boost exports from the eurozone.|$|E

25|$|In 1967, the British economy {{suffered}} from several difficulties. Despite tax increases announced in July 1966, the 1967 budget {{had set the}} greatest deficit in post-war history of £1,000,000,000. Each month, the Board of Trade published figures of the 'balance of trade' between exports and imports which seemed to show an ever-increasing deficit. The closure of the Suez Canal after the Six-Day War hit exporters, as did an unofficial dock strike, which broke {{out at the end}} of September. Having put up the <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> to 6 percent on 19 October, on 18 November, the government abandoned three years of attempting to maintain the exchange rate and devalued the pound sterling from $2.80 to $2.40. Although it was an economic defeat, devaluation was perceived as an export opportunity that British industry needed to seize.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November, Callaghan {{gave his}} first budget and {{announced}} increases in income tax, petrol tax {{and the introduction}} of a new capital gains tax, actions which most economists deemed necessary to take the heat out of the balance and sterling deficit. The budget also contained measures to increase the state pension, a measure which was disliked by the City and speculators, causing a run on the pound. On 23 November, it was decided to increase the <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> from 2% to 7% which generated a large amount of criticism. Handling the crisis was made more difficult by the attitude of Lord Cromer, the Governor of the Bank of England, who argued against the fiscal policies of the new Labour government. When Callaghan and Wilson threatened to call a new general election, the governor soon raised a £3billion loan to stabilise the reserves and the deficit.|$|E
25|$|The {{damage was}} {{relatively}} short-lived. Macmillan's position improved {{within a few}} months of the affair. Butler was moved from the position of Home Secretary and appointed First Secretary of State. Macmillan made out that it was the equivalent of Deputy Prime Minister, a post that had lapsed after 1955. It was in actuality a demotion. Butler was tasked with overseeing the Central African Office, which moved him away from the more powerful state offices. With Lloyd replaced as Chancellor by Maudling, Macmillan pushed ahead with reflation. The more cautious Lloyd had rejected reflation because of the risk of ultimately damaging the economy with a balance of payments crisis. Maudling however was prepared to accept the devaluation of sterling and the placement of controls on imports to stave off this eventuality. By the time of the party conference Macmillan's popularity within his party had largely recovered. Maudling reversed Lloyd's austerity measures that November, following this up with cutting the tax on motor cars, and reducing the <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> and purchase tax. In the Spring 1963 budget he abolished the Schedule A tax, one of the main causes of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives, and a move which Lloyd had resisted. Liberal fortunes, which rested largely on the unpopularity of these policies, declined thereafter. Labour recovered by early 1963 as the exceptionally harsh winter that year drove up unemployment and the economy unexpectedly faltered.|$|E

There are two methods {{that can be used to}} assess the risk based <b>bank</b> <b>rating,</b> namely CAMEL (Capital, Asset, Management, Equity and Liquidity) and RBBR (Risk Based <b>Bank</b> <b>Rating)</b> methods. This study aims to compare the risk based <b>bank</b> <b>rating</b> of Islamic <b>banks</b> and conventional banks after the crisis by using CAMEL and RBBR period 2009 - 2015. This research is descriptive with quantitative approach, samples of this research are five Islamic banks and five conventional banks.

The hypothesis of this study is a significant difference between Islamic banks and conventional banks after the global crisis period 2009 - 2015, by using CAMEL and RBBR methods. Based on the research using the CAMEL in Islamic banks, period 2009 - 2013 and 2015 are into the first rank, 2014 in the second rank, while for conventional bank is always in the first rank during 2009 - 2015.

2500|$|Upon the {{parallel}} introduction of quantitative easing and interest on excess reserves in 2009, banks {{were no longer}} required to set out a target, and so were no longer penalised for holding excess reserves; indeed, they were proportionally compensated for holding all their reserves at the <b>Bank</b> <b>Rate</b> (the Bank of England now uses the same interest rate for its <b>bank</b> <b>rate,</b> its deposit rate and its interest rate target).

40|$|There {{is little}} {{disagreement}} among economists that monetary policy affects {{the rate of}} inflation and, {{at least in the short}} run, the level of real economic activity. From an operational perspective, many central banks currently target a short-term market interest rate. This is done on the premise that this instrument is linked more or less stably to the final objectives of monetary policy through the so-called transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Most of the literature on the transmission mechanism of mon-etary policy implicitly assumes that once the monetary authority’s target rate is changed, short-term market and retail <b>banking</b> <b>rates</b> will follow suit—that is, there will be immediate and complete “pass-through ” to retail <b>banking</b> <b>rates</b> (see, for example, Bernanke and Gertler, 1995; Bernanke and Gilchrist, 1999). If the pass-through to <b>banking</b> interest <b>rates</b> were sluggish or incomplete, those specific channels of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy that op-erate through <b>banking</b> <b>rates</b> would also be affected. Stickiness of retail <b>banking</b> interest <b>rates</b> was first documented in the United States by Hannan and Berger (1991) and Neumark and Sharpe (1992).

FECs were used until 1999, then officially abolished in 2002, in favor of visitors paying directly with hard currency, especially the euro. Since at least 2012 foreigners (and [...] privileged locals) can buy goods priced in 'tied' won using a local debit card, which they have to credit with exchanging foreign currency (Euro, United States dollar or Renminbi/Yuan) at the official <b>bank</b> <b>rate.</b> One euro would provide a credit of 130 won. This card can be used for instance at the famous Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes. In normal stores and markets goods are priced in what has been called the 'untied' won or free market rate and regular banknotes can be used here. At for instance the Tongil Market and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 10,000 won for one euro (2012) to locals and foreigners alike, so almost 77 times as much as the tied rate. However, the prices in the normal shops outside the tied won and restricted state shops are also based on this untied won rate.|$|E

The existence of money market links {{has important implications for}} both domestic monetary policy and for investment decisions. This study examines the linkages between South Africa’s money market and selected major international money markets. The objectives of the study are firstly to examine the links between the repo rate of South Africa and the central <b>bank</b> <b>rates</b> of the EU, Japan, UK and US. Secondly, is to compare the influence of domestic and foreign monetary policy decisions on South Africa’s money market. The third objective is to examine the long run relationship between the South African money market and the money markets of its major trading partners. Three estimation techniques are used to examine the different links. Principal components analysis, four tests of cointegration, and stationarity tests of the spreads/risk premium between South Africa’s interest rates and the interest rates of the other countries. All three techniques show that there is no long-run link between South Africa’s central <b>bank</b> <b>rates</b> and the central <b>bank</b> <b>rates</b> of the other countries. This shows that the repo rate does not depend on movements in other central <b>bank</b> <b>rates.</b> Domestic money market interest rates respond strongly to changes in the repo rate whilst showing no dependence on central <b>bank</b> <b>rates</b> of the other countries. This confirms the autonomy of the South African Reserve Bank in carrying out policy objectives. When the risk premium is accounted for under the third technique, evidence of integration is found. This indicates that the risk premium plays a crucial part in the level of integration between South Africa and the countries included in the study. ...|$|R
