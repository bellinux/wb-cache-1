5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at the <b>best</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E

Government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in Baghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their countries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs. Despite strong US opposition: [...] "Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia formed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure the <b>best</b> <b>price</b> available from the major oil corporations." [...] The Middle Eastern members originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut, but Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose Geneva, Switzerland. On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after Switzerland declined to extend diplomatic privileges.|$|E

We find that commonality in liquidity becomes stronger the deeper we look into the limit order book.

Furthermore, we find strong time variation in commonality both on an intradaily basis and with {{the movement of the}} market return. Our study thus suggests that previous estimates of commonality do not hold for liquidity beyond <b>best</b> <b>prices.</b> Therefore, systematic liquidity risk in a limit order book market is much higher than previous evidence implies...|$|R

500|$|Belgrano {{maintained}} frequent {{discussions with}} the committee members of the Consulate, who were all merchants with strong interests involved in the monopolic commerce with Cadiz. He made many proposals, influenced by free trade ideas. By this time, Belgrano thought that [...] "The merchant must have freedom to buy where he can be best accommodated, and it's natural that he does where {{he is supplied with}} the <b>best</b> <b>price</b> to be able to earn the best profit". Those proposals were rejected by the committee members; his only supporters were Juan José Castelli, Juan Larrea, and Domingo Matheu. However, Belgrano had some successes, such as creating the Nautical School, the Commerce School, and the Geometry and Drawing Academy. He created the Commerce School to influence future merchants to work towards {{the best interests of the}} nation, and the nautical and drawing ones to provide the youth with prestigious and lucrative careers. The schools were situated next to the Consulate so that Belgrano could easily supervise their development. The schools were in place for three years before they were closed by a ruling of Manuel Godoy, from the Spanish monarchy, who considered them an unnecessary luxury for a colony. It was felt that Buenos Aires might not be able to maintain them.|$|E

2500|$|One {{reason for}} high prices is that Fairtrade farmers {{have to sell}} through a monopsonist cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – {{certainly}} some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the <b>best</b> <b>price,</b> or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt {{if they wish to}} retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink Lindsey calls fair trade a [...] "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" [...] encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.|$|E

It advanced the reform agenda for agricultural development, with full-time district representatives, or fieldmen, who promoted education, demonstrations of farm equipment, community picnics and rallies, and cooperative insurance, among other programs.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of retail FX brokers [...] {{offering}} the opportunity for speculative currency trading: brokers and dealers or market makers.

They charge a commission or [...] "mark-up" [...] in addition to the price obtained in the market. Dealers or market makers, by contrast, typically act as principals in the transaction versus the retail customer, and quote a price they are willing to deal at.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse auction {{is a type}} of {{auction in}} which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find the <b>best</b> <b>price</b> among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. By revealing the competing bids in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.|$|E

2500|$|Ron Atkinson bought Lamptey to Aston Villa in {{the summer}} of 1994. This move came as a surprise, as PSV was a more {{successful}} club than Aston Villa at the time and Lamptey was one of the star players at PSV. However, on German TV (see below), Lamptey recalled that when he came to Europe, he had signed an exclusive marketing contract with an Italian player agent. Naive as he was, he thought that the agent would only act in his best interest. In fact, the player's agent (Antonio Caliendo) was [...] "a shady character who held Lamptey's transfer rights like a slave owner held his slave" [...] (quote by a fellow German player agent, and an opinion also supported by Lamptey's trainer Otto Pfister). He thought only of where to sell Lamptey for the <b>best</b> <b>price,</b> to bag ~25% of the transfer sum for himself, and so he sold him to Aston Villa. Too late Lamptey realized that the exclusive contract was a trap he could not flee. He failed to impress at Villa Park, scoring just three times, all of which came in the League Cup against Wigan Athletic (once in the home leg and twice in the away leg).|$|E

40|$|Traders {{using the}} {{electronic}} limit order {{book in the}} foreign exchange market can watch the posted price and depth of the best quotes change over the day. The authors use a structural errorcorrection model to examine {{the dynamics of the}} relationship between the <b>best</b> bid <b>price,</b> the <b>best</b> ask <b>price,</b> and their associated depths. They incorporate measures of the market depth behind the best quotes as regressors. They report four main findings. First, <b>best</b> <b>prices</b> and their associated depths are contemporaneously related to each other. More specifically, an increase in the ask (bid) price is associated with a drop (rise) in the ask (bid) depth. This suggests that sell traders avoid the adverse-selection risk of selling in a rising market. Second, when the spread-the error-correction term-widens, the bid price rises and the ask price drops, returning the spread to its long-term equilibrium value. Further, the best depth on both sides of the market drops, due to increased market uncertainty. Third, the lagged best depth impacts the price discovery on both sides of the market, with the effect being strongest on the same side of the market. Fourth, changes in the depth behind the best quotes impact both the <b>best</b> <b>prices</b> and quantities, even though those changes are unobservable to market participants.

2500|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, the Beaver Wars {{initiated}} by the Iroquois forced a massive demographic shift as the western neighbors of the Haudenosaunee (better known as the Iroquois) fled the violence. They sought refuge west and north of Lake Michigan. The Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee, who had a predatory [...] attitude towards their neighbors even {{at the best of}} times, constantly raiding neighboring peoples in [...] "mourning wars" [...] in search of captives who would become Iroquois, were determined to be the only middlemen between the Europeans and the other Indians who lived in the West, and quite consciously set about eliminating any rivals as such as the Wendat (Huron). By the 1620s, the Iroquois had become dependent upon iron implements, which they obtained by trading fur with the Dutch at Fort Nassau (modern Albany, New York). Between 1624-1628, the Iroquois drove out their neighbors, the Mahican, to allow themselves to be the one people in the Hudson river valley able to trade with the Dutch. By 1640, the Five Nations had exhausted the supply of beavers in Kanienkeh ("the land of the flint"-the Iroquois name for their homeland in what is now upstate New York), and moreover Kanienkeh lacked the beavers with the thick pelts that the Europeans favored and would pay the <b>best</b> <b>price</b> for, which were to be found further north in what is now northern Canada.|$|E
