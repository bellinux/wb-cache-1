5|$|The Count of Artois did {{not join}} the court-in-exile in Hartwell, preferring to {{continue}} his frivolous life in London. Louis's friend the Count of Avaray left Hartwell for Madeira in 1809, and died there in 1811. Louis replaced Avaray with the Comte de Blacas as his principal political advisor. Queen Marie Joséphine died on 13 November 1810. That same winter, Louis suffered a particularly severe case of gout, which was a recurring problem for him at Hartwell, {{and he had to}} <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} Warwick and Montagu {{were laid out}} 'on the morrow after' and 'openly shewed and naked' in St. Paul's, to prevent rumour {{starting}} that they had in fact survived the battle; Warkworth too said that the King personally directed this, and arranged for the corpses 'to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cart... to be laid in the church of Paul's, on the pavement, that every man might see them; and so they lay {{for three or four}} days' before granting permission to their brother George for their burial at Bisham Priory.|$|E
5|$|During certain {{situations}} the player will <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> perilous situation, {{where they will}} be prompted to choose between two possible actions or suffer a certain penalty, if not instant death. These choices affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved. Additionally, a creature called Nemesis is encountered multiple times throughout the game as a recurring boss. Nemesis is considerably more powerful than the player and has the ability to use a rocket launcher as a weapon, dodge incoming fire, and pursue the player from one area to the next. During one of these encounters, the player can choose to either fight Nemesis or run until he is evaded. A variety of encounters are possible, with some being mandatory, and some varying in nature and location based on certain choices made by the player. Even if evaded or defeated during one of these encounters, Nemesis will inevitably continue to pursue the player {{until the end of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state of sleep {{for any length of}} time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

25|$|Charge {{coins and}} other similar items were used from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They came in various shapes and sizes; with {{materials}} made out of celluloid (an early type of plastic), copper, aluminum, steel, {{and other types of}} whitish metals. Each charge coin usually had a little hole, enabling it to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> key ring, like a key. These charge coins were usually given to customers who had charge accounts in department stores, hotels, and so on. A charge coin usually had the charge account number along with the merchant's name and logo.|$|E
25|$|Snails that hatched the {{previous}} summer can <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chilled room for hibernation over winter. About 1 April, (adjusted for local climate), they are moved to the final fattening pen. IN cases where there are several fattening pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of H. aspersa snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For H. aspersa, 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for the Patriots, {{they would}} {{be caught in the}} middle of a bizarre Super Bowl week subplot. Prior to the AFC Championship game, Irving Fryar had cut two fingers with a kitchen knife, {{requiring}} them to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cast. At first it was dismissed as a freak accident, but after the conference championship, the truth came out: Fryar's wife, Jacqueline, had slashed him in a domestic incident after Fryar had knocked her down. It was a distraction that, many thought, epitomized the history of these Patriots – coming as it did in what was otherwise to that point the franchise's finest hour.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{surviving}} {{epitome of}} the lost Trojan War epic of Arctinus of Miletus, the remains of Achilles and Patroclus were brought to this island by Thetis, to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sanctuary, furnishing the aition, or founding myth of the Hellenic cult of Achilles centred here. Ruins believed to be of a square temple dedicated to Achilles, 30 meters to a side, were discovered by the Russian naval Capt. N.D.Kritzkii in 1823, but the subsequent construction of a lighthouse on the very site obliterated all trace of it. Ovid, who was banished to Tomis, mentions the island, so do Ptolemy and Strabo. The island is described in Pliny the Elder's Natural History, IV.27.1.|$|E
25|$|Other common {{styles of}} {{clothing}} popularly worn with a niqab in Western countries include the khimar, a semi-circular flare of fabric with {{an opening for}} the face and a small triangular underscarf. A khimar is usually bust-level or longer, and can also be worn without the niqab. It is considered a fairly easy form of headscarf to wear, as there are no pins or fasteners; it is simply pulled over the head. Gloves are also sometimes worn with the niqab, because many munaqqabāt believe {{no part of the}} skin should be visible other than the area immediately around the eyes or because {{they do not want to}} <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position where they would touch the hand of an unrelated man (for instance, when accepting change from a cashier). Most munaqqabāt also wear an overgarment (jilbab, abaya etc.) over their clothing, though some munaqabat in Western countries wear a long, loose tunic and skirt instead of a one-piece overgarment.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the Gutenberg idea was using a single, hand-carved {{character}} to create identical copies of itself. Cutting a single letter could take a craftsman a day of work. A single page taking 2500 letters made this way was impractical. A less labour-intensive method of reproduction was needed. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron plate, called a matrix. A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a container in which molten type metal could be poured. Once cooled, the solid metal form was released from the tube. The fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to produce many duplicates of the same letter. The result of each molding was a rectangular block of metal with the form of the desired character protruding from the end. This piece of type could <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> line, facing up, with other pieces of type. These lines were arranged to form blocks of text, which could be inked and pressed against paper, transferring the desired text to the paper.|$|E

25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> drawer and “never... see the light of day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E
25|$|Dave Wrobel {{has taught}} {{construction}} and carpentry at Mohawk College {{and worked as}} an accident benefits claims representative. Considered {{to be on the}} right wing of the political spectrum, he was a member of the Reform Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance before winning election himself. He first ran for Brantford City Council in the 1997 municipal election; thirty-one years old during the campaign, he finished a relatively close third. He was elected in his second attempt in 2000; in this campaign, he called for Brantford casino revenues to <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reserve to reduce taxes and opposed using public funds to save private buildings. After the election, he emerged as a frequent opponent of Mayor Chris Friel and a regular ally of his ward-mate Richard Carpenter. In 2002, he offered support to Marguerite Ceschi-Smith's campaign for reclaiming brownfield sites. Wrobel supported Progressive Conservative candidate Alayne Sokoloski in the 2003 provincial election. He was himself re-elected in the 2003 municipal election. Wrobel was given a leave of absence for health reasons in early 2005. He joined with Carpenter and Ceschi-Smith in November 2005, refusing to attend a closed-door session on boundary adjustments and ethanol production; he said the issues were too important to be dealt with in private. He resigned his seat in February 2006 following continued health issues. With his health situation improved, he was re-elected to council in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She {{influenced}} the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin {{from the kitchen}} shelf for the next day's dinner party. [...] "Elizabeth David says..." [...] was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should <b>be</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice {{on what to do}} in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She was a pleasure to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a [...] "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar's feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete's gift of conveying a sense of place.|$|E
