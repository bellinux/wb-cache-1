40|$|<b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} perennial grass in the Southern States. It was introduced into the United States at least as early as 1806. Besides the common <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass,</b> there are several varieties, the most important of which are the Giant, characterized by a very large growth, and St. Lucie grass, similar to ordinary <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass,</b> but lacking underground rootstocks. <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> grows well mixed with lespedeza for a summer crop. Bur clover, black medic, and hairy vetch as winter crops alternate well with it. The best Bermuda-grass pastures of the South will usually carry two head of cattle per acre for eight months of the year. On poor soils the carrying capacity is not more than one cow per acre. On rich bottom land <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> grows tall enough to cut for hay. Under exceptional circumstances three or more cuttings may be secured in a season, giving total yields of from 6 to 10 tons of hay per acre. It will grow well on soils so alkaline that most other field crops, as well as fruits, will fail. The feeding value of Bermuda-grass hay compares closely wit that of timothy hay. <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> frequently is used to bind leaves and toe prevent hillsides from washing. The grass usually can be eradicated by growing two smother crops, a winter one of oats or rye, followed by a summer crop of cow peas or velvet beans. " [...] p. ...|$|R

[...] "Established <b>bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> is a network of shoots, rhizomes, stolons, and crown tissue together that usually form a dense plant canopy.

Bighorn sheep were placed in individual cages and fed three diets: high and low quality alfalfa, and <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> (Cynodon dactylon).

40|$|Background: Allergenic cross {{reactivity}} {{between the}} members of the Pooids (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense, and Poa pratensis) and Chloridoids (Cynodon dactylon and Paspalum notatum) is well established. Studies using crude extracts in the past have demonstrated limited cross reactivity between the Pooids and the Chloridoids suggesting separate diagnosis and therapy. However, little is known regarding the molecular basis for the limited cross reactivity observed between the 2 groups of grasses. The present study was undertaken to gain insights into the molecular basis of cross allergenicity between the major allergens from rye and <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> pollens. Methods: Immunoblot inhibition tests were carried out to determine the specificity of the proteins involved in cross reactivity. Crude pollen extract and bacterially expressed and purified recombinant Lol p 1 and Lol p 5 from rye grass were subjected to cross inhibition experiments with crude and purified recombinant Cyn d 1 from <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> using sera from patients allergic to rye grass pollen. Results: The immunoblot inhibition studies revealed a high degree of cross inhibition between the group 1 allergens. In contrast, a complete lack of inhibition was observed between <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> group 1 allergen rCyn d 1, and rye grass group 5 allergen rLol p 5. Crude rye grass extract strongly inhibited IgE reactivity to <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass,</b> whereas crude <b>Bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> pollen extract showed a weaker inhibition. Conclusions: Our data suggests that a possible explanation for the limited cross reactivity between the Pooids and Chloridoids may, in part, be due to the absence of group 5 allergen from Chloridoid grasses. This approach of using purified proteins may be applied to better characterize the cross allergenicity patterns between different grass pollen allergens...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} is to obtain information about the adaptability of introcluced grass species to our region, and about their proper times of seeding for the pasture establishment without tillage. The growth of 2 species of warm-season grass was compared with that of summer weed. Grass species used were bahia grass, Paspalum notatum Flügge, and <b>bermuda</b> <b>grass,</b> Cynodon dactylon Persoon. As a summer weed, large-crab grass, Digitalia adscendens Henr. was used. They were sown in a plastic pot late in May, early in July and late in September, 1978, then grown under natural conditions. Results were summarized as follows. 1. Emergence of large-crab grass required the least number of days from seeding, and grew vigorously at any time, when compared with those of warm-season grasses. Particularly large-crab grass seeded in July grew most rapidly. 2. The most vigorous growth of bahia and <b>bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> was also observed when seeded in July. An interesting tendency was seen: the earlier the seeding time in <b>bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> and the later in bahia grass, the larger is the ratio of their dry weight to that of large-crab grass. It can be concluded that the proper time of seeding is in May for both grasses, considering the competition with the growth of summer weed; bahia grass, however, grew well if sown in September. 3. Since the <b>bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> showed a great variation in the dry weight with the seeding time, {{it can be said that}} the growth of this grass is affected strongly by seeding time. 4. It can be concluded that <b>bermuda</b> <b>grass</b> is one of the most suitable grass species to be sown for a pasture establishment without tillage, because of its rapid elongation of stolons, which quickly cover the ground...|$|R
