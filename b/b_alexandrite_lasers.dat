STUDY DESIGN/METHODS Eighteen patients underwent a single treatment session using a variable pulse-width <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser.</b> Test sites were performed using a 10 -mm spot size and up to four pulse widths (3, 20, 40, 60 ms) with and without epidermal cooling. Full treatments were performed 3 weeks later using optimum test parameters. The patients were evaluated at 3 and 6 weeks. RESULTS Patients with darker lentigines had greater lesion clearance than those patients with lighter colored lentigines. Shorter pulse widths and treatment without cryogen cooling both, independently, lowered the fluence threshold for lentigo clearance.

40|$|In the DIAL technique, {{the water}} vapor {{concentration}} profile {{is determined by}} analyzing the lidar backscatter signals for laser wavelengths tuned 'on' and 'off' a water vapor absorption line. Desired characteristics of the on-line transmitted laser beam include: pulse energy {{greater than or equal}} to 100 mJ, high-resolution tuning capability (uncertainty less than 0. 25 pm), good spectral stability (jitter less than 0. 5 pm about the mean), and high spectral purity (greater than 99 percent). The off-line laser is generally detuned less than 100 pm away from the water vapor line. Its spectral requirements are much less stringent. In our past research, we developed and demonstrated the airborne DIAL technique for water vapor measurements in the 720 -nm spectral region using a system based on an <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> as the transmitter for the on-line wavelength and a Nd:YAG laser-pumped dye laser for the off-line wavelength. This off-line laser has been replaced by a second <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser.</b> Diode lasers are used to injection seed both lasers for frequency and linewidth control. This eliminates the need for the two intracavity etalons utilized in our previous <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> and thereby greatly reduces the risk of optical damage. Consequently, the transmitted pulse energy can be substantially increased, resulting in greater measurement range, higher data density, and increased measurement precision.

40|$|Background and Objective Basal Cell Nevus {{syndrome}} (BCNS) {{is characterized}} by numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). Multiple treatments with the pulsed dye laser (PDL) have been shown, in small studies, to be effective {{for the treatment of}} superficial and nodular BCCs. Like PDL, the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> can be vessel-selective, but has the added advantage of deeper tissue penetration. We evaluated the utility of the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> in reducing the tumor burden in BCNS with a single treatment. Study Design/Materials and Methods A case report and review of the literature are presented. A 45 -year-old man with BCNS and a history of radiation therapy presented with an extraordinarily high tumor burden (> 250 BCCs). As a compassionate measure to reduce the tumor burden, we investigated the utility of a single treatment of the long-pulsed 755 [*]nm <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> to several BCC lesions. The treated lesions were evaluated at 2 -month and 7 -month clinical follow-up. Histopathologic analysis of a treated lesion was performed at 7 -month clinical follow-up. Results At 2 -month, and 7 -month clinical follow-up, 15 of 18 treated lesions or about 83 % of the <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> treated lesions showed a complete clinical response and appeared as hypopigmented areas with scarring. Histopathologic analysis of a treated lesion at 7 -month clinical follow-up showed no evidence of residual tumor. Conclusions The long-pulsed <b>alexandrite</b> <b>laser</b> may be helpful in significantly reducing tumor burden in difficult to manage BCNS patients with a single treatment. This provides a facile and practical treatment alternative for the management of challenging cases of BCNS. The limitation {{of this study is that}} it is a single case observation.
