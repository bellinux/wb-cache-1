5|$|Speaking on the {{evolving}} relationship of Clark and Chloe, Mack {{believes that the}} season six introduction of Jimmy Olsen into Chloe's life increased her value to Clark. Before, Chloe would drop anything for Clark, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Chloe has other priorities, it makes Clark realize how valuable she is to him. The introduction of Jimmy Olsen also provides Chloe with someone she can finally have a romantic relationship with. The relationship is strained when Chloe has to lie to cover up Clark's secret, as well as keeping {{the fact that she}} is meteor-infected hidden. Writer Holly Harold questions whether or not Jimmy has taken over the place in Chloe's heart that Clark occupied for so long.|$|E

25|$|Recently, two {{strains of}} this {{bacteria}} - subsp. sepidonicum and subsp. michiganensis - {{have had their}} genomes sequenced and annotated. There is still much to discover about this pathogen-host interaction <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> the genome has been sequenced, the rate of discoveries will likely increase. One of the main goals pertaining to research of these bacterial genomes is to develop resistant varieties. Unfortunately, no resistant varieties have yet been found.|$|E
25|$|The Rabbis {{taught in}} a Baraita that {{for two and a}} half years the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel debated, the House of Shammai asserting that it would have been better for {{humanity}} not to have been created, and the House of Hillel maintaining that it is better that humanity was created. They finally took a vote and decided that it would have been better for humanity not to have been created, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> humanity has been created, let us investigate our past deeds or, as others say, let us examine our future actions.|$|E
25|$|Bovine {{colostrum}} from pasture-fed cows contains immunoglobulins {{specific to}} many human pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus species, and rotavirus (which causes diarrhea in infants). Before {{the development of}} antibiotics, colostrum was {{the main source of}} immunoglobulins used to fight bacteria. In fact, when Albert Sabin made his first oral vaccine against polio, the immunoglobulin he used came from bovine colostrum. When antibiotics began to appear, interest in colostrum waned, <b>but,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens have developed, interest is once again returning to natural alternatives to antibiotics, namely, colostrum.|$|E

With Duane Allman on second guitar, the group recorded [...] "Little Wing" [...] at Criteria Studios in Miami, during the sessions for Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs shortly before Hendrix's death on September 18, 1970. [...] Clapton biographer Michael Schumacher notes, [...] "Clapton had intended it {{as a tribute to}} a living legend, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> Hendrix was gone, the song hit on a different emotional level." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There's Something About Marrying" [...] {{featured}} the first appearance of an animated same-sex marriage on network television. Television columnist Ray Richmond {{wrote that the}} episode was a cultural milestone for The Simpsons and that the [...] "issue [...] was mainstream to some degree, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> [...] deigned it worthy of the show it is interwoven into the popular culture. The Simpsons bestowed upon something a pop culture status it never had before, simply by being ripe for a joke." [...] John Kenneth White, {{author of the book}} Barack Obama's America, similarly called [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] a cultural barrier breaker.|$|E

He refers to it, and his dark horse popularity among Republican voters {{and those who did not}} usually vote in presidential elections, as [...] "America's back mole". Oliver says, [...] "It may have seemed harmless a year ago, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it's become frighteningly bigger, it's no longer wise to ignore it." ...|$|E
500|$|Alanna Nash {{regularly}} compared Diffie's {{voice to}} that of George Jones. In her review of A Thousand Winding Roads, she contrasted the album with Mark Chesnutt's debut Too Cold at Home by saying, [...] "While Chesnutt merely takes his inspiration from Jones, Diffie mimics Jones' delivery... <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he's making records himself, [...] drops him {{to the rear of}} the pack, as a stylist with little style of his own." [...] She thought that Diffie began to move away from his George Jones influences on A Night to Remember. William Ruhlmann wrote that Diffie [...] "has put together a decade-plus career in country largely on his ability to succeed" [...] in [...] "scour Nashville publishers for ten good compositions in the established style", and that he was an [...] "adequate but undistinguished singer." ...|$|E
500|$|Miss Manners {{wrote in}} her 1990book Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium that {{although}} the phrase was trite, she wondered whether there was [...] "so much deeply felt good will" [...] permeating through the world that shallow friendliness ought to desist. She stated that for her, saying [...] "goodbye" [...] is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes {{wrote in her}} 2009book How to Instantly Connect with Anyone that if someone says [...] "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding [...] "Thanks, but I have other plans" [...] or [...] "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> you mention it, I think I'll have a nice one."

500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I am old, I see that they are like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E
500|$|The {{cast members}} of the show took the news about the show ending well. Hayes said: [...] "I'm proud of {{being a part of}} {{something}} in history and I'm proud to have been given a platform to make people laugh." [...] McCormack added, [...] "We have never taken ourselves or this show too seriously <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it's over I take our collective achievement very, very seriously." [...] The actors were satisfied with the episode and thought the viewers would find it satisfying as well. [...] "It's daring and ambitious and more far-reaching than most finales go. I think people will be quite surprised," [...] McCormack said. Messing added: [...] "I think Will & Grace fans will be satisfied. Ultimately, [...] was done beautifully and it ties up loose ends for all of the characters in a way that's wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E

500|$|... "I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked" [...] saw the {{departure}} of Stevens, following the breakdown of her marriage with Karev. Series' writer Joan Rater commented on this: [...] "Izzie getting the clean scan back gives Alex the freedom to leave. Because {{he never would have}} left her when she was sick, he's a good guy. And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, it just comes to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done." [...] The writing of the two-part season six finale, caused struggle to Rhimes. She elaborated on this: ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this goal, Wong Fu's {{films were}} {{inspired}} by the members' life experiences rather than racial experiences. The group also does not promote political messages through their works but, rather, raises [...] "many APA issues that we feel would fit our brand and image." [...] They are often considered role models for Asian Americans aspiring to enter the entertainment industry. In response to this, group member Ted Fu said, [...] "We actually didn't {{set out to be}} the 'heroes' of Asian Americans. It just happened by accident. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> we're given this huge responsibility, almost, I feel like it's our duty to take it seriously." [...] Wong Fu presented [...] "one of the most antipicated workshops" [...] on sustaining an independent production company at the 2008 Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association Midwest Conference. They were also the keynote speakers at the Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association 2010 West Coast Conference, which was hosted at their alma mater, UC San Diego.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave Nimrod {{three and a}} half stars out of five, calling it an [...] "invigorating, if occasionally frustrating listen", and although he praised Armstrong's [...] "gift for hooky, instantly memorable melodies", he noted that [...] "the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that it leaves you somewhat dazed." [...] Greg Kot of Rolling Stone enjoyed the album's melodic nature as well as the [...] "measure of sincerity" [...] present in Armstrong's vocals. [...] Kot appreciated the return of the band's [...] "juvenile sense of humor" [...] that he felt was lacking on Insomniac, and praised the musical diversity on the record, remarking, [...] "This music {{is a long way from}} Green Day's apprenticeship at the Gilman Street punk clubs, in Berkeley, Calif. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> the band has seen the world, it's only fitting that Green Day should finally make an album that sounds as if it has." ...|$|E
