5|$|At Shimer, the {{professor}} is a facilitator, a guide on the side, not a sage {{on the stage}} – encouraging each student {{to contribute to the}} intellectual light being kindled in every class. Each student is expected to question and comment upon the text, to respond to one other’s insights, actively taking part in every discussion.... Students know their insights matter; they have something to offer to their peers, and {{to the life of the}} text being discussed. Some students are more exuberant than others, some would rather talk than listen; others may be a bit shy. The professor/facilitator must make sure that each student has a chance to shine, that each can feel confident, each can have the courage to ask what they think might be a stupid question. What are feared to <b>be</b> <b>stupid</b> questions are often the most provocative ones.|$|E
