25|$|Drought is very rare, albeit <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> {{occasionally}} {{given the}} city's strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014–2015, most severe in the Southeast Region {{and the worst}} in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the Paraíba do Sul River to the Guandu River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Paraíba do Sul to the Sistema Cantareira (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 {{in order to help}} the critically drought-stricken Greater São Paulo area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) {{what is the nature of}} the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance of this discussion? However, there was very little agreement about concepts, measurement principles, and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. All kinds of different political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with illusions about reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, that this kind of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E

[...] Peter and Walter reference the 1984 supernatural comedy film Ghostbusters while investigating the opening scene's case, and later debate {{the origin of the}} term pyrokinesis, coined by author Stephen King in his 1981 novel Firestarter. Emmanuel Grayson refers to the titular character of the 1982 science fiction film , as well as Romulans and the United Federation of Planets, when describing government conspiracies to Peter and Olivia. Grayson also believes himself to be Mr. Spock. This reference is made even more appropriate by the fact that Spock's mother was named Amanda Grayson.|$|E

500|$|The club's poor run of form {{continued}} in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped {{to the bottom}} of the league table. Another 3–1 defeat, against Newcastle United, was followed by a second successive 1–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches. Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United, and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season. [...] "It's nice to get three points, but now we have to build on it," [...] said Sturrock. [...] "There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again." [...] Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2–1 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper. Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2–0 at Bloomfield Road. The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle. He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway, a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. [...] "I suppose it was <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better," [...] said executive director Keith Todd. [...] "We understood exactly what we are doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marist College and Siena College; Many {{fans and}} sportswriters dubbed this match-up as [...] "The Battle of I-87" [...] {{because of the}} two-hour {{proximity}} of each school on Interstate 87 highway (coincidentally, the approximate distance {{between the two is}} 87.4 miles). It is said that no other two colleges in the Mid-Hudson Region have a hatred and distaste for one another than the Marist Red Foxes and Siena Saints. Although this rivalry exist in all sports, it is most heated during the basketball season. Whether it's held at McCann Field House or the Times Union Center, both school's visiting fans come in droves, so eventfully conflicts are <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> on the court or in the stands. In 2009, the two school's club-level ice hockey teams established the 87 Challenge Cup, an annual three game round-robin challenge for a replica I-87 road sign; both of the team's logos and winning years are engraved on the back. Siena leads that series, 2–1.|$|E

5000|$|In eukaryotes such as yeasts, {{plants and}} animals, the {{synthesis}} processes are believed <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> in mitochondria. The {{first step is}} the acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate by a glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. Then acylglycerol-3-phosphate can be acylated to form a phosphatidic acid (PA). With {{the help of the}} enzyme CDP-DAG synthase (phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase), PA is converted into cytidinediphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG). The following step is conversion of CDP-DAG to phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) by the enzyme PGP synthase, followed by dephosphorylation by PTPMT1 [...] to form PG. Finally, a molecule of CDP-DAG is <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> PG to form one molecule of cardiolipin, catalyzed by the mitochondria-localized enzyme cardiolipin synthase (CLS).|$|R

5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often <b>bound</b> <b>to</b> cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|R

40|$|The {{recent work}} of CRT,DonohoPol rigorously proved (in a large {{dimensional}} and statistical context) {{that if the}} number of equations (measurements in the compressed sensing terminology) in the system is proportional to the length of the unknown vector then there is a sparsity (number of non-zero elements of the unknown vector) also proportional to the length of the unknown vector such that ℓ_ 1 -optimization algorithm succeeds in solving the system. In more recent papers StojnicCSetamBlock 09,StojnicICASSP 09 block,StojnicJSTSP 09 we considered under-determined systems with the so-called block-sparse solutions. In a large dimensional and statistical context in StojnicCSetamBlock 09 we determined lower bounds on the values of allowable sparsity for any given number (proportional to the length of the unknown vector) of equations such that an ℓ_ 2 /ℓ_ 1 -optimization algorithm succeeds in solving the system. These lower <b>bounds</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be in a solid numerical agreement with what one can observe through numerical experiments. Here we derive the corresponding upper bounds. Moreover, the upper bounds that we obtain in this paper match the lower bounds from StojnicCSetamBlock 09 and ultimately make them optimal.
