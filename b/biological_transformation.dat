The general objective of a {{chemical plant}} is to create new material wealth via the chemical or <b>biological</b> <b>transformation</b> and or separation of materials. Chemical plants use specialized equipment, units, and technology in the manufacturing process. Other kinds of plants, such as polymer, pharmaceutical, food, and some beverage production facilities, power plants, oil refineries or other refineries, natural gas processing and biochemical plants, water and wastewater treatment, and pollution control equipment use many technologies that have similarities to chemical plant technology such as fluid systems and chemical reactor systems.

50|$|Igor Štuhec (born 15 December 1932) is a {{contemporary}} Slovenian composer, {{who lives in}} Ljubljana and Maribor. He studied composition at the Ljubljana Academy of Music under Lucijan Marija Škerjanc and Matija Bravničar. He continued his studies at the Vienna Academy of Music and Dramatic Art under Hanns Jelinek, and also at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse. After some early neo-classical orchestral works that show his mastery of traditional techniques, Štuhec gradually moved towards the adoption of new techniques in the early 1960s. Although in 1955 he had produced a musique concrète composition in <b>Biological</b> <b>Transformation,</b> the radical change came with the chamber pieces Situacija (1963) and Silhuete (1964) and the orchestral Differentiations (1964), all of which exhibit his assimilation of 12-note and aleatory procedures. Štuhec's skill is particularly evident in miniatures such as the Minikoncert, where his writing is at its most delicate and the textures are almost always crystal clear. A later group of orchestral works extending his textural techniques, notably the concertos and the three Entuziazmi pieces, display a vivid imagination and a strong rhythmic momentum. Also among his works are two operas, Zupanova Micka (1948) andMoon Dawn (1973). He is a winner of the Prešeren Prize.|$|E

Typically the waste including the biodegradable portion is transported to the so-called landfills without any segregation process, treatment and utilization in advance. Although mitigation practices such as source reduction, reuse and recycle are essential and required to be practiced in any integrated waste management plan, {{one of the best}} approaches to reduce the volume of the waste goes to the landfills is <b>biological</b> <b>transformation.</b> <b>Biological</b> <b>transformation</b> of waste occurs in two major categories; aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation.

In addition to methane, the byproduct of the anaerobic process is slurry that can be used as soil amendment agent.
