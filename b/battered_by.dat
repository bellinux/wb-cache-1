5|$|At the Battle of Breitenfeld, in 1631, Adolphus {{proved the}} {{effectiveness}} of the changes made to his army, by defeating Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. Although severely outnumbered, the Swedes were able to fire between three and five times as many volleys of artillery, and their infantry's linear formations helped ensure they didn't lose any ground. <b>Battered</b> <b>by</b> cannon fire, and low on morale, Tilly's men broke ranks and fled.|$|E
5|$|Little {{change in}} {{strength}} took {{place for the}} next six hours; a shortwave trough crossing the Baja California Peninsula turned Patricia to the northeast and induced acceleration. Another reconnaissance mission around 18:00UTC recorded a central pressure of 879mbar (hPa; 25.96inHg). The aircraft was <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> severe turbulence (the result of updrafts and downdrafts) and the crew experienced maximum g-forces of +3.0 and -1.5.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground and keep the retreating Chinese forces {{from being able to}} rest.|$|E
5|$|The GUNT-Libyan {{alliance}} invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habré had entrenched {{himself with}} about 5,000 troops. <b>Battered</b> <b>by</b> {{multiple rocket launcher}} (MRL), artillery and tank fire and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT troops on the ground. Habré escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons {{was to build}} thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving sides {{were more likely to}} deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures {{had to find a way}} to cope with being <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} examine the factors related to {{domestic}} violence against women in rural Bangladesh and find the remedies to this problem. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Kandigoan Union Parishad under Sylhet Sadar Upazila in Sylhet district, Bangladesh. Data were collected using social survey method. Two- stage cluster sampling method was applied to select the sample. Chi-square test was applied {{to examine the}} association between independent variables and dependent variable while binary logistic regression was applied to measure the effects of socio-economic factors on domestic violence against women in the household. The chi-square test shows that the age of wife, age of husband, NGOs’ membership of wife and couple’s income {{were related to the}} <b>battering</b> <b>by</b> husbands. Logistic regression shows that wife’s working status, age of husband and couple’s income were related to women <b>battering</b> <b>by</b> husbands in the family...|$|R

5|$|Parker's fleet had an {{extremely}} difficult crossing. <b>Battered</b> <b>by</b> storms and high seas, the first ships {{of the fleet}} did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18, and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3. After several weeks there, in which the British troops raided Patriot properties, Clinton, Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations. Parker had sent out some ships on scouting expeditions {{up and down the}} coast, and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that {{the decision was made to}} go there.|$|E

5|$|The 40th Infantry Division Slavonska was <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> German {{artillery}} fire {{during the night}} 9/10 April. Seriously depleted by desertion and weakened by revolt, it was unable to mount the ordered counterattack against the Barcs bridgehead {{on the morning of}} 10 April. The 42nd Infantry Regiment could only muster 600 men, and the 86th Infantry Regiment slightly more. The divisional cavalry squadron was also heavily reduced in strength, and divisional artillery amounted to one anti-aircraft battery. The border units, responsible for demolition tasks on the line from Bjelovar south to Čazma, refused to follow orders. Having abandoned the counterattack, Raketić decided to establish a defensive line at Pćelić to hinder German movement east towards Slatina.|$|E
5|$|An 1895 fire {{destroyed}} {{half the}} village, {{as it had}} no form of fire protection at that time. Throughout the 20thcentury, {{the decline of the}} natural cement industry caused Rosendale to suffer economically and lose population. The village was also <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> a series of severe floods, and the center of commerce began to shift from Main Street to Route32. By the 1970s the village was having severe problems with its utilities and tax code, and was no longer producing cement. The hippie movement brought many artists to the village during this time, which led to ideological clashes between the newcomers and the more conservative, established residents. In 1976, the village voted to dissolve itself to solve its municipal problems, and on January1, 1978, Rosendale became disincorporated. The village's mayor {{at the time of the}} vote viewed the dissolution as a work of conceptual art, and published a book on the matter.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November, China {{entered the}} war {{on the side of}} North Korea against the UN. Massed Chinese attacks were {{immediately}} launched against troops of the corps. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdraw to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force. In the wake of the retreat, the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re-formed. I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 27th British Brigade, taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place. On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops attacked the Eighth Army's line at the Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground.|$|E
50|$|In baseball, an {{intentional}} base on balls, usually {{referred to as}} {{an intentional}} walk and denoted in baseball scorekeeping by IBB, is a walk issued to a <b>batter</b> <b>by</b> a pitcher {{with the intent of}} removing the batter's opportunity to swing at the pitched ball. A pitch that is intentionally thrown far outside the strike zone for this purpose is referred to as an intentional ball.|$|R

5|$|British {{reinforcement}} entered Basque Roads at 15:20, just as {{the crew}} of Calcutta abandoned the ship, withdrawing across the shoal. Forming a line of battle, the British opened a heavy fire on the nearby, and still grounded, Ville de Varsouvie while Beagle, armed with heavy carronades, nosed close inshore and took up station across the bow of Aquilon and raked the French ship repeatedly. For two hours these immobile French ships were <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> the British line with little reply, until at 17:30 both raised Union flags as an indication that they had surrendered. Shortly afterwards {{the crew of the}} wrecked Tonnere abandoned their ship and set it on fire. The French ship was destroyed by a magazine explosion at 19:30, followed at 20:30 by Calcutta, which had been mistakenly set on fire by an over-enthusiastic British boarding party. The storeship was carrying a large quantity of munitions, reportedly worth over half a million pounds in value, and produced an enormous explosion. Most of the British ships had suffered only minor damage and casualties from fire from the gun batteries on Île-d'Aix, where Revenge had temporarily grounded during the night and suffered 18 casualties. The French losses were minor except on Ville de Varsouvie, which had taken about 100 casualties in the exchange.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero oil pressure in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Linfa caused {{flooding}} and four separate landslides. The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province. Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 18sections of roads, {{as well as two}} bridges and an irrigation canal in San Gabriel, La Union. Slick roads and a fallen tree caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people. Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm, including the entirety of La Union province, and Bacnotan briefly lost water access. In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> huge waves. Three days of high waves washed 30tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury the rotting shells {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster in the country that killed 54. The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged ₱34million ($71,000 USD) worth of crops, and total damage reached ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD). Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents.|$|E
50|$|In December 2008 the Town {{voted to}} restore the pylon, a {{concrete}} structure built in 1935, {{at a cost of}} $172,000. Decades of <b>battering</b> <b>by</b> the ocean has eroded the pylon, which was one of three pylons built to anchor a shark net following a fatal attack in 1925. Two were destroyed by storms in 1937. Since then it has become an iconic landmark and popular diving platform for beach users.|$|R
50|$|Tetsuro Kawajiri (retired): He is {{supposed}} to be a typical gyroballer in Japan. According to the book, the authors confirmed he threw a two-seam gyroball. It confuses the <b>batter</b> <b>by</b> giving the illusion that the ball is faster than it actually is, because of the greater difference between the start speed and end speed. The batter cannot adapt to the slower end speed, which is not what he expected.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{a pitcher}} could {{intentionally}} walk a <b>batter</b> <b>by</b> simply announcing his intent {{to do so}} and not have to actually throw any pitches. Beginning in 2008, the pitcher had to actually pitch the required four balls (which were counted against the pitch count). In 2017, the Major and Minor levels of Little League Baseball aligned with a new rule of Major League Baseball and allowed the batter to intentionally walk a <b>batter</b> simply <b>by</b> declaration. The intentional walk adds 4 to the pitcher's pitch count. This change rescinded a former rule in which the team at bat could decline the award of first base and force the pitcher to pitch, such as to further inflate the pitch count to force the removal of the pitcher.|$|R
5|$|Further inland, several weather {{stations}} reported hurricane-force winds. The Weather Bureau office in Wilmington, North Carolina, reported maximum sustained winds of 88mph (142km/h) and a peak gust of 135mph (220km/h), exceeding {{the previous record}} for fastest measured wind speed of 98mph (158km/h) set during Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Beach resorts there were heavily damaged. In Wrightsville Beach, located 10mi (15km) of Wilmington, 12houses were flattened by the hurricane. Damage to homes there were estimated by police to cost $300,000, and extensive damage to the water system was reported. In Long Beach, damage was less severe, with only minor property damage. Waves pushing past sand dunes caused cracks in seaside roads. Though surveys made no damage estimates, damage in Holden Beach {{was reported to have}} been worse than in Long Beach. A 300ft (90m) pier and a pavilion in Ocean Isle Beach were destroyed. In Topsail Beach and Kure Beach, several homes and businesses were either unroofed or destroyed. Yaupon Beach and Shallotte also had similar reports of unroofed homes. Two homes on Topsail Island were demolished, and extensive property damage was reported in Atlantic Beach. At Cape Fear, winds were estimated at 125mph (200km/h), with gusts as high as 160mph (260km/h), well into Category3 intensity. The powerful winds forced power to be cut off in Wilmington as a precautionary measure. As a result, 7,000telephones were knocked out of service. Damage to the Southern Bell Telephone Company's offices cost $150,000. Total damages in the city was estimated to cost nearly $2million. In Morehead City, a roof was blown from a yacht shed and multiple structures. Long-distance telephone services were also cut off. Off the coast on Ocracoke Island, power and communications failed during the storm after the island was <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> winds of 60mph (100km/h). Power outages were commonplace in other areas as well. In Southport, metal debris was scattered across city streets, and the damage there was described as worse than Hurricane Hazel. Half of its pier was swept away by the rough seas, and other buildings collapsed or sustained heavy damage. Numerous trees, including live oak, were uprooted by the winds. The United States Army provided the port with a temporary electrical generator, which provided power for water pumps and light. In Cape Hatteras, Helene caused an estimated $1million in damages. Although damage to infrastructure tapered off 10mi (15km) from the coast, crop damage was observed 40mi (65km) inland. Corn was the crop most affected by Helene.|$|E
25|$|On May28, Amarillo, Texas was <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> a major hailstorm. An {{estimated}} 35,000vehicles {{and thousands}} of homes were damaged in the storm, with insured losses expected to reach $400million.|$|E
25|$|The attacking force {{assembled}} {{outside of}} the sound beginning on November 3 after being <b>battered</b> <b>by</b> a storm during their journey down the coast. Because of losses in the storm, the army {{was not able to}} land, so the battle was reduced to a contest between ship-based guns and those on shore.|$|E
50|$|Win {{probability}} is {{a statistical}} tool which suggests a sports team's {{chances of winning}} at any given point in a game, based {{on the performance of}} historical teams in the same situation. The art of estimating win probability involves choosing which pieces of context matter. Baseball win probability estimates often include whether a team is home or away, inning, number of outs, which bases are occupied, and the score difference. Because baseball proceeds <b>batter</b> <b>by</b> <b>batter,</b> each new batter introduces a discrete state. There are a limited number of possible states, and so baseball win probability tools usually have enough data to make an informed estimate.|$|R
