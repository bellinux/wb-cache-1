NuScale {{was the first}} to submit plans for small reactors to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is widely expected to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> get government approval. It was also being evaluated by a consortium of utility companies called Energy Northwest.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the civil}} war, Mongalla had {{suffered}} considerable physical neglect and damage, and population loss. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla {{as one of the}} Nile ports to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be rehabilitated. He warned that demands for reconstruction spending would be much greater than available funding, so work had to be prioritized.|$|E

50|$|HHCL was {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} <b>firsts</b> in <b>the</b> UK advertising industry. As a major ad agency, they <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> offer above <b>the</b> line, below the line and PR. They were online by 1993 and <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> give mobile phones to their staff in 1994. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> embrace hot desking and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> use project teams to create work.

50|$|The agency {{also created}} several {{advertising}} <b>firsts.</b> They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> run two different ads concurrently on different channels, for First Direct in 1989. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> advertise on <b>the</b> back of Tube tickets, for Mercury Communications in 1992. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> create a TV ad that viewers needed to record and play back slowly, for Mazda in 1994. They <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> place a web address on a commercial, for Tango in 1994 and they revolutionised sponsorship idents by using dialogue and live action for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time for Tango's sponsorship of The Word in 1994.|$|R
5|$|Koṇḍañña's {{previous}} rebirths {{are described}} in many accounts in Buddhist literature. These accounts show that he had vowed in previous existences to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> comprehend the dharma when {{it was to be}} proclaimed by an enlightened Buddha. They also document that the seeds of his relationship with Gautama Buddha as the first arahant were sown in previous existences in which they had crossed paths.|$|E
5|$|Many early researchers, {{both before}} and after the {{periodic}} table was published, were eager to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> discover and name the missing element. Its location in the table suggested that it should be easier to find than other undiscovered elements.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{are also}} {{thought to have}} come into {{knowledge}} about elements such as antimony, copper, crude arsenic, lead, opium, and mandrake (among others) which are mentioned in papyri.

25|$|Gerhard Herzberg <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> {{actually}} observe <b>the</b> {{spectrum of}} neutral H3, and this triatomic molecule <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> have a Rydberg spectrum measured where its own ground state was unstable.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, Harper <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> debut <b>the</b> Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI) {{system in}} Michigan. Also in 2004, {{surgeons}} at Harper <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> perform a kidney transplant on an HIV recipient.|$|R
50|$|The Martin Waldseemüller map of 1507 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> Americas {{separating}} {{two distinct}} oceans. Later, the Diogo Ribeiro map of 1529 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> Pacific at about its proper size.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, Bainbridge {{remained}} an outspoken proponent {{of civilian control}} of nuclear power and the abandonment of nuclear testing. In 1950 {{he was one of}} twelve prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S.

5|$|A further {{testament}} to this devotion included Hasan-Jalal's commissioning of the Gandzasar Monastery. Construction {{of the monastery}} began in 1216 and lasted until 1238. On July 22, 1240, amid great celebration during Vardavar celebrations and {{in the presence of}} nearly 700 priests including Nerses, the Catholicos of Albania, the church was consecrated. The monastery {{went on to become the}} residence and sepulcher of the family as well as the house of the catholicos; beginning in the 15th century, the family also monopolized control over the seat of Catholicos itself, which would from thereon in pass down from uncle to nephew. Hasan-Jalal's son John VII is considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> have established this practice when he became the Catholicos whereas his nephew, also named John, became the second.|$|E
5|$|A {{highlight}} of the series in 1959 was when the Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see the photographic results of the Luna 3 probe, and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, C-COR {{introduced}} {{the use of}} integrated circuits in amplifiers used on utility poles and in 1969 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> use heat fins on amplifiers. In 1991, C-COR <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> introduce a 1 GHz amplifier.|$|R
50|$|Twelve-year-old Peter Chilvers {{is often}} cited for inventing a {{sailboard}} in 1958.

5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much less favorable conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be rehabilitated.|$|E
5|$|At 06:45, a U.S. scout {{aircraft}} sighted {{the carriers}} of Nagumo's main body. At 06:58, a Japanese scout aircraft reported {{the location of}} Hornets task force. Both sides raced to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> attack the other. The Japanese were first to get their strike force launched, with 64 aircraft, including 21 Aichi D3A2 dive bombers, 20 Nakajima B5N2 torpedo bombers, 21 A6M3 Zero fighters, and two Nakajima B5N2 command and control aircraft on the way towards Hornet by 07:40. Also at 07:40, two U.S. SBD-3 Dauntless scout aircraft, responding to the earlier sighting of the Japanese carriers, arrived and dove on Zuihō. With the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) busy chasing other U.S. scout aircraft away, the two U.S. aircraft were able to hit Zuihō with both their 500-pound bombs, causing heavy damage and preventing the carrier's flight deck {{from being able to}} land aircraft.|$|E

5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase the risk to human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> be hit by floods {{in the event of a}} tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E
5|$|General Matsui, {{along with}} the Army General Staff, envisaged making a slow and steady march on Nanking, but his {{subordinates}} refused to play along and instead raced eagerly {{with each other to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> get to the city. Soon all units were roaring to Nanking at the breakneck pace of up to forty kilometers (25 miles) per day. For instance, the 10th Army captured the key town of Guangde on November 30 three days before it was even supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines they had to purchase or loot their food from Chinese civilians along the way.|$|E
5|$|In 2069, the {{unmanned}} Sun Probe locates {{a planet}} {{lying on the}} same orbital path as Earth {{on the opposite side}} of the Sun. Dr Kurt Hassler (Herbert Lom) of the European Space Exploration Council (EUROSEC) has been relaying the spacecraft's flight data to a rival power in the East; after tracing the transmissions to Hassler's laboratory, Security Chief Mark Neuman (George Sewell) catches the scientist in the act and kills him. EUROSEC director Jason Webb (Patrick Wymark) convinces NASA representative David Poulson (Ed Bishop) that the West must <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> send a mission to investigate the planet. With EUROSEC member states France and Germany unwilling to provide financial support, Webb obtains funding from NASA; American astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross (Roy Thinnes) and British astrophysicist Dr John Kane (Ian Hendry), the head of the Sun Probe project, are assigned to the mission.|$|E

5|$|In December 1974 Bill Gates was {{a student}} at Harvard University and Paul Allen worked for Honeywell in Boston. They saw the Altair 8800 {{computer}} in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics and knew it was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. They wanted to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor based Traf-O-Data computer would give them a head start. While their friend, Paul Gilbert, was building the computer, Allen wrote a program that ran on a DEC PDP-10 time-sharing computer that simulated the 8008 system. He also modified DEC's macro assembler to produce the machine code for the 8008 microprocessor. The Traf-O-Data software could be written and debugged before the computer hardware was complete.|$|E
