40|$|This paper {{distinguishes between}} <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> the {{activity}} and {{those associated with}} changes in the demand for another jointly-produced output. It attempts to define when one or more jointly-produced outputs would be <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> the activity and others would be produced at the margin. The conditions are explored that are necessary for one or more jointly-produced outputs to be, or behave like, <b>by-products</b> <b>of</b> the activity. These conditions are expected to help in sorting out by-products from marginally produced outputs {{in the preparation of}} cost structures for analytic work.

5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost.

5|$|For {{several years}} in the 1950s and 1960s, a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> {{potassium}} production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium, with the rest being potassium and {{a small amount of}} caesium. Today the largest producers of caesium, such as the Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as a by-product from pollucite.|$|E

5|$|Rome's {{territorial}} {{expansion in}} Europe {{and across the}} Mediterranean, and its development of mining, led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era, with an estimated annual output peaking at 80,000 tonnes. Like their predecessors, the Romans obtained lead mostly as a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> silver smelting. Lead mining occurred in Central Europe, Britain, the Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, and Hispania, the latter accounting for 40% of world production.|$|E
5|$|The papery bark of {{the white}} birch tree (Betula papyrifera) was used {{extensively}} by Native Americans. Wigwams were covered by it and canoes were constructed from it. Other uses included food containers, hunting and fishing equipment, musical instruments, toys and sledges. Nowadays, bark chips, a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> the timber industry, are used as a mulch and as a growing medium for epiphytic plants that need a soil-free compost.|$|E
5|$|Today, some cobalt is {{produced}} specifically from various metallic-lustered ores, for example cobaltite (CoAsS), {{but the main}} source of the element is as a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> copper and nickel mining.

5|$|Zirconium is a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> {{the mining}} and {{processing}} of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, {{as well as}} tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne, the price for unwrought zirconium metal decreased from $39,900 to $22,700 per ton. Zirconium metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes are expensive.|$|E
5|$|After the French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Louis Jacques Thénard, and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac {{approved}} the experiments {{of the young}} pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the Académie des Sciences and published in Annales de Chimie et Physique. In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from muride to brôme on the proposal of M. Anglada. Brôme (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac suggested the name brôme for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in Stassfurt enabled its production as a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> potash.|$|E
5|$|Large {{stockpiles}} of weapons-grade plutonium were built up {{by both the}} Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103tonnes, and an estimated 170tonnes of military-grade plutonium was produced in the USSR. Each year about 20tonnes of the element is still produced as a <b>by-product</b> <b>of</b> the nuclear power industry. As much as 1000tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons.|$|E
