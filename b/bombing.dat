5|$|During the {{preparation}} for D-Day {{in the spring}} of 1944, the Allies launched the Transport Plan, carrying out intensive <b>bombing</b> of railway junctions and transport networks across northern France and Belgium. Many of these targets were in towns near densely populated civilian areas, such as La Louvière and Kortrijk in Belgium, which were bombed in March 1944. The phase of <b>bombing</b> in the lead up to D-Day alone resulted in 1,500 civilian casualties. <b>Bombing</b> of targets in Belgium steadily increased as the Allies advanced westward across France. Allied <b>bombing</b> during the liberation in September 1944 killed 9,750 Belgians and injured 40,000.|$|E
5|$|Hanoi, {{which had}} {{continuously}} stipulated {{that it would}} not conduct negotiations while the <b>bombing</b> continued, finally agreed to meet with the Americans for preliminary talks in Paris. As a result, President Johnson declared that a complete <b>bombing</b> halt over North Vietnam would go into effect on 1 November 1968, just prior to the U.S. presidential election. Although the <b>bombing</b> halt was to be linked to progress in the peace talks, the Joint Chiefs were skeptical that the administration would reopen the <b>bombing</b> campaign under any circumstances. They were correct. North Vietnam was not the target of intense <b>bombing</b> again for another three and half years.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 the United States changed tactics from {{strategic}} <b>bombing</b> {{of military}} sites to indiscriminate <b>bombing</b> of cities, {{including the use}} of incendiary cluster bombs. The first successful firebombing raid against Japan was an attack on Kobe on 4 February 1945. The <b>bombing</b> was centred upon Hyogo and Minato wards.|$|E

50|$|A letter <b>bomb,</b> {{also called}} parcel <b>bomb,</b> mail <b>bomb,</b> package <b>bomb,</b> note <b>bomb,</b> message <b>bomb,</b> gift <b>bomb,</b> present <b>bomb,</b> {{delivery}} <b>bomb,</b> surprise <b>bomb,</b> postal <b>bomb,</b> or post <b>bomb,</b> is an explosive device sent via the postal service, and designed {{with the intention}} to injure or kill the recipient when opened. They {{have been used in}} Israeli assassinations and in terrorist attacks such as those of the Unabomber. Some countries have agencies whose duties include the interdiction of letter <b>bombs</b> and the investigation of letter bombings. The letter <b>bomb</b> may have been in use for nearly as long as the common postal service has been in existence, as far back as 1764 (see Examples).|$|R
50|$|An unguided <b>bomb,</b> {{also known}} as a {{free-fall}} <b>bomb,</b> gravity <b>bomb,</b> dumb <b>bomb,</b> or iron <b>bomb,</b> is a conventional aircraft-delivered <b>bomb</b> that does not contain a guidance system and hence, simply follows a ballistic trajectory.|$|R
5|$|A {{variety of}} {{conspiracy}} theories {{have been proposed}} about the events surrounding the <b>bombing.</b> Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knew of the impending <b>bombing</b> and intentionally failed to act on that knowledge. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants of a controlled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site were delayed until the area had been declared safe by the Oklahoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. According to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a memo issued by the United States Atlantic Command the day following the attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theories focus on additional conspirators involved with the <b>bombing.</b> Additional theories claim the <b>bombing</b> {{was carried out by}} the government in order to frame the militia movement or to provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiracy theories suggest that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japanese government or German Neo-Nazis, were involved in the <b>bombing.</b> Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been opened at various times to look into the theories.|$|E
5|$|After an April 21, 1995, {{court hearing}} on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they {{continued}} their investigation into the <b>bombing.</b> Rather than talk to investigators about the <b>bombing,</b> McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police and helicopters that a <b>bombing</b> suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>bombing,</b> the {{residence}} of the President of Croatia was moved from the Banski dvori to the Presidential palaceformerly known as Villa Zagorjein the Pantovčak area of Zagreb. Funds to repair the Banski dvori were approved in 1995, and the site became the official residence of the Croatian Government. A plaque commemorating the <b>bombing</b> was placed at the Banski dvori facade 20years after the attack, in 2011. The <b>bombing</b> is also commemorated by the Zagreb City Museum as the event is featured in the Zagreb in Independent Croatia collection of its permanent display.|$|E

5|$|An {{observance}} is {{held each}} year to remember {{the victims of the}} <b>bombing.</b> An annual marathon draws thousands, and allows runners to sponsor a victim of the <b>bombing.</b> For the tenth anniversary of the <b>bombing,</b> the city held 24days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous years, the tenth anniversary of the <b>bombing</b> observances began with a service at 9:02a.m., marking the moment the bomb went off, with the traditional 168seconds of silence—onesecond for each person who was killed {{as a result of the}} blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, read by children to symbolize the future of Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00 448 B-24 Liberators of the United States Army Air Forces, {{having already}} {{completed}} one <b>bombing</b> mission over Omaha late the previous day, returned. However, with the skies overcast and under orders to avoid <b>bombing</b> the troops which were by then approaching the beach, the bombers overshot their targets {{and only three}} bombs fell near the beach area.|$|E

50|$|Large-sized <b>bombs,</b> {{which may}} be nuclear, are dropped from hook-type {{releases}} or <b>bomb</b> cradles. When a bomber carries many smaller <b>bombs</b> (e.g. iron <b>bombs,</b> JDAMs), the <b>bombs</b> are typically loaded onto mechano-electrical devices known as ejector racks, which allow for larger <b>bomb</b> loads to be dropped with greater accuracy.|$|R

50|$|The main {{differences}} between logic <b>bombs</b> and time <b>bombs</b> {{is that a}} logic <b>bomb</b> may have a timing function implemented into it as a failsafe if the conditions are not met in a certain time period (it may delete itself or activate its payload using the timing system), while time <b>bombs</b> only use timing functions to activate themselves.Time <b>bombs,</b> once activated, will unload their payload (which may be malicious) {{in a similar way}} logic <b>bombs</b> deliver their payloads to the target. The main difference between time <b>bombs</b> and logic <b>bombs,</b> and how their payload differs from a fork <b>bomb,</b> is that a fork <b>bomb</b> has no payload and instead creates copies of itself to do damage.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bombs</b> {{were carried}} in two-section <b>bomb</b> bay in the {{fuselage}} (with space for 4 <b>bombs)</b> and 8 <b>bomb</b> bays {{in the central}} section of the wings (with space for 16 <b>bombs).</b> This arrangement of <b>bomb</b> bays imposed considerable restrictions on the types of <b>bombs</b> that could be carried, especially in the wing bays which were quite small as they had to fit between the ribs of the wing. The maximum load was 2,580 kg (2 × 300 kg and 18 × 110 kg). Apart from two 300 kg <b>bombs</b> {{in one of the}} fuselage <b>bomb</b> bays, it could not carry <b>bombs</b> larger than 110 kg. With maximum loadout, most of the weight of the <b>bombs</b> was carried inside the wings. There were no provisions for mounting <b>bombs</b> {{on the outside of the}} aircraft. During the Invasion of Poland in 1939, 110 kg was the maximum weight used, since the 300 kg <b>bombs</b> were only available in small quantities, and difficult to load at improvised airfields with little infrastructure. 50 kg <b>bombs</b> were also used. Maximal <b>bomb</b> load taken from soft surface runways was reduced to about 800-1200 kg.|$|R
5|$|In {{the last}} eight weeks of the war the <b>bombing</b> {{intensified}} until British <b>bombing</b> operations were suspended in late April 1945. By this time, most of the German airfields were under threat from the advancing Allied ground forces and the mass surrender of the Nachtjagd was taking place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the <b>bombing</b> of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible. The instructions did not result in attacks in Zagreb itself, but JNA barracks in Samobor were captured by Croatian forces {{on the day of the}} <b>bombing.</b> The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day.|$|E
5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that the <b>bombing</b> killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the <b>bombing</b> appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet <b>bombing</b> attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{fuselage}} <b>bomb</b> bay used four <b>bomb</b> racks, {{in later}} versions eight modular standard <b>bomb</b> racks designed to carry one SC 250kg (550lb) <b>bomb</b> or four SC 50kg (110lb) <b>bombs</b> each in nose up orientation. These modular standard <b>bomb</b> racks were a common feature {{on the first}} generation of Luftwaffe bombers, but it turned out that they limited the ordnance selection to <b>bombs</b> of only two sizes. These racks were abandoned in later designs.|$|R
