Between 1998 and 2003, this system was overlaid with an Alstom Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES), using track-mounted transponders {{similar to the}} <b>Balises</b> of the modern European Train Control System.

25|$|The Automatic Train Supervision {{sub-system}} {{provides for}} headway management and proper interleaving of trains at junctions by speeding up or slowing down trains. The system works via {{a series of}} track mounted <b>balises,</b> which function as information beacons transmitting a speed code to the train as it passes overhead. Its designers intended its function to be non-vital, and for this reason, the design is not fail-safe. At no point can the ATC system override the maximum speed limit enforced by the cab signal system.|$|E

50|$|The Eurobalise is {{a passive}} or active antenna device mounted on rail sleepers. Mostly it transmits {{information}} to the driving vehicle. It can be arranged in groups to transfer information. There are Fixed and Transparent Data <b>Balises.</b> Transparent Data <b>Balises</b> are sending changing information from LEU to the trains, e.g. signal indications. Fixed <b>Balises</b> are programmed for a special information like gradients and speed restrictions.|$|E
50|$|These {{on-board}} systems use {{pairs of}} <b>balises</b> {{mounted on the}} sleepers. The pairs of <b>balises</b> distinguish signals in one direction {{from the other direction}} with semicontinuous speed supervision, using a wayside to train punctual transmission using wayside transponders.|$|E
50|$|Eurobalises are {{typically}} placed in pairs on two sleepers {{in the center}} of the track. For ETCS they {{are typically}} spaced 3 metres apart. With the <b>balises</b> being numbered the train will know whether it travels in nominal (1→2) or reverse direction (2→1). Singular <b>balises</b> exist only when linked to a previous balise group or when their function is reduced to provide only the exact position. There may be up to 8 <b>balises</b> in an balise group.|$|E
50|$|<b>Balises</b> {{operate with}} {{equipment}} {{on the train}} to provide a system that enhances the safety of train operation: at the approaches to stations with multiple platforms fixed <b>balises</b> may be deployed, as a more accurate supplement to GPS, to enable safe operation of automatic selective door opening.|$|E
50|$|The direct {{predecessor}} of Eurobalises are the <b>balises</b> of the French KVB {{train protection}} system. Its full name '' provided also {{the name for}} the beacons: <b>balises.</b> It had been developed after a crash in 1985 and it was deployed in the early 1990s on French lines.|$|E

50|$|<b>Balises</b> are {{differentiated}} {{as being}} either a 'Fixed Data Balise' transmitting {{the same data}} to every train, or a 'Transparent Data Balise' which transmits variable data, also called a 'Switchable' or 'Controllable Balise'. (Note that the word 'fixed' refers to the information transmitted by the balise, not to its physical location. All <b>balises</b> are immobile).|$|E

50|$|In {{general the}} GNT ZUB <b>balises</b> are placed {{slightly}} before the PZB inductor signalling an override speed information {{so that the}} traditional PZB on-board system is temporarily disabled at that PZB control point. In the first generation the ZUB and PZB <b>balises</b> were put {{next to each other}} using the same installation pattern on the outer side of the rails and connecting to the same line side signal. The second generation places the balise {{in the middle of the}} rail as any other Eurobalise.|$|E
50|$|The ZUB 1xx {{system is}} a family of train {{protection}} systems produced by Siemens. Its ZUB <b>balises</b> were deployed in the ZUB 121 train protection system in the Swiss railway network, in the ZUB 122 tilting control system in the German railway network, and in the ZUB 123 train protection system in the Danish railway network. Some of these were adapted for other railway lines before the next generation ZUB 2xx family was introduced {{which is based on}} Eurobalises - the earlier ZUB <b>balises</b> are not compatible with those.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the accident, the Spanish rail authority Adif installed three ASFA ("Automatic Braking and Announcement of Signals" [...] in English) <b>balises</b> on 1.9 km of the approach to Santiago de Compostela to enforce speed limits of 160, 60 and 30 km/h, to prevent trains from reaching the 2013 accident point at a speed that would cause a similar derailment. <b>Balises</b> are track-mounted programmable transponders which communicate with the on-board computers on Spanish high-speed trains, and which can cause an automatic brake application if speed restrictions are not obeyed.|$|E

While the Eurobalises are compatible with the earlier KER <b>balises</b> (named after their usage in the KVB, Ebicab and RSDD train protection systems) the ZUB <b>balises</b> are not. With the introduction of ETCS to be in sight the further development of the ZUB 1xx family was stopped.
