25|$|As {{a result}} {{of some of these}} incidents, campaigners have <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> for a {{reduction}} of the road's speed limit since at least 2004. The speed limit for most of the road (excepting where it passes through settlements) is currently 60 miles per hour, the highest limit for non-motorways in the United Kingdom. However, at times of bad weather, the speed limit can be reduced by Cumbria County Council.|$|E

Similarly, [...] "The Beehive" [...] could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to equal 60000 points, as there {{would be at least}} 10,000 bees in a beehive; conversely it could <b>be</b> <b>argued</b> to gain twelve points as the number of bees are not specified.

25|$|The {{value of}} the Australian pound {{remained}} tied to the pound sterling. Inflation in Australia thus increased, less than in Britain, but {{more than in the}} United States. The case for a central bank was increased by the need for the government to cut spending after the war to reduce its debt. Commonwealth Bank Governor Denison Miller had <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> for the issue of Australian currency to be switched from the treasury to the bank, as it had more staff and more monetary knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Sticking one's {{tongue out}} at someone is {{considered}} a childish gesture of rudeness and/or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations, depending {{on the way in}} which it is done.

In 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy was convicted and fined by the country's highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor with whom he had <b>been</b> <b>arguing.</b> Proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera. Blowing a raspberry can also be meant as a gesture of derision.|$|E

The paper gives a short outline of human rationality {{as a matter of}} following plans and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> how this perspective is mirrored in some of the dominant conventional learning theories. Inspired by Lave and Wenger’s (1991) approach to situated learning the heterogeneous aspect of practice is highlighted and it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that we analytically need to distinguish between learning to master specific elements in various communities of practice and to orient oneself in a multiple-contextual practice.

Their subsequent analysis of the effects of bombs on Birmingham and Hull showed that city bombing produced little disruption and production was only affected by direct hits on factories. A supper of scientists in Soho generated a multi-author book Science in War produced in a month by Allen Lane, one of the guests, arguing that science should be applied in every part of the war effort.|$|E
25|$|After Noah is blinded in an {{accident}} at film school, he breaks off with Luke, feeling a need to be independent and blaming Luke, because the couple had <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> {{at the time of}} the accident. Noah finds a specialist, neurosurgeon Reid Oliver, whom he believes he can cure his sight, and Luke tries to lure the arrogant doctor to Oakdale; when promises of money do not work, he successfully blackmails him. In spite of this rocky start, the pair gradually fall in love. When Noah eventually begins to consider reuniting with Luke, Luke is torn - both angry at Noah's prior treatment and confused by his feelings for Reid. Reid eventually resigns from the hospital when he realizes that he must either do so or break off his relationship with Luke, the hospital's biggest donor, but is soon reinstated. Tragically, Reid is mortally injured when his car is struck by a train.|$|E

40|$|It <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> an “externalist” in {{at least}} one sense.

There is, therefore, no neutral “content” that such perceptual experiences share with hallucinations, differing from them only over whether some additional non-psychological condition holds or not. In short, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl <b>was</b> a “disjunctivist”. In addition, it <b>is</b> <b>argued</b> that Husserl held that the individual object of any experience, perceptual or hallucinatory, is essential to and partly constitutive of that experience.

500|$|The state {{constitution}} {{was sent to}} the United States Congress for ratification in December 1857. [...] The approval process was drawn out for several months while Congress debated over issues that had stemmed from the Kansas-Nebraska Act.

[...] After that, Northerners feared that Minnesota's Democratic delegation would support slavery in Kansas. [...] Finally, after the Kansas question was settled and after Congress decided how many representatives Minnesota would get in the House of Representatives, the bill passed. The eastern half of the Minnesota Territory, under the boundaries defined by Henry Mower Rice, became the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858.

500|$|Both sides played defensively {{which led}} many {{commentators}} to bemoan the poor {{quality of the}} match. There were frequent pauses for injuries and accusations of diving. However, some analysts commented on the genuine desire to win both teams displayed. Numerous goal opportunities were missed, most notably by Tyrone, although only a block from Conor Gormley prevented Steven McDonnell from equalising for Armagh in the 68th minute. Tyrone led 008 [...] 004 at half-time; five of their points were scored by Peter Canavan from frees. He was replaced during the interval due to a relapse of his ankle injury during training, although he did return to the pitch for the final few minutes. Diarmuid Marsden was controversially sent off {{in the second half}} following an off-the-ball incident, leaving Armagh with only fourteen players. Marsden had <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> with Conor Gormley when he was approached by Philip Jordan. Marsden raised his arm and made contact with Jordan, who fell to the ground. Some commentators claimed Jordan was feigning injury to get his opponent sent off. [...] Armagh managed to stay within two points of Tyrone at times but were ultimately unable to catch Tyrone. At the final whistle, Tyrone fans invaded the pitch and remained there for an hour. In his speech after lifting the trophy, Peter Canavan dedicated the victory to every Tyrone team he had played on, the 1986 team (beaten in the final by Kerry) and every player who had played on teams without success. He also spoke of his father, who had died over the summer, and of Paul McGirr, who had played alongside many of the Tyrone team before he died in a freak accident aged 18.|$|E
