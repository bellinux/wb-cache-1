5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called to her brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
5|$|Candaules {{depicts a}} scene from the first book of the Histories by Herodotus. Candaules, king of the ancient kingdom of Lydia, {{believed}} his wife Nyssia to be the world's most beautiful woman. He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind the door and watched Nyssia undress. Nyssia noticed Gyges as he slipped out of the room afterwards, but remained silent.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Uncle Vernon punishes Harry, fitting locks to his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> bars to the windows. However, Ron Weasley {{arrives with}} his twin {{brothers}} Fred and George in their father Arthur’s enchanted Ford Anglia and they rescue Harry, who stays at their family home, the Burrow, {{for the remainder}} of his holidays. Harry and the other Weasleys—mother Molly, third eldest son Percy, and daughter Ginny (who has a crush on Harry)—travel to Diagon Alley. There, they are reunited with Hermione Granger and introduced to Lucius Malfoy, father of Harry’s school nemesis Draco, and Gilderoy Lockhart, a conceited autobiographer who has been appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts professor after the death of Professor Quirrel. When Harry and Ron approach Platform 9 3/4 in King's Cross station it refuses to allow them pass; instead, they fly Arthur’s car to Hogwarts, where they crash into a sentient willow tree on the grounds.|$|E
60|$|As {{the words}} passed his lips, the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> opened, <b>and</b> Miss Rachel came out among us suddenly.|$|R
6000|$|He {{opens the}} <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> Left, <b>and</b> stands {{waiting for her}} to go. [...] Summoning up her courage, she goes to open the outer door. A sudden [...] change comes over DANCY'S face; from being stony it grows almost [...] maniacal.|$|R
6000|$|The <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> here opened <b>and</b> the {{individual}} who had called out [...] "Grady, my coat," [...] appeared without the garment in question.|$|R
25|$|Since Marriott {{was found}} {{lying on the}} floor between the bed and wall, {{investigators}} concluded that he tried unsuccessfully to escape after being awakened by the blaze. Disoriented and confused after inhaling large amounts of thick smoke, Marriott had turned left instead of right towards the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> safety. He had been unable to rectify his mistake before being overcome with smoke. At the inquest, a verdict of accidental death by smoke inhalation was recorded. Marriott's blood was found to contain quantities of Valium (taken earlier for flight nerves), alcohol and cocaine.|$|E
500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the burglar alarm, but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E
2500|$|Seward's son, Frederick, {{appeared}} {{at the top of}} the steps in his nightclothes. As Powell reached the second floor, Frederick ordered Powell to stop. Seward's daughter, Fanny, stuck her head out of her father's <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> warned the men that Seward was sleeping. She then returned to the bedroom. Powell said he was delivering medicine, and Frederick asked for the bottle. Powell gave it to him, then pulled out his revolver and pulled the trigger with the barrel of the gun against Frederick's chest. The revolver misfired, and Powell pistol-whipped Frederick over and over. Bell fled the house screaming [...] "Murder! Murder!" [...] and raced to the office of General Christopher C. Augur next door for help. Terrified, Herold tied Powell's horse to a tree and fled on his own steed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nice room, this," [...] Mr. Henneford remarked approvingly. [...] "Slap up, ain't it? Your <b>bedroom's</b> next <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> your secretary's just {{round the}} corner. Done you proud, I reckon. Like a royal suite, eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|The fat boy gasped, {{looked at}} the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> gasped again, <b>and</b> wiped two tears away with the knuckle of each of his forefingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear cousin, I hope I {{have not}} done wrong. Helena left me all by myself. When I had {{finished}} darning the curtain, I really didn't know what to do. So I opened all the <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> upstairs <b>and</b> looked into the rooms. In the big room with two beds--oh, I am so ashamed--I found this book. Please look at the first page." ...|$|R
2500|$|Huguely and Love dated {{over the}} course of two years, but had broken up. At the Charlottesville police station, Huguely waived his Miranda rights and narrated graphic details of his assaulting Love, stating that he kicked open Love's locked <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> [...] "shook Love, and her head {{repeatedly}} hit the wall". Evidence that police seized from Huguely's apartment included two Apple laptop computers, a spiral notebook, two white socks, bathroom and entryway rugs, and a Virginia lacrosse shirt with a red stain. Investigators also followed leads of domestic violence between Huguely and Love, including threatening e-mail and text messages that Huguely sent to Love post-breakup; a violent encounter between the couple that was broken up by several visiting lacrosse players from the [...] University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and an incident in which Huguely attacked Love while drunk but did not recall having hit her. An unnamed student told the New York Daily News that Huguely and Love broke up after the drunken Huguely assaulted Love.|$|E
2500|$|In retrospect, {{aside from}} being a {{collection}} of songs, there is a perception among some that the album tells a story; that its structure consists of a beginning, middle and end. One critic opined: [...] "There is a proper introduction, a rousing orchestral finale, and arguably a coherent narrative of love, sex, drugs and loss." [...] Anderson was highly influenced by the silver screen and admitted that during the recording of Suede's debut album, he watched Performance every night. Critics have noted the album's cinematic influence, with Simon Price writing that Anderson used {{the city as a}} [...] "cinematic backdrop to the tragic heroism of his own life." [...] Likewise, on the subject of Suede's familiar lyrical themes, the Radio Times wrote that [...] "He [...] would replace it with something deeper and timeless, drawing on old Hollywood and tragic, quotidian love stories." [...] Critics have likened the album to having an aura of claustrophobia. While SPIN, summarised the album as [...] "the work of a man cautiously opening the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> reeling from the discovery that other people have lives." [...] Other themes the album explores are solitude, paranoia and self-loathing. On the darker side the album depicts tragedy, failed relationships and doomed romances; however, within this dark setting, Anderson allowed positive statements of ambition and social mobility, reflected in [...] "The Power".|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} while Hester Dethridge opened Geoffrey's <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> went in.|$|E
6000|$|... "A few things, but not that, my pretty lady," [...] he said good-naturedly. [...] "You silly little fibster! I {{heard you}} in the room overhead, where I have no doubt you were putting a little rouge on--you must give some of yours to my Lady Gaunt, whose {{complexion}} is quite preposterous--and I heard the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> open, <b>and</b> then you came downstairs." ...|$|R
60|$|All at {{once the}} <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> opened softly, <b>and</b> Helene was {{standing}} there, looking at me. At first I saw her dimly, as in a vision, then clearly. I leaped {{to my feet and}} went and stood beside her.|$|R
6000|$|They {{had come}} to Flora's dressing-room. Her <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> was open, <b>and</b> George was pacing heavily {{up and down the}} length of both apartments, {{fiercely}} indignant. [...] "Well!" [...] said he, advancing eagerly on Dr. May, [...] "has she confessed?" ...|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN (opening <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> catting mendaciously). Captain Brown will excuse you, Phoebe.|$|E
60|$|The third day, however, Francis {{called on}} him. There was a tap at the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> {{the young man}} entered, all eyes of curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|The figure came onward, bent to the keyhole of the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> whispered (supposing {{him still}} inside), 'Swithin, on second {{thoughts}} I {{think you may}} stay with safety.' ...|$|E
60|$|The visit was, indeed, {{extended}} {{two days}} beyond that time; for the count and countess so pressed {{him that he}} was glad to give way, especially as his own inclinations strongly seconded their entreaties. On the ninth morning he was astonished when his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> opened <b>and</b> Karl came in, and gave his morning's salute as impassively as if he had seen him the evening before.|$|R
50|$|Victoria and Robert {{find that}} someone has painted a large 'X' in blood on their <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Robert <b>and</b> Donald go downstairs to investigate, but Donald collapses after being drugged. Robert investigates the cellar and sees someone he recognizes. Shortly afterward, Victoria finds his body hanging by the ankles on the stairs. The next morning, while {{discussing}} what happened, Ruth asks Martha if she had tied up Colin that night.|$|R
50|$|The maid Nina {{hears the}} shot {{and comes to}} the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door.</b> Mary panics <b>and</b> sends her away. She phones Flint and asks him to help her. Mary is {{prepared}} to accept full responsibility for her actions. But Flint suggests they try {{to dispose of the}} body.|$|R
6000|$|She {{threw open}} the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> called to the maid, in the sitting-room. [...] "Miss Lundie is waiting for you." [...] Blanche pressed her hand, and left her.|$|E
60|$|Poor Katie {{was kept}} in bed till the afternoon. Charley and Harry, however, were allowed {{to come up to}} her <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> hear her {{pronounce}} herself quite well.|$|E
6000|$|Una {{followed}} abjectly, and the matron seemed well {{pleased with}} her reformation of this wayward young woman. Her voice was curiously anemic, however, as she rapped on a <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called, [...] "Oh, Mrs. Lawrence!" ...|$|E
60|$|Bryngelly Vicarage was a {{very simply}} {{constructed}} house. On entering the visitor {{found himself in a}} passage with doors to the right and left. That to the right led to the sitting-room, that to the left to the dining-room, both of them long, low and narrow chambers. Following the passage down for some seven paces, it terminated in another which ran at right angles to it for {{the entire length of the}} house. On the further side of this passage were several <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> a room at each end. That at the end to the right was occupied by Beatrice and her sister, the next was empty, the third was Mr. Granger's, and the fourth the spare room. This, with the exception of the kitchens and servants' sleeping place, which were beyond the dining-room, made up the house.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{sister-in-law}} described Nancy Lanza as a [...] "gun enthusiast {{who owned}} {{at least a}} dozen firearms". She often took her two sons to a local shooting range and had them learn to shoot. Peter Lanza said he does not believe Nancy Lanza feared her son Adam. She did not confide any fear of Adam to her sister or to her best friend; she slept with her <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> unlocked <b>and</b> she kept guns in the house where she lived with Adam.|$|R
50|$|Knox, then aged 20, {{had called}} the police after {{returning}} to her and Kercher's flat after spending the night with her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, <b>and</b> finding Kercher's <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> locked <b>and</b> blood in the bathroom. Following an interrogation, the conduct {{of which is a}} matter of dispute, Knox implicated herself and her employer, Patrick Lumumba. Knox and Sollecito were initially accused of murdering Kercher while acting in concert with Lumumba, but Lumumba was soon released, and the known burglar Rudy Guede was arrested, after Guede's bloodstained fingerprints were found on Kercher's possessions.|$|R
6000|$|... (Knox tosses {{documents}} {{on top of}} low bookcase between fireplace and <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> starts to shake hands.) You're damn careless with those papers. You wouldn't be if you knew how much Gherst paid for them.|$|E
60|$|She {{jumped out}} of bed and hastily wrapped a cloak round her thin girlish shoulders, and slipped her feet into a pair of heelless shoes, then she opened her <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> looked out upon the landing.|$|E
60|$|There was no answer. He {{went up the}} stairs, in {{dread of}} the empty house--the horrible {{emptiness}} that made his heart ring with insanity. He opened the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> his heart flashed with certainty that she had gone, that he was alone.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilks, {{shivering}} with dread, {{sprang to}} his feet and stood irresolute. Judging by the noise, the captain was evidently in a fine temper, and Mr. Smith's remarks about insanity occurred to him with redoubled interest. Then he heard a hoarse shout, the latch of the <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> clicked, <b>and</b> the prisoner stumbled heavily downstairs and began to fumble at the handle of the door at the bottom. Trembling with excitement Mr. Wilks dashed forward and turned the key, and then retreating to the street door prepared for instant flight.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the book}} was an appendix, giving the German {{traveller}} hints concerning the preservation of his health and comfort during his sojourn in English towns, chief among such hints being advice to him to always travel with a supply of disinfectant powder, to always lock his <b>bedroom</b> <b>door</b> at night, <b>and</b> to always carefully count his small change.|$|R
60|$|Mrs Pipchin {{had kept}} watch and ward over little Paul {{and his sister}} for nearly twelve months. They had been home twice, {{but only for a}} few days; and had been {{constant}} in their weekly visits to Mr Dombey at the hotel. By little and little Paul had grown stronger, and had become able to dispense with his carriage; though he still looked thin and delicate; and still remained the same old, quiet, dreamy child that he had been when first consigned to Mrs Pipchin's care. One Saturday afternoon, at dusk, great consternation was occasioned in the Castle by the unlooked-for announcement of Mr Dombey as a visitor to Mrs Pipchin. The population of the parlour was immediately swept upstairs as on the wings of a whirlwind, and after much slamming of <b>bedroom</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> trampling overhead, and some knocking about of Master Bitherstone by Mrs Pipchin, as a relief to the perturbation of her spirits, the black bombazeen garments of the worthy old lady darkened the audience-chamber where Mr Dombey was contemplating the vacant arm-chair of his son and heir.|$|R
