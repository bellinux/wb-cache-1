40|$|This paper investigates vegetational, {{hydrological}} and geomorphological {{influences on}} sedimentation within the river margin of a 1. 7 km, sinuous {{reach of the}} River Severn, UK. The empirical {{study was designed to}} investigate the impact of the following factors on riparian zone sediment deposition: (i) land use, (ii) channel planform location, (iii) the flood stage at which inundation occurs, (iv) submersion time, (v) flood event timing and ordering. Sedimentation was observed using sediment traps located on 48 sample plots within four sites (one on pasture, one within a poplar plantation and two within mixed riparian woodland) during four flood events. A total of 177 observations of sediment deposition were analysed for total dry weight of sediment, particle size and organic content. All sample plots were located within a 30 m wide ribbon of the riparian zone, immediately above the limit of perennial vegetation (i. e. the edge of the low flow channel). Patterns and rates of sedimentation differed between flood events. Whilst significant differences were found in sedimentation between the four sample sites, these were interpreted to be more a function of planform location than land use. The most marked variations were found in the quantity, particle size and organic content of deposited sediment according to riparian zone cross-sectional morphology and elevation. Highest sedimentation occurred within a 1 m elevation band that correlated with the channel-ward face of a morphological bench. Percentage sand content of deposited sediment exhibited a change from approximately 35 % in a band extending from the low flow channel to a 1 m elevation above the morphological <b>bench</b> <b>edge</b> to approximately 10 % above this level. Organic matter content was low (less than 5 %) in sediment deposited up to a 1 m elevation above the edge of the morphological bench. Above this level, there was a gradual increase in organic matter content. These observations suggest a link between the form of the riparian zone and the sedimentation process. The relative influence of vegetational, hydrological and geomorphological influences on sedimentation characteristics are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{paper about}} a novel form of {{commercial}} sex practice recorded in Vietnam, {{and its implications}} for HIV/AIDS prevention strategies. Female commercial sex workers occupy urban parks in the evenings, offering on-site masturbation services to clients at cheap prices even by local standards. All sex acts are performed in public by workers who sit on <b>benches,</b> path <b>edges</b> or stools, often behind bicycles or open umbrellas in the quest for some semblance of privacy. Clients are local men, with only an occasional foreigner involved. Many sex workers were involved, some having 15 to 20 or more clients a night. Sex workers and clients in Vietnam, as elsewhere, operate at high risk of HIV/AIDS infection. As a service which minimizes risks, this form of commercial sex practice should perhaps be given serious consideration by policy makers and authorities for formal deployment in the fight against AIDS.

5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each robotic arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each robotic arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride <b>bench</b> its <b>edges</b> cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The robotic arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|R

50|$|Where the {{circular}} holes are cut deeper through the canopy, they are clad with stainless steel inside and contain artwork by designer and environmentalist Aniko Meszaros, {{as part of}} her installation entitled, Roots. Meszaros' artwork {{in this part of the}} station consists of intricate stainless steel screens akin to filigree with an organic, root-like design. These screens were cut by laser and meant to allow the sun to cast interesting shadows onto the walkway below. The canopy extends beyond the bus transfer area and even the station's prominent glazed entrance on Victoria Park Avenue (also part of the 2008-2011 renovation) to a prominent column on the pedestrian plaza, wrapped with a rounded <b>bench.</b> The eastern <b>edge</b> of the bus transfer plaza is marked by a concrete retaining wall textured with a root motif.

5000|$|In the 1970s, Turrell {{began his}} series of [...] "skyspaces" [...] {{enclosed}} spaces {{open to the}} sky through an aperture in the roof. A Skyspace is an enclosed room large enough for roughly 15 people. Inside, the viewers sit on <b>benches</b> along the <b>edge</b> to view the sky through {{an opening in the}} roof. As a lifelong Quaker, Turrell designed the Live Oak Meeting House for the Society of Friends, with an opening or skyhole in the roof, wherein the notion of light takes on a decidedly religious connotation. (See PBS documentary). His work Meeting (1986) at P.S. 1, which consists of a square room with a rectangular opening cut directly into the ceiling, is a recreation of such a meeting house. In 2013, Turrell created another Quaker skyspace, Greet the Light, at the newly rebuilt Chestnut Hill Friends Meeting in Philadelphia.|$|R
40|$|Humans {{are social}} animals: {{relationships}} {{are critical to}} our wellbeing. Indeed, a lack of face-to-face contact can put our health at risk. This report looks at ways to make cities better places to live by increasing our opportunities to connect with other people. It examines how the design and functioning of a city – from transport networks to the availability of parks and sporting grounds to the architecture of public spaces and buildings – can help bring people together or keep them apart. It shows that even modest and inexpensive changes, such as installing <b>benches</b> at the <b>edge</b> of a public area or converting an unused lot into a ‘pocket park’, can make urban spaces more welcoming. Australian cities are expected to keep growing for the foreseeable future. If they are to absorb more residents and improve {{quality of life for}} all, then it is essential that cities provide for our social as well as our material needs...|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few days the Conservative backbenchers {{threatened}} to break the truce and mount an attack on the government over the munitions situation. Law forced them to back down on 12 May, but on the 14th an article appeared in The Times blaming the British failure at the Battle of Aubers Ridge on the lack of munitions. This again stirred up the backbenchers, who were only just kept in line. The Shadow Cabinet took a similar line; things could not go on as they were. The crisis was only halted with the resignation of Lord Fisher. Fisher had opposed Winston Churchill over the Gallipoli Campaign, and felt that he could not continue in government if the two would be in conflict. Law knew that this would push the Conservative back <b>bench</b> over the <b>edge,</b> and met with David Lloyd George on 17 May to discuss Fisher's resignation. Lloyd George eventually agreed that [...] "the only way to preserve a united front was to arrange for more complete cooperation between parties {{in the direction of the}} War".|$|R
40|$|Relevance {{of study}} {{is caused by}} the search for {{effective}} schemes and devices to intensify air exchange of open pits, which is, substantially, worsen with increasing depth of pits and intensity of mining operations. To implement air exchange of pits the scheme of ventilation with simultaneously used device for aeration of pits (DAP) is offered. DAP represents the inclined profiled blades on the support, which are set on the top platform of the pit leeside near the edge (patent-protected useful DAP model) and based on the turbo-propeller aviation engines pit fan (PF) before it. The associated works in the field concerned consider general development factors of free and semi-limited jets, being developed near a flat surface that is different from their development in the conditions of limiting quarry out space with various parameters (overall slope angles, depth, <b>benches</b> at the <b>edges,</b> etc.). The work objective was to study and define the structure and optimal arrangement of PF in respect to DAP and estimate efficiency of using DAP+PF scheme through modelling in a wind tunnel by criterion of average speed of aerial currents in the pit, using a DAP+PF scheme of ventilation. Features of development of aerial currents in pits with various parameters are analysed. Consistent patterns of speed distribution of in semi-limited jet currents are determined. It is proved that the air amount involved in air exchange increases by 8 - 10 times in comparison with the case with one PF used. The offered air exchange scheme of the quarry out space can be used both for an intensification of airing pit, and for its ventilation. The received study results of aerial current aerodynamics can be used in designing air exchange of pits according to the offered scheme. </p...|$|R
