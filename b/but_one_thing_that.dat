6000|$|... "You are right. It {{is better}} for you,--it is better than to be William's darling, and the {{greatest}} earl in his court,--to feel that you are still an Englishman. Promise me <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> you will make no fierce or desperate answer to the Duke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yours 'll be the next, you know, Miss Feemy, {{and that}} will be the wedding! <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> bothers me intirely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes! {{everything}} <b>but</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{will save}} him. Well, I will not ask you again. But remember, Thorne, I shall alter my will to-morrow." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a March 2009, {{interview}} with NME Radio, when discussing a potential Libertines reunion, Doherty revealed, [...] "He [...] was saying, 'Well, look, what if it's all gonna happen again?' and I said, 'One thing: maybe it will, maybe it won't, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> {{going to help}} me not fuck up again is you, and doing all that together.' Because he means a lot..." [...] Referring to their relationship in a January 2010 interview, Barât said: [...] "...it's a deep love. Deep love does funny things to people".|$|R
6000|$|And Audrey thought: [...] "And {{at my age}} {{there is}} <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> matters, and that matters worse than death." [...] But she did not speak. To whom, to what should she speak? To this hard old woman, who personified the world? Of what use, words? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk not of robbery. I {{could not}} exist under the {{degradation}} of thinking any of us had your money, while debt and imprisonment thus hung over you. There is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can possibly prevent my paying you back Grace's fortune, the day I am of age, as you will see, Miles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I cannot {{understand}}. I {{see that}} she has had designs on Captain Tilney, which have not succeeded; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time. Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother, and then fly off himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anything <b>but</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I {{have sworn}} not to do." [...] For {{he had told}} the priest of the {{promises}} he had made both to his uncle and to his uncle's widow.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{the right}} way," [...] said the mother. [...] "The woman has much power of working usefully and gaining information, <b>but</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is not {{required}} of her is to come forward in public." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{swallowed}} up in politics for the first, I {{hope for the}} last, time in my sublunary career. It is a painful, thankless trade; <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> came up I could not pass in silence. Much drafting, addressing, deputationising has eaten up all my time, and again (to my contrition) I leave you Wreckerless.

6000|$|We were {{presently}} abroad, {{walking through}} the warm summer's night and talking all the more freely for that. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I said I can remember. [...] "I wish at times," [...] said I, with a gesture at the heavens, [...] "that comet of yours or some such thing would indeed strike this world--and wipe us all away, strikes, wars, tumults, loves, jealousies, and all the wretchedness of life!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is usually}} <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> will {{overcome}} an enchantment," [...] remarked the bluejay, seriously; [...] "and {{if it is}} a tingle-berry that will destroy the charm which the old tuxix put upon you, then nothing else will answer the same purpose. The Royal Necromancer is very wise, and you may depend upon what he says. But it is late, at this season, for tingle-berries. They do not grow at all times of the year, and {{we may not be able}} to find any upon the bushes." ...|$|E
60|$|Non. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> still <b>that</b> {{troubles}} me; that's {{her great}} belly, {{and my own}} too.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for Paste magazine, Robert Ham views Material World as [...] "the {{album that}} {{benefits}} most from these remastering efforts" [...] and [...] "the one ripe for rediscovery". Ham suggests that for die-had Beatles fans, The Apple Years [...] "is essential listening to aid you {{in getting a}} little closer to appreciating Harrison's growth as an artist and as a human being". In his review for The Second Disc, Joe Marchese compliments the packaging and deems the box set [...] "beautiful inside and out", adding: [...] "The Apple Years presents George Harrison in his many contradictions, <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that's</b> crystal-clear is that the music he left behind is music to cherish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You take a {{pleasure}} to torment me," [...] said I, [...] "and I make a very feckless plaything; {{but let me ask}} you to be more merciful. At this time there is <b>but</b> the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I care to hear of, and that will be news of Catriona." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, {{there is}} <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can draw the sting, {{and that the}} future may bring to me. But, clerk, if you would see your brother you must on, for there is a meeting to-day, and his merry men will await him ere the shadows turn from west to east. I pray you not to hold him back, for {{it would be an}} evil thing if all the stout lads were there and the leader a-missing. I would come with you, but sooth to say I am {{stationed}} here and may not move. The path over yonder, betwixt the oak and the thorn, should bring you out into his nether field." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes;--to escape {{honestly}} {{from that}} trouble! But how? It {{is just that}} trouble from {{which there is no}} honest escape,--unless a man may honestly break his word. He had engaged himself to her so much that, simply to ignore her would be cowardly as well as false. There was <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he could do, but one step that he could take, by which his security and his self-respect might both be maintained. He would tell her the exact truth, and put it to her whether, looking at their joint circumstances, it would not be better that they should--part. Reflecting on this during his three days' journey down to Sydney, it was thus that he resolved,--forgetting altogether in his meditations the renewed force of the woman's charms upon himself.|$|E
60|$|Through it {{all we can}} {{see there}} is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he fears--that he shall be driven by the exigencies of the {{occasion}} to take some steps which shall afterward be judged {{not to have been}} strictly legal, and which shall put him into the power of his enemies when the day of his ascendency shall have passed away. It crops out repeatedly in these speeches.[202] He seems to be aware that some over-strong measure will be forced upon him for which he alone will be held responsible. If he can only avoid that, he will fear nothing else; if he cannot avoid it, he will encounter even that danger. His foresight was wonderfully accurate. The strong hand was used, and the punishment came upon him, not from his enemies but from his friends, almost to the bursting of his heart.|$|E
5000|$|Hartmann {{rejects the}} theory that dreams are wish-fulfillments, writing, [...] "As for dreams, all the little miseries of our waking life also pass over with them into the state of sleep, <b>but</b> not <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> can at least partly {{reconcile}} the cultivated person to life: the enjoyment of science and art..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so, Alf, my boy, stick at nothing; {{never give}} in; victory or death, that's {{my way of}} expressing the same sentiment. <b>But</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I must impress once more upon you all--namely, that each man must reduce his kit to the very lowest point of size and weight. No extras allowed." ...|$|R
5000|$|Taylor Glasby of Dazed {{ranked the}} song ninth on the publication's [...] "Top ten K-Pop of 2013". He {{described}} {{the group as}} [...] "simultaneously creepy and adorable" [...] and the song as [...] "cheekily adventurous" [...] with an [...] "earworm chorus" [...] and [...] "iconic" [...] dance. He also said the song is [...] "smarter than it first appears", with layered 1980s brass and 1970s disco beats. Scott Interrante, writing for PopMatters, discussed [...] "Bar Bar Bar" [...] in his overview of K-pop in 2013: [...] "The song and video are bratty, obnoxious, and totally awesome. Its hallyu style is so extreme it can convincingly be taken as satire. <b>But</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that’s</b> certain is that it's going to get stuck in your head and annoy you probably forever." ...|$|R
60|$|Juanna {{considered}} the position rapidly. It was hopeless and cruel. Nam and Soa were {{on either side}} of her, the latter standing near the door with the sliding panel beyond which Leonard lay bound, and she knew well that did she speak a single word of the truth to Olfan, it would be the signal for her lover's death. It was possible that the king might be able to protect her own person from violence, but if Leonard died it mattered little what became of her. There was <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> she could do--declare herself willing to become the wife of Olfan. Yet it seemed shameless thus to treat this honourable man, the only friend that they had found among the People of the Mist. But of a truth, such necessities as hers cannot wait while those in their toils weigh scruples or the law of honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us put {{sentiment}} and patriotic illusions aside, {{and look at}} the facts in the face. What do they say? They speak as plainly as the figures in a merchant's account-book. One has only to add the two columns up to see that the French house is bankrupt, that one-half of its property is already in the English sheriff's hands and the other half in nobody'sexcept those of irresponsible raiders and robbers confessing allegiance to nobody. Our King is shut up with his favorites and fools in inglorious idleness and poverty in a narrow little patch of the kingdoma sort of back lot, as one may sayand has no authority there or anywhere else, hasn't a farthing to his name, nor a regiment of soldiers; he is not fighting, he is not intending to fight, he means to make no further resistance; in truth, there is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> he is intending to dogive the whole thing up, pitch his crown into the sewer, and run away to Scotland. There are the facts. Are they correct?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Part of her triumph was {{of course}} due to Mrs. Saintsbury; whose chaperonage; Mrs. Pasmer could see, was {{everywhere}} of effect. But it was also {{largely due to the}} vigilant politeness of young Mavering, who seemed bent on making her have good time, and who let no chance slip him. Mrs. Pasmer felt his kindness truly; and she did not feel it the less because she knew that there was <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could, at his frankly selfish age, make a young fellow wish to make a girl have a good time; except for that reason he must be bending the whole soul of egotistic youth to making some other girl have a good time. But all the same, it gave her pause when some one to whom she was introduced spoke to her of her friends the Maverings, as if they were friends of the oldest standing instead of acquaintances of very recent accident. She did not think of disclaiming the intimacy, but [...] "Really I shall die of these Maverings," [...] she said to herself, [...] "unless I find out something about them pretty soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose,' said Albinia, 'that {{the real}} cure can be <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> for <b>that,</b> as {{for any other}} trouble. I mean, [...] "Thy will be done." [...] I don't suppose {{anything}} else would give energy to turn to other duties. But {{it would be more}} to the purpose to resolve to be more considerate to poor Maria.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No offence, simply business. I'm {{not saying}} anything, mind you, <b>but</b> there's <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> seems {{kind of funny}} to me. This gentleman here says his name's Mr. Bickersteth, as I {{understand}} it. Well, if you're the Duke of Chiswick, why isn't he Lord Percy Something? I've read English novels, and I know all about it." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{duty of the}} {{engineer}} is twofold--to design the work, {{and to see the}} work done. We have seen already something of the vociferous thoroughness of the man, upon the cleaning of lamps and the polishing of reflectors. In building, in road-making, in the construction of bridges, in every detail and byway of his employments, he pursued the same ideal. Perfection (with a capital P and violently underscored) was his design. A crack for a penknife, the waste of [...] "six-and-thirty shillings," [...] "the loss of a day or a tide," [...] in each of these he saw and was revolted by the finger of the sloven; and to spirits intense as his, and immersed in vital undertakings, the slovenly is the dishonest, and wasted time is instantly translated into lives endangered. On this consistent idealism there is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> now and then trenches with a touch of incongruity, and that is his love of the picturesque. As when he laid out a road on Hogarth's line of beauty; bade a foreman be careful, in quarrying, not [...] "to disfigure the island"; or regretted in a report that [...] "the great stone, called the Devil in the Hole, was blasted or broken down to make road-metal, and for other purposes of the work." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'There is <b>but</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> we have omitted,' {{said our}} visitor, solemnly rising {{up from his}} chair and {{clasping}} his long nervous hands together. 'Let us delay no longer to send up a word of praise to the Almighty for His manifold blessings, and for the mercy wherewith He plucked me and my letters out of the deep, even as Jonah was saved from the violence of the wicked ones who hurled him overboard, and it may be fired falconets at him, though we are not so informed in Holy Writ. Let us pray, my friends!' Then in a high-toned chanting voice he offered up a long prayer of thanksgiving, winding up with a petition for grace and enlightenment for the house and all its inmates. Having concluded by a sonorous amen, he at last suffered himself to be led upstairs; while my mother, who had slipped in and listened with much edification to his words, hurried away to prepare him a bumper of green usquebaugh with ten drops of Daffy's Elixir therein, which was her sovereign recipe against the effects of a soaking. There was no event in life, from a christening to a marriage, but had some appropriate food or drink in my mother's vocabulary, and no ailment for which she had not some pleasant cure in her well-stocked cupboards.|$|E
