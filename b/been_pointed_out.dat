5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that, architecturally, {{both the}} O-13 Pyramid and the Late Classic Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque, are nearly identical; both {{have the same}} number of {{substructure}} terraces, and both pyramids' substructures have exactly five doors. Furthermore, both pyramids were built into the sides of existing hills. Damien Marken and Kirk Straight, use this—as well as inscriptions on stelae at Palenque—to argue that {{there was some sort of}} relationship between the two polities.|$|E
5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this.

At the same time, it has <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that Edmund showed a great deal of loyalty to Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E

50|$|After a spymaster {{gives the}} hint with its word and number, their field {{operatives}} make guesses about which code name cards bear words {{related to the}} hint and <b>point</b> them <b>out,</b> one at a time. When a code name card <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card -- a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card -- as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If the assassin <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If {{an agent of the}} other team <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the turn simply ends; but note that this also eliminates one more potential wrong guess that the other team might have made, right before their turn. If an agent of the playing team <b>is</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the team may <b>point</b> <b>out</b> another card if they have guesses left. Again, the maximum number of guesses in any turn is the hint's number plus one.|$|R
5|$|While {{the series}} retells the real {{events of the}} gangland war, several {{inaccuracies}} have <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> and some deliberate fictionalizations have been made. The Purana Taskforce, as presented in this series, is not a portrayal of the real taskforce, as laws in Victoria do not allow real police officers, including those who previously served and were not sacked, to be portrayed by actors in the media. As a result, the characters presented are entirely fictional characters vaguely based on the real officers, leading to some major differences such as the series suggesting that a senior officer died due to a heart attack, which never in fact occurred.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{questioned}} whether a royal affinity could actually {{work in the same}} way as a noble one. It has been suggested that since the king had to be a lord to his retainers and provide good lordship, but also king to the entire people, a contradiction existed, resulting in a decline in local stability where this occurred. At the same time, even powerful magnates such as Gaunt could cause local dissatisfaction by retaining some and, inevitably, excluding others. On the other hand, it has also <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> how, particularly for kings, recruitment into the affinity was a clear promotion which could act as an encouraging loyalty or offered a political amnesty.|$|E

5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 supersonic aircraft with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the success}} of Dynasty Warriors 3, Omega Force began {{development}} on the sequel, Dynasty Warriors 4, and its expansions. The fourth game in the series was the first to introduce an Empires expansion, but it wasn’t designed by the same person who designed Dynasty Warriors 4, Tomohiko Sho. Although he was not the designer for all of the Dynasty Warriors games he was involved in the production for them, usually as the planner. Omega Force works under Koei as an internal development team and have mainly concentrated on the Dynasty Warriors series and the Samurai Warriors series. Similarities have <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> between the two series, such as the Xtreme Legends and Empires expansions, as well as a similar voice cast that has been used throughout a number of the games from each series. Repeated voices between games include Beau Billingslea, Steven Jay Blum and Richard Epcar.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the palaeontologists Spencer G. Lucas and Jay C. Sobus {{published}} {{a revision of}} indricothere taxa, which is followed by most western scientists today. They concluded that Paraceratherium, as the oldest name, was the only valid indricothere genus from the Oligocene, and contained four valid species, P. bugtiense, P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis. They considered most other names to be junior synonyms of those taxa, or as dubious names, based on remains too fragmentary to identify properly. By analysing alleged differences between named genera and species, Lucas and Sobus found that these most likely represented variation within populations, and that most features were indistinguishable between specimens, as had <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> in the 1930s. The fact that the single skull assigned to P. transouralicum or Indricotherium was domed, while others were flat at the top was attributed to sexual dimorphism. Therefore, {{it is possible that}} P. bugtiense fossils represent the female, while P. transouralicum represents the male of the same species.|$|E

5|$|Many scholars, however, have {{disagreed}} with specific claims Weber makes in his historical analysis. For example, the economist Joseph Schumpeter argued that capitalism {{did not begin}} with the Industrial Revolution but in 14th century Italy. In Milan, Venice and Florence, the small city-state governments {{led to the development}} of the earliest forms of capitalism. In the 16th century, Antwerp was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland. Emil Kauder expanded Schumpeter's argument by arguing the hypothesis that Calvinism hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the labour theory of value.|$|E
5|$|Parallels have <b>been</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> between Njörðr and {{the figure}} of Hadingus, attested in book I of Saxo Grammaticus' 13th century work Gesta Danorum. Some of these {{similarities}} include that, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Skáldskaparmál, Hadingus is chosen by his wife Regnhild after selecting him from other men at a banquet by his lower legs, and, in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Gylfaginning, Hadingus complains in verse of his displeasure at his life away from the sea and how he is disturbed by the howls of wolves, while his wife Regnhild complains of life at the shore and states her annoyance at the screeching sea birds. Georges Dumézil theorized that in the tale Hadingus passes through all three functions of his trifunctional hypothesis, before ending as an Odinic hero, paralleling Njörðr's passing from the Vanir to the Æsir in the Æsir-Vanir War.|$|E
