5|$|In December 1984, Silcott {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith had been slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung had been lacerated and his aorta cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year. At first he told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party, {{although}} at trial he acknowledged having been there. He said Smith had started punching him, and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife. Silcott was convicted of Smith's murder in February 1986, while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years. After the conviction he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there had <b>been</b> <b>bad</b> blood between them, and that he had stabbed the man in self-defence, because one of Smith's friends had had a knife.|$|E

500|$|After From Russia with Love, Eon had {{considered}} undertaking {{an adaptation of}} either On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Casino Royale. They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman, who held {{the rights to the}} latter, but a deal proved too difficult to achieve. Instead, Eon turned to the Thunderball novel. Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared. As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball. McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although [...] "in reality all three men would essentially act as producers".

500|$|Many of the {{allegations}} made in the Pendle witch trials resulted {{from members of the}} Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it is implicit in much of the literature on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, {{it may have been a}} trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have <b>been</b> <b>bad</b> blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion.

500|$|Before Michigan {{became a}} state, the first land {{transportation}} corridors were the Indian trails. The original Mackinaw Trail ran roughly {{parallel to the}} route of the modern US131 from east of Kalkaska to Petoskey. In the 19th century, the Michigan Legislature chartered private companies to build and operate plank roads or turnpikes in the state. These roads were originally made of oak planks, but later legislation permitted gravel as well. Two thoroughfares in the Grand Rapids area, Division and Plainfield avenues, were originally plank roads. The companies were funded through the collection of tolls. The infrastructure was expensive to maintain, and often the turnpikes fell into disrepair as the wood warped and rotted away. Mark Twain once commented that [...] "the road could not have <b>been</b> <b>bad</b> if some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it," [...] after a trip on the Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids Plank Road. By {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, only 23 of the 202chartered turnpikes were still in operation; many companies that received a charter never built their specified roadways. The remaining plank roads were turned over to the state or purchased by railway companies in the early part of the century.|$|E
500|$|In the off-season, the Canucks {{made another}} {{significant}} move, signing Rangers' captain Mark Messier during free agency on July 26, 1997. Despite finally having a high-profile centre to play with, media reports soon appeared claiming that Bure was {{asking to be}} traded. The Canucks opened the season with two games against the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo – an event organized by the league to market hockey for the upcoming 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. After two injury-plagued seasons with the number 96 on his jersey, Bure switched back to his familiar number 10, explaining: [...] "I'm not superstitious, but {{the last two seasons}} have <b>been</b> <b>bad</b> memories." [...] Although the Canucks missed the playoffs for the second straight year, he returned to his previous form in 1997–98, scoring 51 goals for his first 50-goal season since 1993–94, and third overall. Bure later recalled that with the Canucks out of playoff contention with a handful of games left, head coach Mike Keenan told him he could play as much as he wanted to reach the milestone. Scoring 50 goals was also implicit in a contract bonus for Bure. With an additional 39 assists, his 90 points ranked him third in the NHL, behind Peter Forsberg and Jaromír Jágr.|$|E

500|$|Alizon Device, {{her mother}} Elizabeth, {{and her brother}} James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, {{and that she had}} told him to lame John Law after he had called her a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, {{something}} that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have <b>been</b> <b>bad</b> blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into Malkin Tower, the home of the Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £100 as of 2008. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by witchcraft, and of killing her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been so frightened of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her [...] of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.|$|E

[...] The reviewer would, however, have [...] "loved any sort of explanation as to why [...] changed his mind about changing the past or how he thought this could work.

We brushed up against many key events and people – Theresa, Daniel’s ‘nurse’, and the Widmore and Eloise parental connection, etc. – but these forays into the geniuses’ past events were more to thread Daniel through the plot than to establish their connection to who Daniel truly was." ...|$|E
