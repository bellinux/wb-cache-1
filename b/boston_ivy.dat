2500|$|Parthenocissus quinquefolia {{can be used}} as a shading vine for {{buildings}} on masonry walls. [...] Because the vine, like its relative P. tricuspidata (<b>Boston</b> <b>ivy),</b> adheres to the surface by disks rather than penetrating roots, it does not harm the masonry but will keep a building cooler by shading the wall surface during the summer.

The adhesive pads will then eventually deteriorate and release their grip.|$|E
60|$|The {{house was}} a private residence. By its boarded front door and {{untrimmed}} <b>Boston</b> <b>ivy</b> the burglar knew that the mistress of it was sitting on some oceanside piazza telling a sympathetic man in a yachting cap {{that no one had}} ever understood her sensitive, lonely heart. He knew by the light in the third-story front windows, and by the lateness of the season, that the master of the house had come home, and would soon extinguish his light and retire. For it was September of the year and of the soul, in which season the house's good man comes to consider roof gardens and stenographers as vanities, and to desire the return of his mate and the more durable blessings of decorum and the moral excellencies.|$|E

Since 2006, anyone who claims {{to be at least}} 13 years old has been allowed to become a registered user of Facebook, though variations exist in the minimum age requirement, depending on applicable local laws. The Facebook name comes from the face book directories often given to United States university students.|$|R

It's all very weird, dear, and I'm not sure but it is you who sit day after day at my lonely {{casement}} and watch the sparrows examining the fuzzy buds of the Jap ivy to see just how soon they can hope to build in the vines. Do you object to the ivy buds looking so very much like snipped woollen rags? If you do, I'm sure it's you, here in my place, for when I come up to town in your personality it sets my teeth on edge. In fact, that's the worst thing about <b>Boston</b> now--the fuzzy <b>ivy</b> buds; there's so much ivy! When you can forget the buds, there are a great many things to make you happy. I feel quite as if we were spending the summer in town and I feel very adventurous and very virtuous, like some sort of self-righteous bohemian. You don't know how I look down on people who have gone out of town. I consider them very selfish and heartless; I don't know why, exactly. But when we have a good marrow-freezing northeasterly storm, and the newspapers come out with their ironical congratulations to the tax-dodgers at the Shore, I feel that Providence is on my side, and I'm getting my reward, even in this world." [...] Bessie suddenly laughed. [...] "I see by your expression of fixed inattention, Molly, that you're thinking of Mr. Durgin!" ...|$|R
500|$|The Publicity Bureau was {{the first}} PR agency and was founded by former <b>Boston</b> journalists, {{including}} <b>Ivy</b> Lee. Ivy Lee is sometimes called the father of PR and was influential in establishing it as a professional practice. In 1906, Lee published a Declaration of Principles, which said that PR work {{should be done in}} the open, should be accurate and cover topics of public interest. According to historian Eric Goldman, the declaration of principles marked the beginning of an emphasis on informing, rather than misleading, the public. Ivy Lee is also credited with developing the modern press release and the [...] "two-way-street" [...] philosophy of both listening to and communicating with the public. In 1906, Lee helped facilitate the Pennsylvania Railroad's first positive media coverage after inviting press to the scene of a railroad accident, despite objections from executives. At the time, secrecy about corporate operations was common practice. Lee's work was often identified as spin or propaganda. In 1913 and 1914, the mining union was blaming the Ludlow Massacre, where on-strike miners and their families were killed by state militia, on the Rockefeller family and their coal mining operation, The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. On the Rockefeller family's behalf, Lee published bulletins called [...] "Facts Concerning the Struggle in Colorado for Industrial Freedom," [...] which contained false and misleading information. Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and especially to listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized versions of the Rockefellers. [...] In response the labor press said Lee [...] "twisted the facts" [...] and called him a [...] "paid liar," [...] a [...] "hired slanderer," [...] and a [...] "poisoner of public opinion." [...] By 1917, Bethlehem Steel company announced it would start a publicity campaign against perceived errors about them. The Y.M.C.A. opened a new press secretary. AT and others also started their first publicity programs.|$|R

5000|$|In 1937, {{the stadium}} was renovated and P. K. Wrigley {{discussed}} beautification with then Chicago Cubs President Bill Veeck. Veeck suggested planting ivy on the outfield walls. The ivy was originally English ivy but was later changed to Parthenocissus tricuspidata -- what's commonly called, <b>Boston</b> <b>Ivy</b> and Japanese Bittersweet, which can endure the harsh Chicago winters better than its English cousin. [...] Cuttings from the ivy were sold by local vendors. The Chicago Cubs attempted {{to grow the}} ivy {{on the outside of}} Wrigley Field as well, but the plantings were often stolen so the Cubs abandoned the plans.|$|E
5000|$|On March 30, 2006, the Cubs {{announced}} the bleachers would be renamed the Bud Light bleachers. A sign {{to that effect}} was soon posted over the bleacher entryway which contrasts significantly with its previous look. The Cubs management also {{announced the}}y would plant ivy on the rebuilt exterior walls, in a soil trough that was provided {{as part of the}} construction. Conventional <b>Boston</b> <b>ivy</b> was planted on the east-facing Sheffield wall, which gets a fair amount of sunlight during morning hours. The north-facing wall along Waveland, which receives little direct sunlight in the summer and none in the winter, was to have an [...] "evergreen" [...] variety, English ivy, which thrives in shade.|$|E
50|$|Whitefish, such as brown croakers, {{flathead}} grey mullets, red seabreams, or olive flounders, is filleted into thin, 7-8 cm long slices, {{seasoned with}} salt and ground black pepper, and pounded lightly {{with the back of}} the knife. Common fillings include ground beef, shiitake mushrooms, cucumber, crumbled tofu, chopped scallions, minced garlic and toasted and ground sesame seeds. The inner surface of each fish slice is dusted with mung bean starch, the filling is placed on it and it is then folded in half and sealed. The edges of the dumplings are trimmed with kitchen scissors to create the half-moon shapes. The dumplings are then coated with mung bean starch, and cooked either in boiling water or in the steamer lined with <b>Boston</b> <b>ivy</b> leaves. Cooked dumplings are commonly served with a dipping sauce such as mustard or choganjang (soy sauce mixed with vinegar).|$|E
5000|$|Wrigley Field {{is known}} for the <b>Boston</b> <b>ivy</b> (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) planted against the outfield wall in 1937 by Bill Veeck, whose father had been team {{president}} until his 1933 death. If the ball is hit into and lost in the ivy, then it is ruled a ground-rule double, provided that the defensive outfielder raises his hands to signify that the ball has {{been lost in the}} ivy; if the player attempts to search for the ball, the play is considered live, and no ground-rule double is ruled. Wrigley is also known for the manual scoreboard Veeck also erected. No batted ball has ever hit the scoreboard; indeed, very few home runs have even landed in the [...] "upper deck" [...] of the center field bleachers. However, Sam Snead did manage to hit the big board with a golf ball teed off from home plate, on April 17, 1951, just prior to the Cubs home opener.|$|E
5000|$|Be {{that as it}} may, {{construction}} went {{on behind}} a temporary fence during the summer, and the finished product was unveiled on September 4, {{in time for the}} last month of the season. Bill Veeck's famous ivy was planted not long after, but it would be another year before it fully took hold. According to his own autobiography, Veeck as in Wreck, he planted Bittersweet, which would grow quickly, and also the more famous <b>Boston</b> <b>ivy,</b> which would eventually take over. Another part of the arboretum was to be a series of Chinese elms on the large [...] "stairsteps" [...] up to the scoreboard, as well as one apiece in the little triangle at the top of each [...] "well". According to Veeck's biography, that plan did not fare so well as the winds kept blowing the leaves off. Management finally gave up [...] "after about twenty tries", so the trees are long gone, leaving just the large bare steps and (until 2006) the little flat triangular supports at the tops of the [...] "wells". According to Veeck, the trees themselves were inexpensive, but the special construction for them in the bleachers cost about $200,000.|$|E
