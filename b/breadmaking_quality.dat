The performance of a dryer can be simulated with computer programs based on mathematical models that represent the phenomena involved in drying: physics, physical chemistry, thermodynamics and heat and mass transfer.

There were small differences in PLFA profiles for cultivars in the conventional system, but none in the organic system. More significant correlations between grain quality and PLFA measures were present in the organic system. Protein levels and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> at least equal to conventional systems can be achieved in organic systems. Wheat cultivars differed for grain quality in both organic and conventional systems, and culivars altered the soil microbial profile in conventional systems.

40|$|Wheat is {{extensively}} {{used for}} food, feed, seed and wet-milling. Wheat starch and {{vital wheat gluten}} isolated by wet-milling of wheat flour are utilized in numerous food and nonfood applications. Five commercial wet-milling processes, namely Martin, Batter, Alfa-Laval/Raisio, Hydrocyclone and High-Pressure Disintegration (HD), have been employed to co-produce wheat starch and vital gluten. Martin and Batter are the traditional processes, whereas Alfa-Laval/Raisio, Hydrocyclone and HD are the modern-day processes. In the traditional processes, separation of starch and gluten starts with a stiff dough or batter with optimally developed gluten and proceeds with kneading and/or screening to separate starch granules from gluten mass. In the modern-day processes, however, separation starts with a sheared flour-water or dough-water dispersion with partially developed gluten and proceeds with centrifugation to separate starch granules from gluten network. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the pasting properties of starches and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>qualities</b> of vital glutens isolated from RBS- 98 wheat flour by three different laboratory wet-milling methods, namely highly sheared flour-water dispersion (HS-FWD), moderately sheared dough-water dispersion (MS-DWD) and dough-washing (Martin), which respectively represent the commercial wet-milling processes of HD, Hydrocyclone and Martin. Three wet-milling methods were found to be somewhat comparable in many respects, yet they differed in certain wet-milling parameters. Damaged starch levels and RVA pasting properties of A-starch fractions isolated by all three wet-milling methods were quite similar, indicating that starch was neither mechanically damaged nor physico-chemically altered during shear treatment of HS-FWD or MS-DWD methods. Similarly, <b>breadmaking</b> <b>qualities</b> of vital glutens isolated by all wet-milling methods did not fluctuate extensively, suggesting that gluten proteins were not damaged nor altered during shear treatment of HS-FWD or MS-DWD methods. In other words, wet-milling methods used for the isolation of starch and vital gluten are of almost no or limited influence on the properties of starch and vital gluten...|$|R
40|$|There {{is still}} {{considerable}} {{debate in the}} literature about the respective roles of starch and gluten in both the linear and non-linear rheology of wheat flour dough. Hence, to elucidate the individual contributions of gluten and starch to the overall dough behaviour, the rheological properties of dough and mixtures of different gluten-starch ratios were studied systematically in shear and extension, {{by means of an}} adequate rheological toolbox consisting of linear small amplitude oscillatory shear tests and non-linear tests such as creep-recovery in shear and uniaxial extension. The starch component plays a pivotal role in linear dough rheology. With increasing starch content, the linearity limit observed in oscillatory shear tests decreases as a power-law function. Starch also clearly affects the extensional viscosity at small strains. Consequently, in the linear region differences between different gluten systems may become obscured by the presence of starch. As <b>breadmaking</b> <b>qualities</b> are known to be intrinsically linked to the gluten network, it is imperative to probe the non-linear behaviour of dough in order to expose differences in flour quality. The quality differences between a strong and a weak flour type were revealed most clearly {{in the value of the}} strain-hardening index in uniaxial extension and the total recovery compliance in non-linear creep-recovery tests. Notwithstanding its earlier successful application to pure gluten gels, the accuracy of the critical gel model in predicting the linear rheological properties of dough was found to be limited, due to dough having a small linearity limit and a finite longest relaxation time...|$|R

The Sudanese cultivars (Elneelain, Debaira, and Wadi Elneel) were compared with an Australian bread wheat cultivar. Baking test, farinograph characteristics, sedimentation value, gluten and gluten index were determined in wheat flours of 68 % extraction rate. Wadi Elneel cultivar showed a better <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> than Elneelain and Debaira. Samples of whole wheat flours from the three Sudanese wheat cultivars and the Australian wheat were fractionated by a modified Osborne fractionation procedure into five solubility fractions: (i) the water-soluble albumins, (ii) the salt-soluble globulins, (iii) the aqueous alcohol-soluble gliadins, (iv) the acetic acid-soluble glutenins, and (v) the residue-glutenin fraction. The residue glutenin, calculated on flour basis, showed significant positive correlations (P≤ 0. 05) with total protein, wet gluten, dry gluten, sedimentation value, gluten index and specific loaf volume. The residue glutenin, on total protein basis, showed significant positive correlations (P≤ 0. 05) with total protein, gluten index and specific loaf volume. On the other hand, the soluble glutenin, calculated on flour basis, showed significant positive correlations (P≤ 0. 05) with only water absorption and farinograph development time. The residue glutenin was found to be a fundamental factor determining <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat. The gluten indices of the Sudanese wheat cultivars were high, indicating good <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality,</b> but according to other results of this study, the Sudanese wheat cultivars are of poor quality.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the relationship between SDS-sedimentation value and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), glutenin subunits of different genotypes (foreign and Iranian cultivars) were analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). SDS-sedimentation value {{was used as an}} indirect criterion for <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b>  Correlation coefficients revealed a closer relationship between low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin subunits and variation in SDS-sedimentation value. Principal component analysis confirmed the presence of association between some of the glutenin subunits and SDS-sedimentation value. Based on the stepwise regression analysis, two LMW and four high molecular weight (HMW) peaks (subunits) were selected which accounted for 70. 2 and 18. 7 % of variability in SDS sedimentation values, respectively. On the basis {{of the results of the}} stepwise regression analysis, a discriminant function was developed. The great efficiency of discriminant function in correct classification of completely different genotypes (Iranian landraces and cultivars) showed that the observed relationship between glutenin subunits and SDS-sedimentation value has a genetic basis and the effects of LMW and HMW glutenin subunits on SDS-sedimentation value are additive. Therefore, it seems that this method based on more protein components (rather than only on HMW glutenin subunits) can be used to predict <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> of wheat against many genetic backgrounds...|$|E

Glutenins consist {{of high and low}} molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS, LMW-GS) encoded by Glu- 1 and Glu- 3 loci, respectively. The allelic variations at both loci have important effects on GMP content and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b> In this study, GMP extraction and size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (SE-HPLC) separation were optimized, and then applied to investigate the effects of Glu- 1 and Glu- 3 allelic variations on GMP content using different wheat genotypes, chromosome substitution lines and near-isogenic lines (NILs). The results showed that the optimized GMP extraction and SE-HPLC protocol could obtain a reproducible separation and reliable quantitation of GMP content with small samples. The allelic variations at Glu- 1 and Glu- 3 were closely related to GMP content. Particularly, Glu-D 1 d encoded 1 Dx 5 + 1 Dy 10 subunits, Glu-A 3 a and Glu-B 3 h encoded an abundant LMW-B subunit respectively had positive effects on GMP content and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality.</b> The introgress of HMW-GS and LMW-GS into bread wheat from related genomes could significantly increase GMP content, indicating that wheat related species has potential gene resources for <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> improvement.

40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of dough and gluten {{are important for}} end-use quality of flour {{but there is a}} lack of knowledge of the relationships between fundamental and empirical tests and how they relate to flour composition and gluten quality. Dough and gluten from six <b>breadmaking</b> wheat <b>qualities</b> were subjected to a range of rheological tests. Fundamental (small-deformation) rheological characterizations (dynamic oscillatory shear and creep recovery) were performed on gluten to avoid the nonlinear influence of the starch component, whereas large deformation tests were conducted on both dough and gluten. A number of variables from the various curves were considered and subjected to a principal component analysis (PCA) to get an overview of relationships between the various variables. The first component represented variability in protein quality, associated with elasticity and tenacity in large deformation (large positive loadings for resistance to extension and initial slope of dough and gluten extension curves recorded by the SMS/Kieffer dough and gluten extensibility rig, and the tenacity and strain hardening index of dough measured by the Dobraszczyk/Roberts dough inflation system), the elastic character of the hydrated gluten proteins (large positive loading for elastic modulus [G'], large negative loadings for tan delta and steady state compliance [J(e) (0) ]), the presence of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) 5 + 10 vs. 2 + 12, and a size distribution of glutenin polymers shifted toward the high-end range. The second principal component was associated with flour protein content. Certain rheological data were influenced by protein content in addition to protein quality (area under dough extension curves and dough inflation curves [W]). The approach made it possible to bridge the gap between fundamental {{rheological properties}}, empirical measurements of physical properties, protein composition, and size distribution.

40|$|Grain Protein Content (GPC) {{of wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L. and T. turgidum L.) is {{important}} for improved nutritional value and {{is also one of}} the major factors affecting <b>breadmaking</b> and pasta <b>quality.</b> A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for high GPC was detected a few years ago in the short arm of chromosome 6 B from accession FA 15 - 3 of Triticum turgidum L. var. dicoccoides. New molecular markers are presented here to facilitate the transfer of this high GPC gene into tetraploid and hexaploid wheat cultivars. Two sets of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) primers were designed to amplify regions of the non-transcribed spacer of the XNor-B 2 locus. This locus was selected because it mapped on the peak of the QTL for GPC. The first pair of allele-specific primers produced an amplification product only when the T. turgidum var. dicoccoides XNor-B 2 allele was present. The second pair of primers amplified fragment(s) of similar length in the different genotypes that after digestion with the restriction enzyme BamHI allowed differentiation of the T. turgidum var. dicoccoides allele. Four microsatellites markers were mapped on the short arm of chromosome 6 B at both sides of the QTL peak and two on the long arm. Five additional amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were mapped into the QTL region on 6 BS. These PCR markers together with 10 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers showed that the hexaploid cultivar Glupro, selected for high GPC, carries a distal segment of chromosome 6 BL and a proximal segment of 6 BS from dicoccoides accession FA 15 - 3 encompassing the segment with highest LOD score for the GPC QTL...|$|R

Additionally, three of the field experiments investigated grain filling, drying, and nitrogen accumulation, and two of these experiments tested fungicide effects over different cultivars. When averaged over all cultivars, the fungicide significantly (p < 0. 05) increased grain yield and thousand-grain weight (TGW) in five, and specific weight in three field experiments. Grain crude protein concentration (CP) and Hagberg falling number (HFN) were significantly reduced once following Septoria tritici control, and HFN alone was reduced a second time following powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) control.

The use of cassava flour in bread making is a convenient alternative for promoting {{the use of a}} local crop as well as reducing imports of wheat flour, promoting the production of high quality cassava flour, offering a gluten-free product and developing biofortified and fortified foods. Although the substitution level of cassava flour is limited, in some products, the incorporation of additives or flours from other crops improve the nutritional value and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> of the baked foods. Several limitations have hindered the success of initiatives to promote, in some cassava producing countries, the intensive use cassava flour in bread making. Among these include the costs and efficiency of processing technologies, standards of the quality of cassava flour and lack of favorable policies. Further studies about bioavailability and retention of nutrients on baked foods and evaluation on the effects of processing cassava flour in relation to increasing the resistance starch are required to provide scientific evident for the health benefits of this flour...|$|E
40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of fresh gluten in small amplitude oscillation in shear (SAOS) and creep recovery after short application of stress {{was related to}} the hearth breadbaking performance of wheat flours using the multivariate statistics partial least squares (PLS) regression. The picture was completed by dough mixing and extensional properties, flour protein size distribution determined by SE-HPLC, and high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) composition. The sample set comprised 20 wheat cultivars grown at two different levels of nitrogen fertilizer in one location. Flours yielding stiffer and more elastic glutens, with higher elastic and viscous moduli (G' and G") and lower tan 8 values in SAOS, gave doughs that were better able to retain their shape during proving and baking, resulting in breads of high form ratios. Creep recovery measurements after short application of stress showed that glutens from flours of good <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> had high relative elastic recovery. The nitrogen fertilizer level affected the protein size distribution by an increase in monomeric proteins (gliadins), which gave glutens of higher tan delta and flatter bread loaves (lower form ratio) ...|$|E
40|$|The chapatti and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> of nine (eight Indian and one Australian) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars was compared. The {{extension}} of a chapatti strip {{measured with a}} Kieffer dough extensibility rig correlated with chapatti scores for overall quality (r = 0. 84), pliability (r = 0. 91), hand feel (r = 0. 72), chapatti eating quality (r = 0. 68), and taste (r = 0. 80). Overall chapatti quality also correlated with the resistance to {{extension of}} a chapatti strip (r = 0. 68) when tested for uniaxial extension with a texture analyzer. The texture analyzer provided objectivity in the scoring of chapatti quality. The high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit protein composition assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis did not correlate with the overall chapatti score. A negative correlation was found between chapatti and bread scores (r = − 0. 77). The different requirements for chapatti and bread quality complicate the breeding of new wheat varieties and the exchange of germplasm between regions producing wheat for chapatti and those supplying bread producers...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} level {{and timing of}} {{nitrogen}} (N) fertilizer application on grain yield (YLD), grain protein (GPC), and breadmaking ability of four hard red spring wheat cultivars and on soil residual nitrate was investigated. Nitrogen fertility caused an increase in YLD, lodging, several yield components, GPC, and <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> and caused a reduction in N harvest index and grain ash, and N use efficiency (NUE) resulting {{in an increase in}} soil residual NO$ sb 3 $-N. Split N application reduced lodging, tillers and spikes m$ sp{- 2 }$ and caused an increase in grain weight, GPC, loaf volume and NUE. Grain yield increases were largely due to increases in the grain spike$ sp{- 1 }$ and tillers n$ sp{- 2 }$. Absolute protein content was found to be critical in determining GPC. Cultivars showed plastic responses to N. Despite its high YLD and flour yield, Hege 155 - 85 may be risky to produce because of its high dependence on N. Mineralization of N occurred during winter. Marked differences existed between the sites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Wheat quality depends {{directly}} on the grain protein content and protein composition. High and low molecular weight glutenin subunits {{play an important role}} in determining the visco-elastic properties of gluten. In an attempt to improve the <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> of hexaploid triticale, a fragment of wheat chromosome 1 D, containing the Glu-D 1 allele encoding the 5 + 10 subunits, was translocated to the long arm of chromosome 1 A by Lukaszewski and Curtis [1]. The 1 A. 1 D translocation chromosome was transferred to tetraploid wheat [2], making the Glu-D 1 locus available for the improvement of durum wheat. The goal of this study was to evaluate using cytogenetics and molecular approaches the amount of chromatin introgressed in durum wheat. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with total genomic DNA (GISH) of Aegilops squarrosa L. indicated that the translocated chromosome 1 A. 1 D had a terminal 1 DL segment of about 35 - 40 % of the recombinant arm length. Several pairs of microsatellite primers from chromosome 1 A and 1 D were used to genetically characterize the recombinant chromosome. The mapping data indicated that a 1 AL segment, a...|$|E
40|$|Hordeum chilense is an {{excellent}} genetic resource for wheat breeding due to its potential to improve <b>breadmaking</b> <b>quality</b> and nutritional value and provide resistance to some biotic and abiotic stresses. Hexaploid wheat lines carrying chromosome 7 Hch introgressions, namely, chromosome additions of the whole chromosome 7 Hch or the 7 Hchα or the 7 Hchβ chromosome arms, and chromosome substitutions of the homeologous chromosomes 7 A, 7 B, or 7 D by chromosome 7 Hch were compared by 2 D-PAGE analysis to study {{the effect of these}} alien introgressions on the wheat endosperm proteome. The addition of the 7 Hchα chromosome arm did not alter the profile of most glutenins and gliadins, but showed higher quantities of puroindolines and lower xylanase inhibitors, which might improve also resistance to plant pathogens. On the other hand, (7 A) 7 Hch or (7 D) 7 Hch substitution lines showed enhanced avenin-like b proteins and triticin levels but reduced puroindolines, which could be desirable to improve dough properties and nutritional value and increase kernel hardness in wheat.
