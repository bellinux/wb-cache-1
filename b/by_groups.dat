5|$|As players {{walk through}} the level, they are stopped <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> of enemies who must be {{defeated}} before they can continue. The level ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each level contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} level.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains fell {{during the}} night of September 5-6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked {{vehicles}} in the withdrawal. The 1st Battalion completed its withdrawal without opposition. During its night march west, the 3rd Battalion column was joined several times <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> of North Korean soldiers who apparently thought {{it was one of}} their own columns moving south. They were made prisoners and taken along in the withdrawal. Nearing Waegwan at dawn, the battalion column was taken under North Korean mortar and T-34 tank fire after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties.|$|E
5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was a loyal {{supporter}} of the New Deal and compiled a liberal voting record. His major legislative achievement was the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring registration of certain organizations controlled by foreign powers. After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced Nixon in 1946 in a bitter campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} major issue. Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Soviet Union and Finland had been tense—a legacy of the two periods of forced Russification {{at the turn of}} the century and the failed Soviet-backed socialist rebellion in Finland, as well as incursions <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> of Finnish nationalists—the Viena expedition in 1918 and the Aunus expedition of 1919—into Russian East Karelia.|$|E
5|$|Up {{to the end}} of the 18th century, slate was {{extracted}} on a {{small scale}} <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> of quarrymen who paid a royalty to the landlord, carted slate to the ports, and then shipped it to England, Ireland and sometimes France. Towards the close of the century, the landowners began to operate the quarries themselves, on a larger scale. After the government abolished slate duty in 1831, rapid expansion was propelled by the building of narrow gauge railways to transport the slates to the ports.|$|E

5|$|A library {{has been}} present {{since the time}} of StWerburgh's Abbey, and {{following}} the dissolution of the monasteries it became the cathedral library. It continued to grow over the centuries, but by the 19thcentury it had become neglected. Between 1867 and 1885 it was enlarged and in the 1890s new bookcases were added. A further reorganisation took place in the 1920s but by the 1980s the contents were contained in five separate sites around the cathedral. A programme of repair and re-cataloguing of the contents was instituted. During the 2000s more work was carried out and the refurbished library, housed in three rooms, opened in 2007. The library is available for research and for organised visits <b>by</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Bab el Wad, {{the road}} wound to Jerusalem through deep, narrow valleys, over steep spurs, {{and around the}} {{shoulders}} of rocky hills. There were other ways through the hills, but they were a tangle of unmapped, rough and rocky hill tracks and pathways—often little more than donkey tracks—which made movement by infantry, dismounted cavalry, and artillery very difficult. The rough tracks meandered through narrow valleys and over distorted piles of razor-backed ridges, which were broken <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> of cone-shaped hills and successive shelves of rock jutting out from every hillside at intervals of a few yards. It was virtually impossible for advances to the north or south of the main road to be supported by artillery. In heavy rain and cold, wet and muddy conditions, it {{was found to be}} impossible to deploy the 75th Division's guns off the road. These guns had been brought forward by teams of up to eight horses to a gun the day before.|$|E
5|$|Assimilation efforts {{began as}} early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in New France. They were {{resisted}} by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate missionaries with the diseases devastating Indigenous populations. The establishment of day and boarding schools <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> including the Récollets, Jesuits and Ursulines was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also {{played a role in the}} decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the fur trade and military pursuits.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this {{population-based}} study, all 314 {{episodes of}} β-haemolytic streptococcal bacteraemia in adult {{patients in the}} Pirkanmaa area, Finland, during the 10 -year period 1995 – 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Altogether, 92 cases of bacteraemia caused <b>by</b> Lancefield <b>group</b> A β-haemolytic streptococci (GAS), 76 caused <b>by</b> <b>group</b> B β-haemolytic streptococci (GBS), 18 caused <b>by</b> <b>group</b> C β-haemolytic streptococci (GCS) and 128 caused <b>by</b> <b>group</b> G β-haemolytic streptococci (GGS) were identified. The most important finding was {{that the incidence of}} GGS increased during the study period. Disruption of the cutaneous barrier was a very common predisposing factor in GAS and GGS bacteraemias. Skin infections were the presenting clinical manifestations in two-thirds of GAS and GGS bacteraemias...|$|R
5|$|Hailing from Pomona, California, {{the members}} of Bonded by Blood met through mutual friends. The idea of {{creating}} a band was conceived by lead vocalist Jose Barrales, a singer with hardcore punk and crossover thrash backgrounds, influenced <b>by</b> <b>groups</b> like The Blackheads, Cryptic Slaughter, D.R.I. and Black Flag. He always had an appreciation for heavy metal music, {{but it was not}} until a friend recommended him to listen to Exodus that Barrales got into the thrash metal subgenre. Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood had a profound impact on Barrales, and it was inspiring to the point he idealized the creation of a thrash metal band, as he had noticed that there were few or even no groups in this genre in the music scene.|$|E
