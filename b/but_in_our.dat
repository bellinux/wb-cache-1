500|$|Fernando Alonso ran a {{new power}} unit in his McLaren over the weekend, {{one that he}} had already used once during {{practice}} for the previous race in Russia, having taken the grid penalty for it there. Teammate Jenson Button hoped for Alonso to [...] "annihilate" [...] him, adding: [...] "It's unusual to say that, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> situation it's about getting it on the car." [...] McLaren also introduced new aerodynamic parts to their cars for the Grand Prix. Both Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen of Ferrari needed to exchange their power units. Having already used the allowed four units for the season, both drivers received ten-place grid penalties. Manor Marussia's Will Stevens was placed back twenty grid spots {{for a change of}} his engine, turbocharger and MGU-H unit. Renault used eleven of their twelve remaining token for changes to their power unit. However, both customer teams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso chose not to run with the update, saying its performance advantage was not worth taking the grid penalties. Both Red Bull and McLaren used new front wings, emulating a concept introduced by Mercedes supposed to create more downforce by directing the airflow towards the outside of the front tyres. Similar changes were made by Ferrari to their SF15-T. In preparation for the effects of the high altitude in Mexico, Mercedes added two [...] "ears" [...] {{at the top of the}} airbox in order to improve cooling to the Energy Recovery System of their power unit.|$|E
500|$|The first {{published}} {{description of the}} species was written by botanist Lucien M. Underwood in 1899, based on a specimen found the previous year in the woods of Mount Desert, Maine. Although he called the new species a Cantharellus, he noted that [...] "the plant is a remarkable one and from its habit might well form a distinct genus since it has {{little in common with}} Cantharellus except its fold-like gills." [...] In 1910, William Murrill transferred it to the new genus Polyozellus; Murrill thought the compound structure of the stem to be a sufficiently unique characteristic to warrant it being separated from Cantharellus species, which have simpler stem structures. In 1920, specimens from a Japanese collection compiled by A.Yasuda were sent to mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd, who believed the fungus to be a new species and named it Phyllocarbon yasudai.No further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937, when it was found in Quebec, Canada. The next year, Paul Shope considered the genus Polyozellus to be superfluous, pointed out that the compound fruit bodies and the wrinkled hymenium were instead consistent with the genus Craterellus. In 1939, American mycologist Lee Oras Overholts, {{in a letter to the}} journal Mycologia, opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by Calvin Henry Kauffman, who made notes and photos of the species collected in the Rocky Mountains of Wyoming and Colorado, and in the Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon. Kauffman believed the species to be merely [...] "a very extreme growth condition" [...] of Cantharellus clavatus (now known as Gomphus clavatus) and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus Craterellus. Mycologists Alexander H.Smith and Elizabeth Morse, in their 1947 publication on Cantharellus species in the United States, placed the species in a new section Polyozellus, but did not separate it from the genus Cantharellus; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of Polyozellus as the small, roughened, hyaline spores and the color change of the flesh in potassium hydroxide solution, adding that [...] "the spores are unusual for the genus <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> estimation do not warrant excluding the species." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 20th century {{historian}} of Paris René Héron de Villefosse {{shared the same}} view of Haussmann's renovation: [...] "in less than twenty years, Paris lost its ancestral appearance, its [...] character which passed from generation to generation... the picturesque and charming ambiance which our fathers had passed onto us was demolished, often without good reason." [...] Héron de Villefosse denounced Haussmann's central market, Les Halles, as [...] "a hideous eruption" [...] of cast iron. [...] Describing Haussmann's renovation of the Île de la Cité, he wrote: [...] "the old ship of Paris was torpedoed by Baron Haussmann and sunk during his reign.

2500|$|Although the Queen's Canadian titles include Defender of the Faith/Défenseur de la Foi, {{neither the}} monarch {{nor any of}} the viceroys have an {{official}} religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (Fidei defensor, in Latin) signifies the sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of {{the security of the}} Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. Defender of the Faith thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the House of Commons: [...] "The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In our countries [...] there are no established churches, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> countries {{there are people who have}} faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{were more}} temperate, but {{generally}} agreed the production was a failure. They were most divided over Pousseur's musical collage technique. Claudio Sartori found the quotations [...] "pointless", while the critic for La Stampa was noncommital, saying only that [...] "Pousseur is a musician of proven dexterity, {{aligned with the}} most up-to-date ranks of the avant-garde" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ). Peter Heyworth, on the other hand, found the [...] "elaborate collage of citation, parody, pastiche and genuine composition" [...] to have been [...] "carried off with considerable panache", and admitted that Votre Faust is [...] "utterly unlike any opera I have ever heard, and I {{would like to believe}} that it represents a major attempt to bring music and drama into a new sort of relationship" [...] but, on the whole, found it [...] "nothing more than a box of tricks; full of sound and signifying precious little. In the worst sense of the word, an experiment" [...] Luciano Berio, a colleague and friend of Pousseur, was wholly enthusiastic about [...] "a score that I love deeply for innumerable reasons", but nevertheless admitted the production was a failure—a failure which he blamed partly on Butor's text, but more emphatically on the stage design and [...] "what is normally defined as directing <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> case is revealed as a gratuitous succession of inconsistent poses perpetrated by a pair of naïve amateurs inexplicably dragged to Milan by M. Butor" [...] Sartori concurred, describing the production as [...] "heavy" [...] and the sets [...] "ugly" [...] In an interview conducted shortly after the Milan performances, one of the singers confirmed that stage direction was practically nonexistent, so that the performers were forced largely to improvise their movements. After protracted wrangling that began with the first rehearsals in the theatre and continued through most of the run, it was finally agreed to do the fourth and last performance in concert form [...] The instrumentalists were described as [...] "bravissimi" [...] (talented) and the singers as [...] "strenui" [...] (stalwart) , and although Jean Topart in the role of Mondor was generally admired, the other actors' performances were scarcely mentioned. One exception was made by Berio, who paid Roger Mollien a backhanded compliment: [...] "The 'protagonist' Henri, ... is, in the words of Butor, a perfect cretin, equaled in this respect only by 'actor-director' Mollien trying to portray the part", who in the end, according to Berio, uttered only two coherent sentences: [...] "C'est que nous n'avons pas encore abordé la question du livret" [...] (We have not yet addressed the issue of the libretto), and [...] "s'il y a eu un coupable dans l'affaire, c'est moi, tu le sais bien, Maggy" [...] (If there has been a guilty man in this case it's me, you know that, Maggy) [...]|$|E
