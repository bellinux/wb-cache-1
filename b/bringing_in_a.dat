5|$|Developed in the United States, the American Water Spaniel is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of}} the American Water Spaniel are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Stewie rams a toy {{spaceship}} into Peter's ear, annoying him, so Peter throws Rupert {{into the}} basement. Stewie follows the bear, discovering an old television script that Brian wrote entitled What I Learned on Jefferson Street. Stewie tosses the script onto the kitchen table, prompting Lois to question {{what it is}} about. Brian suggests she read it and tell him what she thinks. Lois {{falls in love with}} it, and suggests he meet with network executives about producing the show. When Brian pitches it to CBS, the executives respond positively. While the initial casting session goes well, with Elijah Wood auditioning for the lead, the producers assigned by the executives also bring in James Woods, who performs the role in a more comedic fashion, winning over the executives. Brian's serious drama is turned into a sitcom, <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> live studio audience as well as a chimpanzee, and renaming it Class Holes. When Brian objects to the changes, the producers remind him of what he had tried to achieve for many years—his own television show—and threaten him with unemployment if he objects to those changes. Disappointed that Brian allowed the executives to change his show so dramatically, Lois demands that he stand up for himself and object to everything James Woods changed about the show. The producers, however, do not take kindly to Brian's desire to start over, so Brian quits in frustration. Brian reveals his disappointment that he no longer has his own television show, but Lois convinces him that it is his integrity that matters. Peter interrupts, with his own show appearing on the screen, entitled Bigger Jaws.|$|E
5|$|Stockport County's {{traditional}} kit colours {{are blue}} and white, {{although they have}} played in other colours throughout their history. Originally competing in blue and white striped jerseys and white shorts, they experimented with red and white stripes in the early 1900s, and from the mid-1930s to mid-1960s played in white jerseys and black shorts. No set pattern has been established for the club's use of blue and white as main colours, as they have played at various times in a white jersey with a blue band and blue shorts and a blue jersey with white pin stripes and white shorts. They made a short experiment with an Argentina-style kit, light blue and white stripes with black shorts, after the 1978 World Cup. This was abandoned after {{the outbreak of the}} Falklands War, and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s. County marked their 125th anniversary during 2008 by <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> third kit – a gold colour with black trim. The kit was worn on 17 occasions, all away trips. The strip was retired 'undefeated' {{at the end of the}} year, having been worn for 13 victories and 4 draws. The kit was also worn during a match against Chester City which was abandoned after 59 minutes.|$|E

Despite the extent of Angevin rule, Henry's son, John, was defeated in the Anglo-French War (1213–1214) by Philip II of France following the Battle of Bouvines.

25|$|A {{well-known}} {{accusation that}} Indian political parties make for their rivals {{is that they}} play vote bank politics, meaning give political support to issues {{for the sole purpose}} of gaining the votes of members of a particular community.

The Shah Bano case, a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by <b>bringing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> parliamentary amendment to negate the Supreme Court's decision.

25|$|Scripps Cottage was {{finished}} in September 1931, funded with a donation of $6,000 from Ellen Browning Scripps matched with $5,000 from the state.

She builds 20–30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.|$|E
