IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight {{times more likely than}} men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal <b>body</b> <b>weight.</b> In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal <b>body</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the relation ship between <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> and linear <b>body</b> measurement so as to enable us develop an accurate prediction equation from linear measurements [...] The data used for this study is made up of 163 records sets of records on <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> and linear <b>body</b> measurements (body length, height-at-withers and heart girth) obtained from the University of Maiduguri Teaching and Research Farm.

5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{is one of}} {{relatively}} few sauropods for which gastroliths were found obviously alongside the type specimen. In 2007, an experiment using Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus (=Seismosaurus), and Cedarosaurus tested if sauropods used their gastroliths in an avian-style gastric mill. The analysis took into account that {{among the hundreds of}} sauropods found, gastroliths are only known from a few associated specimens. Authors chose to use the three sauropods with the most associated gastroliths, Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus, and Cedarosaurus, because of the large amount of gastroliths found in birds. When birds were typically found to have 1.05% of their <b>body</b> <b>weight</b> gastroliths, the sauropod Diplodocus, which had the highest amount of gastroliths, only amassed to 0.03% <b>body</b> <b>weight.</b> This means that since the other sauropods Dinheirosaurus and Cedarosaurus had less gastroliths to body mass, an avian-style gastric mill is unlikely to have evolved in sauropods, and they instead might have used gastroliths to absorb minerals.|$|E

40|$|To {{know the}} {{distribution}} of the mortality from diabetes mellitus in Japan and the factors concerned of it, the age-adjusted death rates of diabetes mellitus in each prefecture were calculated by indirect method in the triennial periods of 1969 - 71, and correlations between the death rates and the average <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> of pupils in each prefecture were studied. Significant correlations between the age-adjusted death rates in 1969 - 71 and those in 1963 - 67, 1958 - 62, and 1953 - 57 were recognized, and significant correlations were also recognized between the age-adjusted death rates of males and those of females, so prefecture-accumulations of the death rates were recognized. Significant correlations of the average <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> of pupils between 17 years on one hand and 12, and 8 years on the other in 1968 and 1959 were recognized, and constancies of the <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> by prefecture in terms of sex and time were seen. As the correlations between the age-adjusted death rates of diabetes mellitus in 1969 - 71 and the average <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> of pupils in 1968 and 1959 were significant, the prefecture-accumulations of the death rates of diabetes mellitus seemed to have ralations with the <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> of pupils, and the nutrition of the community...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Broiler cockerels {{were used}} in four trials of 3 -wk {{duration}} to investigate the effects of altering dietary cation:anion ratios on chick growth, leg abnormalities, bone, and blood parameters. Dietary cation content was changed using Ca and Mg, whereas the anions P, CI, and S were included at various levels, giving several total cation:anion ratios with several levels of ions. Narrowing the cation:anion ratios increased 3 -wk <b>body</b> <b>weights</b> and the incidence of both dyschondroplasia and varus deformation. Further increases in dietary anion concentration generally caused a slight depression of <b>body</b> <b>weights.</b> Supplementation of Ca or Mg to diets containing high levels of anion relative to cation decreased the incidence of leg problems and lowered 3 -wk <b>body</b> <b>weights.</b> Blood pH was not significantly affected by dietary mineral alterations, although pH tended to decrease as anion content was increased. Addition of P significantly reduced blood HC 03 and base excess (meq/L). Base excess was negatively correlated (P<. 05) with the incidence of TD and 3 -wk <b>body</b> <b>weights.</b> Two strain-crosses of broiler cockerels, fed diets which had previously increased the incidence of leg abnormalities, exhibited {{no significant differences in}} the incidence of varus deformation or dyschrondroplasia.
