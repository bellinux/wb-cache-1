5|$|From {{literary}} sources it {{is known}} that the collapsible umbrella was invented during Wang Mang's reign, although the simple parasol existed beforehand. This employed sliding levers and <b>bendable</b> joints that could be protracted and retracted.|$|E
5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible umbrella dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible umbrella of Wang Mang's carriage had <b>bendable</b> joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible umbrella has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai. However, the Chinese collapsible umbrella is perhaps a concept that is yet centuries older than Wang's tomb. Zhou Dynasty bronze castings of complex bronze socketed hinges with locking slides and bolts—which {{could have been used}} for parasols and umbrellas—were found in an archeological site of Luoyang, dated to the 6th century BC.|$|E
5|$|As {{a medical}} garment, metal corsets endured {{well into the}} 20th century. The Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was a notable wearer of such medical corsets, {{following}} ongoing problems {{as a result of}} a serious road crash she experienced as a teenager. By 1944, Kahlo's doctors had recommended that she wear a steel corset instead of the plaster ones she had mainly worn since the accident; and Kahlo, whose paintings were heavily autobiographical, used the new corset as the basis for one of her best known self-portraits, The Broken Column. In the painting, Kahlo portrays herself weeping with agony, her torso split open revealing that her spine is a crumbling Ionic column, and her damaged body held together by the steel corset. A form of metal corset or orthopaedic brace used in the second half of the 20th century is called a Harris brace after its inventor, R.I. Harris. Harris braces are designed to immobilise the waist whilst healing, and are made with two <b>bendable</b> metal bands worn above and below the waist, and connected with rigid metal supports.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bendable</b> fiber {{may also}} be {{resistant}} to fiber hacking, in which the signal in a fiber is surreptitiously monitored by bending the fiber and detecting the leakage.|$|E
25|$|In October 2008, Sony {{published}} {{results of}} research it {{carried out with}} the Max Planck Institute over the possibility of mass-market bending displays, which could replace rigid LCDs and plasma screens. Eventually, <b>bendable,</b> see-through displays could be stacked to produce 3D images with much greater contrast ratios and viewing angles than existing products.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} heat {{tolerance}} and mechanical strength of ceramic composite discs, they are often used on exotic vehicles where the cost is not prohibitive to the application. They are also found in industrial applications where the ceramic disc's light weight and low-maintenance properties justify the cost relative to alternatives. Composite brakes can withstand temperatures that would make steel discs <b>bendable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kong's torso was {{streamlined}} {{to eliminate}} the comical appearance {{of the real world}} gorilla's prominent belly and buttocks. His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, <b>bendable</b> wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.|$|E
25|$|FR-4 (Flame Retardant 4), a woven {{fiberglass}} cloth impregnated with an epoxy resin. Low water absorption (up to about 0.15%), good insulation properties, good arc resistance. Well-proven, properties well understood by manufacturers. Very common, workhorse of the industry. Several grades with somewhat different properties are available. Typically rated to 130°C. Thin FR-4, about 0.1mm, {{can be used}} for <b>bendable</b> circuitboards. Many different grades exist, with varying parameters; versions are with higher Tg, higher tracking resistance, etc.|$|E
25|$|Rope is {{very often}} used in bondage as a {{material}} for physical restraint. In the western world, almost any kind of rope {{can be used for}} bondage, such as cotton, artificial fibers, or other materials. However, in Japanese bondage (shibari), only ropes made of hemp or jute are usually used. In Japanese bondage, the rope is usually well prepared before it can be used, so that it becomes soft and easily <b>bendable.</b> Between bondage sessions, the rope is cleaned by washing it.|$|E
25|$|The bladder {{walls are}} very thin and transparent, but are {{sufficiently}} inflexible {{to maintain the}} bladder's shape despite the vacuum created within. The entrance, or 'mouth', of the trap is a circular or oval flap whose upper half is joined {{to the body of}} the trap by very flexible, yielding cells which form an effective hinge. The door rests on a platform formed by the thickening of the bladder wall immediately underneath. A soft but substantial membrane called the velum stretches in a curve around the middle of this platform, and helps seal the door. A second band of springy cells cross the door just above its lower edge, and provide the flexibility for the bottom of the door to become a <b>bendable</b> 'lip' which can make a perfect seal with the velum.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} two years that Midge was sold, she had [...] "straight legs" [...] that could not bend at the knee. [...] A rare Midge with teeth was sold the first year and is now sought after by collectors. [...] One year later, in 1964 the dolls that were sold had {{slightly}} longer hair. [...] Midge's boyfriend Allan arrived as well. Early in 1965, Wigs Wardrobe Midge was sold, and consisted of a Midge head with short molded hair and three wigs. This was the Midge counterpart of the Fashion Queen Barbie. Since she came with only a head, another doll had to provide for the body. [...] In 1965 Midge with <b>bendable</b> legs was introduced. She had shorter [...] "bobbed" [...] hair, like the American Girl Barbie, with a blue headband. Her swimming suit was different as well, and was now one-piece and striped.|$|E
2500|$|The {{collectible}} releases {{include a}} set of <b>bendable</b> action figures, including Lieutenant Kif Kroker, Turanga Leela, and Bender. There have also been a few figures released by Moore Action Collectibles, including Fry, Turanga Leela, Bender, and the Planet Express Ship. In late 2006, Rocket USA brought out a limited edition [...] "super" [...] heavyweight die-cast Bender. Another special edition Bender figure was released at the San Diego Comic Con (SDCC) in 2006; the figure was called [...] "Glorious Golden Bender".|$|E
2500|$|Fiber cable {{can be very}} flexible, but {{traditional}} fiber's loss increases greatly if {{the fiber}} is bent with a radius smaller than around 30mm. This creates a problem when the cable is bent around corners or wound around a spool, making FTTX installations more complicated. [...] "Bendable fibers", targeted towards easier installation in home environments, have been standardized as ITU-T G.657. This type of fiber can be bent with a radius as low as 7.5mm without adverse impact. Even more <b>bendable</b> fibers have been developed.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, Samsung showcased the world's {{thinnest}} OLED display, {{also the}} first to be [...] "flappable" [...] and <b>bendable.</b> It measures just 0.05mm (thinner than paper), yet a Samsung staff member said that it is [...] "technically possible to make the panel thinner". To achieve this thickness, Samsung etched an OLED panel that uses a normal glass substrate. The drive circuit was formed by low-temperature polysilicon TFTs. Also, low-molecular organic EL materials were employed. The pixel count of the display is 480 × 272. The contrast ratio is 100,000:1, and the luminance is 200cd/m2. The colour reproduction range is 100% of the NTSC standard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{drum shell}} {{is made of}} hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use {{depending}} on the region where the drum is made. [...] To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it <b>bendable,</b> and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together. [...] The heads are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames. [...] However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone. [...] Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred. [...] Rope threaded {{back and forth across}} the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum. [...] Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning. [...] Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum.|$|E
2500|$|In some Lego products, figures {{other than}} {{standard}} minifigures are used. A catalog that shows all these LEGO figures is available. Some Lego sets from 1974 on included much larger figures where only the heads and hair were special pieces , {{which is why}} the usual figures are [...] "mini". Technic used larger scale action figures between 1986 and 2001. These figures featured more realistic sculpts, although still distinctively angular, and featured more articulation, including <b>bendable</b> elbows and knees. These figures are further distinguished from minifigures in that they cannot be easily disassembled; even the hair pieces are non-removable. Duplo includes figures that have less articulation than standard minifigures and cannot be disassembled for safety reasons. Likewise, the Fabuland collection, produced in the 1980s, consisted of larger anthropomorphized animal characters, which also could not be easily disassembled. Belville and Scala, Lego products marketed to girls, also include larger scale figures. These figures are similar to Technic figures in articulation, but feature less angular body sculpts. Scala figures more closely resemble dolls, in that clothes are separate from the figures and hair is made of strands rather than molded plastic. In 2001 Lego further expanded the minifigure system, with the introduction of Bionicle figures. These figures are a part of a fictional story developed by Lego, and resemble biomechanical creatures. Initially, these figures were produced without articulation, only able to hold tools and weapons. Bionicle later got replaced with Hero Factory in 2010. In 2005, Lego released Bionicle playsets, with minifigure variations of characters that had previously been produced in the larger Bionicle scale, notably the Toa and Visorak characters. While these minifigures did not feature movable parts, Lego released Piraka and Inika playsets in 2006, which included minifigures with movable parts. The Friends theme, released in 2012, included mini-doll figures, a more doll-like construction with more realistic anatomy, soon introduced into other themes chiefly aimed at girls. Even though the mini-dolls in the Lego Friends theme have a more realistic anatomy, the mini-dolls' legs can only move ninety degrees into a sitting position. [...] The mini-dolls' legs are also molded together and can not move separately like the traditional Lego minifigure legs can. The mini-doll in the Lego Friends theme is slightly taller than the traditional minifigure.|$|E
60|$|Women were so fickle and so capricious! which remark {{inwardly}} muttered {{came with}} singular inappropriateness from Gaston de Stainville. His keen judgment, however, fought his apprehensions. He knew quite well that Lydie was unlike other women, at once stronger and weaker {{than those of}} her own sex, more firm in her purpose, less <b>bendable</b> in her obstinacy. And he knew also that nothing could occur within the gorgeous walls of that palace to cause her to change her mind.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding which minuteness a good Microscope discovers {{those small}} movable specks {{to be very}} prettily shap'd Insects, each of them {{furnished}} with eight well shap'd and proportion'd legs, which are each of them joynted or <b>bendable</b> in eight several places, or joynts, {{each of which is}} covered, for the most part, with a very transparent shell, and {{the lower end of the}} shell of each joynt is fringed with several small hairs; the contrivance of the joynts seems the very same with that of Crabs and Lobsters legs, and like those also, they are each of them terminated with a very sharp claw or point; four of these legs are so placed, that they seem to draw forwards, the other four are placed in a quite contrary position, thereby to keep the body backwards when there is occasion.|$|E
50|$|The doll is 23 {{centimetres}} (9 inches) {{tall and}} there are three different versions of her: Dizzy Daisy, who has a stiff body and unbendable legs,with just {{her arms and legs}} swinging up and down from the hips and shoulders, basic bodied version with <b>bendable</b> legs, as well as the swivelling arms and leg joints, and an active version called Dashing Daisy, whose body is the most <b>bendable.</b> Her hair colour has ranged from different shades of blond to brunette and red.|$|E
