40|$|<b>Bindarit</b> retards {{renal disease}} and prolongs {{survival}} in murine lupus autoimmune disease. As {{an alternative to}} classical immunosuppressants in experimental lupus nephritis, we looked at <b>bindarit,</b> 2 -methyl- 2 -{[1 -phenylmethyl) - 1 H-indazol- 3 -y 1]methoxy}propanoic acid, a novel molecule devoid of immunosuppressive effects, which selectively reduces chronic inflammation in rat adjuvant arthritis. Two groups of NZB/W mice (N = 55 for each group) were given <b>bindarit,</b> (50 mg/kg/day p. o.) or vehicle starting at 2 months of age. Mice were sacrificed at 2, 6, 8 and 10 months or used for survival studies. <b>Bindarit</b> delayed the onset of proteinuria (% proteinuric mice, <b>bindarit</b> vs. vehicle, 6 months: 0 vs. 33 % and 8 months: 7 % vs. 60 %, P < 0. 005; 10 months: 53 % vs. 80 %) and significantly (P < 0. 05) protected from renal function impairment (serum BUN, <b>bindarit</b> vs. vehicle: 8 months, 30 ± 3 vs. 127 ± 42; 10 months, 53 ± 5 vs. 140 ± 37 mg/dl). Appearance of anti-DNA antibodies was retarded and survival significantly (P < 0. 0001) prolonged by <b>bindarit</b> (% survival, <b>bindarit</b> vs. vehicle: 8 months, 100 % vs. 80 %; 10 months, 87 % vs. 40 %; 12 months, 27 % vs. 20 %). <b>Bindarit</b> significantly limited glomerular hypercellularity, interstitial inflammation and tubular damage. Renal expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP- 1) mRNA (Northern blot) markedly increased (7 - 12 -fold in 8 - 10 -month-old mice vs. 2 -month-old) during the progression of nephritis in association with mononuclear cell infiltration. <b>Bindarit</b> completely prevented MCP- 1 up-regulation. In another series of experiments, <b>bindarit</b> (0. 25 % and 0. 5 % medicated diet, N = 16 for each group) when started at 4. 5 months of age in NZB/W mice improved survival in respect to untreated mice (N = 17) in a dose-dependent manner (% survival: 8 months, 94 % and 100 %, respectively, vs. 47 %; 10 months, 75 % and 100 % vs. 35 %; 12 months, 31 % and 75 % vs. 12 %).

40|$|<b>Bindarit</b> is an {{original}} compound with peculiar anti-inflammatory activity {{due to a}} selective inhibition of a subfamily of inflammatory chemokines, including the monocyte chemotactic proteins MCP- 1 / CCL 2, MCP- 3 /CCL 7, and MCP- 2 /CCL 8. It {{is well known that}} chemokines have a crucial role in initiating and progressing neointima formation by controlling each step of the vascular remodelling in response to various noxious stimuli. The induction of MCP- 1 not only correlates with macrophage accumulation but there is strong evidence for an important role of MCP- 1 in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration, processes that contribute substantially to neointima formation after arterial stenting and balloon angioplasty. In this thesis, we investigated the effect of <b>bindarit</b> on neointima formation using three animal models of arterial injury: rat carotid artery balloon angioplasty, wire-induced carotid injury in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice, and in stent stenosis in preclinical porcine coronary stent model. Treatment of rats with <b>bindarit</b> (200 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced balloon injury-induced neointima formation by 39 % at day 14 without affecting re-endothelialization and reduced the number of medial and neointimal proliferating cells at day 7 by 54 and 30 %, respectively. These effects were associated with a significant reduction of MCP- 1 levels both in sera and in injured carotid arteries of rats treated with <b>bindarit.</b> In addition, in vitro data showed that <b>bindarit</b> (10 – 300 μM) reduced rat vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration, and invasion, processes contributing to the injury-induced neointima formation in vivo. Similar results were observed in hypercholesterolaemic apoE-/- mice in which <b>bindarit</b> administration resulted in a 42 % reduction of the number of proliferating cells at day 7 after carotid injury and in a 47 % inhibition of neointima formation at day 28. Analysis of the cellular composition in neointimal lesions of apoE-/- mice treated with <b>bindarit</b> showed that the relative content of macrophages and the number of SMCs were reduced by 66 and 30 %, respectively, compared with the control group. One or 2 bare metal stents (Multi-Link Vision, 3. 5 mm) were deployed (1 : 1. 2 oversize ratio) in the coronary arteries of 42 pigs (20 <b>bindarit</b> versus 22 controls). <b>Bindarit</b> (50 mg/kg per day) was administered orally from 2 days before stenting until the time of euthanasia at 7 and 28 days. <b>Bindarit</b> caused a significant reduction in neointimal area (39. 4 %), neointimal thickness (51 %), stenosis area (37 %), and inflammatory score (40 %,) compared with control animals, whereas {{there was no significant difference}} in the injury score between the 2 groups. Moreover, treatment with <b>bindarit</b> significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (by 45 %) and monocyte/macrophage content (by 55 %) in stented arteries at day 7 and 28, respectively. These effects were associated with a significant (P< 0. 05) reduction of MCP- 1 plasma levels at day 28. In vitro data showed that <b>bindarit</b> (10 – 300 μmol/L) reduced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, 50 ng/mL) –induced pig coronary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibited MCP- 1 production. However, the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of <b>bindarit</b> in controlling neointimal formation/restenosis have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effect of <b>bindarit</b> on human coronary smooth muscle cells activation, drawing attention to the phenotypic modulation process, focusing on contractile proteins expression as well as proliferation and migration. The expression of contractile proteins was evaluated by western blot analysis on cultured human coronary smooth muscle cells stimulated with TNF-α (30 ng/mL) or fetal bovine serum (FBS, 5 %). <b>Bindarit</b> (100 - 300 μM) reduced the embryonic form of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMemb) while increased smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA) and calponin in both TNF-α- and FBS-stimulated cells. These effects were associated with the inhibition of human coronary smooth muscle cell proliferation/migration and both MCP- 1 and MCP- 3 production. The effect of <b>bindarit</b> on smooth muscle cells phenotypic switching was confirmed in vivo in the rat balloon angioplasty model. <b>Bindarit</b> (200 mg/Kg/day) significantly reduced the expression of SMemb, while increased α-SMA and calponin in rat carotid arteries subjected to endothelial denudation. The results provided in this thesis show that <b>bindarit</b> given systemically significantly reduced neointimal formation in animal models of arterial injury by inhibiting SMC proliferation/migration, and macrophage infiltration; these effects correlated with a reduction in MCP- 1 synthesis. Preclinical studies demonstrated that <b>bindarit</b> has a safe toxicological profile and is devoid of immunosuppressive, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects. Phase I clinical studies demonstrated that <b>bindarit</b> (up to a dose of 1200 mg BID) is well tolerated and confirmed the lack of overt toxicity suggested by preclinical studies. Results of Phase II clinical studies confirmed the good tolerability profile of <b>bindarit</b> and demonstrated, at 600 mg BID, significant effects in kidney disease patients. Importantly, a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial, with the aim of investigating the effect of <b>bindarit</b> in human coronary restenosis, showed that <b>bindarit</b> induced a significant reduction of in-stent late loss.

40|$|Prostate {{and breast}} cancer are major causes of death worldwide, mainly due to patient relapse upon dis- ease {{recurrence}} through formation of metastases. Chemo- kines are small proteins with crucial roles in the immune system, and their regulation is finely tuned in early inflammatory responses.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Alphaviruses such as {{chikungunya}} virus, Sindbis virus, o'nyong-nyong virus, Mayaro virus, and Ross River virus (RRV), {{are commonly}} associated with arthralgias and overt arthritides worldwide. Understanding the processes by which arthritogenic viruses cause disease is a prerequisite {{in the quest for}} better treatments. In this regard, we have recently established that monocyte/macrophages are mediators of alphavirus-induced arthritis in mice. We hypothesized that chemokines associated with monocyte/macrophage recruitment may {{play an important role in}} disease. The aim of the present investigations was to determine whether <b>bindarit,</b> an inhibitor of monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP) synthesis, could ameliorate alphavirus-induced rheumatic disease in mice. METHODS: Using our recently developed mouse model of RRV-induced arthritis, which has many characteristics of RRV disease (RRVD) in humans, the effects of <b>bindarit</b> treatment on RRVD in mice were determined via histologic analyses, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: Bindarit-treated RRV-infected mice developed mild disease and had substantially reduced tissue destruction and inflammatory cell recruitment as compared with untreated RRV-infected mice. The virus load in the tissues was not affected by <b>bindarit</b> treatment. <b>Bindarit</b> exhibited its activity by down-regulating MCPs, which in turn led to inhibition of cell infiltration and lower production of NF-kappaB and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which are involved in mediating tissue damage.

40|$|Chemokines such as {{monocyte}} chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1 are key agonists {{that attract}} macrophages to tumors. In melanoma, {{it has been}} previously shown that variable levels of MCP- 1 /CCL 2 appear to correlate with infiltrating macrophages and tumor fate, with low to intermediate levels of the chemokine contributing to melanoma development. To work under such conditions, a poorly tumorigenic human melanoma cell line was transfected with an expression vector encoding MCP- 1.

40|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common age-related neurodegenerative pathology, is the abnormal extracellular deposition of neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that accumulate in senile plaques. Aβ aggregates are toxic to neurons and are thought to contribute to neuronal loss. Evidence indicates that inflammation is involved in the pathophysiology of AD, and activation of glial cells by a variety of factors, including Aβ, appears to be a central event. Among molecules produced during inflammation associated with neuronal death, CCL 2, also known as monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1), seems to be particularly important. Indeed, CCL 2 levels are higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD than in controls. In the present study, we demonstrated the protective effect of <b>bindarit</b> (which inhibits CCL 2 synthesis) against both Aβ 25 - 35 and Aβ 1 - 42 -induced toxicity in primary mixed neural cultures. <b>Bindarit</b> (30 - 500 μM) reversed cell death induced by Aβ in a dose-dependent manner and reduced the transcription and release of CCL 2 by astrocytes after Aβ treatment, as revealed by qRT-PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence staining. Astroglial activation and CCL 2 release was induced by ATP released by damaged neurons through interaction with P 2 X 7 receptors present on astrocyte surface. CCL 2, interacting with its cognate receptor CCR 2, present on neuron surface, strongly contributes to the toxic activity of Aβ. <b>Bindarit</b> was able to disconnect this neuro-glial interaction. Our results demonstrate the ability of <b>bindarit</b> to inhibit Aβ-induced neuronal death and suggest the potential role of CCL 2 inhibitors in the treatment of neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative diseases...|$|E
40|$|Background—Monocyte {{chemoattractant}} proteins (MCPs) play {{an important}} role in mediating inflammatory processes. Hypertension (HTN) is associated with inflammation as well as impaired cardiac microcirculatory function and structure, but the contribution of MCPs to these alterations remained unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that MCPs regulate cardiac microvascular function and structure in experimental HTN. Methods and Results—Pigs (n 6 per group) were studied after 10 weeks of normal, renovascular HTN, or renovascular HTN <b>bindarit</b> (MCPs inhibitor, 50 mg/kg/d PO). Left ventricular (LV) function, myocardial microvascular permeability, and fractional vascular volume were assessed by fast computed tomography before and after adenosine infusion (400 g/kg/min). Myocardial fibrosis, inflammation, and microvascular remodeling were determined ex vivo. Hypertension was not altered by <b>bindarit,</b> but LV hypertrophy and diastolic function were improved. In response to adenosine, myocardial microvascular permeability increased in HTN (from 0. 00830. 0009 to 0. 01030. 0011 AU, P 0. 038 versus baseline) and fractional vascular volume decreased, whereas both remained unchanged in normal and HTNbindarit pigs. HTN upregulated endothelin- 1 expression, myocardial inflammation, and microvascular wall thickening, which were inhibited by <b>bindarit.</b> Conclusions—MCPs partly mediate myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, vascular remodeling, and impaired vascular integrity induced by hypertension. Inhibition of MCPs could potentially be a therapeutic target in hypertensiv...|$|E

METHODS AND RESULTS A phase II, double-blind, multicentre randomised trial included 148 patients randomised into three arms (BND 600 mg, n= 48; BND 1, 200 mg, n= 49; PLB, n= 51). <b>Bindarit</b> was given following PCI and continued for 180 days. Monthly clinical follow-up and six-month coronary angiography were conducted. The primary endpoint was in-segment late loss; the main secondary endpoints were in-stent late loss and major adverse cardiovascular events. Efficacy analysis was carried out on two populations, ITT and PP. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics among the three treatment groups. In-segment and in-stent late loss at six months in BND 600, BND 1, 200 and PLB were: (ITT 0. 54 vs. 0. 52 vs. 0. 72; p= 0. 21), (PP 0. 46 vs. 0. 53 vs. 0. 72; p= 0. 12) and (ITT 0. 74 vs. 0. 74 vs. 1. 05; p= 0. 01), (PP 0. 66 vs. 0. 73 vs. 1. 06; p= 0. 003), respectively.

While there has been significant progress in defining the pathophy-siology of alphaviral disease, relatively {{little is known about the}} mechanisms involved in CHIKV-induced arthritis or potential therapeutic options to treat the severe arthritic symptoms associated with infection. Here, we used microcomputed tomographic (CT) and histomorphometric analyses to provide previously undescribed evidence of reduced bone volume in the proximal tibial epiphysis of CHIKV-infected mice compared to the results for mock controls. This was associated with a significant in-crease in the receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand/osteoprotegerin (RANKL/OPG) ratio in infected murine joints and in the serum of CHIKV patients. The expression levels of the monocyte chemoattractant proteins (MCPs), includingMCP- 1 /CCL 2, MCP- 2 /CCL 8, andMCP- 3 /CCL 7, were also highly elevated in joints of CHIKV-infected mice, accompanied by increased cellular-ity within the bone marrow in tibial epiphysis and ankle joints. Both this effect and CHIKV-induced bone loss were significantly reduced by treatment with theMCP inhibitor <b>bindarit.</b> Collectively, these findings demonstrate a unique role for MCPs in pro-moting CHIKV-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone loss during disease and suggest that inhibition of MCPs with <b>bindarit</b> ma...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is {{the current}} procedure that allows the endovascular treatment of occlusive artery disease, without the need of bypass surgery. The most problematic complication of PCI, with or without stent implantation, is the restenosis defined as the re-narrowing of the enlarged artery and characterized by an immune/inflammatory response going with a hyperplastic reaction, involving smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration/proliferation, and remodelling of the arterial wall. In an effort to improve on current therapy for restenosis we are prompted to consider new strategies for prevention and treatment, focusing on understanding of molecular mechanisms and identifying possible therapeutic targets. This thesis aims at four issues described as follows: 1. Effect of NBD peptide on injury-induced neointimal formation The activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a crucial step in the arterial wall's response to injury. NF-κB essential modulator-binding domain (NBD) peptide blocks the activation of the IκB kinase complex, selectively abrogating the inflammation-induced activation of NF-κB. In this study, we investigated the effect of NBD peptide on neointimal formation using two animal models of arterial injury: rat carotid artery balloon angioplasty and wire-induced carotid injury in apolipoproteinE-deficient (apoE-/-) mice. Local treatment with the NBD peptide (300 μg/site) significantly {{reduced the number of}} proliferating cells in rat carotid arteries 7 days after angioplasty (by 40 %; P< 0. 01) and reduced injury-induced neointimal formation (by 50 %; P< 0. 01) at day 14. These effects were associated with a significant reduction of NF-κB activation and monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) expression in the carotid arteries of rats treated with the peptide. In addition, the NBD peptide (0. 01 to 1 μM) reduced rat SMC proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, processes contributing to the injury-induced neointimal formation in vivo. Similar results were observed in apoE-/- mice in which the NBD peptide (150 μg/site) reduced wire-induced neointimal formation at day 28 (by 47 %; P< 0. 01). Our results demonstrate that the NBD peptide reduces neointimal formation and SMC proliferation/migration, both effects associated with the inhibition of NF-κB activation. 2. Use of the anti-inflammatory agent <b>bindarit</b> to control neointimal hyperplasia Chemokines are a family of proteins that regulate the migration of circulating leukocytes to sites of arterial injury as well as the activation of SMCs. Many chemokine genes are under the control of NF-κB. <b>Bindarit</b> is an original compound with peculiar anti-inflammatory activity due to a selective inhibition of the chemokines MCP- 1, MCP- 3, and MCP- 2. In the present study we evaluated the effect of <b>bindarit</b> on neointimal formation using both animal models described above. Treatment of rats with <b>bindarit</b> (200 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced balloon injury-induced neointimal formation by 39 % at day 14 without affecting re-endothelialisation and reduced the number of medial and neointimal proliferating cells at day 7 by 54 % and 30 %, respectively. These effects were associated with a significant reduction of MCP- 1 levels both in sera and in injured carotid arteries of rats treated with <b>bindarit.</b> In addition, in vitro data showed that <b>bindarit</b> (10 - 300 µM) reduced rat SMC proliferation, migration, and invasion. Similar results were observed in apoE-/- mice in which <b>bindarit</b> administration resulted in a 42 % reduction of the number of proliferating cells at day 7 after carotid injury and in a 47 % inhibition of neointimal formation at day 28. Analysis of the cellular composition in neointimal lesions of apoE-/- mice treated with <b>bindarit</b> showed that the relative content of macrophages and the number of SMCs were reduced by 66 % and 30 %, respectively, compared with the control group. This study demonstrates that <b>bindarit</b> is effective in reducing neointimal formation in both non-hyperlipidaemic and hyperlipidaemic animal models of vascular injury by a direct effect on SMC proliferation and migration and by reducing neointimal macrophage content. All of these data were associated with the inhibition of MCP- 1 production. 3. Role of Monocyte Chemotactic Protein- 3 in human coronary smooth muscle cell proliferation Few studies have examined the role of MCP- 3 in vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis and restenosis in which SMC proliferation plays an important role. In this study, we investigated the effect of MCP- 3 on human coronary artery SMC (CASMC) proliferation. MCP- 3 induced concentration-dependent CASMC proliferation with the maximum stimulatory effect at 0. 3 ng/mL (about 50 % vs unstimulated cells) assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake and direct cell counting. Anti-MCP- 3 Ab (20 ng/mL) completely inhibited cell proliferation, demonstrating the specificity of the proliferative effect of MCP- 3. Moreover, the MCP- 3 -induced CASMC proliferation was blocked by RS 102895 (0. 06 - 6 μM), a specific antagonist of chemokine receptor 2 (CCR 2). The mitogenic effect of MCP- 3 appeared to be dependent on ERK 1 / 2 MAPK and PI 3 K signalling pathway activation, as demonstrated by the reduction of MCP- 3 -induced CASMC proliferation observed after the treatment of cells with U 0126 (1 μM) and LY- 294002 (5 μM), selective inhibitors of ERK 1 / 2 and PI 3 K activation, respectively. We found no relationship between MCP- 3 -induced CASMC proliferation and NF-κB activation. Moreover, we found that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, 30 ng/mL) and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β, 1 ng/mL) both induced time-dependent increase of MCP- 3 production by CASMCs, which was reduced by the anti-MCP- 3 Ab (20 ng/mL), suggesting that the mitogenic effect of these stimuli is due, at least in part, to MCP- 3. Our results demonstrate that MCP- 3 is produced by human CASMCs and directly induces CASMC proliferation in vitro, suggesting a potential role for this chemokine in vascular pathology. 4. Antigen presentation and costimulatory molecules expression by murine smooth muscle cells The findings that SMCs express MHC II molecules during arterial response to injury suggested their active role in cellular immunity. Since it is not known if vascular SMCs can function as antigen presenting cells, in the present study we investigated the contribution of SMC in antigen presentation. Firstly, we examined the MHC II and some costimulatory molecules expression in SMCs. The percentage of MHC II, CD 54 (ICAM- 1), CD 44 and OX 40 L positive unstimulated SMCs was about 2 %, 30 %, 87 % and 5 %, respectively. The stimulation with IFN-γ (100 ng/mL)) significantly caused a 7 to 8 fold increase in the percentage of MHC II positive cells (P< 0. 01), a 2 fold increase in the percentage of ICAM- 1 positive cells (P< 0. 01), while it did not affect the expression of CD 44 and OX 40 L. To assess the antigen presentation by SMCs we employed the Ealpha (Eα) -GFP/Y-Ae system that allows visualisation of antigen uptake, as the Eα is GFP labelled, and tracking of antigen presentation using the Y-Ae Ab to detects Eα when bound to MHC II. Treatment of SMCs with Eα for 24 h induced an increase in the percentage of GFP positive cells, both in presence or absence of IFN-γ-stimulation, without affecting the percentage of Y-Ae positive cells. Treatment with Eα of dendritic cells, used as positive control, significantly caused a 50 to 60 fold increase in the percentage of both GFP and Y-Ae positive cells. Our results show that cultured murine SMCs express MHC II molecules after stimulation with IFN-γ but are not able to present the antigen in the context of MHC II...|$|E

This proapoptosis effect of SGS on neutrophils was abrogated by pretreatment with protease as well as preincubation with antisaliva antibodies.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: While various {{monocyte}} chemokine {{systems are}} increased in expression in osteoarthritis (OA), {{the hierarchy of}} chemokines and chemokine receptors in mediating monocyte/macrophage recruitment to the OA joint remains poorly defined. Here, we investigated the relative contributions of the CCL 2 /CCR 2 versus CCL 5 /CCR 5 chemokine axes in OA pathogenesis. METHODS: Ccl 2 -, Ccr 2 -, Ccl 5 - and Ccr 5 -deficient and control mice were subjected to destabilisation of medial meniscus surgery to induce OA. The pharmacological utility of blocking CCL 2 /CCR 2 signalling in mouse OA was investigated using <b>bindarit,</b> a CCL 2 synthesis inhibitor, and RS- 504393, a CCR 2 antagonist. Levels of monocyte chemoattractants in synovial tissues and fluids from patients with joint injuries without OA and those with established OA were investigated {{using a combination of}} microarray analyses, multiplexed cytokine assays and immunostains. RESULTS: Mice lacking CCL 2 or CCR 2, but not CCL 5 or CCR 5, were protected against OA with a concomitant reduction in local monocyte/macrophage numbers in their joints. In synovial fluids from patients with OA, levels of CCR 2 ligands (CCL 2, CCL 7 and CCL 8) but not CCR 5 ligands (CCL 3, CCL 4 and CCL 5) were elevated. We found that CCR 2 + cells are abundant in human OA synovium and that CCR 2 + macrophages line, invade and are associated with the erosion of OA cartilage. Further, blockade of CCL 2 /CCR 2 signalling markedly attenuated macrophage accumulation, synovitis and cartilage damage in mouse OA. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that monocytes recruited via CCL 2 /CCR 2, rather than by CCL 5 /CCR 5, propagate inflammation and tissue damage in OA.

40|$|The {{receptor}} {{for advanced}} glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a 35 -kDa polypeptide of the immunogloblin superfamily {{that has been}} implicated as a mediator of both acute and chronic vascular inflammation. RAGE has also recently been implicated in the pathology of pulmonary hypertension (PH) : a rare, progressive disease of the small pulmonary arteries characterised by pulmonary vascular remodelling, thrombosis, vasoconstriction and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. A ligand for RAGE, the calcium binding protein MTS 1 /S 100 A 4, is expressed in occlusive vascular lesions of patients with advanced PH. MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 is upregulated and secreted by pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) in vitro on activation of the 5 HT 1 b receptor and 5 HT transporter (5 HTT). Additionally, the proliferative effect of 5 HT on these cells, which is mediated by 5 HT 1 b and 5 HTT, may be inhibited by antagonism of RAGE or reduced bioavailability of MTS 1 /S 100 A 4. These data suggest that MTS 1 /S 100 A 4, through its action at RAGE, is a key mediator of 5 HT-induced hPASMC proliferation. 	Transgenic mice overexpressing MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 are observed to develop obliterative pulmonary vascular disease and possess increased right ventricular pressure at baseline and after hypoxia when compared to wildtype mice (WT). These increases occur {{in the absence of}} an increase in pulmonary vascular remodelling suggesting that MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 overexpression is associated with some other structural or functional change in the pulmonary circulation. 	We sought to further our understanding of the role of RAGE in pulmonary hypertension through treatment with a small molecule inhibitor of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1), a marker of downstream of RAGE rage activation; through further characterisation of the MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 mouse in a chronic hypoxic model of PAH; and through treatment with soluble RAGE (sRAGE) to reduce RAGE ligand bioavailability in vivo. In each case systolic right ventricular pressure (sRVP), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and pulmonary vascular remodelling were measured in normoxic conditions or after a two week chronic hypoxia challenge to induce PH. These in vivo experiments were supplemented with functional studies in isolated intrapulmonary arteries to assess vascular reactivity and vascular elastance as well as studies of pulmonary fibroblast proliferation in vitro. 	Treatment with the MCP- 1 synthesis inhibitor <b>Bindarit</b> produced no detectable effects upon the pulmonary response of mice to chronic hypoxia, though this study may have been hampered by difficulties with the methylcellulose vehicle. MCP- 1 produced no degree of proliferation in pulmonary fibroblasts and neither augmented nor inhibited proliferation induced by 5 HT. 	 	We found little evidence for the exacerbation of PH in MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 mice in normoxia, hypoxia or after 4 weeks of normoxic recovery. Mean RVP was elevated above that in WT mice exposed to hypoxia. However, MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 mice appeared protected against hypoxia-induced vascular remodelling and decreases in vascular elastance. No other significant differences in sRVP, RVH or remodelling were observed between strains. Vessels isolated from MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 mice tended towards an enhanced contractile response to 5 HT in normoxia compared with vessels in WT mice but were also more sensitive to the nitric oxide donor SNP. These differences in vasoreactivity were largely abolished by exposure to hypoxia. Treatment with soluble RAGE (sRAGE) to reduce RAGE ligand bioavailability produced a significant reduction in sRVP after hypoxia in comparison to vehicle-dosed mice -possibly associated with the prevention of a hypoxia-induced decrease in proximal vascular elastance. However, no benefit upon the development of remodelling or the extent of RVH was observed. Vessels isolated from mice treated with sRAGE and challenged with hypoxia showed a marked increase in contractility. Further work demonstrated that sRAGE produces a small, slowly developing contraction in isolated vessels and that the maximal force of contraction to 5 HT was markedly augmented in the presence of sRAGE. Finally, treatment with sRAGE did not inhibit fibroblast proliferation in vitro as induced by 5 HT but was observed to cause a small degree of proliferation alone and to augment hypoxia-induced proliferation. 	In summary, we have reported a number of seemingly contradictory findings associated with RAGE in pulmonary hypertension. Treatment with sRAGE produced a beneficial reduction in hypoxia-induced PH associated with protection against decreased proximal vascular elastance but produced no change in hypoxia-induced RVH or remodelling as well as greatly increasing vascular contractility. MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 mice show some evidence of deleterious changes to the pulmonary circulation, but these may be offset by beneficial compensatory mechanisms such as increased sensitivity to nitric oxide and protection against vascular remodelling. 	MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 stimulates smooth muscle cell proliferation suggesting that it may involved pulmonary vascular remodelling. However, inhibition of RAGE was observed to enhance fibroblast proliferation in response to hypoxia here. Fibroblasts are important regulators of SMC proliferation in vivo. These findings therefore suggest a more complicated relationship between RAGE, its ligands and the remodelling process. Since both MTS 1 /S 100 A 4 overexpression and sRAGE treatment in vivo produced findings which are difficult to reconcile using the currently employed techniques, it is clear that furthering our understanding of RAGE will require study with greater focus upon the interaction of different cell types in the pulmonary vasculature and the manner in which the disturbance of this may lead to alterations in the physical and physiological properties of the pulmonary circulation...|$|E
