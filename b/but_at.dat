5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E

5|$|All of Godwin's {{books written}} from 1970 to 1990 are fictional stories based on themes taken from Godwin's life.

The main protagonist is often restricted by family, tradition and patriarchy. Most of Godwin's early works include a prominent mother-daughter relationship as well.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{original}} objective was solely {{to protect the}} Serb population against the Ustaše, Dangić quickly became {{an important factor in}} the conflict between the two groups in eastern Bosnia.

5|$|Bridging the {{gap between}} self-expressive {{piercing}} and spiritual piercing, modern primitives use piercing {{and other forms of}} body modification as a way of ritually reconnecting with themselves and society, which according to Musafar once used piercing as a culturally binding ritual. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> the same time that piercing can be culturally binding, it may also be a means of rebellion, particularly for adolescents in Western cultures.|$|E
