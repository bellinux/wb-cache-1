5|$|A prophecy {{states that}} a female {{child with a}} special {{birthmark}} will herald {{the downfall of the}} evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. Bavmorda imprisons all pregnant women in her realm to prevent fulfillment of the prophecy. When the prophesied child Elora Danan is born, the mother <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> midwife to hide the infant and smuggle her to safety. The midwife reluctantly accepts and leaves Nockmaar castle unnoticed. The mother is executed, the midwife is hunted down and eventually found. Knowing she cannot escape, she sets the baby on a makeshift raft of grass and sends her down the river hoping for fate to run its course. The midwife is killed by Nockmaar hounds. Bavmorda, furious about the escape, summons her daughter Sorsha and her army's commander, General Kael, to find the baby.|$|E
5|$|In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a {{grasshopper}} squanders {{the spring}} and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food. After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars â€“ that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act. Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide an account of <b>the</b> fallaciousness of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} without thereby indicting as fallacious all otherwise acceptable deductively valid reasoning. The solution that we suggest exploits the intuition that all good arguments are weakly circular. <b>The</b> fallaciousness of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question is not that the reasoning is circular simpliciter. Rather, <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question is a fallacy because the conclusion relies on an undischarged assumption that the audience cannot accept without further argumentation. In the face of such an argument the arguer might just as well have merely asserted the conclusion. 1. Goal and thesis of the essay Goal: To provide an account of <b>the</b> fallacy of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question that both recognizes the circularity that is inherently present in any good argument (specifically a deductively valid argument), yet does not characterize all good arguments (specifically deductively valid arguments) as question <b>begging.</b> Thesis: <b>Begging</b> <b>the</b> question is an informal fallacy in that an argument and a context (hence the informality) must have the following characteristic: the conclusion depends upon an assumption that is not accepted by the audience without further argumentation. 2.

5|$|Andrei is {{once again}} at the Andronikov Monastery as famine and war grip the country. He no longer paints and never speaks, and keeps Durochka with him as a fellow {{companion}} in silence. Several refugees discuss the problems in their respective home towns, and one man talks in a broken voice of his escape from Vladimir. He is recognised by a younger monk as the long absent Kirill. He has suffered during his {{time away from the}} monastery and <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> father superior to allow him to return. His wish is granted but he is instructed to copy out the holy scriptures fifteen times in penance. A group of Tatars stops at the monastery while travelling through the region, much to the concern of Andrei and Kirill who experienced their brutality first hand. Durochka is too simple minded to remember what the Tatars did and is fascinated by one of the soldier's shining breastplate. The group taunt and play with her, but the soldier takes a liking to her, putting his horned helmet on her head and dressing her as a bride, finally deciding to take her away with him as his eighth, and only Russian, wife. Andrei attempts to stop her from leaving, but she is determined and rides away with the Tatars. Kirill talks to Andrei {{for the first time since}} they both left the monastery, and he assures him that Durochka won't be in any danger, as harming a holy fool is considered bad luck, and she will be let go. Andrei continues his menial work of carrying large hot stones from a fire with tongs to heat water for the monastery, but drops the stone in the snow.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{this paper}} is to make it clear how and why <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} should be seen as a pragmatic fallacy which can only be properly evaluated in a context of dialogue. Included in the paper is a review of the contemporary literature on <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question that shows the gradual emergence over the past twenty years or so of the dialectical conception of this fallacy. A second aim of the paper is to investigate a number of general problems raised by the pragmatic framework. In this paper, it is shown that the methods required to analyze and evaluate criticisms of <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question are practical, and come under the heading of logical pragmatics, which is concerned with the use of propositions by an arguer to convince, persuade, or refute an-other arguer in a context of dialogue. However, certain parts of these methods also have to do with logical semantics, which is concerned with relationships between the truth and falsehood of propositions, and with logical reasoning, which is concerned with diagramming the structure of sequences of arguments. To begin with, it is clear that <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question is not a fallacy that can, at least straightforwardly, be modelled in a deductive logic of propositions. For the circular argument form, `A, therefore A', is deductively valid. The recent literature on <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question, out-lined in Section 1 below, has concentrated on examining syllogisms and other familiar forms of deductively valid argument, in an attempt to get a grasp of just what is wrong with question-begging arguments. These articles are shown in the account below to have posed the prob-lem: What is the context of argument in which <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question makes sense as a fallacy? Subsequently, one stream of the literature followed the lead of Ham-blin (1970, 1971), who advocated the formal game of dialogue as the right sort of context to model <b>begging</b> <b>the</b> question as a fallacy. But this literature became problematic when it was discovered that circular sequences of argumentation could be constructed in formal games o...|$|R

At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancÃ©, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him.

25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first <b>begs</b> <b>the</b> Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will take pleasure in watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E
