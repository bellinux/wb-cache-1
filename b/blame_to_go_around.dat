40|$|Excerpt] The {{impact of}} the market failure that has befallen the {{residential}} real estate market {{during the past two}} years is well-known and self-evident, even if the underlying causes and remedies remain in controversy. Whether the market failure was caused by “predatory lenders,” whose only interest was in “churning product” to generate fees; “speculative developers,” who saw endless demand; “greedy securitizers,” who built a financial house of cards using over-leveraged derivative insurance contracts; “clueless speculators,” who thought the market values of real estate could only increase; or “hapless regulators,” who were under-funded and held in thrall to the industries they oversaw – the bottom line is that there is plenty of <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around.</b> As a result of this market failure, primary and secondary market liquidity has slowed to a trickle, significantly reducing institutional and consumer credit for the first time since the late 1940 s...|$|E

If it {{did not begin}} then, Kim II Sung could not have [...] "started" [...] it then, either, but only at some earlier point. As we search backward for that point, we slowly grope toward the truth that civil wars do not start: they come. They originate in multiple causes, with <b>blame</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> for everyone—and <b>blame</b> enough <b>to</b> include Americans who thoughtlessly divided Korea and then reestablished the colonial government machinery and the Koreans who served it. How many Koreans might still be alive had not that happened? <b>Blame</b> enough <b>to</b> include a Soviet Union likewise unconcerned with Korea's ancient integrity and determined to [...] "build socialism" [...] whether Koreans wanted their kind of system or not. How many Koreans might still be alive had that not happened? And then, as we peer inside Korea to inquire about Korean actions that might have avoided national division and fratricidal conflict, we get a long list indeed.|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{tactical}} air {{power in the}} battle of Normandy has been fraught with both misunderstanding and contradiction. Largely ignored by the army-centric historians who have written the histories of the campaign, it has been asserted on the one hand that Allied air power was overwhelming and on the other that the system for controlling it was cumbersome and ineffective. On the face of it, at least, there would appear to be some tension between those two schools of thought. Which is more accurate? In order to examine that question, it is important to begin with an understanding of the doctrine for tactical air power—the contemporary doctrine of the time—and disputes about both that doctrine and the role of air power in the campaign. What emerges is that there is enough <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> for all parties—and enough credit. In truth, the doctrine of the time was under-developed, and this simply reflected some of the larger doctrinal weaknesses of the Western Allies’ militaries...|$|E
40|$|This case {{highlights}} accounting manipulations, {{in areas}} of reserves and lease accounting, as viewed through SEC documents related to the KPMG audit failure of Xerox 1997 - 2000. Referenced online citations provide flexibility {{in the use of}} the case. We present the original causes and eventual consequences, and update for enacted changes in auditing standards and authoritative guidance, including current efforts to address lease accounting in the IFRS and US GAAP convergence. A set of questions are included; teaching notes contain the actual outcome of the case. The case is appropriate for anyone who wishes to review a well-documented audit failure. CASE OVERVIEW This audit failure case reviews readily available evidence from SEC Administrative Proceedings and Litigation Releases that indicate there was plenty of <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> for the parties: Xerox and KPMG. The case events from 1997 - 2000 are viewed in the actual historical context as well as recent changes in authoritative pronouncements and Sarbanes Oxley. The eventual outcome in terms of penalties to the company, audit firm, and all related parties are discussed, as the investor lawsuit finally settled in 2008. The evolution of accounting and auditing guidance updates related matters, and a discussion illustrates how inherent complexities within the situation enabled the fraud. The case is set forth with questions proposed by each section, and concludes with a set of teaching notes with answers for interested readers to review the context of this fraud...|$|E
40|$|The {{past few}} days in Taiwan have been marked by a mixture of joy and trepidation: joy at Obama’s {{unprecedented}} electoral triumph {{and what it means}} for the achievement of justice and racial harmony (dare we hope that one day a Hakka or Aborigine may become President of Taiwan?), but also trepidation over the state of Taiwan’s democratic system. Violent street protests accompanying the visit of Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Chairman Chen Yunlin 陳雲林 have shocked and dismayed the nation, prompting the normally mild-mannered President Ma Ying-jeou 馬英九 to pound the podium in rage while issuing a strong rebuke to those involved. There is ample <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> for both the government and opposition, and especially for those opportunistic DPP politicians and other public figures who attempted to use the protests against Chen’s visit to gain greater notoriety and/or enhance their prospects for winning future elections. At the same time, however, simply labeling the protests as the work of some sort of violent rabble overlooks the fact that many participants were law-abiding citizens deeply concerned about their country’s future. To keep things in perspective, the pattern of largely peaceful protests dissolving into violence following the infiltration of gangsters and other anti-social elements also occurred following the Presidential Election of 2004 and the Depose Bian (倒扁) movement of 2006, the main difference being that the leaders of these protests were mostly members of the pan-blue camp or their sympathizers...|$|E

40|$|The federal {{government}} still refuses {{to take any}} responsibility for the disaster in Iraq, writes Brett Bowden THE Australian government’s ill-considered attack on Democrat US presidential hopeful Senator Barack Obama was remarkable {{for a number of}} reasons. The most obvious being the fact that it happened. No possible good can come from it and the real harm might not be known until it returns to haunt a future government. Perhaps more disturbing, though, are the disingenuous justifications being offered in defence of the attack and the simultaneous deflection of blame for the calamitous state of affairs in Iraq. If elected president, Obama has pledged to conditionally withdraw all US combat troops from Iraq. He hopes he won’t have to wait that long as he is introducing binding legislation that he hopes will force President George W. Bush to do the same by March 2008. The tactic is unlikely to work, but it will have its supporters. If Obama is lucky enough {{to make it to the}} White House, the Iraq mess will still be waiting for him. His announcement is noteworthy for the fact he is only talking about combat troops. The real intrigue lies in what else he has in mind. Could it be any worse than the current directionless policy? The key elements of the Obama plan are not too far removed from those proposed by the bipartisan Iraq Survey Group: de-escalation of the war, tough benchmarks for the Iraqi government, increased security, and economic and infrastructure reconstruction. He is explicitly not talking about a precipitous, unconditional withdrawal. Prime Minister John Howard is concerned that even talking about deadlines and exit strategies emboldens al-Qaeda in Iraq and weakens the US in the eyes of the world. Foreign Minister Alexander Downer fears that a precipitous withdrawal will leave a vacuum waiting to be filled by insurgents and terrorists. They accuse Obama of failing to grasp the intricacies of Iraq and just how much is at stake there. For all the concerns over Obama’s lack of foreign policy experience, it appears as though he has the edge over Howard and Downer when it comes to the realities of Iraq. He knows the war is going badly no matter which way you try to spin it. He knows more than 3100 US troops have died in a war he opposed from the outset. He knows there is no security, there is minimal government and there are few prospects of achieving any of these by staying the course. And he knows he’s not alone in his thinking. Howard and Downer, on the other hand, appear to be living in a bubble. They speak about the risk of destabilising and destroying Iraq in the future tense as though they are oblivious to the daily carnage going on there. By their reckoning, should such a terrible thing befall Iraq the fault lies not at the feet of the Bush administration and its coalition partners, but with Obama and the Democrats. No doubt there is enough <b>blame</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>around</b> to sheet some of it home to Kevin Rudd and the Labor Party as well. The problem with Howard and Downer’s reasoning on this issue is that it is so clearly wrong. There was no al-Qaeda in Iraq prior to the invasion and occupation. There was no link between Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda terrorist network and the regime of Saddam Hussein. The turmoil in Iraq is generated by the presence of coalition troops insurgents and foreign terrorists have materialised since the invasion. This much has been widely conceded by all but the most diehard supporters of the war in Washington and, apparently, Canberra. If Howard really was running al-Qaeda in Iraq he would be wise to put a circle around March 2008, and 20 January 2009, the date of inauguration of the next US president. Whether it’s Senator Obama or another Democrat or even a Republican like former New York City Mayor Rudi Giuliani entering the White House the odds are that things will change in Iraq. Whether the change is for the better or worse is difficult to predict. Although imagining how things could get much worse than they are now is not easy. It is high time the Howard government took its share of the blame and accepted some of the responsibility for the mess. • Brett Bowden is a Research Fellow in the Centre for International Governance & Justice at the Australian National University.
