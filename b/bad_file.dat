40|$|Abstract. In {{unstructured}} peer-to-peer networks, as in real life, a good neighbourhood is {{not only}} crucial for a peaceful sleep, but also for an exchange of important gossips and for finding good service. This work investigates self-protection mechanisms based on reputation in unstructured peer-to-peer networks. We use a simple approach where each peer rates the service provided by others and exchanges the collected knowledge with its direct neighbours. Based on reputation values peers manage their connections to direct neighbours and make service provisioning decisions. To quantify the impact of our proposed scheme, we implement a simple protocol in a fully unstructured peer-to-peer network. We show that free riding {{and the impact of}} malicious peers trying to poison the network with <b>bad</b> <b>files</b> is minimised. Furthermore, we show that a good neighbourhood protects peers from selecting <b>bad</b> <b>files,</b> while free riders suffer in a bad neighbourhood of malicious peers. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) {{file sharing}} networks, {{it is common}} practice to manage each peer using reputation systems. A reputation system systematically tracks the reputation of each peer and punishes peers for malicious behaviors (like uploading <b>bad</b> <b>file,</b> or virus, etc). However, current reputation systems could hurt the normal peers, since they might occasionally make mistakes. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce forgiveness mechanism into the EigenTrust reputation system to reduce such malicious treatments and give them opportunities to gain reputation back. Particularly, we take four motivations (the severity of current offence, the frequency of offences, the compensation and the reciprocity of the offender) into consideration to measure forgiveness. The simulation work shows that the forgiveness model can repair the direct trust breakdown caused by unintentional mistakes and lead to less invalid downloads, which improves the performance of P 2 P file sharing systems...|$|E
40|$|An {{attacker}} who {{has gained}} access to a computer may want to upload or modify configuration files, etc., and run arbitrary programs of his choice. We can severely restrict {{the power of the}} attacker by having a white-list of approved file checksums and preventing the kernel from loading loading any file with a bad checksum. The check may be placed in the kernel, but that requires a kernel that is prepared for it. The check may also be placed in a hypervisor which intercepts and prevents the kernel from loading a <b>bad</b> <b>file.</b> We describe the implementation of and give performance results for two systems. In one the checksumming, or integrity measurement, and decision is performed by the hypervisor instead of the OS. In the other only the final integrity decision is done in the hypervisor. By moving the integrity check out from the VM kernel it becomes harder for the intruder to bypass the check. We conclude that it is technically possible to put file integrity control into the hypervisor, both for kernels without and with pre-compiled support for integrity measurement. TESPEVSCN...|$|E

This common interface {{makes it possible to}} interact with Rucio using a lot of different programming languages, including Javascript.

They can search for particular datasets and get details about its metadata and available replicas and easily create rules to create new replicas and delete them if not needed anymore. On the other hand it is possible for site admins to restrict transfers to their site by setting quotas and manually approve transfers. Besides R 2 D 2 additional features include transfer backlog monitoring for shifters, group space monitoring for group admins, a <b>bad</b> <b>file</b> replica summary and more.

40|$|Abstract—Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{architectures}} {{are gaining}} popularity and importance for applications ranging from massive-scale Internet content delivery to mobile social networks. Such P 2 P systems must provide directory services for locating peers with the desired content and services. These directory services are themselves decentralized, such as with distributed hash tables (DHTs), which allow for efficient locating of objects without any centralized directory. Being a distributed system over a diverse set of untrusted nodes, however, such directory services must be resilient to adversarial behavior. Otherwise, the entire P 2 P {{system can be}} crippled by manipulating or simply denying access to resources. We propose Repu-tation for Directory Services (ReDS), a framework for using reputation management to enhance the security of finding information in distributed systems. While previous reputation systems have addressed several specific applications of P 2 P networks (e. g., by iden-tifying peers who share <b>bad</b> <b>files),</b> directory services form the backbone of P 2 P systems and have unique properties with respect to reputation that make them worth investigating. In this extended abstract, we motivate our investigation of ReDS and describe preliminary results that show its effectiveness in the Salsa P 2 P system.

40|$|After {{decades of}} {{lobbying}} to “get tough” on bankruptcy repeat filers, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA). The Bankruptcy Code now {{requires that the}} automatic stay, which prevents creditors from pursuing the property of bankruptcy debtors, expires after thirty days for petitioners who file for bankruptcy within one year of a previously failed petition. Debtors can file a motion to extend the stay, {{but there is a}} presumption of a <b>bad</b> faith <b>filing,</b> only overcome if a debtor can show there has been a “substantial change in his or her financial or personal affairs” that makes discharge likely. Despite the Congressional focus on repeat filers, there has been little scholarly study of them. This study uses a national random sample to analyze post-BAPCPA repeat filers. I find that even post-BAPCPA, there is a significant number of repeat filers. Indeed, 14. 7 % of all bankruptcy petitions filed in 2007 were repeaters, and of Chapter 13 repeat filers, 69 % filed a new petition within a year after a previous petition’s failure. Further, the strict new Congressional rules for repeat filers have effected little practical change: 98 % of petitions to extend the automatic stay are granted, even though the majority of repeat filers provide no evidence of changed circumstances. Based on these findings, interviews with bankruptcy judges, trustees, and lawyers, and analysis of relevant case law, I explain why BAPCPA’s crack-down on repeat filers has effected little practical change, and argue that effectively tackling the refiler problem will likely require very different tactics than those employed in BAPCPA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{investigates the}} {{application}} of semiconductor file memory as a disk cache to fill part of the access time gap between disk and main memory. Leveraging DRAM cell technology, block-addressable file memory can lower the overall cost per bit of conventional DRAM due to relaxed design constraints and <b>bad</b> block management. <b>File</b> memory could function in a distinct memory hierarchy stage known as extended storage, which was common in legacy mainframes but should be revisited as a cost-competitive means of improving the performance of modern systems. We have modified the Linux 2. 4. 18 operating system kernel to emulate file memory in a reserved region of system memory. This experimental model evaluates file memory as an extended storage hierarchy stage that is independent {{of the effects of}} the CPU caches and the variablesized page cache. In an analysis of chip cost and performance, if file memory can be at least 27 % less expensive than DRAM and is up to three times slower, it can be used as extended storage to improve performance for typical server loads.

40|$|In {{a report}} {{provided}} by the European Chamber of Commerce in China, the problem with bad faith trade mark applications was highlighted. The report concluded that the current application of the law, combined with the procedural background constitutes an incentive rather than a deterrent for bad faith trade mark applications in China. The issue originates in Chinese defrauders conducting research among foreign companies {{with the intent of}} un- lawfully registering their trade marks in China. Since China apply a ‘first-to-file’ system, un- registered trade marks enjoy very little protection. Companies, and foreign companies in particular, are therefor often forced to rebuy their trade marks from the bad faith filers. The Chinese government are, however, not blind to this issue and recently, a draft amend- ment to the Trademark Law was released, partly aimed at obstructing <b>bad</b> faith <b>filing.</b> In remains, however, to be seen whether the amendment will have any great impact on the is- sue of bad faith trade mark applications. The purpose of this thesis is to ascertain the core to the problem with bad faith trade mark applications and to establish whether the new amendment provides a solution to this issue. The thesis uses a comparative method by studying the EU approach to bad faith trade mark applications and to put it in relation to the system used in China. The analyse demonstrates that the core to the problem with bad faith trade mark applica- tions in China fall into several aspects significant to the Chinese trade mark system, primar- ily through the construction of the trade mark application process and the ineffective appa- ratus operating the Chinese judicial system. Although the new amendment is a great leap in Chinese trade mark development, it does not sufficiently address the issue with bad faith trade mark applications...|$|R

40|$|In the text, I {{argue that}} {{dismissal}} from court {{is equivalent to}} liquidation for most firms. To verify this, I randomly selected 100 dismissed firms that filed for Chapter 11 and examined {{the reasons for their}} dismissal using court documents on the U. S. Court’s Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system. In general, the reasons for dismissal can be sorted into four categories: (1) the debtor failed to follow court procedure, such as failure to file specific documents, failure to hire counsel, or failure to show up in court; (2) the debtor is deemed to have abused the system by <b>filing</b> in <b>bad</b> faith, or <b>filing</b> repeatedly without making efforts to repay its debts; (3) there is no possibility that the debtor can successfully reorganize; (4) the debtor has reached a settlement with its creditors and therefore no longer needs bankruptcy protection. Unsurprisingly, the reason for dismissal varies considerably depending on which party files the motion. When the trustee or court files the motion for dismissal, it is typically because the debtor did not obey a court order of some sort, but in a significant minority of cases it is also because there is no hope of reorganization. When a creditor files a successful motion the reason for dismissal is often because the debtor has abused the bankruptcy system in some way. Debtor-filed motions, however, are nearly equally split between debtors who have no hope of reorganizing, and who wish to leave bankruptcy and simply liquidate without incurring further legal fees, and debtors who hav...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{encompasses}} a super helical memory system's design, 'Boolean logic & image-logic' as a theoretical {{concept of an}} invention-model to 'store time-data' in terms of anticipating the best memory location ever for data/time. A waterfall effect is deemed to assist the process of potential-difference output-switch into diverse logic states in quantum dot computational methods via utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs). A 'quantum confinement' is thus derived for a flow of particles in a categorized quantum well substrate with a normalized capacitance rectifying high B-field flux into electromagnetic induction. Multi-access of coherent sequences of 'qubit addressing' is gained in any magnitude as pre-defined for the orientation of array displacement. Briefly, Gaussian curvature of k(k< 0) for greater CCNT diameters, space-time continuum is folded by chance for the particle. This benefits from Maxwell-Lorentz theory in Minkowski's space-time viewpoint alike to crystal oscillators for precise data timing purposes and radar systems e. g., time varying self-clocking devices in diverse geographic locations. This application could also be optional for data depository versus extraction, in the best supercomputer system's locations, autonomously. For best performance in minimizing current limiting mechanisms including electromigration, a multilevel metallization and implant process forming elevated sources/drains for the circuit's staircase pyramidal construction, is discussed accordingly.

40|$|While the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) {{model has}} become the de facto {{standard}} for preservation archives, the design and implementation of a repository or reliable long term archive lacks adopted technology standards and design best practices. This paper is intended to provide guidelines and recommendations for standards implementation and best practices for a viable, cost effective, and reliable repository and preservation storage architecture. This architecture {{is based on a}} combination of open source and commercially supported software and systems. Although several operating systems currently exist, the logical choice for an archive storage system is an open source operating system, of which there are two primary choices today: Linux and Solaris. There are many varieties of Linux available and supported by nearly all system manufacturers. The Solaris Operating System is freely downloadable from Sun Microsystems. Many variants of the Linux operating system and Solaris are available with support on a fee base. The Hierarchical Storage System, or HSM, is a key software element of the archive. The HSM provides one of the key components that contributes to reliability by through data integrity checks and automated file migration. The HSM provides the ability to automate making multiples copies of files, auditing files for errors based on checksum, rejecting <b>bad</b> copies of <b>files</b> and making new copies {{based on the results of}} those audits. The HSM also provides the ability to read in an older file format and write-out a new file format thus migrating the format and application information required to ensure archival integrity of the stored content. The automation of these functions provides for improved performance and reduced operating costs. The Sun StorageTek Storage Archive Manager (SAM) software provides the core functionality of the recommended preservation storage architecture. SAM provides policy based data classification and placement across a multitude of storage devices from high speed disk, low cost disk, or tape. SAM also simplifies data management by providing centralized metadata. SAM is a self-protecting file system with continuous file integrity checks. The digital content archive provides the content repository (or digital vault) within Sun&# 39;s award-winning Digital Asset Management Reference Architecture (DAM RA). DAM RA enables digital workflow and the content archive provides permanent access to digital content files. With SAM software, the files are stored, tracked, and retrieved based on the archival requirements. Files are seamlessly and transparently available to other services. SAM software creates virtually limitless capacity. Its scalability allows for continual growth throughout the archive with support for all data types. The policy based SAM software stores and manages data for compliance and non-compliance archives using a tiered storage approach with integrated disk and tape into a seamless storage solution, SAM software simplifies the archive storage. Allows you to automate data management policies based on file attributes. You can manage data according to the storage and access requirements of each user on the system and decide how data is grouped, copied, and accessed based on the needs of the application and the users. Helps you maximize return on investments by storing data on the media type appropriate for the life cycle of the data and simplifying system administration. Sun Open Storage solutions provide the systems built with an open architecture using industry-standard hardware and opensource software. This open architecture allows the most flexible selection of the hardware and software components to best meet storage requirements. In a closed storage environment, all the components of a closed system must come from the vendor. Customers are locked into buying disk drives, controllers, and proprietary software features from a single vendor at premium prices and typically cannot add their own drives or software to improve functionality or reduce the cost of the closed system. Long term preservation is directly dependant on the long term viability of the software components. Open source solutions offer the most viable long term option with open access and community based development and support...|$|R
