25|$|The LCMS has a {{modified}} form of congregational polity.

25|$|A {{manifestation of}} the Sacred in profane space is, by definition, an example of {{something}} breaking through from one plane of existence to another. Therefore, the initial hierophany that establishes the Center must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> at which there is contact between different planes—this, Eliade argues, explains the frequent mythical imagery of a Cosmic Tree or Pillar joining Heaven, Earth, and the underworld.|$|E
25|$|The optimal {{shape for}} {{the tip of}} a {{lightning}} rod has been controversial since the 18th century.

25|$|The {{landmark}} of this sighting {{is generally}} reckoned to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> lying about half-way between the present-day towns of Orbost and Mallacoota on the south-eastern {{coast of the}} state of Victoria. A survey done in 1843 ignored or overlooked Cook's earlier naming of the point, giving it the name Cape Everard. On the 200th anniversary of the sighting, the name was officially changed back to Point Hicks.|$|E

In each stage there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> before the finish, where the riders would be timed until they crossed the line. The times from each stage would then be added together for each rider to determine {{the leader of the}} classification. The leader of the classification was awarded a blue jersey. The classification was run each year since its addition until 2005. The last winner of the classification was Stefano Zanini. Fabrizio Guidi won the classification three times, the most by any rider. Guidi won the classification in 1996, 1999, and 2000.|$|E
25|$|The {{signing of}} Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko {{in the summer}} of 2006 for a club record fee would also prove to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of {{contention}} between Mourinho and Abramovich. Shevchenko, {{at the time of his}} signing, was one of the most highly regarded strikers in Europe during his time with Milan, where he won the Champions League, Scudetto and Ballon d'Or awards in his seven years in Milan. Chelsea had attempted to sign Shevchenko in the preceding two years but Milan rebuffed Abramovich's interest in him. Shevchenko's first season at Chelsea was viewed as a major disappointment by the Chelsea fans, as he only scored four league goals and 14 in all competitions.|$|E
25|$|In the Upper School, ages 16 to 18, {{responsibility}} {{is available through}} a hierarchy of positions. This starts with Captains of Sports, Service and House. In the case of Captains, no peer voting takes place but rather a pupil is elected by the Head of the respective department. This way {{it is not uncommon}} for some people to be re-elected as Captain for multiple terms depending on whether or not anybody else of suitable stance is available. Captains of Sport such as the Football or Rugby Captain are chosen by the Head of that sport and will help the Head organise teams for practice and preparation off the field of play as well as on it. Similarly Captains of Service will aid the Head of Service organise training sessions and <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> of contact for the rest of the members.|$|E

25|$|The forbidding of shaving {{the corners}} of the head was {{interpreted}} by the Mishnah as prohibiting the hair at the temples being cut so that the hairline was a straight line from behind the ears to the forehead; thus it was deemed necessary to retain sidelocks, leading {{to the development of a}} distinctly Jewish form of sidelock, known as payot. As for the beard, more complicated views arose; {{the corners of}} the beard were explained to refer to five extremities in the Talmud. There are many opinions in mediaeval scholars as to what these five points are. For example, it may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> on each cheek near the temples, a point at the end of the cheek bone towards the centre of the face, and the point of the chin. Or it may be 2 on the mustache, 2 somewhere on the cheek and one on the point on the chin. As a result, Shulchan Aruch prohibits the shaving of the entire beard and mustache.|$|E
500|$|The {{electron}} has {{no known}} substructure {{and it is}} assumed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> particle with a point charge and no spatial extent. In classical physics, the angular momentum and magnetic moment of an object depend upon its physical dimensions. Hence, {{the concept of a}} dimensionless electron possessing these properties contrasts to experimental observations in Penning traps which point to finite non-zero radius of the electron. A possible explanation of this paradoxical situation is given below in the [...] "Virtual particles" [...] subsection by taking into consideration the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.|$|E
