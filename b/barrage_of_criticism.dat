25|$|The {{incident}} {{sparked a}} high level of discussion on Internet forums where commentators were split over whether the incident was playful fun or actual assault. In many forums there was overwhelming censure of the Big Brother series itself, with many calling for the show to be cancelled. Subsequent to the controversy the program's ratings showed an increase, however this proved to be only a temporary boost; the show's regular ratings did not show a significant overall increase and the Daily Show continued to rate significantly lower than its competitors on other commercial networks. Network Ten indicated that they planned to continue producing the series despite the <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism.</b> In the wake of the controversy, several former housemates came forward with descriptions of audition processes that require potential housemates to parade nude, and the frequent occurrence of sexual acts in the house similar to the one that the two housemates were ejected for.|$|E

Because if you say the king cannot be criticised, {{it means that the}} king is not human", he claimed. [...] "If the king can do no wrong, it is akin to looking down upon him because the king is not being treated as a human being. But the king can do wrong." [...] A widespread <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> resulted, followed by a sharp rise in lèse-majesté prosecutions.

During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland, Henry {{was involved in a}} controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009. With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time, he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner. This sparked a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> against the Frenchman, while national team coach Raymond Domenech and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended him. The Football Association of Ireland lodged a formal complaint with FIFA, seeking a replay of the game, which FIFA declined. Henry said that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident, but maintained that he was not a [...] "cheat"; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay, he stated that [...] "the fairest solution would be to replay the game". FIFA President Sepp Blatter described the incident as [...] "blatant unfair play" [...] and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future, and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee. Blatter also said Henry told him that his family had been threatened {{in the aftermath of the}} incident. In January 2010, FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Euro crisis in 2009 a succession of one “last chance” meeting after another has exposed deep rifts over the policies to implement in order to ensure the permanence of the Euro. From austerity measures to curb swelling public deficits put forward by Germany to European growth plans and solidarity mechanisms suggested by France disagreements have been deep and infighting widespread. The agreement of a new European treaty creating a tight fiscal pact, at the European Summit on 7 December 2011, brought these tensions to the fore, leading to a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> in France against Germany imposing its austerity agenda on the whole Eurozone. This article seeks to analyse how Germany has been portrayed in the French political discourse by focusing on the vast array of reactions to this new treaty. It will show a discursive struggle between three discourse types representing Germany as an evil force intent on dominating Europe, a virtuous ant unwittingly dominating Europe and an economic giant but a political dwarf. These discourses will show how Germany is trapped into past representations and how they reveal far more about France’s self-image in relation to its neighbour than about Germany itself...|$|R

The contract included: resolution of Theresa’s early affect confusion; how archaic conflicts effected conflicts in her {{relationships in the}} present; and to “find alternative ways of stabilizing herself other than raging or demanding attention for her helplessness”. What began as few memories in Theresa’s childhood progressed to more awareness within the therapeutic relationship. The methods of a phenomenological and historical inquiry, attunement to Theresa’s affect, her developmental levels, and relational needs, {{and the process of}} involvement that included acknowledgement, validation, and normalization of her attempts to resolve conflicts in her childhood were evident in Richard’s interactions with Theresa. A few illustrations of the methods of Inquiry, Attunement, and Involvement that appear in this case study follow. You may notice that under inquiry I have included “here-and-now ” inquiry since this is a critical component in Integrative Psychotherapy. In his responses, Richard uses the term “relational inquiry”. Inquiry – Phenomenological inquiry-“I regularly inquired about her body sensations and what she was feeling” Historical inquiry- “She was now able to talk about her teen-age years [...] ”; “With each exploration she began to remember humiliating school situations and eventually her mother’s constant <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> <b>criticisms</b> and ridiculing comments”...|$|R

Social Security is facing a financial crisis as early as 2016. The Social Security Trust Fund will not delay the onset of Social Security's problems. The critics are equally mistaken about individual accounts. Individual accounts do not involve simply switching investments from bonds to stocks.

40|$|Corporate {{responsibility}} {{is a popular}} buzzword in the news today, but the concept itself is hardly novel. In response to a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> public <b>criticism,</b> the Ford Motor Company commissioned and published a study of its own activities immediately before and during WWII. The study explores the multifaceted and complicated relationship between the American parent company in Dearborn and the German subsidiary in Cologne. The report 2 ̆ 7 s findings, however, are largely inconclusive and in some cases, dangerously misleading. This thesis will seek to establish how, {{with the consent of}} Dearborn, the German Ford company became an arsenal for Hitler 2 ̆ 7 s march on Europe. This thesis will clarify these murky relationships, and picking up where the Ford internal investigation left off, place them within a framework of corporate accountability and complicity. Ford 2 ̆ 7 s development as a transnational entity provides a perfect subject of study to embark on such a project. Many of the major themes of post-World War I Europe – economic stagnation, nationalism, coping with the aftermath of a devastating conflict, and eventually, the rise of authoritarian states – are all present in Ford 2 ̆ 7 s German story, and their consequences not only resonate within the fields of American, European, and business history but also that of corporate responsibility. The lessons are still relevant today...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{interviews}} with salmon farmers exploring their {{decision as to whether}} to adopt organic production methods. Organic salmon farming has the potential to considerably reduce the social, environmental and economic risks associated with salmon farming. Salmon farming is an industry subjected to intense scrutiny and is highly controversial. The combination of these two factors was expected to reveal the use of environmental accounting in evaluating this potentially difficult, expensive strategic decision, responding to the <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> public <b>criticism,</b> driven by changing environmental regulations and a potential value shift by key actors. However, interviews revealed that going organic was regarded as a normal agricultural decision, largely based on price forecasts. The shift to organic was relatively easy, unproblematic and not too expensive. The environmental pressure groups campaigns had very little impact on this decision and it was not subjected to systematic accounting evaluation. The interviews described a sector exhibiting many of the characteristics of Beck's Risk Society thesis (1992, 1995, 1996). Decision makers' risk perception is identified as important for considering what factors are thought to be legitimate/illegitimate and powerful/weak in the decision making process. Unless risks are considered 'real' by the decision makers then the associated costs/benefits of doing or not doing something are not going to figure in the decision heuristics, regardless of the nature of their calculation. Environmental accounting could play a part, not necessarily at the individual farm level, but as part of a reflexive process in reconstructing the underlying knowledge of the social, environmental and economic risks of salmon farming as a whole...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{notion of}} Western liberal democracy has {{in recent years}} been met with a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> negative <b>criticism.</b> Liberal democracy from both a minimalist and substantive position appears to be backsliding, and once more falling into what Samuel P. Huntington (1991) termed a reverse wave. The analysis which Huntington (1991) presented ended in {{an era in which}} liberal democracy once more dominated the political landscape for a third consecutive wave, without any indication {{that it was going to}} relapse. In light of Huntington’s (1991) closure, this study has attempted to continue with his analysis and point to the possible existence of a third wave reversal. In order to do so, this study has meticulously used the same methodological approach as Huntington (1991) did to highlight previous wave reversals. This has been done by critically discussing, with examples, the existence of those factors that lead to a global decline in liberal democratic practice as prescribed by Huntington (1991). This study attempts not only to point to the possible existence of a third wave reversal, but also to explain the contextual reasons behind such an increase in anti-democratic rhetoric. The application of Huntington’s (1991) wave theory does not explain the subjective reasoning behind the contemporary deterioration of liberal democracy, as his factors leading to wave reversals may be too pragmatic for this study. It is in this light that a second argument as brought forward by Huntington in 1996, serves as the contextual layer for the decrease in democratic support as it provides the basis for the application of a critical discourse analysis. Therefore, this study serves not only as an investigation of the possible existence of a current third wave reversal, but also as an analysis into the discursive nature of liberal democracy’s historical and future trajectory...|$|R

This image precipitated a <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> complaint and <b>criticism</b> surrounding issues <b>of</b> race, gender violence and freedom of speech. The cartoon represents a critical geopolitical moment through which to analyse the entrenchment of democracy in South Africa.

Problems with colonial legacies and the strategic depoliticisation of race are highlighted as key concerns for post-apartheid nation-building. Opposition to the cartoonist's freedom to criticise political leaders highlights the continued deployment of race in political ways while reminding us of the transitional challenges facing the state and the African National Congress party. The cartoon also provides a moment to address threats to the independence of the judiciary from political bodies through inflammatory and intimidatory rhetoric and protest. Questions over gender equality and security are highlighted through the rape motif of the image and responses to the cartoon. It is argued that the challenges made visible through this cartoon are critical to the consolidation of democracy in South Africa. The potential for political cartoons to be used by political geographers to engage with issues beyond the discipline's geographic ‘core’ is also stressed...|$|R
