One possible method to develop leaders {{is the use}} of experiential techniques based on <b>business</b> <b>games.</b> The objective of this article was to identify, based on literature, <b>business</b> <b>games</b> used in leadership development and to examine how they contribute to the qualification of the leaders. In particular, the article analyzes <b>business</b> <b>games</b> in which elements of leadership development were present as part of the computer model (simulator). The article describes the goals of the games, their pedagogical and technical features, their relation to leadership theories, and their effectiveness in leadership development. The methodology used was systematic review conducted in SCOPUS, ISI, and BKL (Bernie Keys Library) databases. The review identified five games that met the criteria and objectives of this research. This study shows that using <b>business</b> <b>games</b> for leadership development is still a hard task. It points up some problems and difficulties in this task and suggests ways to develop more effective methods for leadership development with <b>business</b> <b>games.</b> Keyword...|$|R

How to overcome it,--that was the thing. Suppose he did meet with Dede out in the hills; and suppose, by some lucky stroke of fate, he should manage to be riding alongside of her; then that whirl of Bob's would be most disconcerting and embarrassing.

That was to say, whether it was a sack of potatoes, a grand piano, or a seven-passenger touring car, it came into being only by the performance of work. Where the bunco came in was in the distribution of these things after labor had created them. He failed to see the horny-handed sons of toil enjoying grand pianos or riding in automobiles. How this came about was explained by the bunco. By tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands men sat up nights and schemed how they could get between the workers and the things the workers produced. These schemers were the business men. When they got between the worker and his product, they took a whack out of it for themselves The size of the whack was determined by no rule of equity; but by their own strength and swinishness. It was always a case of [...] "all the traffic can bear." [...] He saw all men in the <b>business</b> <b>game</b> doing this.|$|E
