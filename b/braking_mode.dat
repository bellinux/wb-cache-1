The {{objective of this}} paper is developing the methods for assessment of <b>braking</b> <b>modes</b> of cuts under conditions of fuzziness of their rolling properties, as well as selecting the permissible starting speed range of cuts from retardant positions. As a criterion for assessing the modes of target control of cut rolling speed, it was proposed to use an average gap size on a classification track at the established norms of probable exceeding of permissible speed of cars collision and their stop in retarders. As a criterion for evaluating the modes of interval control of cuts rolling speed, using the risk of their non-separation on the switches was proposed. Using the simulation modeling and mathematical statistics, the configuration of the range of permissible speed of cuts coming out from retardant positions has been set.

One of the main tasks of the indicated systems is the assurance of cuts reliable separation at all elements of their rolling route to the classification track.

The purpose {{of this research is}} to find the optimal <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of control cut of design group. Methodology. In order to achieve the purpose is offered to use the direct search methods in the work, namely the Box complex method.

The control strategy of type one is achieved by controlling the change rates of clutch hold-down and motor braking forces. The control strategy of type two is achieved by simultaneously changing the target braking torque during different mode switch stages and controlling the motor to participate in active coordination control. Finally, the torque coordination control strategy is modeled in MATLAB/Simulink, and the results show that the proposed control strategy has a good effect in reducing the braking torque fluctuation and vehicle shocks during <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> switches...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aerodynamic brake is a {{new type}} of non-adhesion <b>brake</b> <b>mode</b> used to {{high-speed}} train brake by unfolding the brake panel {{on the roof of the}} high speed train to increase aerodynamic resistance. This <b>brake</b> <b>mode</b> is effective especially in the condition of high speed.

The opening and closing mechanism mainly include three components of guide mechanism, the center of rotation and drive mechanism. The guide mechanism as auxiliary orientation is a functional unit of the bearing parts used to improve the movement and load conditions of the brake panel. The center of rotation is the key component to support the brake panel and transmit the braking force. The drive mechanism, the power source of the opening and closing mechanism, is designed to drive the brake panel up and down in the reciprocating motion.

As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different <b>modes</b> of <b>braking.</b> At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and braking distance size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and braking distances were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and braking distances amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different <b>braking</b> <b>modes.</b> Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched.

Therefore, at _ 1 = _ 2, {{the position of}} the U line in the domain of permissible braking modes is unchanged. We take into account the fact that the direction of the interval value increases along the line U and depends only on the position of separating points, and the length of the middle cut based on the position of optimal <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> remains unchanged too. Thus, if it is known that <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> v_ 2 is the optimal one, the breaking modes change of the first and last cuts {{in such a way that}} _ 1 = _ 2 and the optimal <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> will remain at the same point v_ 2.|$|E

Defining and {{analysis}} of the probabilistic and spectral characteristics of random current in regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> of DC electric rolling stock are observed in this paper. Methodology. The elements and methods of the probability theory (particularly the theory of stationary and non-stationary processes) and methods of the sampling theory are used for processing of the regenerated current data arrays by PC. Findings. The regenerated current records are obtained from the locomotives and trains in Ukraine railways and trams in Poland. It was established that the current has uninterrupted and the jumping variations in time (especially in trams). For the random current in the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> the functions of mathematical expectation, dispersion and standard deviation are calculated. Histograms, probabilistic characteristics and correlation functions are calculated and plotted down for this current too. It was established that the current of the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>mode</b> can be considered like the stationary and non-ergodic process. The spectral analysis of these records and “tail part” of the correlation function found weak periodical (or low-frequency) components which are known like an interharmonic. Originality. Firstly, the theory of non-stationary random processes was adapted for the analysis of the recuperated current which has uninterrupted and the jumping variations in time. Secondly, the presence of interharmonics in the stochastic process of regenerated current was defined for the first time. And finally, the patterns of temporal changes of the correlation current function are defined too. This allows to reasonably apply the correlation functions method in the identification of the electric traction system devices. Practical value.
