50|$|Metallurgical {{examination}} of the <b>brake</b> <b>rod</b> showed that it failed because of fatigue. There were many secondary cracks around the fracture surface which were detected by magnetic particle technique. To investigate fatigue failure {{it was necessary to}} determine the inservice loading of the <b>brake</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R

50|$|All {{electrical}} and mechanical {{components of the}} winding system were thoroughly investigated to find the cause of accident. Electrical systems {{were found to be}} working as supply of compressed air was available above the servo cylinder. However the brake shoes were about 3 mm clear of the brake paths as the vertical <b>brake</b> <b>rod</b> had broken into two pieces. So the investigation concentrated on the failure of the <b>brake</b> <b>rod.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{chemical}} analysis {{proved that the}} material of the <b>brake</b> <b>rod</b> (carbon steel with the designation En8, conforming to British Standard 970:1947) was within the specification demanded {{at the time of}} manufacture.|$|R
50|$|The major {{difference}} {{was in the}} <b>brake</b> <b>rods</b> of which there were two inboard of the wheels. The earlier SO and 562 locomotives had four pull-rods, the outer ones being outside of the wheels.|$|R
50|$|Abici {{bikes are}} made in eight colors based on car colors of the 1950s, has a Brooks England saddle with copper rivets, metal {{mudguards}} and a chrome <b>brake</b> <b>rod.</b> The light-weight bikes are made from aluminum, carbon fiber and titanium.|$|R
60|$|When {{the level}} roadway was gained once more they made {{good time to}} Carwood, and there called on the {{blacksmith}} to repair the broken <b>brake</b> <b>rod.</b> While waiting they ran into Tom Bender, and the boy was very anxious to know all about the lost aeroplane.|$|R
50|$|Though made {{obsolete}} by {{the introduction}} of the duck brake, coaster <b>brake,</b> and <b>rod</b> <b>brake,</b> spoon brakes continued {{to be used in the}} West supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s, and on children's bicycles until the 1950s. In the developing world, they were manufactured until much more recently.|$|R
60|$|Not {{without much}} {{difficulty}} did the three youths {{manage to get}} the ropes disentangled from the rear wheels and the back axle. It was found {{that one of the}} hooks had gone into a tire, causing a blow-out that, in the general excitement, nobody had noticed. But otherwise everything seemed to be all right, apart, of course, from the broken <b>brake</b> <b>rod,</b> and the boys were thankful.|$|R

50|$|Mechanical brake {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} brake shoes applied to the underside of the brake paths by the action of the compressed spring nest operating through a system of levers. Force is transmitted from the spring nest to main lever through a 2 in diameter steel rod 8 ft long. This vertical <b>brake</b> <b>rod</b> is always in tension as the springs are compressed. It also {{consists of}} a servospring mechanism which uses the compressed air to counteract the spring force to move the brake shoes away.|$|R
50|$|Later {{systems were}} {{fitted with a}} sliding {{mechanism}} within the coupling enables the drawbar to {{move back and forth}} relative to the trailer chassis. When the towing vehicle brakes, the inertia of the trailer slides the mechanism, this in turn uses the travel of this mechanism to pull on the <b>brake</b> <b>rod</b> which applies the brakes. The sliding mechanism contains a damper to even out the shock loading transmitted from the tow vehicle. Therefore,the inertia of the trailer provides the force to apply the brakes.|$|R
50|$|Both Russell and Hammett {{visit the}} site of the Russell family car accident. Russell then takes a {{vacation}} to her family's summer home with her friends Flo and Donny. During the vacation, she recovers her wits enough to realize that somebody is trying to murder her and all the people that could possibly be connected with the car accident that killed her parents, from Long's parents to her psychiatrist. She visits the garage that collected the remainder of her parents' car and learns that the <b>brake</b> <b>rod</b> was cut and she is not to blame for their deaths; they were murdered.|$|R
50|$|Braking is {{provided}} through Girling <b>rod</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{with a similar}} design found on the Austin 14 Goodwood.|$|R
2500|$|Under the bonnet, the car {{utilised}} the new Villiers Mk 35A unit {{designed specifically}} for it. A development of the 9E, the new engine incorporated numerous mechanical refinements to improve strength and reliability, albeit slightly {{at the cost of}} overall power, now rated at [...] at 4,500rpm. Rear suspension was completely revised, with trailing arm units controlled by Armstrong dampers. The <b>rod</b> and cable <b>brake</b> systems of previous cars was also replaced by a Lockheed semi hydraulic and <b>rod</b> <b>braking</b> system (front brake fully hydraulic, but rear <b>brakes</b> still <b>rod</b> operated from a central floor-mounted hydraulic cylinder) acting on all three wheels.|$|R
50|$|Since the 1890s only {{incremental}} mechanical {{advances have}} taken place {{for the majority of}} the world's utility bicycles. In fact many bicycles in Asia still employ <b>rod</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R

50|$|Following on from {{previous}} designs of London taxi, the FX3 had a traditional 3-door body, {{with an open}} luggage platform rather than a front passenger seat beside the driver. The FX3 was fitted with mechanical <b>brakes,</b> with <b>rod</b> operation, beam axles on leaf springs and a built-in Jackall hydraulic jacking system. Like all London taxis, it has a tight turning circle of 25 ft (7.6m) diameter, {{as required by the}} Conditions of Fitness.|$|R

The estate featured a large hatchback, hinged at the roof. Inside, the rear seats could also be folded flat or removed entirely. On the Ranger version the rear seats and rear side windows were omitted.|$|R
50|$|In 1921 the pre-war {{light car}} was {{replaced}} by a 1496 cc British Anzani engined model which was equipped with <b>rod</b> <b>brakes</b> and a flat radiator. This model was replaced one year later. The Roadspeed sports version was guaranteed to exceed 60 mph.|$|R
50|$|The ER2 {{is mostly}} {{similar to the}} earlier ER1; the most {{significant}} design changes {{were made to the}} passenger doors (which were now compatible with both high and low passenger platforms, unlike those of the ER1 which were only compatible with high platforms) and the electrical equipment (improved storage batteries and motor-generators). Also, braking equipment was redesigned: the number of braking cylinders was increased, the connecting levers simplified, and automatic adjusters which adjusted the travel of the <b>brake</b> piston <b>rods</b> were deleted.|$|R
5000|$|Raleigh Bicycle Company {{developed}} a variation that combined the <b>rod</b> <b>braking</b> surfaces of Westwood rims with flat sides for caliper braking. It {{has been called}} [...] "Raleigh Pattern" [...] and [...] "Westrick". They are noted for their strength, {{and there is also}} a Schwinn Bicycle Company copy of this design.|$|R
50|$|The {{driving wheels}} were 44.6 inch in diameter, flanged upon their lower edge like the balance {{wheels of the}} trucks, and were mounted upon steel axles 6 inch in diameter, which extend through a sliding box {{containing}} the journals. The boxes slid in cast iron ways placed at right angle {{to the line of}} the engine, and each axle had a crank keyed upon its upper end. The well known slotted yoke connection was used. The slide valves were of the usual locomotive form. The links were placed in a horizontal instead of a vertical position, and were operated by two bell cranks. The throttle valve, link <b>rod,</b> <b>brake,</b> and coupling <b>rods,</b> and the connection between the driving boxes for producing pressure against the rails, were operated by hydraulic power, although hand levers were also provided.|$|R
50|$|The chassis had half-elliptic {{leaf springs}} all round and drive {{was to the}} rear wheels through either a four-speed {{preselector}} or manual gearbox. Girling <b>rod</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted. Three different wheelbases were made and two track options of 48 in on most versions or 51 in on the 1936 Adelphi, Continental and Kestrel saloons.|$|R
25|$|The {{rear linkage}} {{mechanism}} {{is complicated by}} the need to allow rotation where the fork and handlebars attach to the frame. A common setup was to combine a front <b>rod</b> <b>brake</b> with a rear coaster brake. Although heavy and complex, the linkages are reliable and durable and can be repaired or adjusted with simple hand tools. The design is still in use, typically on African and Asian roadsters such as the Sohrab and Flying Pigeon.|$|R
50|$|The {{controls}} in the Model AA are entirely mechanical, except {{the windshield wipers}} in later models. The brakes are mechanical and the truck has four oversized drum brakes to stop the vehicle. The mechanical system is a pull lever system that applies the force from the pedal to a pivot that pulls the <b>brake</b> <b>rods</b> that expand the brakes in the drums. The brake light is activated when the brake pedal is pushed. The brakes are proportioned more toward the rear drums. The parking brake is a chrome lever {{on the floor with}} a release button on the top. The windshield wipers started as hand operated and later models were powered by vacuum diverted from the intake manifold. The horn button is mounted {{in the middle of the}} steering wheel assembly. Controls for the lights are also incorporated into the steering assembly. The switch was a three-stop switch for parking lights, headlights and high-beams. The tail-light lens colors on the AA underwent several changes during the production run. Two levers are mounted on the steering column to adjust the engine. The left lever controls the manual advance of the timing. Adjusting the timing of the engine changes the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber and those changes affect the performance of the engine. The right lever is a manual control for the throttle. The throttle can be adjusted to ease the shifting of the transmission and the idling speed of the engine. Underneath the dash on the right side is the choke rod. The choke can adjust the flow of fuel from the carburetor into the engine. Turning the knob on the choke rod clockwise closes the fuel flow, leaning out the engine; turning the knob counterclockwise opens the fuel flow to the engine.|$|R
50|$|The Bullnose {{radiator}} {{was replaced}} by a more conventional flat radiator announced 11 September 1926 on new cars now with doors either side and a longer list of accessories supplied as standard. All steel bodies were coming available. The engines remained the same, but the Cowley unlike the Oxford, retained braking on the rear wheels only as standard, although a front brake system was available at extra cost (featured car has this fitted). The chassis was new and the suspension was updated with semi elliptic leaf springs all round plus Smiths friction type scissor shock absorbers. The <b>brakes</b> are <b>rod</b> and spring operated with cams inside the drums to actuate. Interesting to note that the rear brake drums include two sets of shoes, one of which is connected directly to the handbrake.|$|R
50|$|They are simple, {{relative}} to other bicycles. They are all-steel single speed with 28 in wheels, fenders, fully covered chain, sprung leather saddle, rear rack and <b>rod</b> <b>brakes</b> (a handlebar lever connects directly to the brake pads), double stand (PA02 and PA06) or side stand (PB13). Like the Ford Model T, they are only available in one colour, black, except for the flare of vanilla at the fender tips. They can be equipped with a dynamo lighting set.|$|R
5000|$|... 1930 {{brought a}} series of {{improvements}} to the car. The Morris <b>rod</b> <b>brake</b> system, with the handbrake working on the transmission, was replaced a cable system with cross shaft coupled to the handbrake and the transmission brake deleted. Engine output was increased to [...] by improving the camshaft and a four-speed gearbox was offered as an option. The doors became front-hinged. A supercharged version could be ordered from 1932, raising the top speed to 80 mi/h km/h.|$|R
5000|$|The Hillman 16 had a 2110 cc 15.90 hp {{side valve}} straight-six engine whilst the {{matching}} 20/70 had larger 2810 cc 20.9 hp engines. The [...] "16hp" [...] and â20/70â saloons were five seaters with bucket {{seats at the}} front and a folding armrest dividing a bench seat at the rear. All these vehicles had Bendix [...] "Duo Servo" [...] <b>brakes,</b> which used <b>rod</b> and cable linkages and operated on all four wheels via both the foot pedal and the handbrake lever.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of mass-produced pneumatic tyres by the Dunlop Tyre Company, the use of spoon brakes began to decline, as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres. [...] This problem led to demands for alternative braking systems. On November 23, 1897, Abram W. Duck of Duck's Cyclery in Oakland, California was granted a patent for his Duck Roller Brake (U.S. Patent 594,234). The duck <b>brake</b> used a <b>rod</b> operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre, braking the front wheel.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "rod-actuated brake", {{or simply}} [...] "rod brake", (roller lever brake in Raleigh terminology) uses {{a series of}} rods and pivots, rather than Bowden cables, to {{transmit}} force applied to a hand lever to pull friction pads upwards against the inner surface, which faces the hub, of the wheel rim. They were often called [...] "stirrup brakes" [...] due to their shape. <b>Rod</b> <b>brakes</b> are used with a rim profile known as the Westwood rim, which has a slightly concave area on the braking surface and lacks the flat outer surface required by brakes that apply the pads {{on opposite sides of}} the rim.|$|R
50|$|An {{updated version}} {{appeared}} in 1937 with mainly styling changes but the chassis was stiffened and Girling <b>rod</b> <b>brakes</b> replaced the hydraulic ones {{that had been}} fitted to earlier cars. Bodies were a 6-light saloon and a 4-light sports saloon. There were no more tourers pre war but 200 were made in 1947 and 1948 with the first four bodies by Rover and the remaining 196 by AP Coachbuilders of Coventry. The 1938 models had fixed bonnet sides and for 1939 synchromesh {{was added to the}} top two ratios on the gearbox. Disc wheels became an option to wire wheels in 1939 and standard on post war models.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{drum brake}} {{was first used}} in a car made by Maybach in 1900, although the principle was only later patented in 1902 by Louis Renault. He used woven asbestos lining for the drum brake lining, as no alternative dissipated heat like the asbestos lining, though Maybach had used a less sophisticated drum brake. In the first drum <b>brakes,</b> levers and <b>rods</b> or cables operated the shoes mechanically. From the mid-1930s, oil pressure in a small wheel cylinder and pistons (as in the picture) operated the brakes, though some vehicles continued with purely mechanical systems for decades. Some designs have two wheel cylinders.|$|R
