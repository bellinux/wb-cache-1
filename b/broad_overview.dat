However, Veronica asks several questions to him which he does not answer very well. Veronica suddenly connects the dots and says that Tim committed the murder in order to frame Hank, who denied him a job opportunity.

25|$|Description: The goal of {{this study}} was to perform a {{comparative}} study of living and fixed cytoplasm using the eggs at different stages. Strobell and Foot were able to study live eggs of Allolobophora foetida under high magniication using a Bausch and Lomb compressor, a feat that Foot had been attempting since 1894. The purpose of this particular paper was to discuss the photomicrography techniques using a <b>broad</b> <b>overview</b> of their work with the eggs. Three plates at different stages labeled A, B, and C are discussed in detail with 6 accompanying photographs each to show different perspectives. All three were fixed using a different method but the photographic technique remained consistent, using daylight near noon with 15-30 seconds of exposure.|$|E

2500|$|The Green Book {{is issued}} to IRA volunteers {{as part of}} their {{training}} and is considered a secret document which should not be revealed to, or discussed with non-IRA members. [...] In order to protect the organisation, disclosure of its training material and any other training documents, including the Green Book, would most likely carry stiff penalties up to and including Court Martial. Once issued, each volunteer is expected to study and learn from his/her copy of the manual, to apply the rules given in it, and to apply lessons learnt from it. [...] While the manual is clearly not all the training a volunteer could expect, it gave a <b>broad</b> <b>overview</b> meant to go some way to preparing the volunteer for active duty with the organisation.|$|E
2500|$|The Old Town of Vilnius, the {{historical}} centre of Vilnius, {{is one of}} the largest in Europe at [...] The most valuable historic and cultural sites are concentrated here. The buildings in the old town—there are nearly 1,500—were built over several centuries, creating a blend of many different architectural styles. Although Vilnius is known as a Baroque city, there are examples of Gothic (e.g. Church of St. Anne), Renaissance, and other styles. Their combination is also a gateway to the historic centre of the capital. Owing to its uniqueness, the Old Town of Vilnius was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1994. Vilnius University's main campus's spectacular architectural ensemble features 13 courtyards framed by 15th century buildings and splashed with 300-year-old frescoes, and the Church of St. Johns. The Gate of Dawn, the only surviving gate of the first original five gates in the city wall, hosts the painting of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which has been said to have miracle-working powers. Over 200 tiles and commemorative plaques to writers, who have lived and worked in Vilnius, and foreign authors, who have shared a connection with Vilnius and Lithuania, adorn a wall on Literatų street (...) in the Old Town, presenting a <b>broad</b> <b>overview</b> of the history of Lithuanian literature. In Antakalnis district there is Church of St. Peter and St. Paul – a masterpiece of the 17th-century Baroque famous for its exceptional interior where one can see about 2,000 stucco figures. In 1995, the world's first bronze cast of Frank Zappa was installed in the Naujamiestis district with the permission of the government. The Frank Zappa sculpture confirmed the newly found freedom of expression, and marked the beginning of a new era for Lithuanian society.|$|E
