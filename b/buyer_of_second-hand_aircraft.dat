5000|$|Purchase of an {{advanced}} fighter aircraft - medium to long term program, purchase {{of up to}} 18 x 4.5-generation fighters. Program cost: 12-15 billion kuna. This program is planned as a long term investment {{in the air force}} designed to provide the next fighter, with new fighters joining the Air Force around 2020 and after. Most likely candidates are the Jas 39E/F and the F-16 E/F Block 60. MiG-21 fighters currently in service will by then {{no longer be able to}} be overhauled due to the age and stress on their airframes. The purchase <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> is still a possibility, but with the cost <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> fighters not far off from new fighters, it is not a likely option.|$|R
40|$|Second-hand {{housing market}} is the {{barometer}} {{of the real estate}} market since the <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> houses usually are those who really want to live, whereas financial investment and speculation are not their goals. So the price and determinants <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> houses reflect the real demand of housing market. In this paper KNN related algorithms are applied to study the problems associated with price <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> house. It includes using KNN and weighted-KNN algorithms to predict the price, using cross validation method to compute average deviation of prediction algorithm and compare KNN’s prediction effect with weighted-KNN’s, and using stimulated annealing optimization algorithm to compute the weight values of house attributes and evaluate the relative importances of them. Through the analysis of attribute importance it can show the influences of different house attributes on house price and the main concerns <b>of</b> <b>buyers.</b> All these results can give valuable information for manages, decision makers and appraisers of real estate...|$|R
40|$|Apparently mistaken {{decisions}} are ubiquitous. To what extent does this reflect irrationality, {{as opposed to}} a rational trade-off between the costs of information acquisition and the expected benefits of learning? We de-velop a revealed preference test that characterizes all patterns of choice “mistakes ” consistent with a general model of optimal costly informa-tion acquisition and identify the extent to which information costs can be recovered from choice data. Limits on attention impact choice. Shoppers may buy unnecessarily expensive prod-ucts due to their failure to notice whether or not sales tax is included in stated prices (Chetty, Looney and Kroft (2009)). <b>Buyers</b> <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> cars focus their attention on the leftmost digit of the odometer (Lacetera, Pope and Sydnor (2012)).

25|$|In late 1960, the People's Republic of China {{had begun}} {{negotiations}} with Vickers {{for as many}} as 40 Viscounts; however, negotiations were protracted due to political tensions. At this point, China sought arrangements to purchase Viscounts second-hand from existing operators, and later achieved successive deals regarding the Viscount with Britain directly. The last batch of six aircraft built were for the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which were delivered during 1964; at the end of production a total of 445 Viscounts had been manufactured. Many Viscounts were refurbished and saw new service with African operators; sales <b>of</b> these <b>second-hand</b> <b>aircraft</b> continued into the 1990s.|$|R
5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure on the domestic aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> F-4J <b>aircraft</b> were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} parts industry was {{born out of}} the sale <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> or used <b>aircraft</b> parts from the aerospace manufacture sector. Within the United States there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow. This includes leveraging a certified repair station to overhaul and [...] "tag" [...] a part. This certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet OEM specifications. Once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market. When an airline has an aircraft on the ground, the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable. This can drive the market for specific parts. There are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of {{aircraft parts}}.|$|R

40|$|A {{warranty}} for a second-hand {{product is}} {{a contractual obligation}} offered by the dealer {{in connection with the}} sale of the product. Determination of warranty cost for second-hand products is extremely complex due to uncertainties with age, usage and past maintenance history. Pricing for warranty cover linked to sale <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> products is not only dependant on the failure characteristics and warranty policy but also the amount the buyer is willing to pay depending on buyer’s risk attitude. A dealer is expected to maximize profit which depends on volume of sale, price and expected cost to service warranty claims based on warranty policy. In this paper, a free repair warranty is considered with sale, under which the customer can have the product repaired free of charge if it fails during the warranty period. It is assumed that’s <b>buyers</b> <b>of</b> the used items are heterogeneous with a random risk-aversion parameter in their risk attitudes towards a warranty price and uncertain repair costs.

40|$|ABSTRACT Second-hand {{clothing}} {{has been}} traded since the Renaissance era, and widely consumed {{by a majority}} of the populace. However, very few studies concerning second-hand retailing and consumer preferences have been conducted, especially in the United States. The present study was conducted to understand second-hand retailers 2 ̆ 7 current marketing practices, sourcing strategies, and resources that lead to their business success. Moreover, unique features and definitions of three specialized types <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailers (e. g., vintage stores, consignment stores, and thrift stores) were discussed through a typology. Resource-based theory (RBT) (Barney, 1991) and the Four Experiential Realms (4 Es) (Pine 2 ̆ 6 Gilmore, 1999) were used to frame the qualitative study. Owner-managers (N= 13) of three specialized types <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retail stores (vintage, consignment, and charity/thrift) in the Midwestern U. S. were recruited for the study. To obtain candid responses from participants, an open-ended, semi-structured questionnaire was used. A grounded theory approach using open coding and axial coding was employed for data analysis and interpretation. Four major themes were identified from the results of this study: business background and motivations, resources generated for second-hand retail business, marketing and management plans, and definition <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailing. Concerning the theme, definition <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailers, each specialized type <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailer (e. g., vintage, consignment, and thrift stores) was defined and classified by contrasting similarities and differences among formats. Unique features of each specialized type <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailer were also discussed. Although all types <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailers are similar in the sense of dealing with used items, this study revealed that each possesses distinctive characteristics. Second-hand retailers 2 ̆ 7 business resources that lead to their business success were discussed within the theme, resources generated for second-hand retail business. A majority <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> businesses are operated by owning one or two physical stores. Critical resources possessed by thrift stores are balers, used for baling unsold clothes and sending them to trading companies. Owner-managers were very supportive to assist their neighboring communities, and made efforts to maintain network relationships with counselors and business partners. Some vintage stores often sold exclusive items through alternative retail channels, such as websites, movie productions, and social connections. Finally, diverse types of sourcing methods and suppliers for each specialized type <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailer were discussed. Second-hand retailers 2 ̆ 7 marketing and management plans that enhance business growth were discussed within the theme, marketing and management plans. First, a product strategy uniquely performed by second-hand retailers was agile inventory turnover and quick circulation from racks to stock. Some price strategies were practiced by second-hand retailers by providing affordable prices to approach various types <b>of</b> customers. <b>Second-hand</b> retailers specifically focused on maintaining relationships with customers and customer services, such as welcoming and greeting, finding a proper outfit for customers, and searching for items customers requested. Experiential, entertainment, esthetic, and escapist experiences were offered to customers so customers not only consume products and services, but also enjoy second-hand stores 2 ̆ 7 unique atmosphere. This study is a beginning point for second-hand retailing research in the U. S. By identifying information about second-hand retailing and U. S. markets, this study inspires and encourages other researchers to conduct future studies by utilizing the findings from this study. For future studies, investigating each specialized type <b>of</b> <b>second-hand</b> retailer 2 ̆ 7 s business practices can be considered. Examining consumers 2 ̆ 7 viewpoints towards second-hand business are also suggested...|$|R
