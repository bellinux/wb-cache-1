40|$|Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> can {{be applied}} as an {{effective}} method to get insight in the opinions of participants. Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> form the interviewing part of Q methodology. Q methodology {{can be used to}} identify typical sets of opinions. However, in many studies, the research goal is to order opinions and see which ones play the most important roles, instead of identifying groups of people with similar opinions. In such cases, full Q methodology is not required. Yet, the Q <b>board</b> <b>interviewing</b> method has a number of characteristics that are also advantageous in such situations. Therefore, we decided to apply Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews,</b> although our goal was not to do factor analysis. With Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews,</b> participants order pre-formulated statements. Besides, participants are encouraged to provide background information. This enables them to bring in issues that go beyond the fixed set of statements. Because of this combination, Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> stimulate engagement of the participants, without making the interview time consuming. The paper describes how Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> were used by students of the course Social Cohesion Design and how the application of Q <b>board</b> <b>interviews</b> functioned as a preparation for applying Q methodology in the second stage of the course.

5000|$|Seals {{announced}} in June 2007 {{that he would}} be running for Congress in the 10th district again. In the primary election he faced Jay Footlik, a former Clinton administration official. Seals was endorsed by U.S. Senator Dick Durbin. Footlik raised the residency issue again during a Chicago Tribune editorial <b>board</b> <b>interview,</b> to which Seals replied: [...] "If I was a millionaire I could certainly just pick up and buy a new home, but I'm not a millionaire, and if you want more millionaires in Congress, I'm not your man." [...] The United States Constitution requires that candidates for Congress be residents of the state from which they are elected, but does not require district residency. Seals' home lies 0.3 miles outside of the 10th district, in the 9th which is represented by Jan Schakowsky. Footlik contended that Seals didn't deserve another chance because he lost to Kirk by six points in a good Democratic year, while Seals argued he had superior name recognition. On February 5, 2008 Seals won the primary with 81% of the vote.|$|E
