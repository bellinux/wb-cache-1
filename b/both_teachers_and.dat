The teachers appointed were jurists, theologians, and traditionalists who received their salary from endowments to the institutions they taught in.

He left Concord in 1830 and moved to Andover, Massachusetts, to become principal of Phillips Andover Academy’s new teacher training program.

This first meeting of the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America, commonly called the [...] "Synodical Conference", was held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on July 10–16, 1872. They wrote the constitution to the Synodical Conference, which arranged the synods together as a federation and did not vest any real authority with the Synodical Conference, either at the convention or board level. The fellowship union included full communion among members, the sharing of educational facilities, joint mission and benevolence work, and open pulpit between pastors of the different synods.|$|E
60|$|This {{letter is}} an {{instance}} of the reserve and reticence which Mr. Patteson felt so strongly with regard to his adventures and pupils. He could not endure stories of them to become, as it were, stock for exciting interest at home. There was something in his nature that shrank from publishing accounts of individual pupils as a breach of confidence, as much, or perhaps even more, than {{if they had been}} English people, likely to know what had been done. Moreover, instances had come to his knowledge in which harm had been done to <b>both</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> taught by their becoming aware that they were shown off to the public in print. Such things had happened even where they would have seemed not only unlikely, but impossible; and this rendered him particularly cautious in writing of his work, so that his reports were often dry, while he insisted strongly on his letters to his family being kept private.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{we may be}} well {{assured that}} the case was not thus, but far otherwise, with the early Christians. Had it been thus, Christianity never would have {{expanded}} from an obscure sect of the despised Hebrews into {{the religion of the}} Roman empire. When their enemies said, [...] "See how these Christians love one another" [...] (a remark not likely to be made by anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the meaning of their creed than they have ever had since. And to this cause, probably, it is chiefly owing that Christianity now makes so little progress in extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries, is still nearly confined to Europeans and the descendants of Europeans. Even with the strictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines, and attach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people in general, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparatively active in their minds is that which was made by Calvin, or Knox, or some such person much nearer in character to themselves. The sayings of Christ coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effect beyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland. There are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badge of a sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognised sects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaning alive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are more questioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers. <b>Both</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>and</b> learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there is no enemy in the field.|$|E
