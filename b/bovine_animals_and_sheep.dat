40|$|In {{the period}} 2003 - 2014, Romania became an {{important}} source for the export of live <b>animals</b> (<b>bovines</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheep),</b> both for the intra-Community trade and for third countries. Although {{in the same period}} the imports consisted mainly of breeding animals, the balance of trade was constantly positive. The method used in the paper was the comparative analysis of trade-specific set of indicators, the main information sources being international information, reports and studies, FAOSTAT and EUROSTAT statistics. From our analysis, it results that that Romania practiced a conjuncture export, as the herds specialized in meat production, both in the case of bovines <b>and</b> <b>sheep,</b> have a significant share in total livestock herds. The reason why Romania is agreed as supplier of live animals is rather represented by the raising of animals under extensive system, where feeding is mainly based on grazing...|$|R
40|$|Forty-nine typical and {{atypical}} enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains {{belonging to}} different serotypes and isolated from humans, pets (cats <b>and</b> dogs), farm <b>animals</b> (<b>bovines,</b> <b>sheep,</b> <b>and</b> rabbits), <b>and</b> wild <b>animals</b> (monkeys) were investigated for virulence markers and clonal similarity by {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The virulence markers analyzed revealed that atypical EPEC strains isolated from animals {{have the potential to}} cause diarrhea in humans. A close clonal relationship between human <b>and</b> <b>animal</b> isolates was found by MLST and PFGE. These results indicate that these animals act as atypical EPEC reservoirs and may represent sources of infection for humans.

40|$|Background: While Group B Streptococcus (GBS) human {{colonization}} and infection {{has long}} been suspected as originating from cows, several investigators have suggested that ongoing interspecies GBS transmission is unlikely due to genotyping data demonstrating that human and bovine-derived GBS strains represent mostly distinct populations. The possibility of ongoing transmission between humans and their livestock has not been systematically examined. Methodology/Principal Findings: To examine ongoing interspecies transmission, we conducted a prospective crosssectional cohort study of 68 families and their livestock. Stool specimens were collected from 154 people and 115 livestock; GBS was detected in 19 (12. 3 %) humans and 2 (1. 7 %) <b>animals</b> (<b>bovine</b> <b>and</b> <b>sheep).</b> Application of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identified 8 sequence types (STs or clones), with STs 1 and 23 predominating. There were 11 families in which two members submitted stools {{and at least one}} had GBS colonization. In 3 of these families, both members (consisting of couples) were colonized, yielding a co-colonization rate of 27 % (95 % CI: 7 %– 61 %). Two of these couples had strains with identical MLST, capsule (cps) genotype, susceptibility, and RAPD profiles. One couple co-colonized with ST- 1 (cps 5) strains also had a bovine colonized with the identical strain type. On multivariate analysis of questionnaire data, cattle exposure was a predictor of GBS colonization, with each unit increase in days of cattle exposure increasing the odds of colonization by 20 % (P = 0. 02). These results support interspecies transmission with additional evidence for transmission provided by th...|$|R

Although GBS uncommonly colonizes livestock stools, increased frequency of cattle exposure was significantly associated with human colonization and one couple shared the same GBS strains as their bovine suggesting intraspecies transmission.

Pattern recognition of steroid profiles is a promising approach for tracing/detecting the abuse of natural hormones administered to cattle. Traditionally steroids are analysed in urine as free steroid after deconjugation of the glucuronide (and sulphate) conjugates. The disadvantage of this deconjugation is that valuable information about the steroid profile in the sample is lost.

Based on this, a tiered reduction formula for other WTO members is proposed and preliminary analysis show that other member countries, including the US, have the possibility to meet this proposal. Analyzing implications of reforming agricultural domestic support {{is not an easy}} task, due to several measurement and modeling issues and the complexities associated with domestic support programs in different countries. In this paper, we show how the reform of the CAP in the context of fulfilling the WTO reduction proposal is modeled, especially the decoupling of its Amber and Blue box programs.
