5|$|Susan Hall {{wrote that}} there is no rule of law in the books, as the actions of Ministry of Magic {{officials}} are unconstrained by laws, accountability or any kind of legal challenge.

This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.|$|E
