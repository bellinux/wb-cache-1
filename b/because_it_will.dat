5|$|Habitat destruction, such as forest {{clearing}} {{for commercial}} logging, agriculture space, and residential areas, {{is the most}} detrimental activity {{on the distribution of}} these rabbits. Since they prefer a habitat of both mature and young forests, they do not thrive in only mature forests untouched by destruction, yet they do not thrive in newly growing forests alone, either. There are plans to remove current habitat for these rabbits for the construction of golf courses and resorts, which is allowed <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not directly be killing the rabbit, just changing the environment where it dwells, which is legal even under the protection of the special natural monument status.|$|E
5|$|Lange {{says that}} his girlfriend, Sarah Flannigan (Laura MacDonald), is jogging near the harbor, so Pembleton sends detectives Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Falsone (Jon Seda) to look for her. Lewis and Falsone talk {{about the nature of}} death while {{questioning}} random joggers; their search effort proves fruitless. Lange tries to convince EMT Joy Tolson (Wendee Pratt) to give him painkillers, but she refuses <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> reduce their chances of saving his life, even while she insists he cannot be saved. Pembleton keeps Lange company, despite his initial annoyance at Lange's bullying and mean-spirited attitude. The emergency personnel plan to use airbags to push the subway train away from the platform, then pull Lange free and rush him to the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E

25|$|In an {{interview}} with Top Gear, President of Bugatti Dr. Wolfgang Schreiber said that Bugatti will never manufacture Galibier nor SuperVeyron <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> confuse their customers.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimated}} cost to implement and operate congestion pricing in San Francisco still is unknown, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{depend on the}} program design according to the final alternative selected for implementation and the specific technology used.|$|E
25|$|A {{treatment}} of supplements of retinoic acid {{which is a}} part of vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal, but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if the treatment is daily <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not bring the retinoid hypo-signalling back to normal.|$|E

50|$|The novel {{ends with}} Will and Marcus both having become {{more typical of}} their age groups, and happier <b>because</b> of <b>it.</b> <b>Will</b> intends to marry Rachel, and embraces romantic {{normality}} and Marcus enters his teenage phase in the typical fashion of a boy growing up in 1990s London.|$|R
50|$|A full {{renovation}} of the station for handicapped accessibility is planned. However, the project has attracted criticism <b>because</b> of concerns <b>it</b> <b>will</b> degrade service on the entire line.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, when {{married couples}} argue {{they tend to}} focus on who is right and who is wrong.

25|$|The Serb {{minority}} of Kosovo, which largely opposes {{the declaration of}} independence, has formed the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija in response. The creation of the assembly was condemned by Kosovo's president Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK has said the assembly is not a serious issue <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> not have an operative role.|$|E
25|$|Scholars of {{religion}} {{have argued that}} {{a study of the}} subject is useful for individuals <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> provide them with knowledge that is pertinent in inter-personal and professional contexts within an increasingly globalised world. It has also been argued that studying religion is useful in appreciating and understanding sectarian tensions and religious violence.|$|E

25|$|Mearsheimer {{asserts that}} Australia should be {{concerned}} with China's accretion of power <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> lead to an intense security competition between the China and the US that would destabilize the region. He also argues that China is implementing the militarily aggressive philosophy of the U.S. naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, who argued for sea control and decisive battle.|$|E
25|$|You can't say {{anything}} about this <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> screw up our source and there's a real concern.

He knows everything that's to be known in the FBI. He has access to absolutely everything.|$|E
25|$|He does state however that {{evolution}} within a species is possible, yet that no species can evolve from another species. Furthermore, {{he states that}} the human or 'intellectual animal' naturally evolves in time, for example our society is an evolution from previous societies - however the evolution of species can never achieve spiritual liberation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> always return to devolution. Spiritual liberation requires a 'revolution of consciousness'.|$|E

25|$|The Rahall Transportation Institute Foundation, in {{association}} with the City of Huntington and various community members, has designed this trail system to incorporate many of Huntington's amenities and workplaces to allow the citizens of Huntington an alternate means of transportation. The PATH is vital in Huntington's continued efforts towards the redevelopment and growth of the City, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> help cut congestion, connect business and communities, and provide healthy recreational opportunities for residents.|$|E
25|$|An extreme type of {{reciprocal}} zugzwang, called trébuchet, {{is shown in}} the diagram. It is also called a full-point mutual zugzwang <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> result in a loss for the player in zugzwang, resulting a full point for his opponent. Whoever is to move in this position must abandon his own pawn, thus allowing his opponent to capture it and proceed to promote the remaining pawn, resulting in an easily winnable position.|$|E
25|$|Some hobbyists have {{developed}} computer {{programs that will}} solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm, which {{is a type of}} brute force search. Backtracking is a depth-first search (in contrast to a breadth-first search), <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> completely explore one branch to a possible solution before moving to another branch. Although it has been established that approximately 6.67 x 1021 final grids exist, a brute force algorithm can be a practical method to solve Sudoku puzzles.|$|E

50|$|In The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-88), Edward Gibbon famously {{placed the}} blame on a loss of civic virtue among the Roman citizens. They {{gradually}} entrusted the role of defending the Empire to barbarian mercenaries who eventually turned on them. Gibbon held that Christianity contributed to this shift by making the populace less interested in the worldly here-and-now <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was <b>willing</b> {{to wait for the}} rewards of heaven.|$|R
25|$|Removal {{of surface}} dirt and {{deposits}} is beneficial {{for the health}} and longevity of an object <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> prevent the dirt from becoming drawn into the body. Dust and grease may be held on the surface loosely by electrostatic forces or weak chemical bonds and are easily removed. Some deposits, such as calcium salts, can be strongly attached a ceramic surface especially if the surface is unglazed. There are two main methods in which ceramics are cleaned and treated: mechanically and chemically.|$|E
25|$|Achieving {{a closed}} orbit is not {{essential}} to lunar and interplanetary voyages. Early Russian space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit. NASA considered launching Apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary parking orbit and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory. This costs additional propellant because the parking orbit perigee must be high enough to prevent reentry while direct injection can have an arbitrarily low perigee <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> never be reached.|$|E
25|$|The {{tentative}} deal {{to develop}} the $6.2 billion Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador was negotiated by the Progressive Conservative government in November 2010. The Liberal Party opposes the deal, saying it is bad for the province <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> increase the province's debt and will see electricity rates increase for consumers. The NDP have had similar concerns and both party leaders have called for spending on the project to stop until more independent analysis' can be conducted {{to see if the}} current deal is the best one for the province.|$|E
