500|$|... "Boyz 4 Now" [...] {{was written}} by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux and {{directed}} by Anthony Chun. Upon hearing the writers' pitch of the episode, series creator Loren Bouchard found its plot to be [...] "such an immediately appealing story" [...] and [...] "a great way to have Louise peek over {{the other side of}} adolescence and look into the abyss." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bouchard cited [...] "Boyz 4 Now" [...] as one of his favorite episodes of the series and revealed his liking of [...] "episodes where Louise is a little vulnerable...you don't want her to be as invulnerable as she pretends to <b>be.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> try to keep the show grounded, then you periodically have to say, she's a nine-year-old girl." [...] He added that while the character has [...] "an adult sensibility about a lot of stuff," [...] he and the writing staff try to [...] "look for ways to bring her back down to earth," [...] citing the episode's depiction of Louise [...] "fighting against growing up," [...] with Tina acting as [...] "her strange ambassador into that world...in some ways, you couldn't ask for a better guide." ...|$|E
500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E
2500|$|... “The Honorable Elijah Muhammad {{said these}} planes {{were used to}} set up {{mountains}} on the earth. The Qur'an says it like this: We have raised mountains on the earth lest it convulse with you. How do you raise a mountain, {{and what is the}} purpose of a mountain? Have you ever tried to balance a tire? You use weights to keep the tire balanced. That's how the earth is balanced, with mountain ranges. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that we have a type of bomb that, when it strikes the earth a drill on it is timed to go into the earth and explode at the height that you wish the mountain to <b>be.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> wish to take the mountain up a mile (1.6 km), you time the drill to go a mile (1.6 km) in and then explode. The bombs these planes have are timed to go one mile (1.6 km) down and bring up a mountain one mile (1.6 km) high, but it will destroy everything within a 50-square-mile (130 km²) radius.

2500|$|Robinson {{said that}} the nucleus of their idea for Orange Man came as a {{reaction}} to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which w{{as a reaction to}} Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was [...] "meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time", comparing it to coffee advertisements where [...] "they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom," [...] noting that Orange Man decided to [...] "express this in an really OTT fashion". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling [...] "We said how brilliant it would <b>be</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened." [...] The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a [...] "cardinal sin in adland." [...] One commentary considered the advertisement to be a [...] "riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{while he}} was the Vatican's chief astronomer, Fr. George Coyne, issued a {{statement}} on 18 November 2005 saying that [...] "Intelligent design isn't science even though it pretends to <b>be.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to teach it in schools, intelligent design should be taught when religion or cultural history is taught, not science." [...] Cardinal Paul Poupard added that [...] "the faithful have the obligation to listen to that which secular modern science has to offer, just as we ask that knowledge of the faith be taken in consideration as an expert voice in humanity." [...] He also warned of the permanent lesson we have learned from the Galileo affair, and that [...] "we also know the dangers of a religion that severs its links with reason and becomes prey to fundamentalism." [...] Fiorenzo Facchini, professor of evolutionary biology at the University of Bologna, called intelligent design unscientific, and wrote in the January 16–17, 2006 edition L'Osservatore Romano: [...] "But it is not correct from a methodological point of view to stray {{from the field of}} science while pretending to do science.... It only creates confusion between the scientific plane and those that are philosophical or religious." [...] Kenneth R. Miller is another prominent Catholic scientist widely known for opposing Young Earth Creationism and Intelligent Design. He writes, concerning Emeritus pope Benedict XVI, that [...] "The Holy Father's concerns are not with evolution per se, but with how evolution is to be understood in our modern world. Biological evolution fits neatly into a traditional Catholic understanding of how contingent natural processes can be seen as part of God's plan...a careful reading suggests that the new pope will give quarter neither to the enemies of spirituality nor the enemies of evolutionary science. And that's exactly as it should be." ...|$|E
