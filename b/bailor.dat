25|$|Sir William Holdsworth {{described}} trover as {{an extension}} of detinue, which enabled not only a <b>bailor</b> and a dispossessed owner, but also a third person, to whose use goods had been bailed, to get full recognition of their interests.|$|E
2500|$|An {{action for}} {{conversion}} may be predicated upon an improper disposal, removal, transportation, delivery, or {{transfer of possession}} of property to one not authorized by the owner to receive the property. The Restatement (Second) of Torts states that, with some exceptions, one who makes an unauthorized delivery of a chattel to a person not entitled to its immediate possession is subject to liability for conversion to another who is so entitled. [...] A bailee, agent, or servant who re-delivers to his <b>bailor,</b> principal, or master is not liable for conversion unless the person entitled to immediate possession had made an adverse claim upon him. [...] A bailee, agent or servant who delivers the chattel to a third person pursuant to the instructions of his <b>bailor,</b> principal or master is not liable for conversion unless he has knowledge or reason to know that his <b>bailor,</b> principal, or master is not authorized so to dispose of it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} Isaac v Clark , it was laid down that a <b>bailor</b> could not {{maintain}} trover or detinue {{where he had}} pledged the goods, because the wrong [...] was an offense against the possession of the bailee.|$|E
5000|$|Livingstone v Roskilly 1992 3 NZLR 230 was a 1992 New Zealand appeal case {{questioning}} whether an [...] "all care, no responsibility" [...] clause excluded liability for negligent {{damage to a}} <b>bailor's</b> goods.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{participated in}} action at <b>Bailor's</b> Farm on June 15, 1864, before {{taking part in}} the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign until December 17. The 6th served in the {{trenches}} around Petersburg up to June 18 and then did fatigue duty at Dutch Gap Canal until August 27, 1864. From there, the regiment moved to Deep Bottom and later participated in heavy action during the Battle of Chaffin's Farm at Fort Harrison on September 29 and September 30. After {{taking part in the}} Battle of Fair Oaks from October 27 to October 28, the unit returned to the trenches, this time near Richmond, where it remained until December 1864.|$|R
40|$|In Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., the United States Supreme Court {{recently}} reaffirmed its longstanding {{position that}} forfeiture statutes may be constitutionally applied to innocent property owners such as lessors, <b>bailors,</b> and secured creditors. The Court also held that seizure {{for purposes of}} forfeiture constitutes an 2 ̆ 2 extraordinary situation 2 ̆ 2 which justifies postponing notice and an adversary hearing. The decision overturned a lower court ruling which held the seizure and forfeiture to be unconstitutional on two distinct grounds: as a taking of property for government use without just compensation and as a taking of property without adequate notice and hearing. This Note argues that such seizure and forfeiture of beneficial property of innocent owners serves no legislative purpose and should be held unconstitutional. (The notice and hearing problems that accompany this procedure are {{beyond the scope of}} this article. ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{principle}} of Isaac v Clark (see immediately supra) was extended in Manders v. Williams [...] where {{the court found}} that a bailee had a bailment for a period of time, and not merely at the will of the <b>bailor.</b> In other words, there had to be an agreement, similar to a contractual arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the time}} of Bracton, despite the {{generality}} of the writ, the <b>bailor</b> of a chattel could only bring this action against the bailee of the chattel, or those who represent the bailee by testate or intestate succession. [...] Only two actions were available. [...] The plaintiff could claim, [...] "I lost the goods and you found them."; or [...] "I bailed the chattel to you." [...] The first of these was called detinue sur trover.|$|E
2500|$|In those days, {{action in}} detinue sur trover could not lie against a third party. If a person bailed his {{chattels}} to another, and that bailee wrongfully gave, sold or bailed the chattels {{to a third}} party, the only action was against the original bailee. Liability to the third bailee was not transferable. In later times, lawyers would talk of trover and bailment. In 1292, {{there was a slight}} tendency to regard the detainer rather than the bailment as the gist of the action, where it was stated [...] "it is not enough to say, 'you did not bail to me' , but one must add, 'and I do not detain it [...] from you.'" [...] But there are other later cases which show that it is impossible or at least extremely difficult for the <b>bailor</b> to fashion any count that will avail him against the third party. The third party was called the [...] "third hand".|$|E
5000|$|The 5th {{participated in}} the capture of City Point, Virginia, on May 4, 1864, and while in the city the {{regiment}} served fatigue duty, built Fort Converse on the Appomattox River, defended an attack against Fort Converse on May 20, and took part in Brigadier General Benjamin F. Butler's operations {{on the south side}} of the James River and against Petersburg and Richmond. The unit participated in action at <b>Bailor's</b> Farm on June 15, 1864, before taking part in the Richmond-Petersburg Campaign from June 16 to December 6, 1864. The 5th served in the trenches around Petersburg, seeing action there during the Battle of the Crater on July 30. [...] On August 28, 1864, the regiment moved to Deep Bottom in Henrico County, Virginia, and subsequently {{participated in the}} Battle of Chaffin's Farm and Fort Harrison from September 28 to September 30 and the Battle of Fair Oaks from October 27 to October 28 before returning to the trenches, this time near Richmond. Four men of the 5th Regiment received the Medal of Honor for their actions at Chaffin's Farm: Powhatan Beaty, James H. Bronson, Milton M. Holland, and Robert Pinn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes a {{thing is}} bailed to a person," [...] {{continued}} Rollo's father, [...] "for the benefit of both persons, the <b>bailor</b> and the bailee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, for nothing; {{without any}} pay. Perhaps the <b>bailor</b> {{has a right}} to claim his {{property}} again, at any time, if it is bailed gratuitously, though I am not certain. I will ask some lawyer when I have an opportunity. But when a thing is let for pay, or bailed on contract in any way, I am sure the <b>bailor</b> ought to leave it {{in the hands of the}} bailee, until the purpose is accomplished; or, at least, until there has been a fair opportunity to accomplish it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{repeated}} his father, [...] "now as this property was bailed to you {{solely for the}} advantage of the <b>bailor,</b> the question whether you ought to pay for the loss of it, depends on whether you was grossly careless, or not. If you took good ordinary care, and it was lost by accident, then you are not liable." ...|$|E
60|$|So Mary {{explained}} to him what her father had said. She told him, first, that whenever one boy intrusted his property of any kind to the hands of another boy, it was a bailment; and that the question whether the one who took the thing ought to pay for it, if it was lost, depended upon the degree of care he took of it, considered {{in connection with the}} question, whether the bailment was {{for the benefit of the}} <b>bailor,</b> or the bailee.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{remember}} that whenever any thing belonging to one boy is intrusted to another in any way, if {{it is for the}} benefit of the bailee, if any accident happens to it, he must make it good; unless it was some inevitable accident, which could not have been prevented by the utmost care. If it is {{for the benefit of the}} <b>bailor,</b> that is, the boy who intrusts it, then he can't require the other to pay for it, unless he was grossly negligent. And if it was for the common benefit of both, then if the bailee takes what may be called good care of it, he is not liable to pay; if he does not take good care, he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The law requires," [...] {{continued}} his father, [...] "that {{you should take}} greater care of any thing, if it is bailed to you for your benefit, than it does if {{it is for the}} benefit of the <b>bailor.</b> For instance, if you were to borrow James's knife for your own benefit, and were to lose it, even without any special carelessness, you ought to get him another; for it was solely for your advantage, that you took it, and so it ought to be at your risk. But if he asked you to take the knife to get it mended for his benefit; then, if you accidentally lose it, without any particular carelessness, you ought not to pay for it; for it was placed in your hands for his advantage, and so it ought to be at his risk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Rollo's father. [...] "There is a {{principle}} {{in the law}} of bailment which I did not explain to you the other day. It is this: Whenever a person bails a thing to another person, for a particular purpose, and receives a compensation for it, the <b>bailor</b> {{has no right to}} take it back again from the bailee, until a fair opportunity has been allowed to accomplish that purpose. For instance, if I go and hire a horse of a man to make a journey, I have a right to keep the horse until the journey is ended. If the owner of the horse meets me on the road, fifty miles from home, it is not reasonable, you see, that he {{should have the right to}} take the horse away from me there, on the ground that it is his horse, and that he has a right to him wherever he finds him. So, if one boy lends another his knife to make a whistle with, he ought not to take it away again, when the boy has got his whistle half done, and so make him lose all his labor." ...|$|E
