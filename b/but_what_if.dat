5|$|The mouse {{reference}} genome has {{at least}} 21 distinct Mup genes (with open reading frames), and a further 21 Mup pseudogenes (with reading frames disrupted by a nonsense mutation or an incomplete gene duplication). They are all clustered together, arrayed side by side across 1.92 megabases of DNA on chromosome 4. The 21 functional genes have been divided into two sub-classes based on position and sequence similarity: 6 peripheral Class A Mups, and 15 central Class B Mups. The central Class B Mup gene cluster formed {{through a number of}} sequential duplications from one of the Class A Mups. As all the Class B genes are almost identical to each other, researchers have concluded that these duplications occurred very recently in mouse evolution. Indeed, the repetitive structure of these central Mup genes means {{they are likely to be}} unstable and may vary in number among wild mice. The Class A Mups are more different from each other and are therefore likely to be more stable, older genes <b>but</b> <b>what,</b> <b>if</b> any, functional differences the classes have are unknown. The similarity between the genes makes the region difficult to study using current DNA sequencing technology. Consequently, the Mup gene cluster is one of the few parts of the mouse whole genome sequence with gaps remaining, and further genes may remain undiscovered.|$|E

The lengthy transition that has become standard when you change from one president to another could not begin because you didn't know who the new president was going to be. It was becoming a very serious problem. The issue before the United States Supreme Court is: having decided the case, having decided this is unconstitutional, should we nonetheless let the election go on? Or is it time cut it off and let's move on? ...|$|E

[...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E

2500|$|The theory {{underlying}} this [...] "exemption" [...] {{is derived}} from the nature of the hearsay rule itself. The hearsay rule operates to exclude extrajudicial assertions as untrustworthy because they cannot be tested by cross-examination. When an assertion is offered into evidence against the defendant and the defendant objects, [...] "hearsay", the defendant is in essence saying [...] "I object to this statement as untrustworthy because I am not afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the person who made it. How can we trust what he said?" [...] <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> the defendant is the person who made the statement that is now being offered against him? To object, [...] "hearsay" [...] in this circumstance would be as absurd as to argue, [...] "This statement is unreliable because I cannot cross-examine myself; therefore, how can I trust what I said?" [...] In this situation the objection of the Hearsay rule falls away, because the very basis of the rule is lacking, viz. the need and prudence of affording an opportunity of cross-examination. Another {{way of looking at it}} is that a defendant who faces his own statement being used against him has an opportunity to cross-examine himself – he can take the witness stand and explain his prior assertion, so the rule is satisfied.|$|E
2500|$|While Lynch {{was working}} on the first few episodes of Twin Peaks, his friend Monty Montgomery [...] "gave me a book that he wanted to direct as a movie. He asked if I would maybe be {{executive}} producer or something, and I said 'That's great, Monty, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?' And he said, 'In that case, you can do it yourself'." [...] The book was Barry Gifford's novel Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula, which told the tale of two lovers on a road trip. Lynch felt that it was [...] "just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] With Gifford's support, Lynch adapted the novel into a film called Wild at Heart, a crime and road movie starring Nicolas Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula. Describing his plot as a [...] "strange blend" [...] of [...] "a road picture, a love story, a psychological drama and a violent comedy", Lynch altered much from the original novel, changing the ending and incorporating numerous references to the classic film The Wizard of Oz. Despite receiving a muted response from American critics and viewers, it won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1989, Lynch had {{finished}} the pilot episode for the successful Twin Peaks television series and tried to rescue two of his projects – Ronnie Rocket and One Saliva Bubble – both involved in contractual complications {{as a result of}} Dino De Laurentiis' bankruptcy, which had been bought by Carolco Pictures. Lynch stated, [...] "I've had a bad time with obstacles... It wasn't Dino's fault, but when his company went down the tubes, I got swallowed up in that". Independent production company Propaganda Films commissioned Lynch to develop an updated noir screenplay based on a 1940s crime novel while Monty Montgomery, a friend of Lynch's and an associate producer on Twin Peaks, asked novelist Barry Gifford what he was working on. Gifford happened to be writing the manuscript for Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula but still had two more chapters to write. He let Montgomery read it in pre-published galley form while the producer was working on the pilot episode for Twin Peaks. Montgomery read it and two days later called Gifford and told him that he wanted to make a film of it. Two days afterwards, Montgomery gave Lynch Gifford’s book while he was editing the pilot, asking him if he would executive produce a film adaptation that he would direct. Lynch remembers telling him, [...] "That’s great Monty, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> I read it and fall in love with it and want to do it myself?" [...] Montgomery did not think that Lynch would like the book because he did not think it was his [...] "kind of thing." [...] Lynch loved the book and called Gifford soon afterwards, asking him if he could make a film of it. Lynch remembers, [...] "It was just exactly the right thing at the right time. The book and the violence in America merged in my mind and many different things happened." [...] Lynch was drawn to what he saw as [...] "a really modern romance in a violent world – a picture about finding love in hell," [...] and was also attracted to [...] "a certain amount of fear in the picture, as well as things to dream about. So it seems truthful in some way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>if</b> he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
