5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute to go. <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E
5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but instead of doing that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth choice at 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E

The capture of Venlo and Roermond, which was surrendered to the Cardinal-Infante a week later, effectively cut Maastricht from the Dutch Republic, thus preventing further attacks on the Spanish Netherlands from the east.
