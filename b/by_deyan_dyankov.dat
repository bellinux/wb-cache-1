The album's 2012 release added five additional tracks, {{most of which are}} the orchestral backing tracks of other songs. Filmtracks summed it up by saying [...] "for enthusiasts of boys' choirs and heartwarming, sentimental choral performances in general, The Chorus translates into a strong, albeit repetitive album." [...] The soundtrack topped the albums chart in France for 11 weeks and reached number three in Belgium, before its United States release in early 2005. Around the same time, the live album Les Choristes en concert {{was released}} on both CD and DVD.|$|R

500|$|The SIS {{building}} was positively critiqued <b>by</b> <b>Deyan</b> Sudjic in The Guardian in 1992 who {{described it as}} an [...] "epitaph for the [...] architecture of the eighties". Sudjic wrote that [...] "It's a design which combines high seriousness in its classical composition with a possible unwitting sense of humour. The building could be interpreted equally plausibly as a Mayan temple {{or a piece of}} clanking art deco machinery", and added that the most impressive thing about Farrell's design was the way he had not [...] "confined himself to a single idea" [...] as the building [...] "grows and develops as you move around it". In their 2014 Guide to London's Contemporary Architecture, Kenneth Allinson and Victoria Thornton wrote that [...] "Some see this building as Farrell's most controlled and mature building – a rich diet, certainly, but not a cacophony of rhetorical features, nor without the unselfconscious virtuosity which can uplift and excite. But it is undoubtedly too Gotham City for the taste of many. Farrell's many critics and opponents...would call it a nightmare: a secret service fortress, provided by a private speculator, designed by an avowed populist, and sited on a most prominent river location. Indubitably, it is a bizarre phenomenon".|$|R
