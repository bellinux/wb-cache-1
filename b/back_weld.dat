40|$|Exposure to welding gases {{can cause}} health adverse effects. Risk {{assessment}} {{is a useful}} tool for good assessment of exposed workers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the risk levels for exposed welders to welding gases. Welders (n= 239) were selected from Iranian Natural Gas Transmission Pipelines Industry from four regions in Iran including Assaluyeh, Omidieh, Loshan, and Borujen. Ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) samples were collected according to OSHA ID- 214 method and NIOSH analytical method 6014, respectively. Direct reading instruments were used for sampling of carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). A semi-quantitative method was used for risk assessment. Exposure to O 3, NO 2, CO, and CO 2 ranged 0 - 0. 0371, 0. 01 - 0. 58, 0. 375 - 4. 33, and 89. 5 - 1395. 44 ppm, respectively. Among welders, <b>Back</b> <b>weld</b> group had the maximum exposure to O 3, CO, CO 2, while the maximum exposure to NO 2 was seen for Filling group and then for <b>Back</b> <b>weld</b> group. Although average exposure values were significantly lower than Threshold Limit Values-Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA) (p< 0. 05), the results of risk assessment showed that, control approaches should be applied for welders specially in Full pass, Filling, Filling cap, and <b>Back</b> <b>weld</b> groups due to their medium (M) and high (H) rank of risk...|$|E

On the implementation of welding using SMAW welding type which is one method of welding is used widely in construction grafting techniques. In welding, there 2 ̆ 7 s common defects such as imperfections of root penetration, hardened and cracked. <b>Back</b> chipping or <b>welding</b> opponent {{needs to be done}} to avoid or fix things that often occur in the root weld. SMAW welding is one method which is widely used in construction grafting techniques. This study aims to determine the different test results with the depth of groove weld seam treatment chipping back to the tensile strength test also to determine micro structure.

40|$|AbstractX 7 Ni 9 {{steel plates}} (13 mm thickness) were welded using two {{processes}} with corresponding consumables, the filler metals are ERNiCrMo- 4 wire and ENiCrFe- 9 electrode respectively for the {{tungsten inert gas}} arc welding (TIG) and shield metal arc <b>welding</b> (SMAW). After <b>backing</b> <b>weld</b> of double-sided synchronous TIG, the regular TIG and SMAW will be carried out respectively to process the filling welding. The microstructures and mechanical properties of two kinds of joints are analyzed, the result shows that the impact energy at - 196 ̊C in different zones of two joints reach to 70 J and more, the lower heat input of TIG is more favorable for improving the impact toughness of joints. And the weld metal strength is lower than that of the base metal, but the transverse tensile strength all exceeds the lowest limit of the base metal, it indicated that the weld joint can achieve equal strength matching. Furthermore, the double-sided synchronous TIG could reduce the work of overhead welding for X 7 Ni 9, the welding appearance and the welding quality could be improved...|$|R

The mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the welded joint was also tested and studied. Results indicate that austenite and acicular ferrite distribute uniformly in the weld metal, which strengths the toughness and ductility of the joint. The austenite content in weld is higher than that in over-heated zone of S 31803. The SMAW joint structure is coarsening than that of GTAW and has more austenite content. It is also observed {{that there are a}} decarburization layer and a carbon-enriched zone nearby the fusion line. And very small amounts of the third phase of harmful metal phase are found in the fusion zone of S 31803 side. The welded joint shows the excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.

In Sanok in 2008, the company built one copy of the bus, which did not have any major stylist differences in between the Jelcz M083C. The bus became popular in Sweden. The serial production of the model Sancity Autosan A0808MN was launched in late 2008. The chassis has a long frame, which is integral with the structure. The body structure is built from stainless steel pipes joined together by welding. The outer structure has stainless steel panels and plastic on the front and the <b>back,</b> <b>welded</b> to the frame of the bus. The rear side flaps are made of aluminium. The bus has a possibility of including air conditioning and monitoring of the passenger compartment.

In {{view of the}} {{fracturing}} {{occurred at}} the welded joint of the belt conveyor roller while being in use in a coal mine of Fujian Province, the paper analyses the roller’s structure and stress in {{the basis of the}} transmission principle. It explores the reasons of the fracturing problem, and then proposes method to improve the roller’s welding technology. These are the cause of the roller fracturing，which the tension of the belt is great, and the roller itself is not strong enough, and welding process of steel plate is poor, and welding quality is not high. Use CO 2 and Ar mixed gas shielded arc <b>welding</b> to do <b>backing</b> <b>weld,</b> then use the welding method of automatic submerged arc welding. Finally the tempering to the welded joint part with the track-type far-infrared heater eliminate the welding residual stress.

50|$|Forge welding {{has been}} used {{throughout}} its history for making most any items out of steel and iron. It {{has been used}} in everything from the manufacture of tools, farming implements, and cookware to the manufacture of fences, gates, and prison cells. In the early Industrial Revolution, it was commonly used in the manufacture of boilers and pressure vessels, until the introduction of fusion-welding. It was commonly used through the Middle Ages for producing armor and weapons. One of the most famous applications of forge welding involves the production of pattern-welded blades. During this process a smith repeatedly draws out a billet of steel, folds it <b>back</b> and <b>welds</b> it upon itself. Another application was the manufacture of shotgun barrels. Metal wire was spooled onto a mandrel, and then forged into a barrel that was thin, uniform, and strong.

40|$|Abstract. In a welded structure, thick {{plates are}} joined by multi-pass welding in the butt joint. During the first pass of multi-pass welding, burn-through, lack of fusion, and {{incomplete}} penetration were readily found as weld defects. Accordingly, the backing condition should be carefully selected in welding of a thick plate, because improper backing conditions lead to weld defects. In the job site, a steel backing strip is usually adopted, although it reduces the fatigue strength. No backing conditions or removable backing is recommended to increase the fatigue strength, but selection of the proper <b>backing</b> and <b>welding</b> conditions is complicated. In this study, several backing methods, such as ceramic backing, water-cooled copper backing, and even the use of no backing, were investigated during GMA (Gas Metal Arc) welding of a thick steel plate.
