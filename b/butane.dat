5|$|There {{were three}} types of torches {{designed}} for use on the relay: a standard solid fuel powered torch made of aluminium, a special <b>butane</b> gas torch used onboard HMS Whitesand Bay, and a final torch used to enter Empire Stadium that was made of stainless steel and powered by a magnesium candle.|$|E
5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a <b>butane</b> torch.|$|E

5|$|Michael Bree's first {{victim was}} Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} <b>butane</b> gas addict {{whom he met}} at the Rainbow before killing her hours later. He {{is thought to have}} strangled her before setting her body on fire near a recreation ground. Three days later, he met mother-of-three Rosemary Corcoran at the same public house and drove her to a rural location, where he bludgeoned her to death and drove over the body. Then, as he drove home, he hit care worker Carol Jordan with his car and, fearing capture, beat her to death. All three bodies were discovered soon after the murders were carried out.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 2000, Smith met 21-year-old Jodie Hyde, a {{recovering}} <b>butane</b> gas addict from Alum Rock, Birmingham, at the Rainbow public house, {{and they were}} seen leaving together. He {{took her to a}} hospital appointment and later killed her. Prosecutors believed that he strangled her at his flat and dumped her body near a recreation ground near Golden Hillock Road in Sparkbrook, where he set it alight. The still-smouldering remains were discovered at 6:15am next morning (9 November) by two patrolling police officers. The body was barely recognisable and had to be identified using fingerprints. A subsequent post mortem concluded that she had been strangled before being rolled up in a carpet and set on fire.|$|E
5|$|The torch {{lighting}} ceremony {{took place}} on 17 July 1948 in Olympia, Greece. As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay, the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector, which then lit the first torch. The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos, Elis. She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia. In a symbolic gesture, the first runner, Corporal Dimitrelis of the Greek Army, laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand. The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as {{a gift from the}} Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins, for Princess Elizabeth. It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo, where at 7pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu. It stayed overnight in the city of Corfu, and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1:30pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped <b>butane</b> gas torch {{in order to ensure that}} there was a 48-hour lifespan available for the flame, despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours.|$|E
50|$|On an {{industrial}} scale, butadiene is prepared by thermal cracking of <b>butanes.</b> In a similarly non-selective process, dicyclopentadiene is obtained from coal tars.|$|R

5000|$|The {{conventional}} Merox {{process for}} extraction and removal of mercaptans from {{liquefied petroleum gases}} (LPG), such as propane, <b>butanes</b> and mixtures of propane and <b>butanes,</b> {{can also be used}} to extract and remove mercaptans from light naphthas. It is a two-step process. In the first step, the feedstock LPG or light naphtha is contacted in the trayed extractor vessel with an aqueous caustic solution containing UOP's proprietary liquid catalyst. The caustic solution reacts with mercaptans and extracts them. The reaction that takes place in the extractor is: ...|$|R
25|$|Separated from a gas stream, NGLs are an {{undifferentiated}} {{batch of}} light hydrocarbons — ethane, propane, <b>butane</b> and condensate. To separate them into more valuable individual products requires fractionation facilities. Fractionation towers separate {{a stream of}} mixed NGL feedstock into specification-grade ethane, propane, <b>butane</b> and condensate products.|$|E
25|$|In {{this form}} {{it is often}} mixed with small amounts of {{hydrogen}} sulfide and mercaptans which will give the unburned gas an offensive smell easily detected by the human nose. In this way, <b>butane</b> leaks can easily be identified. While hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans are toxic, they are present in levels so low that suffocation and fire hazard by the <b>butane</b> becomes a concern far before toxicity. Most commercially available <b>butane</b> also contains {{a certain amount of}} contaminant oil which can be removed through filtration but which will otherwise leave a deposit at the point of ignition and may eventually block the uniform flow of gas. Contaminants are not used in fragrance extraction and <b>butane</b> gasses can cause gas explosions in poorly ventilated areas if leaks go unnoticed and are ignited by spark or flame.|$|E
25|$|Propane and <b>butane</b> are gases at {{atmospheric}} pressure {{that can be}} liquefied at fairly low pressures and {{are commonly known as}} liquified petroleum gas (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles, <b>butane</b> in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays.|$|E
25|$|Adsorption process, using {{activated}} carbon or molecular sieves as the adsorbent. This process may have limited applicability {{because it is}} said to incur the loss of <b>butanes</b> and heavier hydrocarbons.|$|R

50|$|Merox is {{an acronym}} for {{mercaptan}} oxidation. It is a proprietary catalytic chemical process developed by UOP used in oil refineries and natural gas processing plants to remove mercaptans from LPG, propane, <b>butanes,</b> light naphthas, kerosene and jet fuel by converting them to liquid hydrocarbon disulfides.|$|R
25|$|Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs): when {{derived from}} methane, ethane, propane, and <b>butane,</b> these {{compounds}} have the respective formulae CFmH4−m, C2FmH6−m, C3FmH8−m, and C4FmH10−m, where m is nonzero.|$|E
25|$|When oxygen is plentiful, <b>butane</b> burns to form {{carbon dioxide}} and water vapor; when oxygen is limited, carbon (soot) or carbon {{monoxide}} may also be formed.|$|E
25|$|Propane and <b>butane</b> {{that have}} not been {{separated}} from the treated olefin pass through the unit. Although they do not participate directly in the reactions, and adversely impact product quality, they provide an avenue for organic fluorides to leave the unit. The propane stream is removed (typically in a tower called the HF stripper) and are then processed in the defluorinating section to remove combined fluorides and any trace acid that may be present due to mis-operation. Many units also remove <b>Butane,</b> which typically gets treated in a separate defluorinating section.|$|E

25|$|A {{small amount}} of {{nitrogen}} dioxide, a toxic gas, results from burning <b>butane</b> gas, along with any combustion in the earth's atmosphere, and represents a human health hazard from home heaters and stoves.|$|E
25|$|Sales of gas liquids were seldom {{difficult}} because of their ready use in oil refining. Refiners also used <b>butane</b> for blending. Propane, on the other hand, presented a challenge because the volumes available greatly exceeded demand.|$|E
25|$|Transporting VCM {{presents}} the same risks as transporting other flammable gases such as propane, <b>butane</b> (LPG) or natural gas (for which the same safety regulations apply).The equipment used for VCM transport is specially {{designed to be}} impact and corrosion resistant.|$|E
50|$|Before {{natural gas}} {{can be used}} as a fuel, it must be {{processed}} to remove impurities, including water, to meet the specifications of marketable natural gas. The by-products of this processing include ethane, propane, <b>butanes,</b> pentanes, and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide (which may be converted into pure sulfur), carbon dioxide, water vapor, and sometimes helium and nitrogen.|$|R

50|$|Methane {{clathrates}} (hydrates) {{are also}} commonly formed during natural gas production operations, when liquid water is condensed {{in the presence}} of methane at high pressure. It is known that larger hydrocarbon molecules like ethane and propane can also form hydrates, although longer molecules (<b>butanes,</b> pentanes) cannot fit into the water cage structure and tend to destabilise the formation of hydrates.|$|R
