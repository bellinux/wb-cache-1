In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E

500|$|Writing {{in retrospect}} for Daily Express, {{reviewer}} Simon Gage {{was critical of}} Minogue's lack of musical progression, charisma, and thought that she lacked a [...] "great voice". He stated [...] "There are dodgy tracks and the “voice”, more processed than a tinned pea, does start to grate but it’s still pretty good." [...] He awarded the box set three stars. British journalist Paul Du Noyer reviewed the box set, and complimented Minogue's Parlophone work as [...] "ambiguous pop". However, he stated [...] "There’s a lot of ambitious pop in here, but no conceptual overreach. Not even her experience of breast cancer was allowed to surface in Kylie’s subsequent material: lyrically, it was straight <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>business.</b> It seems unlikely such a 20-year lucky streak could be sustained {{without a lot of}} shrewd decisions by Minogue herself.
