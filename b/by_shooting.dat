40|$|To {{study the}} effects of soil Cu and {{salinity}} levels on uptake of micronutrients <b>by</b> <b>shoots</b> and roots of pistachio seedlings, a factorial experiment was carried out as completely randomized design with three replications in greenhouse of College of Agriculture, Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan, Iran, in May 2008. Treatments consisted of five salinity levels (0, 800, 1600, 2400 and 3200 mg NaCl per kg soil), four Cu levels (0, 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 mg Cu per kg soil) and two pistachio cultivars (Badami Zarand and Ghazvini). Results showed that salinity stress significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased the uptake of micronutrients including Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn <b>by</b> <b>shoots</b> and roots. Application of 5 mg Cu per kg soil significantly increased the uptake of Cu, Fe and Mn <b>by</b> <b>shoots,</b> but had no significant effect on Zn uptake <b>by</b> <b>shoots.</b> Application of 2. 5 mg Cu per kg soil significantly increased uptake of Cu, Fe and Mn by roots, while had no significant effect on Zn uptake by roots. In conclusion, the uptake of micronutrients in Badami Zarand cultivar was significantly higher than Ghazvini cultivar. Since trees suffer from deficiency of micronutrients in pistachio orchards, using Badami Zarand cultivar is recommended as pistachio rootstock...|$|R
5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored <b>by</b> <b>shooting</b> the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored <b>by</b> <b>shooting</b> the puck and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E

5|$|Alisia attacks <b>by</b> <b>shooting</b> {{streaks of}} {{lightning}} from her hands.

5|$|After {{five years}} of war and heavy {{attrition}} many of the Luftwaffe's pilots were inexperienced fledgelings and poorly trained, deficient in marksmanship and flight skills. There was a shortage of experienced instructors, {{and many of the}} training units were forced to fly front-line operations in order to bolster the front-line Jagdgeschwader. Long-range Allied fighters exacerbated this situation <b>by</b> <b>shooting</b> down many training aircraft. By late 1944 there were no safe areas in which pilots could be trained without the possibility of air attack. Allied personnel who witnessed the attacks frequently remarked on the poor aim of the strafing aircraft, and many of the Luftwaffe aircraft shot down by Allied anti-aircraft fire were caught because they were flying too slowly and too high. Aviation fuel supplies were also at a premium.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. This court handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death <b>by</b> <b>shooting.</b> The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E
