The performance of these structures during their lifetime depends on the durability of geotextile used.

40|$|Heron Island {{is a small}} coral cay on {{the western}} end of a large {{platform}} reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. In 1967 a boat access channel and a small mooring basin were dredged between the western reef-rim and the island. Since then reef-top currents have flowed out through this channel, removing sediment from the reef-flat and the island’s beaches. The mooring basin and access channel were enlarged in 1987. Offreef waves (hourly) and reef-top currents (at 10 minute intervals) were measured {{on either side of the}} island during a twelve month period (17 March 1996 – 18 March 1997). An initial analysis of the experimental data gathered during this period is presented in this report. Under mild (tidally dominated) conditions, maximum reef-top currents of about 0. 3 m/s occurred during ebb spring tides when flow on the reef-flat was controlled by weir action at the harbour <b>bund</b> <b>walls.</b> There were four current reversals per tidal cycle on the northern reef-flat and two on the southern reef-flat. As offreef wave heights increased, waves breaking on the reef-rims generated wave-generated flows towards the boat harbour and these became sufficiently strong to reverse and eventually suppress the tidal flow on the reef-top around the island. The wave height required to reverse the tidal flow increased with increasing tidal range. When offreef wave heights reached 3 m there were unidirectional flows from the reef-rims into the boat harbor throughout the tidal cycle. When tidal ranges were small, the magnitudes of the wave-generated currents increased approximately linearly with increasing wave heights.

40|$|Abstract Mining in Chingola Zambia started {{underground}} in 1931 and was catastrophically flooded and closed. The present Nchanga Underground Mine NUG {{started in}} 1937. The Nchanga Open Pit NOP mine started in 1955 situated {{to the west}} of NUG and partially overlying it. Open pit water control safety operations in the Nchanga-Chingola area have successfully enabled the safe extraction of millions of tonnes of copper ore annually over the past 60 years from NUG mining as well as the NOP. At the start Nchanga mining license surface already had NUG and many watershed divides with the Nchanga and Chingola streams being the main streams feeding into Zambias second largest river Kafue river and 42 of the year was characterised by heavy rains ranging between 800 mm to 1300 mm per annum. In this paper the presence of very significant amounts of seasonal rain and subsurface water in the mining area was identified as both a curse and a blessing. An excess in seasonal rain and subsurface water would disrupt both open pit and underground mining operations. In order for NOP to be operated successfully stable and free from flooding coping water management tactics were adopted from 1955 to 2015 including 1. Underground mine pump chamber pumping system 2. Piezometer instrumented boreholes 3. Underground mine 1500 -ft sub-haulage east borehole dewatering beneath the open pit 4. Nchanga and Chingola stream diversionary tunnel and open drains 5.

40|$|Fish assemblages in two {{floodplain}} sub-catchments of the Burdekin River, north Queensland, {{were examined}} over two years, {{in relation to}} habitat condition water quality {{and the effects of}} habitat rehabilitation. The main study sites were located along Sheep Station Ck and Warren’s Gully which are overflow channels or sub-catchments of the Burdekin delta. Artificially high flows are maintained in these streams as water from the Burdekin River is pumped through them to supply downstream irrigation needs. In general, the study sites were moderately to highly impacted by riparian clearing, modified flow regimes and weed infestations. Weed infestations appeared to be linked with the imposition of a modified flow regime as remnant sites had far less cover of weeds than sites with modified flow. Sites in the upper floodplain, Burdekin River and Barratta Ck had highest habitat values. Water quality was highly variable across sites, streams and over time. Oxygen concentration was identified as a major determinant of fish diversity, so the dynamics of dissolved oxygen were a major focus of this study. Flow, habitat condition and weed infestation were identified as the main drivers of oxygen in the streams. The introduced Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) had a major impact on oxygen as it essentially blocks oxygen exchange with the water. Modified flows appear to benefit weed growth, through continuous nutrient supply. Loss of riparian habitat improves growing conditions for weeds and increases water temperature, further impacting oxygen content in the water. Habitat condition had a major influence on fish assemblages. Species richness and abundance were highest in sites of good habitat condition. Sites within the distribution systems (Sheep Station Ck and Warren’s Gully) had the most impacted fish assemblages. The abundances of exotic species (both real and relative) decreased with increase in habitat condition. The most abundant fish species were (i) small, highly tolerant gudgeons, (ii) the introduced Mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki) and (iii) larger Tarpon (Megalopes cyprinoides), which is a facultative air breather. The small species appeared to favour degraded lagoon habitats but it appears that as habitat condition improves and more predatory species occur, the abundance of these small species decreases. During the sampling period a local project was initiated using an aquatic weed harvester to remove weed infestations from lagoons on Sheep Station Ck Weeds were harvested from Payard’s Lagoon in August 2000. Three samples were taken before weed removal and six after weed removal to examine temporal changes in fish assemblages and water quality. There was an immediate improvement in oxygen content in the month after weed removal and this improvement persisted for a further year. The abundance of native fish species increased rapidly after weed removal. Gudgeons were the most abundant. Over the study period these abundances gradually declined due largely to the re-colonisation by predators, previously excluded from the lagoon by poor habitat and water quality condition. A number of species moved into the experimental site from a refuge site in the inlet and during a flood event. The most notable of these species is Bony bream (Nematalosa erebi), a species that is very intolerant of hypoxia. As more natural native habitat conditions re-established, the abundance of exotic species (G. holbrooki) decreased. However, fish assemblages could not fully return to natural because of combined barriers to access by estuarine species (e. g., flow control devices, <b>bund</b> <b>walls</b> and hypoxic lagoons), and poor linkage to remnant refuges...|$|R

Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations and associated increases in air and sea temperatures, rising sea level, changes in oceanic circulation, rainfall patterns and frequency and intensity of storms are highly likely to affect the physiology, ecology and ultimately the stability of wetland habitats (Table 9. 1). The intertidal position of mangroves, salt marshes and salt flats makes them particularly vulnerable to changes in sea level, although other climate change factors will also exert a strong influence on wetland communities (Table 9. 1). Past rises in sea level have led to increases {{in the area of}} mangroves in northern Australia 186. However, past climate change has occurred with limited human modification of the coast compared to current levels of development. Human activities have resulted in loss of wetlands, disruption to connectivity, enhanced availability of nutrients, changed sediment dynamics and the creation of structures that will prevent landward migration of wetlands with sea level rise (eg roads, berms, <b>bunds</b> and sea <b>walls).</b> Many of these human impacts will reduce the resilience of intertidal wetlands to climate change.

40|$|Acid sulfate soils {{occur in}} dynamic and geomorphologically complex inland and coastal landscapes that are {{inherently}} susceptible to natural and human induced changes. These changes {{can lead to}} environmental degradation and loss of infrastructure through acidification of soil and water and metal mobilisation. This study has identified and described the interrelationships between acid sulfate soil materials and their geomorphic environment, composition (pedology, mineralogy), redox status and geochemistry, and potential environmental hazards, within a complex estuarine landscape in the Barker Inlet region, north of Adelaide, South Australia. For this purpose two study sites were chosen within Barker Inlet, namely Gillman and St Kilda. The Gillman site was chosen because it was known to have problem acid sulfate soils with sulfuric material and was ideally suited for comparative research because it contained “paired sites” with intertidal soils abutting an area that had been reclaimed for industrial development. The reclaimed land at Gillman was non-tidal due {{to the construction of}} <b>bund</b> <b>walls</b> 75 years ago. An intertidal site at St Kilda was selected as a control site and to assess the influence of tidal variations on soil properties. The aims of this study were to: (i) conduct detailed field and laboratory examinations to characterise the range of soil types occurring across the tidal and disturbed (formerly tidal) landscapes, (ii) construct detailed soil maps to relate the data spatially to hazards associated with soil types and landscape features within the study sites, and (iii) construct descriptive and predictive conceptual soil-regolith models to validate and increase understanding of environmental degradation processes occurring within these complex acid sulfate soil landscapes. A review of the natural history and previous research work was conducted in conjunction with a preliminary soil survey of the Gillman and St Kilda study sites and these indicated that areas most vulnerable to contamination and acidification were geomorphically controlled. Detailed soil surveys were then conducted to target the typical landscape features at the study sites (i. e. focus areas). Detailed acid sulfate soil characterisation and mapping of soil types within the focus areas allowed surface cover types from aerial photography {{to be used as a}} surrogate for accurately mapping acid sulfate soil types. Soil maps were produced, in this manner, covering the two study sites. For management purposes, this enabled map units to be assigned descriptive properties that included ‘hazard classes’ and ‘acid sulfate soil treatment categories’. New, in-situ soil redox monitoring methods were developed to reliably measure Eh in 14 selected soil profiles over extended periods of time within contrasting tidal and non-tidal environments. Redox data loggers continuously recorded redox measurements at depth increments ranging from + 10 cm (surface water) to 2 m below the soil surface. Results showed that significant changes in redox status occurred at sub-hourly timeframes in both tidal and non-tidal soils. Tidal environments were characterised by large, cyclic fluctuations in redox conditions, which were proportional to the timing and strength of tidal currents. When freely draining mangrove soils were exposed at low tide, redox conditions generally became more oxidising. However, soil that remained submerged in tidal creeks during low tide become more reducing due to less movement and mixing of surface water. Storm events and seasonal variations influenced soil and water redox conditions for non-tidal environments (i. e. reclaimed land at the Gillman site). Redox conditions within some sulfuric materials alternated seasonally between oxidising and strongly reducing, causing oxidation and subsequent re-formation of pyrite. Storm-related disturbance of subaqueous soils at Gillman initially caused redox potential (Eh) in the water column to decrease, due to the dispersion of monosulfidic material. Developing the ability to link soil and water contaminant issues to soil map units was particularly important for the non-tidal area at Gillman because elevated concentrations of potentially toxic elements (As, Ba, Co, Cu, Pb, V and Zn) were identified and these were related to historic land use (industrial) and landforms. Results indicated that trace metals were concentrated in surface soil layers of the more elevated areas containing sulfuric material as well as in low lying areas containing monosulfidic material. Trace metals were more concentrated at depth in soil profiles at Gillman that were subjected to seasonal flooding. This is due to redox conditions in the upper portion of the soil profile alternating seasonally from oxidising to reducing, and causing trace metals to accumulate at the summer redox front where iron sulfides remain stable as well as form during wet months. Acidic soil conditions promoted migration down the profile of trace elements, which were scavenged by salt efflorescences that formed on soil surfaces near the water table. Dissolution of salt efflorescences following rain events negatively impacted drainage water quality, mainly by release of Al, Fe and acidity. Salt efflorescence mineralogy was a result of characteristic Mediterranean type climate, hydrogeology, saline seepages, and salt crusting formed in drains above sandy sulfuric, hypersulfidic and hyposulfidic materials. This study documented the first occurrence of sideronatrite [Na₂Fe(SO₄) ₂(OH). 3 H₂O], tamarugite [NaAl(SO₄) ₂. 6 H₂O] and alunogen in coastal acid sulfate soils in Australia. They formed together with starkeyite, pentahydrite, gypsum and some halite on the exposed face of soil pits and drains at Gillman. These Fe/Al oxyhydroxysulfate and oxyhydroxide minerals are indicators of very acidic soil conditions (i. e. indicate the presence or former presence of oxidised pyrite), and as such their identification provides an important environmental indicator of acid sulfate soil processes. Descriptive and predictive soil regolith models were constructed to describe and explain the origin of these minerals at the Gillman study site. The models were tested by constructing experimental drains through sulfuric material at the Gillman site. Micromorphological studies helped to identify features indicative of contemporary and relic processes within acid sulfate soils and verify soil characteristics within tidal and non-tidal environments. The results indicated that micro-environments of pyrite oxidation can control bulk soil pH, particularly in sandy soil profiles with little buffering capacity. The varied morphology and composition of pyrite crystals and framboids, and goethite pseudomorphs after pyrite, were used as palaeo-indicators of the soil physio-chemical conditions. The morphology and composition of pyrite oxidation products indicated oxidation rates and carbonate availability. Microanalysis of sulfidic materials and sulfide oxidation products (including salt efflorescences) assisted in identifying migration pathways of trace elements through the landscape. The preservation of pyrite crystals within oxidising environments was identified to occur by armouring with clay coatings and by pyrite framboids being overgrown by (or included within) gypsum and halite crystals. Armouring of pyrite in soils has implications for the characterisation of acid sulfate soil types using ageing experiments, as well as for hazard assessment and management, by underestimating the potential sulfidic acidity of some soil materials. The development of descriptive and predictive conceptual soil-regolith models was based on the integration of all results to provide a holistic understanding of the coastal landscape and the impact of acid sulfate soils on the environment. The information and mapping techniques developed here were used to construct local and regional scale acid sulfate soil hazard maps. This information was used in the production of Coastal Protection Board policy documents and educational material underpinning risk-based acid sulfate soil management options for coastal developments in South Australia, and was specifically integrated into new master development plans for the Gillman area.
