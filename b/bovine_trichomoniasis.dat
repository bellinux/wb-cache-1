40|$|Trichomonas vaginalis and Tritrichomonas foetus are {{important}} extracellular protozoans that cause, respectively, human and bovine venereal diseases.

The state of animal health in live stock cattle changed significantly {{during the course of the}} study period. In the beginning epidemics and venereal diseases were the most important cattle diseases, whereas towards the end, non-infectious diseases, particularly nutritional disorders, and multifactorial infectious diseases took this place. <b>Bovine</b> tuberculosis, brucellosis, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> vibriosis and warble fly infestation were eradicated in the GDR from 1946 to 1989. A significant relationship can be established between the development of agriculture and the main foci of diseases. Freestall housing, the foundation of large-scale live stock enterprises and industrialized cattle production caused specific animal health problems. Control of economically significant cattle diseases in the GDR was performed by an extensive public veterinary service under central government guidance and coordination. The efficiency of this system was high, especially in controlling epidemics, but it was restricted to the limited economic capacities of the GDR. The control of animal epidemics and parasitoses was mainly performed in an administrative manner. Area sanitation programmes were successfully applied for tuberculosis, brucellosis, warble fly infestation, mastitis agalactiae and leucosis. It was shown, that set-backs in controlling animal epidemics were often caused by uncertainties in diagnostic measures. To supervise the herd health situation relative to fertility and metabolic herd health, specific procedures were developed and applied in large live stock farms.

In the second and third chapters, we studied the interaction of C. fetus subsp. venerealis and T. foetus with epithelial cells in vitro respectively. The kinetics of CXCL 8 transcription in microorganisms were evaluated by RT-PCR using epithelial cells: HeLa, MDBK, HEK 293, HEK 293 -TLR 2, HEK 293 -TLR 4 /MD- 2, after infection kinetics, with the use of specific primers for CXCL 8, TLR 2, TLR 4, MD- 2.

In vitro, several virulence factors similar to those of T. vaginalis have been studied, including cysteine proteinases, binding of host cell proteins, and factors involved in attachment to vaginal cells.

40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} disease caused by the flagellated protozoan Tritrichomonas foetus. A protective surface antigen was previously identified and immunoaffinity purified from T. foetus isolate D 1 with cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) TF 1. 15 and TF 1. 17 (BonDurant, R. H., R. R. Corbeil, and L. B. Corbeil, Infect. Immun. 61 : 1385 - 1394, 1993). This antigen elicited antibody responses in the serum and cervicovaginal mucus of heifers. Thus, {{it may be useful}} as an immunodiagnostic reagent as well as a subunit vaccine. Conservation of the antigen in all strains would be crucial for either application. We investigated the conservation of this antigen among 36 isolates of T. foetus from Argentina, Costa Rica, and the United States using MAbs TF 1. 15 and TF 1. 17 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MAb TF 1. 17 reacted with 32 of the 36 isolates, whereas MAb TF 1. 15 reacted with all of the isolates tested. One of the isolates which did not react with MAb TF 1. 17 (i. e., D 1 # 3) was investigated further by Western blotting (immunoblotting) to determine the reason for the lack of reactivity with one of the two cross-reactive MAbs. The antigenic band that was reactive with MAb TF 1. 15 had a molecular mass slightly lower than that of the corresponding band from isolate D 1, which reacted with both MAbs TF 1. 15 and TF 1. 17. Thus, at least a major portion of the antigen appeared to be conserved. This was confirmed in a study of heifers infected with isolate D 1 # 3. The vaginal immunoglobulin A antibodies of these infected heifers reacted with the antigen of isolate D 1 that was immunoaffinity purified with MAb TF 1. 17. Therefore, even though the epitope recognized by MAb TF 1. 17 was missing in the challenge isolate (D 1 # 3), the heifers developed an immune response {{to the rest of the}} molecule. These results indicate that the major portion of the previously described protective antigen is conserved in different isolates of T. foetus. This portion contains the epitope that reacts with MAb TF 1. 15. Most isolates express the whole antigen, which possesses both TFl. 15 and TF 1. 17 epitopes, but the few isolates that are missing the portion containing the TF 1. 17 epitope may still elicit an immune reponse to the conserved portion.

The molecular pathways that are important in initiating host inflammatory and immune responses to T. vaginalis are poorly understood. Here we report interactions of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells with the most abundant cell surface glycoconjugate of the parasite, the T. vaginalis lipophosphoglycan (LPG).

Ninety-seven BALB/c mice were inoculated intravaghally with 8. 0 x 1 O 5 Tritrichomonas foetus organisms, {{using either}} isolate ATCC 30003 or field isolate MU Y 2 2 2 days after estrogenization with 15 gg 17 P-estradiol. Reproductive tracts were {{examined}} at several time points post-inoculation to determine gross and histologic responses to trichomonad infection {{as compared to}} estrogenized, uninfected control animals. The two isolates varied greatly in ability to maintain chronic infection; no ATCC 30003 -inoculated animals remained culture-positive beyond 7 weeks post-inoculation, whereas MU Y 22 -inoculated animals were infected for greater than 26 weeks. Lesions were seen in 40 - 60 °/o of animals prior to 10 weeks post-inoculation and included moderate uterine dilation and glandular atrophy, uterine gland abscesses, pyometra, intramural peri-vascular lymphoid infiltrates, and ovarian bursitis. The severity of lesions was independent of the T. foetus isolate. Lesions became more severe at 10 weeks post-inoculation, and at 10 and 26 weeks post-inoculation, lesions were seen in 60 % and 75 % of animals, respectively. In addition to lesions described above, epithelial changes were marked at these late necropsies, including ulceration, flattening, hypertrophy, and squamous metaplasia.

40|$|A better {{method for}} {{diagnosis}} of <b>bovine</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> is needed because culture {{is slow and}} somewhat lacking in sensitivity. Immunodiagnosis of Tritrichomonas foetus infection usually involves detection of antigen-antibody reactions with an anti-immunoglobulin conjugate. However, nonspecific immunoglobulin (Ig), bound {{to the surface of}} T. foetus, would also be detected by an anti-Ig conjugate and thus would interfere with the specificity of the immunoassay. The goals of this study were to define the binding of bovine immunoglobulin to T. foetus. To determine whether nonimmune binding of Ig to T. foetus occurs, we immunized rabbits with organisms that had been grown in medium containing normal bovine serum and vigorously washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The rabbit antiserum had similar titers to T. foetus and to normal bovine serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, two bovine serum proteins were immunoprecipitated by the rabbit antiserum in an immunoelectrophoretogram. One of the serum proteins had a distribution characteristic of IgG 2. The rabbit antiserum was then shown to react with purified bovine IgG and IgM by ELISA. Reactivity to IgG was greater. To identify the IgG subisotypes bound and to confirm nonimmune binding of Ig, we grew T. foetus in agammaglobulinemic fetal calf serum and reacted it with IgGl, IgG 2, and IgM specific for dinitrophenol (DNP) in ELISA. The binding of IgG 2 was greatest, that of IgGl was next, and that of IgM was least. Little competitive inhibition by DNP was detected...|$|E

The hypothesis that IgE and mast cell degranulation {{play a role in}} clearance was tested in 25 virgin heifers inseminated experimentally and infected intravaginally with T. foetus strain D 1 at estrus and cultured weekly. Groups were euthanatized at 3, 6, 9, or 12 weeks, when tissues were fixed and secretions were collected for culture and antibody analysis. Immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to a soluble lipophosphoglycan (LPG) –containing surface antigen (TF 1. 17) demonstrated antigen uptake by uterine epithelial cells. Lymphoid nodules were detected below antigen-positive epithelium. Little IgG 2 antibody was detected but IgG 1, IgA, IgM, and IgE T. foetus–specific antibodies increased in uterine secretions at weeks 6 and 9 after infection. This was inversely proportional to subepithelial mast cells numbers and most animals cleared the infection by the sampling time after the lowest mast cell count. Furthermore, soluble antigen was found in uterine epithelium above inductive sites (lymphoid nodules). Cross-linking of IgE on mast cells by antigen and perhaps LPG triggering appears to have resulted in degranulation. Released cytokines may account for production of predominantly Th 2 (IgG 1 and IgE) and IgA antibody responses, which are related to clearance of the infection...|$|E
40|$|Trichomoniasis is a widespread, {{economically}} important {{venereal disease}} of cattle which causes infertility and abortion. Effective control of trichomoniasis has been impeded by the insensitivity of traditional diagnostic procedures, which require the isolation and cultivation of the parasite, Tritrichomonas foetus, from infected cattle. We developed a 0. 85 -kb T. foetus DNA probe by identifying conserved sequences in DNAs from T. foetus that were isolated from cattle in California, Idaho, Nevada, and Costa Rica. The probe hybridized specifically to DNAs of T. foetus isolates from different geographic areas {{but not to}} DNA preparations of Trichomonas vaginalis, bovine cells, or a variety of bacteria from cattle. The probe detected DNA from a minimum of 10 (5) T. foetus organisms. To improve sensitivity, a partial sequence of the probe was used to identify oligonucleotide primers (TF 1 and TF 2) {{which could be used}} to amplify a 162 -bp product from T. foetus DNAs by PCR. A chemiluminescent internal T. foetus sequence probe was hybridized to Southern blots of the amplification product.

Analysis of 52 clinical samples showed that 47 (90. 4 %) of the 52 samples were correctly identified, with no false-positive reactions.

40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> is a {{prevalent}} {{sexually transmitted}} disease of cattle caused by the protozoan Tritrichomonas foetus. Currently, diagnosis is most often made by culture. In order to provide a faster immunodiagnostic approach, a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was investigated. A protective surface antigen (TF 1. 17 antigen) of T. foetus was immunoaffinity purified and used in an ELISA to detect antibodies in vaginal mucus from heifers inoculated with T. foetus. In preliminary studies, antibodies of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype were detected in mucus from all experimentally infected heifers which were tested at 6 weeks postinoculation, whereas IgG 1 and IgG 2 were not. In addition, IgA responses detected in postinoculation samples were all greater than those detected in preinoculation samples, unlike those detected by a whole-cell antigen ELISA. For these two reasons, IgA antibodies appeared to be useful diagnostically. Further investigation of IgA antibodies used vaginal mucus collected weekly from heifers inoculated intravaginally with 10 (2), 10 (4), or 10 (6) T. foetus organisms. Heifers with positive cultures for T. foetus had similar IgA responses to TF 1. 17 antigen over the 10 weeks of infection regardless of the initial inoculum dose. This indicates that if the dose is sufficient to establish infection, the magnitude and duration of the immune response are no longer dependent on dose. All of the infected animals receiving all dosages responded with high absorbance values in the IgA anti-TF 1. 17 antigen ELISA by 6 weeks postinoculation, and all absorbance values remained high at 10 weeks.

Antibody specific for a 190, 000 -Da surface complex (Tf 190) was previously shown to inhibit this adhesion. In this study we used immunoaffinity chromatography to purify Tf 190 from T. foetus in order to analyze its composition and examine its expression. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified Tf 190 followed by silver staining revealed three components of Tf 190. Western blotting and antibody-binding experiments showed that the 140 - and 60 -kDa bands were immunogenic. By using a battery of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) periodate-sensitive epitopes were identified on Tf 190, suggesting that these epitopes contained carbohydrate structures. Analyses of affinity-purified Tf 190 by high-performance liquid chromatography and gas-liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of the monosaccharides and lipids known to be prominent constituents of the lipophosphoglycan (LPG) of T. foetus. Flow cytometry experiments on several isolates of T. foetus with Tf 190 -specific antibodies revealed that Tf 190 was present on subpopulations of all isolates but that not all epitopes were present on every isolate. This pattern of reactivities on the different parasite isolates was confirmed by Western blots of whole-parasite extracts probed with MAbs and antiserum. These results suggest that although variation in the expression of epitopes of Tf 190 occurs in different strains of T. foetus, the Tf 190 adhesion complex is widespread in different populations of the parasite. The data further suggest that immunogenic structures, important in the adhesion of T. foetus to mammalian cells, are located in the LPG-like component of Tf 190...|$|E
40|$|Tritrichomonas foetus is {{a serious}} {{veterinary}} pathogen, causing <b>bovine</b> <b>trichomoniasis,</b> a sexually transmitted disease leading to infertility and abortion. T. foetus infects the mucosal surfaces of the reproductive tract. Infection with T. foetus leads to apoptotic cell death of bovine vaginal epithelial cells (BVECs) in culture. An affinity-purified cysteine protease (CP) fraction yielding on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa (CP 30) also induces BVEC apoptosis. Treatment of CP 30 with the protease inhibitors TLCK (Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone) and E- 64 [l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamide-(4 -guanido) -butane] greatly reduces induction of BVEC apoptosis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of CP 30 reveals a single peak with a molecular mass of 23. 7 kDa. Mass spectral peptide sequence analysis of proteolytically digested CP 30 reveals homologies to a previously reported cDNA clone, CP 8 (D. J. Mallinson, J. Livingstone, K. M. Appleton, S. J. Lees, G. H. Coombs, and M. J. North, Microbiology 141 : 3077 - 3085, 1995). Induction of apoptosis is highly species specific, since the related human parasite Trichomonas vaginalis and associated purified CPs did not induce BVEC death. Fluorescence microscopy along with the Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS assay and flow cytometry analyses were used to detect apoptotic nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, and changes in plasma membrane asymmetry in host cells undergoing apoptosis in response to T. foetus infection or incubation with CP 30. Additionally, the activation of caspase- 3 and inhibition of cell death by caspase inhibitors indicates that caspases are involved in BVEC apoptosis. These results imply that apoptosis {{is involved in the}} pathogenesis of T. foetus infection in vivo, which may have important implications for therapeutic interference with host cell death that could alter the course of the pathology in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tritrichomonas foetus, a {{parasite}} {{well known for}} its significance as a venereally transmitted pathogen in cattle, {{has been identified as}} a cause of chronic large bowel diarrhea in domestic cats in many countries of the world. In Brazil, several studies on the diagnosis of <b>bovine</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> have been performed, but until now, no study was made regarding feline trichomoniasis. Thus, this is the first study to report the occurrence of T. foetus and Pentatrichomonas hominis in cats using morphological and molecular analysis. Feces from 77 cats were examined, four of which (5. 2 %) were positive for the presence of parabasalids. Morphological analysis of stained smears revealed piriform trophozoites showing the three anterior flagella, elongated nucleus and axostyle ending abruptly in fillet, characteristic of T. foetus. In scanning and transmission electron microscopy, identification characters similar to those previously reported for T. foetus were observed. The cultures containing trophozoites were submitted for molecular analysis, which resulted positive for T. foetus DNA using specific primers (TFR 3 and TFR 4), and all samples were positive and subjected to sequencing in which they showed 99. 7 - 100 % similarity with another isolate sequencing of T. foetus (JX 960422). Although no trophozoite with consistent morphology of P. hominis has been visualized in the samples, differential diagnosis was performed using specific primers for P. hominis (TH 3 and TH 5) amplicon. In three of the four samples (3. 89 %) sequencing revealed 100 % similarity when compared with another sequence of P. hominis deposited in Genbank (KC 623939). Therefore, the present study revealed through the diagnostic techniques employed the simultaneous infection by T. foetus and P. hominis in the feces of cats. However, it was necessary to use more than one technique for the diagnosis of the co-infection. These results demonstrate the importance of a correct diagnosis to allow an appropriate treatment by the veterinarian...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> is a venereal {{infection}} {{that reduces the}} fecundity of cattle. It is caused by Trichomonas foetus, a flagellated protozoan which inhabits the genital tract, causing inflammation and partial sterility. Both sexes are susceptible to infection. In females it is usually of short duration and frequently terminates sponaneously following abortion. In males the disease has both acute and chronic stages. During the acute stage the prepucial membranes become inflamed and a muco-purulent discharge develps in which trichomonads are abundant. In the following chronic stage symptoms disappear, but the animal remains a carrier and is a dangerous source of infection to healthy cows. Diagnosis is made by examining the material from infect organs for the specific parasite. The cell body of Trichomonas foetus is fusiform or napiform. It varies from 9 to 20 microns in length, and from 3 to 7 microns in width. Its salient features are an undulating membrane and 4 flagella arising from the blepharoplast, 3 of which are anterior and free, the fourth proceeds caudad bordering the undulating membrane for its entire length and projecting unattached behind. By means of the flagella and undulating membrane the organism move jerkily through an irregular course, as is characteristic of the genus Trichomonas. Dovine trichomoniasis has a wide geographic distribution. In Europe {{it has been reported}} from Italy, France, Germany, Holland, and England. Futamura has reported it from Japan. In the United States the infection is known to be present in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Texas, Michigan, California, and Utah. Survey work done in Utah {{under the direction of the}} Utah Agricultural Experiment Station includes examination of herds in Cache, Utah, Davis, Sanpete, and Sevier Counties. Infections were found present in all counties where examinations were made except Sevier. Because of unrestricted commerce of cattle among the important live-stock centers, it is supposed that trichomoniasis is widely spread and probably exists in some cattle in the majority of the counties of the state...|$|E
