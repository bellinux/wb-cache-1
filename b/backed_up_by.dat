5|$|His career {{features}} {{many examples}} of indiscipline, including on-pitch scuffles with other players. which at times threatened to overshadow his achievements. Jack O'Connor, Kerry's manager in the 2005 All-Ireland final, suggested in his autobiography that Canavan tackled Colm Cooper off the ball, preventing him getting into a goal-scoring position, a claim <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Sunday Tribune journalist, Kieran Shannon.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese force lacked for transport, {{engineer}} and logistical support and was hampered {{by a lack}} of cohesion due to its disparate command structure and poor infrastructure. In contrast, the Australian force had fought together in previous campaigns and was <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a formidable logistical support base that could deliver them a technological and industrial superiority that the Japanese were unable to match.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{fleet of}} 150 ships {{including}} 60 horse transports set off towards the Byzantine Empire {{at the end}} of May 1081.

Secondary {{electrical system}}s were 28V DC, single-phase 115V AC at 1600Hz, and three-phase 115V AC at 400Hz, driven by transformers and inverters from the main system. The 28V DC system was <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a single 24V battery.|$|E

5|$|This {{inequality}} further offended {{the smaller}} countries. Finally, this inequality {{also meant that}} the minority rights were not seen as a universal right; it was exclusively a foreign policy issue, and thus populations that had no state to back up their claims were relatively disadvantaged when compared to ones <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a powerful state or group of interests.|$|E
5|$|Paul Roma began feuding with The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) {{during the}} July 21, 1990, episode of WWF Superstars. Roma was {{attacked}} after a match by Dino Bravo; when The Rockers {{came to the}} ring for the following match, Roma accused them of attacking him. The argument turned physical, and Roma was <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> Hercules. One week later, Roma and Hercules appeared on the Brother Love Show, an interview segment, and announced that they had formed a tag team known as Power and Glory. A match between the two teams was later scheduled for SummerSlam.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} barrier {{was to be}} <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> air-dropped and hand-emplaced acoustic and seismic sensors that would provide both warning and location of enemy movements. A scientific group was established to find or develop the technology for what was initially titled Practice Nine. On 17 June 1967 {{the title of the}} program was altered to Illinois City and on 15 July to Dyemarker, the electronic barrier portion of which was designated Muscle Shoals. In June 1968 it was renamed for the last time, becoming Operation Igloo White.|$|E

5|$|There are differing {{levels of}} {{qualification}} that the ambulance crew may hold, from holding no formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board. Most ambulance services require at least two crew members to be on every ambulance (one to drive, and one to attend the patient), although response cars may have a sole crew member, possibly <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> another double-crewed ambulance. It {{may be the case}} that only the attendant need be qualified, and the driver might have no medical training. In some locations, an advanced life support ambulance may be crewed by one paramedic and one EMT-Basic.|$|E
5|$|Chuck and Hartley go to Volkoff Industries, and Hartley reveals to Vivian {{that he went}} {{undercover}} voluntarily, {{resulting in}} his transformation into the villainous Volkoff. Chuck gives up the discs from Casey so Vivian and her father can start a new life. Chuck returns with the antidote to Burbank, California, where Decker is waiting for him. A standoff occurs, but as Chuck is <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> a superior force made up of his friends, family, the C.A.T. Squad (Mini Andén and Mercedes Masöhn), and Volkoff's Spetsnaz paratroopers, Decker is forced to stand down. Using the information about Alexei as leverage against Decker, Chuck delivers the antidote.|$|E
5|$|Claudette wobbled to the {{northwest}} over the Gulf of Mexico and gradually restrengthened. Upper-level winds steadily decreased, and Claudette again became a hurricane late on July 14. Just prior to landfall, it strengthened quickly and picked up its forward motion in a more westerly direction, striking Port O'Connor, Texas, on July 15 as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with 90mph (150km/h) winds. Residents along and inland of the central Texas coast were caught off guard both by its intensity and its time of arrival. The hurricane was projected to make landfall in the evening hours of July 15, but instead came ashore before noon. Furthermore, some initial estimates suggested that Claudette had reached Category2 status, with sustained winds of up to 100mph (155km/h); these were based on unofficial observations which were not <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> official data.|$|E
50|$|It is an {{open-source}} project hosted on SourceForge {{and implemented}} by many open-source Unix-like operating systems.

50|$|Teaford {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Tampa Bay Rays on January 16, 2015. He was {{designated}} for assignment on April 28, 2015.

5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|It still {{came as a}} {{shock to}} the Special Forces troopers at Lang Vei when 12 tanks {{attacked}} their camp. The Soviet-built PT-76 amphibious tanks of the 203rd NVA Armored Regiment churned over the defenses, <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> an infantry assault by the 7th Battalion, 66th Regiment and the 4th Battalion of the 24th Regiment, both elements of the 304th Division. The ground troops had been specially equipped for the attack with satchel charges, tear gas, and flame throwers. Although the camp's main defenses were overrun in only 13 minutes, the fighting lasted several hours, during which the Special Forces men and Bru CIDGs managed to knock out at least five of the tanks.|$|E
5|$|Land {{is defined}} as the surface, subsoil, {{airspace}} and anything permanently attached to the land, such as houses. The rights of landowners over airspace are not unlimited; in Bernstein of Leigh v Skyviews & General Ltd, the action for trespass failed because the violation of airspace took place several hundred metres above the land. This was <b>backed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the Civil Aviation Act 1982, which provides that it is not trespass if the aircraft is flying at a reasonable height. An overhanging crane can constitute trespass, as in Woolerton v Costain, as can an advertising sign, as in Kelsen v Imperial Tobacco Co. Possession does not necessarily mean the ownership of land, but the right to eject or exclude others from it.|$|E

50|$|The Chiefs managed one {{touchdown}} in the game, coming from Larry Johnson in the third quarter.

Johnson was not penalized for pulling Polamalu down, but <b>by</b> pulling him <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> his hair (a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct).|$|R
