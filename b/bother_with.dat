5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} to cut their hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E
5|$|The {{briefing}} {{process was}} repeated {{with a second}} group of 34 candidates a week later. Of the 69, six {{were found to be}} over the height limit, 15 were eliminated for other reasons, and 16 declined. This left NASA with 32 candidates. Since this was more than expected, NASA decided not to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> the remaining 41 candidates, as 32 candidates seemed a more than adequate number from which to select 12 astronauts as planned. The degree of interest also indicated that far fewer would drop out during training than anticipated, which would result in training astronauts who would not be required to fly Project Mercury missions. It was therefore decided to cut the number of astronauts selected to just six. Then came a grueling series of physical and psychological tests at the Lovelace Clinic and the Wright Aerospace Medical Laboratory. Only one candidate, Jim Lovell, was eliminated on medical grounds at this stage, and the diagnosis was later found to be in error; thirteen others were recommended with reservations. The director of the NASA Space Task Group, Robert R. Gilruth, found himself unable to select only six from the remaining eighteen, and ultimately seven were chosen.|$|E
25|$|Persons {{who keep}} their own surname after {{marriage}} {{do so for}} a number of reasons. Objection to the inequality of the tradition is one major reason. Some people are the last ones in the family with that surname. Others don't want to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> the paperwork. Common reasons for maintaining their birth name include not wanting to lose their identity, preferring their last name to their spouse's last name, and fear of professional ramifications.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914 the Fort de Maizeret was {{under the command of}} Captain-Commandant Poncelet, with about 400 men. The fort was bombarded by invading German forces {{beginning}} on 21 August 1914. The Germans did not <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. Maizeret was abandoned by Poncelet and his garrison on 22 August, its ability to resist destroyed by the heavy German artillery.|$|E

While he secured the deal, the time spent and an unforeseen delay meant his sub-team was late back to the boardroom and fined 25% of their sales, losing the team the task.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914 the Fort de Suarlée was {{under the command of}} Captain-Commandant Moisse, with about 400 artillerymen and 80 {{fortress}} troops. The fort was bombarded by invading German forces beginning on 23 August 1914. The Germans did not <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. On the 24th the fort was hit by about 1500 heavy projectiles, causing significant damage. On the 25th Suarlée was hit from the rear by another 1500 210mm, 305mm and 420mm shells, nearly destroying the fort and resulting in its surrender that day.|$|E

25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can be said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
25|$|Though cell {{reproduction}} {{that uses}} mitosis can reproduce eukaryotic cells, eukaryotes <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> the more complicated process of meiosis because sexual reproduction such as meiosis confers a selective advantage. Notice that when meiosis starts, the {{two copies of}} sister chromatids number 2 are adjacent to each other. During this time, there can be genetic recombination events. Parts of the chromosome 2 DNA gained from one parent (red) will swap over to the chromosome 2 DNA molecule that received from the other parent (green). Notice that in mitosis the two copies of chromosome number 2 do not interact. It is these new combinations of parts of chromosomes that provide the major advantage for sexually reproducing organisms by allowing for new combinations of genes and more efficient evolution.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914 the Fort de Saint-Héribert was {{under the command of}} Captain-Commandant Derzellez, with about 400 artillerymen and 80 {{fortress}} troops.The fort was bombarded by invading German forces beginning on 21 August 1914. The Germans did not <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> infantry assault at the Namur forts as had been tried at Liège, at a heavy cost, preferring to batter the Namur positions with artillery. The Namur forts fell quickly. Telephone contact with the outside was lost on 23 August, the same day that the infantry in the intervals between the forts were withdrawn. The fort repelled an infantry attack early on the 24th, but took heavy German fire from 1530 to 1945. At 2100 the garrison surrendered, while the Germans continued to fire around them to prevent their escape.|$|E

500|$|Kneale also adapted Sharpe's Gold for ITV in 1995, as part {{of their}} series of adaptations of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels. This was an {{assignment}} that surprised his agent; [...] "We didn't think he'd want to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> them but he did. That was probably because he liked the producer." [...] He returned to writing for radio {{for the first time since}} the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary The Quatermass Memoirs for BBC Radio 3. Partly composed of Kneale looking back at the events that led to the writing of the original three Quatermass serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV Quatermass serial and featuring Andrew Keir, star of the Hammer version of Quatermass and the Pit, as the Professor.|$|E
500|$|The IPA is {{also not}} {{universal}} among dictionaries in languages other than English. Monolingual dictionaries of languages with generally phonemic orthographies generally do not <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> indicating the pronunciation of most words, and tend to use respelling systems for words with unexpected pronunciations. Dictionaries produced in Israel use the IPA rarely and sometimes use the Hebrew alphabet for transcription of foreign words. Monolingual Hebrew dictionaries use pronunciation respelling for words with unusual spelling; for example, the Even-Shoshan Dictionary respells [...] as [...] because this word uses kamatz katan. Bilingual dictionaries that translate from foreign languages into Russian usually employ the IPA, but monolingual Russian dictionaries occasionally use pronunciation respelling for foreign words; for example, Sergey Ozhegov's dictionary adds нэ́ in brackets for the French word пенсне (...) {{to indicate that the}} final е does not iotate the preceding н.|$|E

500|$|Poe's {{funeral was}} a simple one, held at 4 p.m. on Monday, October 8, 1849. Few people {{attended}} the ceremony. Poe's uncle, Henry Herring, provided a simple mahogany coffin, and a cousin, Neilson Poe, supplied the hearse. Moran's wife made his shroud. The funeral was presided over by the Reverend W. T. D. Clemm, cousin of Poe's wife, Virginia. Also in attendance were Dr. Snodgrass, Baltimore lawyer and former University of Virginia classmate Zaccheus Collins Lee, Poe's first cousin Elizabeth Herring and her husband, and former schoolmaster Joseph Clarke. The entire ceremony lasted only three minutes in the cold, damp weather. Reverend Clemm decided not to <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> a sermon because the crowd was too small. Sexton George W. Spence wrote of the weather: [...] "It was a dark and gloomy day, not raining but just kind of raw and threatening." [...] Poe was buried in a cheap coffin that lacked handles, a nameplate, cloth lining, or a cushion for his head.|$|E
500|$|Hewett {{played all}} three matches of the 1895 Scarborough Festival; {{he opened the}} innings for the MCC against Yorkshire, and then captained the South in their loss against the North. In the third match, Hewett was named captain of an England XI, a {{compliment}} for the former Somerset captain. However, rain meant that the start was delayed. Unlike {{a couple of years}} earlier, Hewett was happy to ignore the puddles in the field and start the match at the scheduled time. The umpires disagreed with him, and the crowd, wanting cricket, blamed Hewett for the delay and lack of sport. When he belatedly led his side onto the field, the spectators threw insults at him until the Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, shouted [...] "Keep quiet or I'll think about calling the game off". Hewett did not <b>bother</b> <b>with</b> such threats, and left the field, got changed and departed from the ground, taking no further part in the game. Fred Spofforth replaced him in the match which the England side went on to win by nine wickets.|$|E
