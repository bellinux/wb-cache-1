5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, the House of Lords {{began to}} use the tower to store its {{parliamentary}} records, <b>building</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> alongside it {{for the use of the}} parliamentary clerk, and extensive improvements followed in 1621. The tower continued as the Lords' records office through the 18th century, and several sets of renovations and building work were carried out to improve its fire-proofing and comfort, creating the current appearance of the tower. In 1834, the tower was one of only four buildings to survive a terrible fire in Westminster, and in the aftermath the records were moved to a new, purpose-built archive.|$|E
5|$|Medical issues forced Schweitzer {{to leave}} Africa many times, and {{sometimes}} Albert {{kept her from}} returning at times. When Albert {{decided to return to}} Africa in 1924, he took on Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant, leaving Schweitzer behind. After the birth of their daughter (Rhena Schweitzer Miller), Schweitzer was no longer able to live in Lambaréné owing to her health. In 1923 the family moved to Königsfeld im Schwarzwald, Baden-Württemberg, where Albert was <b>building</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> for the family.

25|$|The only {{options for}} living on North Campus for upperclassmen are the program houses and co-op houses: Risley Residential College, Just About Music, the Ecology House, Holland International Living Center, the Multicultural Living Learning Unit, the Latino Living Center, , and Ujamaa. In {{an attempt to}} create a sense of {{community}} and an atmosphere of education outside the classroom and continue Andrew Dickson White's vision, a $250million reconstruction of West Campus created residential colleges there for undergraduates. The idea of <b>building</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> system can be attributed in part to the success of Risley Residential College, the oldest continually operating residential college at Cornell.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the Weekly Standard, an American {{conservative}} opinion magazine, questioned the cost-effectiveness of Habitat building projects. To estimate cost effectiveness, all costs associated with building a Habitat home must be used, including the cost of volunteer time and training. For houses constructed by foreign volunteers, travel and associated costs paid by the volunteers are also significant. Including these costs raises the question whether <b>building</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> this way is an efficient use of resources. Particularly in developing countries where labor is relatively inexpensive, unemployment is high, and local currency is cheap, purchasing local labor and supplies may result {{in an increase in}} the number of houses built.|$|E

By the Spring of 1900 the road reached about a mile up from its starting point just north of Lester Park. Snively built the road {{in a way that it}} crossed the Amity creek in nearly a dozen places, creating the need for the construction of many rustic wooden bridges. Upon its completion, Snively presented his new road to the city of Duluth as a designated parkway, and turned his attention to his farm and elsewhere.|$|E

500|$|In 1894, Claud Biddulph, {{youngest}} {{son of the}} politician Sir Michael Biddulph, was given [...] of land by his father and in 1906, he committed £5000 (worth approximately £2 million in 2015) per year to <b>building</b> <b>a</b> <b>house.</b> Biddulph and his wife, Margaret, were passionate about the Arts and Crafts movement, a design movement focused on restoring traditional approaches to decorative craftwork and fine art, so he commissioned architect Ernest Barnsley to create the house in that style. Biddulph referred to the manor as a [...] "cottage in the country". The Biddulphs originally hoped for a large village house, {{a focal point for}} the village community, who would work on craft projects in the house. Barnsley had settled in the Cotswolds in 1893 with his brother, leaving their successful Birmingham architecture firm behind, to focus on traditional crafting methods without machines.|$|E
500|$|The Scottish philosopher David Hume (who died in 1776, before Paley {{assembled}} {{his arguments}} into Natural Theology) had criticised arguments from design on several grounds. Firstly, {{he rejected the}} making of an analogy between the world and a human artifact such as a watch, since these are so dissimilar that any analogy must be very weak and unreliable. Secondly, Hume argued that even if one accepted the analogy, it would not prove that the creator is infinite, good, or perfectly intelligent, nor {{that there would be}} only one creator god. After all, wrote Hume, [...] "what shadow of an argument… can you produce from your hypothesis to prove the unity of the Deity? A great number of men join in <b>building</b> <b>a</b> <b>house</b> or ship, in rearing a city, in framing a commonwealth; why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing a world?" ...|$|E

[...] Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do [...] "homework" [...] from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for [...] "all the terrible things she did to me", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will [...] "renovate" [...] her life. [...] During the following day of [...] "The Plan", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to [...] "renovate their homes" [...] together. [...] In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the impact of spatial {{implementation}} conditions on the effectiveness of investing in <b>building</b> <b>a</b> residential <b>house</b> in the Municipality of Prevalje. It looks at data on advertised and sold residential houses, and vacant building lots. Basic statistics are calculated. The costs of <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new residential <b>house</b> are compared with the estimated market value of the appraised residential house in order to establish the rationality of investing in building. To discuss the influence spatial implementation conditions have on the effectiveness of investing, we examined how different ratios between the lay-out of the building and the area of the building plot, and different factors of the use of land affect the costs of <b>building</b> <b>a</b> residential <b>house.</b> We have established that spatial implementation conditions have very little influence on the effectiveness of investing in <b>building</b> <b>a</b> residential <b>house.</b> In the Municipality of Prevalje, such investments would not be rational, seeing that the estimated market value of <b>a</b> residential <b>house</b> is much lower than the estimated costs of <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new residential <b>house...</b>|$|R
