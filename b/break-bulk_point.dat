Gradually, shipping by train and boat diminished as most package freight is transported by road. The railway's Intermodal freight transport has {{done away with}} the costly transshipment of individual goods between box cars and Lake freighters. Combined with loss of grain subsidies (the Crow Rate) and {{the free trade agreement}} with the United States, have terminated Thunder Bay's privileged position as a linchpin in Canadian east-west trade. As a result, the city has lost its traditional raison d'Ãªtre as a <b>break-bulk</b> <b>point,</b> and the city is in economic decline.|$|E

2500|$|The {{assumption}} at {{the time}} was that car owners would drive to the nearest railhead (which was usually the junction where the closed branch line would otherwise have taken them) and continue their journey onwards by train. In practice, having left home in their cars, people used them for the whole journey. Similarly for freight: without branch lines, the railways' ability to transport goods [...] "door to door" [...] was dramatically reduced. As in the passenger model, it was assumed that lorries would pick up goods and transport them to the nearest railhead, where they would be taken across the country by train, unloaded onto another lorry and taken to their destination. The development of the motorway network, the advent of containerisation, improvements in lorries and the economic costs of having two <b>break-bulk</b> <b>points</b> combined to make long-distance road transport a more viable alternative.|$|R
