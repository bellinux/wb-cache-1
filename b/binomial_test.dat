40|$|Objectives. To examine {{relationships}} between conventional MRI measures and the paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT) and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted. Included studies had ≥ 30 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, administered the SDMT or PASAT, and measured T 2 LV or brain atrophy. Meta-analysis of MRI/information processing speed (IPS) correlations, analysis of MRI/IPS significance tests {{to account for}} reporting bias, and <b>binomial</b> <b>testing</b> to detect trends when comparing correlation strengths of SDMT versus PASAT and T 2 LV versus atrophy were conducted. Results. The 39 studies identified frequently reported only significant correlations, suggesting reporting bias. Direct meta-analysis was only feasible for correlations between SDMT and T 2 LV (r=- 0. 45, P< 0. 001) and atrophy in patients with mixed-MS subtypes (r=- 0. 54, P< 0. 001). Familywise Holm-Bonferroni testing found that selective reporting was not the source of {{at least half of}} significant results reported. <b>Binomial</b> <b>tests</b> (P= 0. 006) favored SDMT over PASAT in strength of MRI correlations. Conclusions. A moderate-to-strong correlation exists between impaired IPS and MRI in mixed MS populations. Correlations with MRI were stronger for SDMT than for PASAT.

40|$|In {{small sample}} studies with binary outcome data, {{use of a}} normal {{approximation}} for hypothesis testing can lead to substantial inflation of the type-I error-rate. Consequently, exact statistical methods are necessitated, and accordingly, much {{research has been conducted}} to facilitate this. Recently, this has included methodology for the design of two-stage multi-arm studies utilising exact <b>binomial</b> <b>tests.</b> These designs were demonstrated to carry substantial efficiency advantages over a fixed sample design, but generally suffered from strong conservatism. An alternative classical means of small sample inference with dichotomous data is Fisher's exact test. However, this method is limited to single-stage designs when there are multiple arms. Therefore, here, we propose a two-stage version of Fisher's exact test, with the potential to stop early to accept or reject null hypotheses, which is applicable to multi-arm studies. In particular, we provide precise formulae describing the requirements for achieving weak or strong control of the familywise error-rate with this design. Following this, we describe how the design parameters may be optimised to confer desirable operating characteristics. For a motivating example based on a phase II clinical trial, we demonstrate that on average our approach is less conservative than corresponding optimal designs based on exact <b>binomial</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Programmes {{to educate}} media {{professionals}} about suicide are increasingly established, but information about which suicide cases {{are most likely}} to be reported in the mass media is sparse. Methods: We applied <b>binomial</b> <b>tests</b> to compare frequencies of social characteristics of all domestic suicides in the 13 largest Austrian print media in 2005 with frequencies of suicide characteristics in the population. Additionally, each reported suicide case was linked to its respective entry in the suicide database. We performed a logistic regression analysis, with presence of an article as outcome, and sex of the suicide case, age, religious affiliation, family status, conduction of an autopsy and location of the suicide as explaining variables. Time of the year and federal state where the suicide happened was controlled for. Results: <b>Binomial</b> <b>tests</b> showed that suicides involving murder or murder attempt were over-represented in the media. Reporting on mental disorders was under-represented. In the regression analysis, the likelihood of a report was negatively associated with the age of suicide cases. Foreign citizenship was a further predictor of a suicide report. The methods of drowning, jumping, shooting and rare methods were more likely to be reported than hanging, which is the most frequent suicide method in Austria.

40|$|The ski {{industry}} is often perceived {{as having a}} negative impact on sensitive alpine and subalpine communities. However, empirical evidence of such impacts is lacking. We reviewed the available literature from the last 35 years to quantify the reported effects of winter recreation on faunal communities. Overall, using one-sample <b>binomial</b> <b>tests</b> (‘sign tests’) we found that the effects of all types of winter recreation-related disturbances (i. e. ski runs, resort infrastructure and winter tourism) {{were more likely to be}} negative or have no effect, than be positive for wildlife.

In terms of specific taxa, birds and to a lesser extent mammals and arthropods, responded negatively to disturbance. Results from our meta-analysis confirmed the results from our <b>binomial</b> <b>tests.</b> Richness, abundance and diversity of fauna were lower in areas affected by winter recreation when compared with undisturbed areas. For most regions and taxa, however, empirical evidence remains too limited to identify clear impacts of winter recreation.
