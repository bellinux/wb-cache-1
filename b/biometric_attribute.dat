40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} person re-identification is to recog-nize a target subject across {{non-overlapping}} distributed cameras {{at different times}} and locations. The applications of person re-identification include security, surveillance, multi-camera track-ing, etc. In a real-world scenario, person re-identification is challenging due to the dramatic changes in a subject’s appearance in terms of pose, illumination, background, and occlusion. Exist-ing approaches either try to design robust features to identify a subject across different views or learn distance metrics to maximize the similarity between different views of the same person and minimize the similarity between different views of different persons. In this paper, we aim at improving the re-identification performance by reranking the returned results based on soft <b>biometric</b> <b>attributes,</b> such as gender, which can describe probe and gallery subjects at a higher level. Dur-ing reranking, the soft <b>biometric</b> <b>attributes</b> are detected and attribute-based distance scores are calculated between pairs of images by using a regression model. These distance scores are used for reranking the initially returned matches. Experiments on a benchmark database with different baseline re-identification methods show that reranking improves the recognition accuracy by moving upwards the returned matches from gallery that share the same soft <b>biometric</b> <b>attributes</b> as the probe subject.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new cryptographic primitive which is the signature analogue of fuzzy identity based encryption(IBE). We call it fuzzy identity based signature(IBS). It possesses similar error-tolerance property as fuzzy IBE that allows a user with the private key for identity ω to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted for identity ω ′ {{if and only if}} ω and ω ′ are within a certain distance judged by some metric. A fuzzy IBS is useful whenever we need to allow the user to issue signature on behalf of the group that has certain attributes. Fuzzy IBS can also be applied to biometric identity based signature. To our best knowledge, this primitive was never considered in the identity based signature before. We give the definition and security model of the new primitive and present the first practical implementation based on Sahai-Waters construction[6] and the two level hierarchical signature of Boyen and Waters[9].

40|$|Biometric {{identifiers}} {{refer to}} unique physical properties or behavioural attributes of individuals. Some {{of the well}} known biometric identifiers are voice, finger prints, retina or iris, facial structure etc. In our daily interaction with others directly or indirectly, we implicitly use biometrics to know, distinguish and trust people. Biometric identifiers represent the concept of "who a person is" by gathering vital characteristics that don't correspond to any other person. The human brain to some extent is able to ascertain disparities or variation in certain physical attributes and yet verify the authenticity of a person. But this is difficult to be implemented in electronic systems due to the intense requirements of artificial decision making and hard-coded logic.

To identify factors contributing to this, we have retrospectively studied a range of ocular parameters in patients with varying outcomes from orthokeratology lens wear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three groups were studied: an experimental group (9 subjects wearing Contex OK- 3 design orthokeratology contact lenses), and 2 control groups [10 rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens wearers and 10 non-contact lens wearers]. Three categories were identified among the orthokeratology group: those responding well, moderately, or poorly to orthokeratology lens wear. Measurements included subjective refraction, intraocular distances, corneal thickness, ocular rigidity, and epithelial fragility. RESULTS: When comparing the three orthokeratology categories, {{there was no significant}} difference for central and peripheral epithelial fragility and ocular rigidity. There was also no significant difference for any of the biometric characteristics measured. The prefitting spherical equivalent power was found to be significantly different between categories of responders (p = 0. 0228), with the poor responders having the highest initial level of myopia. None of the measured characteristics differed significantly among the orthokeratology group and the two control groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, the success of orthokeratology lens wear was not related to ocular biomechanical or <b>biometric</b> <b>attributes,</b> but it was related to prefitting refractive error...|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, reliable, fast, and {{accurate}} {{recognition of a}} person is an important need for security systems, and recent advances in technology and increasing the need for security {{require the use of}} reliable biometric systems [1]. The <b>biometric</b> <b>attributes</b> used in security system for recognition include finger print, hand geometry, face, iris, and retina [2 – 8]. Each biometric feature has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice depends on the application. Among these methods, the retina provides a higher level of security for recognition due to uniqueness and the stability of the blood vessel pattern during one's life. However, because of technological limitation in manufacturing specific imaging apparatus, its usage is limited to places where high security level is needed. Depending on the application context, a biometric system may operate in verification or identification mode. In the verification mode, the system confirms or denies a person's claimed identity by comparing the captured biometric features with the own biometric template(s) stored in the database. In the identification mode, the system recognizes an individual by searching the templates of all users in the database for a match [9]. Therefore, for identification at first step, the security system must decide about the existence of a person. After confirming the existence, the security system must determine the identity of that person. Most recognition methods based on the retinal images are used only in identification or verification mode.|$|R

Image size is 256 x 256 pixel used. In training phase, the image of the signature subject to several prosesses that threshold, the transformation wavelet, normalized and then be trained by using algorithm Artificial Neural Network (ANN) backpropagation. The testing phase has the same process as in the training phase {{but at the end of}} the process will be a comparison the image data that has been stored with the image comparison. 	ANN can perform optimally when trained using input data that has been taken into consideration the size, parameters, and the numbers of nodes on the network. optimal results are obtained by using a neural network has two hidden layers, each of 20 and 10 nodes, the transformation of Haar wavelet at level 4 and learning rate of 0, 12.

Unimodal biometric systems perform person recognition based on a single source of biometric information and are affected by problems like noisy sensor data, non-universality and lack of individuality of the chosen biometric trait, absence of an invariant representation for the biometric trait and susceptibility to circum-vention. Some of these problems can be alleviated by using multimodal biometric systems that consolidate evidence from multiple biometric sources. Integration of evidence ob-tained from multiple cues is a challenging problem and integration at the matching score level {{is the most common}} approach because it offers the best trade-off between the in-formation content and the ease in fusion. In this thesis, we address two important issues related to score level fusion. Since the matching scores output by the various modalities are heterogeneous, score normalization is needed to transform these scores into a common domain prior to fusion. We have studied the performance of different normalization tech-niques and fusion rules using a multimodal biometric system based on face, fingerprint and hand-geometry modalities. The normalization schemes have been evaluated both in terms of their efficiency and robustness to the presence of outliers in the training data. We have also demonstrated how soft <b>biometric</b> <b>attributes</b> like gender, ethnicity, accent and height, that by themselves do not have sufficient discriminative ability to reliably recognize a per-son, can be used to improve the recognition accuracy of the primary biometric identifiers (e. g., fingerprint and face). We have developed a mathematical model based on Bayesian decision theory for integrating the primary and soft biometric cues at the score level...|$|R
