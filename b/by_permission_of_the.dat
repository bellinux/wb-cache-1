500|$|One {{method of}} paying for the {{construction}} and maintenance of city walls was a tax called murage, usually levied <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king on particular goods being imported into a city. In Worcester, murage was raised to support work on the walls during three main phases, [...] 1224 to 1239, 1252 to 1310 and 1364 to 1411. Worcester was attacked again during the Second Barons' War in the 1260s, and the records suggest {{that some of the}} murage payments were used to repair damage caused by that attack. In the late 14th century a watergate was built in the western walls of the city, close to a slipway for launching boats. Worcester's last murage grant occurred in 1439, although in 1459 Henry VI allowed the city to use stones from the castle to repair the walls to defend the city in anticipation of a Yorkist attack during the Wars of the Roses. As in many other English towns and cities, as the medieval period progressed, housing began to encroach on the city walls in Worcester.|$|E

The oath, shelo yaalu bechoma means explicitly that we cannot storm eretz-Yisrael from chutz-laaretz. But when the Jews are in eretz-Yisrael, there is surely a hechsher mitzva of kibbush-haaretz.

2500|$|In Germany the {{individual}} German states are legally {{responsible for the}} provision of emergency services, but typically delegate these responsibilities to the district level ("Kreis" [...] or [...] "kreisfreie Stadt"). Municipalities, including both smaller communities ("Gemeinden") and cities ("Städte") are given responsibility by the State for equipping and operating fire departments ("Feuerwehr"), which can operate an EMS system <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district (see below). [...] German law mandates the provision of fire and rescue services, including EMS, staffing and equipping according to levels which correspond to local population. In independent cities, this is usually provided directly by the Fire Prevention Bureau ("Amt für Brand- und Katastrophenschutz", sometimes called [...] "Amt 37"); one of the (standard) departments in a municipality.|$|E

A line-walker (runner) is given a map, and sets off to follow a course marked on it, leaving a scent-article ('smeller') attached to a flag marking {{the beginning of the}} trail. A hound and its handler start a set time later, and try to follow his trail, while the judge, equipped with a copy of the map, follows behind assessing their performance. When each of the entered hounds has completed a trail, he picks a winner. There are a series of 'stakes' of increasing difficulty, the simplest being 1 mile long, ½ an hour cold, and the hardest 3 miles long, 2 hours cold. On winning a stake, a hound moves up to the next one. Hounds may work unleashed if they have passed a test showing they will not bother farm stock, especially sheep. Special prizes are on offer for identification and voice ('speaking to the line'). The best hounds may be invited to take part in special stakes, the most difficult being 3 miles long, 24 hours cold.|$|E
2500|$|The town of Springfield {{was settled}} in 1636 by William Pynchon (as Agawam Plantation), {{encompassing}} the modern towns of Westfield, Southwick, West Springfield, Agawam, Chicopee, Holyoke, Wilbraham, Ludlow and Longmeadow in Massachusetts, and Enfield, Suffield, Somers, and East Windsor in Connecticut. It {{was connected to}} the Atlantic and major avenues of trade by the Connecticut River, which ran past Hartford and through the territory of the Connecticut Colony. Initially, Springfield's founders attended the Connecticut Colony meetings held in Hartford; however, relations quickly soured between the strong-minded leaders of each settlement, the iconoclastic William Pynchon of Springfield and Puritan Reverend Thomas Hooker of Hartford. Pynchon proved to be a very savvy businessperson, and his settlement quickly eclipsed the Connecticut towns in trade with the Natives. In 1640, during a grain shortage, Hooker and other Connecticut leaders gave Pynchon permission to buy grain for them; however, because the Natives were refusing to sell at reasonable prices, Pynchon refused the Natives' offers. Pynchon's perceived greediness infuriated Hartford; however, Pynchon explained that he was merely trying to keep market prices steady so that colonists need not pay exorbitant amounts in the future. Infuriated, Hartford sent famed Indian-killer Captain John Mason up to Pynchon's settlement [...] "with money {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other." [...] Mason threatened the Natives by Springfield with war if they did not sell grain at the prices he demanded. Pynchon was disgusted by this behavior, as he had enjoyed a congenial relationship with the Natives – and Mason's threats made him look bad. Mason believed that Natives were untrustworthy, and thus exchanged some [...] "hard words" [...] with Pynchon before leaving Springfield. After Mason left, settlers of Agawam Plantation rallied in support of Pynchon. In 1640, they voted to annex their settlement – with arguably the best position on the Connecticut River, near Enfield Falls, surrounded by fertile farmland and friendly Natives – to the faraway government in Boston, rather than the nearby government in Hartford. (Springfield had been settled <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts General Court, so Massachusetts assumed it had jurisdiction over Pynchon's settlement anyway; however, they renamed it Springfield in Pynchon's honor).|$|E
