40|$|Renardine is a bone tar product {{available}} {{for use as a}} coyote (Canis latrans) repellent in Canada. The substance is applied to pasture borders to prevent coyotes from entering and attacking sheep. Because data regarding the effectiveness of Renardine are lacking, we designed two experiments. In the first, six pairs of coyotes were first presented with 400 g of ground meat in two pans (200 g/pan) with false screen bottoms. Beneath the screens were absorbent tubes wetted with 10 ml of distilled water. Subsequently, during a treatment period, the absorbent tube was wetted with 10 ml of Renardine. Pans were presented for 60 minutes, and the amount of time to consume the meat was recorded. In the second experiment, six additional pairs of coyotes were first presented with 200 g of ground meat inside a barrier created with baling twine and wooden dowels. The area inside the barrier was 1 m 2, and the twine was tied onto the dowels 0. 25 m above the ground. During the treatment period, the twine and dowels were painted with Renardine. In both experiments, all coyote pairs consumed all of the ground meat shortly after presentation. We conclude that Renardine probably is not an effective coyote repellent. However, because the active ingredient in Renardine is <b>bone</b> tar <b>oil</b> and <b>bone</b> tar <b>oil</b> is deer repellent, we speculate that Renardine may have utility as an herbivore repellent...|$|R

40|$|An ever {{increasing}} global energy demand and evolving geopolitical scenarios {{has put the}} non- renewable and depleting petroleum resources under pressure. This, coupled with {{a concern for the}} environment, make the development of alternative and renewable sources of fuel, as a replacement for fossil fuels, an imperative task for the transition to a sustainable energy future. The production of biofuels from waste and renewable biomass needs to be catalyzed by acids and bases. However, homogenous acids, while efficient, come with concomitant problems of product purification, equipment corrosion, non-reusability while being environmental hazards. These issues are mitigated by heterogeneous catalysts. This thesis explores the development and application of several novel nanoporous heterogeneous solid acids and solid bases that successfully catalyze the conversion of renewable and waste biomass feedstock such as vegetable oils, cellulose, algae, brown grease and acidulated <b>bone</b> <b>oil</b> into fuels and biorenewable chemicals. The catalysts were used for developing and optimizing renewable resource utilization processes. As an example, the 100 % transformation of a municipal waste such as brown grease into biodiesel, synthesis gas and bio-oil illustrates the prototype blue print of a process which can be used for power generation and biofuel production from a low grade feedstock and a potential health hazard with high municipal management costs and little alternative avenues for usage. The novel chemistries employed in the synthesis of these structures results in nano materials with very high surface area, mesoporosity and superhydrophobic character with catalytic activities superior to all corresponding commercially available solid catalysts. In some studies, the catalytic activity was found to be superior to even homogenous catalysts. In addition, the limited reduction in catalytic activity over cycles of usage make these nanoporous heterogeneous catalysts attractive and sustainable candidates for the development of scaled up reactor modules to commercialize biofuels and biorenewable chemical production with minimal ramifications on the environment and production equipment...|$|E

40|$|Osteoporosis and {{pathologic}} fractures {{are frequent}} complications ill patients with end-stage liver or kidney diseases. Although successful transplantation eliminates some {{factors related to}} poor organ function, all increased incidence of pathologic fractures was reported ill the early post-transplant period in spite of normalization of the allograft function. The aims of this thesis were to study the effect of organ transplantation <b>oil</b> <b>bone</b> density and bone mineral metabolism {{as well as to}} evaluate tile effect of immunosuppressive drugs <b>oil</b> <b>bone</b> mineral metabolism. Twenty-five patients with end-stage liver disease and candidates for liver transplantation were measured for bone mineral density (BMD) before transplantation and measurements were repeated in 9 patients at 3 months, 6 months. and 12 months after liver transplantation (Paper 1). We found that an early and accentuated bone loss occurs during the first 6 months following transplantation, predominantly in sites enriched with trabecular bone and less ill cortical bone. 'I his bone reduction seems to mainly be the result of increased bone resorption, possibly related to the immunosuppressive therapy. One hundred and twenty-eight patients with different types of' hyperparathyroidism (HPT) were included for evaluation of bone mineral density before and after parathyroidectomy (Paper 11). Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed ill all patients once before parathyroidectomy and measurements were repeated longitudinally for 3 years. Regardless of the etiology, a large proportion of HPT patients [lad reduced bone density. Ill patients with primary symptomatic HPT and patients with HPT associated with hemodialysis, bone density increases after parathyroidectomy to all extent that largely restores their preoperative bone loss. Ill contrast, parathyroidectomy does riot appear to improve BMD ill patients with HPT associated with renal transplantation, possibly because ofthe adverse effects of immunosuppressive agents ill these patients. The effect of the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine A (CsA), Tacrolimus (FK 506), and prednisolone <b>oil</b> <b>bone</b> mass ill the rat was studied ill two experiments using densitometry of femur bone and bone morphometry of decalcified tibial bone (Paper Ill. W). Bone density and histology revealed that both CsA and FK 506 affect bone by different mechanisms, possibly growth retardation, and that a high dosage of CsA or FK 506 alters both cortical and trabecular bone ill rats. Prednisolone reduced bone turnover without affecting bone mass, and the combined therapy of both CsA and prednisolone induced a low bone turnover osteopenia. Recent reports have indicated that statins used ill the treatment of hypercholesterolemia might substantially increase bone formation and reduce the risk of fractures. To evaluate the association between statin use and BMD ill our patient population. hospital records for all adult patients who had received a kidney transplant between 1973 and 1998 were reviewed and 59 patients were identified as receiving statins. Bone density measurements were performed in 32 renal transplant patients taking statins as well as in age- and sex- matched controls. Statins users had a higher bone density in the lumbar spine compared to their controls. In conclusion, patients undergoing organ transplantation are at high risk to develop osteoporosis and pathologic fractures due to the accentuated bone loss, which occurs during the first posttransplant year. The immunosuppressive therapy could have a contribution in the early decrease of bone mass in patients following transplantation as well as ill abolishing the anabolic effect of parathyroidectomy on bone mass ill patients with HPT associated with renal transplantation. Experimental administration of CsA and FK 506 to rats ill doses comparable to those used ill human subjects provided direct evidence that both drugs have adverse effects on bone. Moreover, CsA seems to augment the effect of prednisolone <b>oil</b> <b>bone</b> when both drugs were given together. Preliminary data of the effect of statins <b>oil</b> <b>bone</b> showed a modest increment of trabecular bone density (lumbar spine) in statin users compared to controls.

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of biological materials science, the researchers find that inorganic biomaterials, which {{are close to}} the composition of natural bone, have good biocompatibility and human-body adaptability. It is the ideal bone substitute and {{can be used as a}} filling medium material of bone damage. So, there is a very good application prospect in the medical field [1, 2]. Among them, hydroxyapatite (HAp), as a new biological material, is the most widely used in the fields of researches and application [3, 4]. HAp belongs to a surface active material and is the main inorganic component in natural bone. It is similar to natural bone not only on the macrostructure, but on microstructure, chemical composition, features, the good biocompatibility, organization activity, and bone induced. HAp does not contain other toxic elements and can provide necessary elements of calcium and phosphorus to the body’s tissues. After being implanted in human body, it has no immunity or rejection effect on the body tissue. So, it can be used as a bone defect repair material to give full play to the role of bone conduction [5, 6]. The breakthrough research of tissue engineering and biomaterials cannot be done without nano-HAp. At present, the nanometer HAp has been very important in various fields. It is a target of the present day how to choose the preparation technique of different patterns HAp, and apply it to biomedical field [7, 8]. As the emergence of new biological materials hydroxyapatite, the research and utilization of cattle bone (including chicken bone, pig bone, cow bone, etc.) will be gradually turned to the extraction and application of hydroxyapatite in natural bone from extracting <b>bone</b> <b>oil,</b> bone glue and hydrolyzed gelatin, etc. Recently, people have already begun to seek the preparation and extraction process of natural HAp in order to respond to the “green chemistry,” which the world is advocating. It has become a focused issue for the researchers to obtain HAp by choosing a green and efficient solvent to dissolve animal bones and other materials [9, 10]. The ionic liquid (IL), as a veritable environment-friendly green solvent, shows the advantages of “green and pollution-free” compared with traditional organic solvents and is a kind of designability new green organic solvent and catalyst. ILs, as green solvents, have an excellent solubility property, which can dissolve most inorganic materials, organics, polymers, etc. [11 – 13]. ILs are non-volatile liquid solvents with a low melting point and have many practical applications, such as widely used in organic synthesis, catalysis, separation and purification, electrochemistry, and nanometer materials. So, there is a broad application prospect and it is expected to be an effective alternative to traditional organic solvent. In addition, since ILs possess a strong ability to break hydrogen bonds, they have been used to dissolve natural polymer materials which contain a large number of hydrogen bonds and macromolecular materials in terms of natural extraction, especially the extraction of protein [14, 15].|$|E

Further studies led to identifying the structural features of vitamin D...|$|R
50|$|The African manatee is a {{vulnerable}} species {{because of its}} meat, <b>oil,</b> <b>bones,</b> and skin, which can bring great wealth to poachers. Specifically {{they are used to}} make walking sticks and toy spinning tops. In some countries, such as Nigeria and Cameroon, African manatees are sold to zoos, aquariums, online as pets, and they are sometimes shipped internationally. Anyone visiting such countries will notice manatee meat being sold on the streets and in marketplaces, but the lack of law enforcement protects the poachers from punishment. Residents of countries such as Mali and Chad depend on the oil of the African manatee to cure ailments such as ear infections, rheumatism, and skin conditions.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} fluoride <b>oil</b> <b>bone</b> fluoride levels and on ectopic bone formation in young and old rats. Eighty male Wistar rats were assigned to four groups (n = 20 /g), which differed according to the fluoride concentration in their drinking water (0, 5, 15 and 50 mg/l). When half of the rats were 90 days old, demineralized bone matrix (DBM) was implanted. The other rats received DBM implants when they were 365 day`s old. The animals were killed 28 days after. Fluoride in the femur surface, whole femur and plasma was analyzed with an electrode, The implants were analyzed histomorphometrically. Data were tested for statistically, significant differences by ANOVA, Tukey`s test, t-test and linear regression (p < 0. 05). Increases in plasma, femur surface and whole femur fluoride concentrations were observed cis water fluoride levels increased. There was also a trend for increase in plasina and femur fluoride concentrations cis age increased. Significant positive correlations were found between plasma and femur surface, plasina and femur and femur surface and femur fluoride, concentrations. The morphometric analyses indicated all increase in bone formation for younger rats that received 5 mg/l of fluoride in the drinking water. However, this was not statistically, significant. The younger rats that received 50 mg/l of fluoride showed impairment in bone formation. Bone formation was not significantly affected among the older rats. The results suggest that lower doses of fluoride in the drinking water, which slightly increase plasma fluoride levels, may have an anabolic effect <b>oil</b> <b>bone</b> formation in younger rats.

50|$|Ivory is {{a fragile}} medium; many 19th century pieces were {{preserved}} {{because they were}} kept in a barrel of oil onboard ship. Gary Kiracofe, a scrimshander in Nantucket, Massachusetts, advises collectors that if a piece looks dry, one should fill {{the center of the}} tooth with unscented baby oil and allow it to remain until as much oil as possible is soaked into the microscopic pores of the ivory. Clear paste wax or high-end car wax will seal the surface after <b>oiling.</b> <b>Bone</b> items are even more fragile (more fibrous and porous) and may be treated the same way: with a light clear mineral oil. Organic oils are inadvisable, as they will eventually hasten discoloration, as on old piano keys subjected to the natural oils in one's hands.|$|R
