40|$|The Authors hereby {{review the}} {{literature}} concerning hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, with particular {{reference to the}} genetic and familial influence. They present their cases of 49 children; out of these 3 pairs of <b>biovular</b> <b>twins</b> out of which {{only one of the}} twin babies was affected and 2 similar twins both of which were affected. In conclusion they are confirming the importance of a genetic component, influenced by environmental factors, on the origin of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis...|$|E
2500|$|Dizygotic (DZ) or {{fraternal twins}} (also {{referred}} to as [...] "non-identical twins", [...] "dissimilar twins", [...] "biovular twins", and, informally {{in the case of}} females, [...] "sororal twins") usually occur when two fertilized eggs are implanted in the uterus wall at the same time. When two eggs are independently fertilized by two different sperm cells, fraternal twins result. The two eggs, or ova, form two zygotes, hence the terms dizygotic and <b>biovular.</b> Fraternal <b>twins</b> are, essentially, two ordinary siblings who happen to be born at the same time, since they arise from two separate eggs fertilized by two separate sperm, just like ordinary siblings.|$|R
