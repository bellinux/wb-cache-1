40|$|Three rations were {{compared}} with the standard maize-meat meal ration when fed to <b>baconers.</b> Excellent gains were made on all the rations, the pigs on the millet and barley rations, however, making the best gains, but these lots also consumed the largest amounts of food daily. The difference in rate of growth slightly influenced the degree of fatness of the pigs, otherwise {{there were no significant}} differences in the carcase measurements of the pigs in the four lots. The fat appeared to be firmer than that of pigs of previous trials which had similar rations. Type of pig may have caused this difference. The grading was good and the rate of gain had no adverse influence, so that it appears that different types of pigs have different optimum growth rates for the production of first grade bacon. The standard maize-meat meal ration again proved to be the most economical in bacon production. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|The stomachs of pigs (n = 15, 741) {{originating}} from 136 herds from the Australian states of Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales were examined at slaughter {{for the presence}} of oesophago-gastric ulcers (OGUs). Stomachs were categorised as being normal, hyperkeratotic, eroded, ulcerated, or having strictures. A questionnaire was distributed to piggery owners to identify factors associated with an above-average herd prevalence of OGU. Thirty percent of all pigs examined had OGU (median within-herd prevalence of 17 %). The median within-herd prevalence in Victoria (53 %) was significantly higher than in Western Australia (30 %) or Queensland (7 %). The prevalence of OGU in culled breeding animals was significantly higher than in porkers or <b>baconers</b> from the same herds. There was no difference between the prevalence of OGU in male and female pigs sampled from the same Western Australian herds. The relationship between OGU and herd and pig risk factors was assessed by random effects logistic-regression analysis. Herds with a high prevalence of OGU were more likely to feed ad libitum (OR = 13. 7), use automated feeding systems (OR = 7. 8), feed a pelleted ration (OR = 384) and get water from a dam rather than from a bore or river (OR = 3. 8). Furthermore, for every change in the ration formulation for finisher pigs, the risk of OGU increased 1. 5 times...|$|R
