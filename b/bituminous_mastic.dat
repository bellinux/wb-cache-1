40|$|The {{self-healing}} {{capability of}} bituminous materials {{has been known}} for many years. Researches were mostly focused on the self healing behaviour during load repetitions. The tests are either time consuming and/or complex. In this paper, a simple self healing test procedure is presented combining the fracture-healing-re-fracture test (FHR) with morphological observations. A fast displacement speed loading was applied first to produce a flat open crack with a crack width of 100 – 200 ?m. Then the specimen was placed in a silicone rubber mould to heal. Various healing periods, temperatures and material modifications were applied. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe the morphological change during the healing periods. After healing, the specimen was re-fractured under the same condition as the original fracture test. The experimental results indicate that the self healing capability, which was quantified by the re-fracture strength, increases with increasing healing time and increasing healing temperature. A strength recovery master curve at any healing temperature can be obtained through a timetemperature superposition principle. When comparing the strength recovery master curve with the morphological healing observation from fluorescence microscopy, the healing process observed in this paper is believed to be a viscosity driven process, consisting of two steps namely crack closure and strength gain. A Styrene-Butadiene-Styrene polymer modified <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastic</b> shows lower healing capability than a standard 70 / 100 penetration grade <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastic.</b> The test procedure proposed in this paper is proven to be simple and effective for evaluating and comparing the self healing capability of bituminous materials.

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{crumb rubber}} as {{modifier}} or additive within asphalt concretes has allowed obtaining mixtures able to bind high performances to recovery and reuse of discarded tires. To date, the common technologies that permit the reuse of rubber powder are the wet and dry ones. In this paper, a dry-hybrid technology {{for the production of}} Stone Mastic Asphalt mixtures is proposed. It allows the use of the rubber powder as filler, replacing part of the limestone one. Fillers are added and mixed with a high workability bitumen, modified with SBS (styrene-butadiene-styrene) polymer and paraffinic wax. The role of rubber powder and limestone filler within the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastic</b> has been investigated through two different approaches. The first one is a rheological approach, which comprises a macro-scale laboratory analysis and a micro-scale DEM simulation. The second, instead, is a performance approach at high temperatures, which includes Multiple Stress Creep Recovery tests.

In particular, it increases stiffness and elasticity at high temperatures and it reduces complex modulus at low temperatures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{rheological}} {{properties of the}} bituminous components (bitumen and <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastic)</b> within asphalt mixtures contribute significantly to the major distresses of flexible pavements (i. e. rutting, fatigue and low temperature cracking). Asphalt mixtures are usually composed of mastic-coated aggregates rather than pure bitumen-coated aggregates. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effects of mineral fillers on the rheological behaviour of several polymer-modified bitumens (PMBs) through laboratory mixing. A neat bitumen and two types of polymers (elastomeric and plastomeric) were used to produce PMBs, and two fillers with different minerals (limestone and basalt) were selected to obtain mastics. The dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and bending beam rheometer (BBR) were used to characterize the {{rheological properties}} of PMBs and mastics. In particular, multiple stress creep recovery (MSCR) tests were performed to evaluate the rutting potential at high temperatures, whereas BBR tests were carried out to investigate the low temperature behaviour of these materials. BBR results for unmodified mastics show that the increase of stiffness is similar regardless of the filler type, whereas results for polymer-modified mastics indicate that the degree of stiffening depends on the combination of filler/polymer types. MSCR results show that adding filler leads to a reduced susceptibility of permanent deformation and an enhanced elastic response, depending on the combination of filler/polymer types. Overall results suggest that a physical–chemical interaction between the filler and bitumen occurs, and that the interaction level is highly dependent on the type of polymer modification...|$|E

Fatigue behaviour of mastics under repeated loading was investigated by means of time sweeps performed in the strain-controlled mode at various amplitudes.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} an asphalt mixture is largely {{dependent on the}} properties of its constituents {{and by the way}} they reciprocally interact in the bituminous layer. In particular, the stress-strain response of the road pavements is closely related to the rheological behavior of the bituminous binder and of its interaction with the finest part of the lytic skeleton. Therefore, it is important to study in the laboratory by means of advanced rheological tests, how mastics (Bitumen-Filler Systems) and mortars (Bitumen-Filler-Sand Systems) react to dynamic loads and thermal stresses. Moreover, the understanding of the contacts mechanisms within the bitumen-filler system, through 3 D micro-mechanical models, should allow for a deeper analysis of the mastic rheological behavior. Based on these considerations, in a socio-economic context in which it is necessary to reduce the environmental impact caused by the construction and maintenance of transportation infrastructures, <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastics</b> containing different reclaimed fillers from the industrial production wastes were studied. For this purpose, advanced rheological tests have been first validated and then implemented and combined with the 3 D DEM models development.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a laboratory investigation aimed at evaluating the effects of filler on the rheological properties of bituminous mastics. More specifically, the mechanical behaviour of mixtures made with bitumen and inorganic aggregate is analyzed: selected fines from Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator (MSWI) ashes were used. The interaction between binder and aggregate determines a change in the rheological behaviour. Experimental data show a viscoelastic behaviour in the usual operating temperatures range and in a dynamic stress configuration characterized by high strains. It can also be observed that the thermal susceptibility of the mastic markedly depends on the content of filler, which is responsible for the variations of stiffness and resilience, measured in terms of complex modulus and phase angle. In order to examine the rheological effect of inorganic filler, tests were performed with the objective of checking the mastic behaviour {{at the edge of the}} linear viscoelastic region. Above the linear viscoelastic threshold, the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastic</b> is significantly sensitive to the presence of filler and a statistically robust protocol is required. The experimental data were obtained by means of a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and synthesized with a viscoelastic model. For the interpretation of the results, master curves of the main performance indices were calculated, being related to the filler content. As expected, the results confirm that artificial aggregate from MSW incinerators can be used in order to improve mastic properties...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study of crumb rubber-mediated {{improvement}} in bitumen cohesion, analyzed with the UCL method. UCL, a procedure developed to characterize bituminous binders, evaluates the cohesion obtained by adding {{a certain amount of}} bitumen or <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastic</b> to a standard mix aggregate. This method was chosen because {{it can be used to}} assess bitumen containing crumb rubber added by either the wet or the dry mix process. In the dry mix process crumb rubber is combined with the mix as if it were a fine aggregate; i. e., crumb rubber and binder are blended during mix manufacture, laying and compaction. In the wet mix process, the binder is blended with the crumb rubber prior to mixing with the aggregate; i. e., when added to the mix, it has already been modified. The effect of digesting this dry mixed material prior to use was also analyzed in the present study. A comparison of the dry (with and without digestion) and wet mix processes showed the latter to be more effective, particularly when the crumb rubber was blended with the binder via microscopic dispersion.

40|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} is a viscoelastic material {{consisting of}} aggregates, filler and bitumen. The response of asphalt concrete is {{highly dependent on}} temperature, loading rate and confining pressure. Permanent deformation {{is one of the}} most important distresses developing during the flexible pavement service life. The total deformation which is visible at the pavement surface is the sum of the deformation that developed in each and every layer. In this thesis however attention will only be paid to permanent deformation of the asphalt layers. The main goal of this research was to investigate and better understand the permanent deformation behaviour of asphalt mixtures at 50 °C which is a temperature that regularly occurs in asphalt wearing courses in the Netherlands and which therefore is applied in the Dutch standard for testing the resistance to permanent deformation of wearing courses. The thesis is divided in two parts. The first part focuses on sample preparation, testing procedures and fundamental properties of dense asphalt concrete (DAC) and porous asphalt concrete (PAC) mixtures and skeletons. In the second part the focus is on the prediction of permanent deformation. In the first part of this research special attention was paid to the following aspects: Effects of end constraints on test results Friction between the ends of the specimen and the top and bottom loading platens introduces extra confinement at the top and bottom of the specimen. In this research an extensive monotonic compressive testing program was performed on DAC and PAC mixtures under two different end contact conditions being full friction and reduced friction. “Full friction” was achieved by gluing the specimen to the top and bottom loading platens. “Reduced friction” was obtained by using a sandwich-shaped friction reduction system which consisted of two thin rubber sheets and vacuum grease in between. The results show that in the case of “full friction” the failure stress is overestimated and the displacement at failure is underestimated. The results also show that in the case of uniaxial testing without confinement and when using the friction reduction system, a deformation correction is needed to obtain the true deformation of the specimen. When confining pressure is applied deformations due to the friction reduction system can be ignored. The stress-strain behaviour of asphalt mixtures The permanent deformation behaviour of asphalt mixtures is highly dependent on temperature, stress conditions and number of load repetitions. A better understanding of the stress-strain behaviour of asphalt mixtures is beneficial for a better understanding of the permanent deformation. Therefore an extensive monotonic compressive test program was conducted on DAC and PAC at 40 °C and 50 °C with 3 various confining pressures and 5 different loading rates. The test results showed that the stress-strain behaviour of DAC significantly depends on temperature, strain rate and confinement. The results also showed that at high temperatures the PAC mixture behaves much alike a granular material with little cohesion. In this case the skeleton of PAC plays a significant role in the mechanical behaviour and this behaviour is highly dependent on the level of confinement. Behaviour of aggregate skeletons Permanent deformation develops at elevated temperatures. At elevated temperatures, the contribution of the aggregate skeleton becomes crucial. For this reason monotonic compressive tests were conducted on DAC and PAC skeletons at two strain rates and two confining pressure levels. The stress-strain behaviour of the DAC and PAC skeleton were compared with the stress-strain behaviour of both mixtures. The results implied that the <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastic</b> in DAC acts as a binder and contributes to the behaviour of the DAC asphalt mixture. The results also showed that the PAC aggregate skeleton shows typical elastoplastic behaviour regardless of the strain rates. In the second part of this thesis repeated load triaxial tests to study the development of permanent deformation were performed on the DAC mixture at 50 °C and the following questions related to permanent deformation of the DAC mixture were discussed. Scatter observed in permanent deformation results A power function was used to model the obtained permanent deformation. A large scatter in the model parameters was observed even at the same stress ratio for selected test specimens. The possible relation between the scatter on one hand and the air voids content and resilient modulus of specimens on the other was studied. CT scanning was used to investigate the internal structure of the intact and tested specimens. The results showed that there is no clear relationship between air voids and the parameters describing the development of the permanent deformation with increasing number of load repetitions. The results also showed that the model parameters were stress dependent and a strong relationship was found between the model parameters and the resilient modulus after 1000 load repetitions. The CT scan results showed that different failure modes took place in the permanent deformation tests and that the internal structure of specimens is important for the development of permanent deformation. It is believed that part of the scatter in the test results can be explained by the variation in internal structure. Influence of loading pattern on permanent deformation The influence of different loading pulses and rest times on the permanent deformation of DAC was also investigated by performing Triaxial Repeated Load Permanent Deformation (TRLPD) test. The tests were performed at two different loading patterns, being 0. 2 s load + 1. 8 s rest and 0. 4 s load + 0. 6 s rest, and at two confinement levels of 150 kPa with a stress ratio 0. 43 and 100 kPa with a stress ratio 0. 3. The results showed that the stress ratio has a significant influence on the permanent deformation while the loading time has little influence on the development of permanent deformation. At the same stress level it seems that the longer loading time does not result in larger permanent deformation. Evolution of the resilient modulus in relation to the number of load repetitions In order to obtain a better understanding of the relationship between permanent strain and resilient strain which is developed in the DAC test specimens during the repeated load triaxial tests, the evolution of the resilient modulus of DAC with the number of load repetitions was investigated and modelled. The results showed that the resilient modulus of DAC reduced during the first load repetitions and tended to take a constant value after 1000 load repetitions. Evolution of Burgers’ model parameters in relation to the number of load repetitions The measured total strain was decomposed into elastic strain, delayed elastic strain and viscous permanent strain and modelled by means of the Burgers’ model. The evolution of Burgers’ model parameters obtained at two different loading patterns was investigated in this study. It was found that the value of the parameter representing the dashpot in series, used for modelling the permanent deformation, increased with increasing number of load repetitions and tended to be constant after thousands of load repetitions. This value however strongly decreased when dilation of the specimen occurred. The loading pattern had a significant influence on the value of this viscous parameter Shake down limit in permanent deformation of DAC In order to explore the existence of a shakedown limit for the tested DAC mixture, five representative permanent deformation tests were analyzed. From this analysis it appeared that below a stress ratio of 0. 3 (the ratio of applied vertical stress to vertical stress at failure at the same confinement level) only a limited amount of permanent deformation developed after a large number of load repetitions. The stress ratio of 0. 3 is proposed to be the shake down limit at 50 °C for the test conditions and DAC mixture used in this research. Permanent deformation modeling based on Dissipated Energy Concept Most of the permanent deformation prediction models are simply relating permanent deformation to stress conditions and the number of load repetitions. In this study a permanent deformation model was developed based on dissipated energy. It was shown that the initial dissipate energy, the applied stress level and the number of load repetitions explain very well the permanent deformation development.

40|$|<b>Bituminous</b> <b>mastics</b> {{influence}} {{many other}} important asphalt mixture properties {{in addition to}} their own allowance for the load transfer in the aggregate skeleton. The influence of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastics</b> extends to the overall stability of a mixture, air void distribution, bitumen draindown during transport, a mixture's workability during the laying process, and the overall in-time performance of the pavement. To understand the properties of asphalt mixtures and their resistance to environmentally induced failure mechanisms, it is paramount to study not only bitumen and the asphalt mixture but also the mastic itself. Current asphalt design procedures do not take mastic behavior into account, however; this omission leads to a significant flaw in the ability to design and predict asphalt concrete response. This paper presents the results of an ongoing research project to enhance the understanding of the mastic phase as well as to develop a new test protocol to characterize mastics. A description is given of the measurements of mastic viscosity for different types of mastics in which the bitumen source is kept as a constant but with varying fillers as well as concentrations. Environmental susceptibility was investigated by subjecting the samples to aging and moisture conditioning. Biomass fillers were included in some of the mastics, in addition to some of the traditional fillers, to show their impact on the viscosity under varying conditions. Results showed that the developed test protocol was able to identify clearly the impact of filler properties on the mastic viscosity. A critical filler concentration was identified beyond which the viscosity behavior became nonlinear. The results also showed that moisture and aging had significant effects on the viscosity of mastics. No Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|Fly {{and bottom}} ash {{are the main}} {{by-products}} arising from the combustion of solid biomass. Since the production of energy from this source is increasing worldwide, the processing and disposal of the resulting ash have become environmental and economic issues. Fly and bottom ash are of interest as a construction material because they are composed of very fine particles similar to the fillers normally employed in bituminous and cementitious mixtures. This research investigates the potential use of ash from biomass combustion as filler in bituminous mixtures. The morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of twenty-one different types of ash and two traditional fillers (calcium carbonate and a recovered bituminous mixtures plant filler) were evaluated and discussed. Based on this characterization, several types of ash were selected in order to cover {{the whole range of}} morphological, physical and chemical properties. These ashes were subsequently used to create <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastics</b> (filler-bitumen blends), which were studied with the aim of obtaining indicators of bituminous mixture performance. A variety of rheological tests were performed to evaluate workability, rutting resistance, fatigue resistance, low temperature cracking resistance and moisture damage resistance of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastics.</b> Experimental results showed a wide range of values for almost all the characteristics of the ash and a low correlation with biomass type in terms of origin and chemical composition. A sieving process was found to be necessary in order to improve the properties of the raw materials in terms of grading. Furthermore, mastics containing ashes with high values of porosity of a compacted sample of dry filler (Rigden voids) were found to have low workability, fatigue resistance and low temperature cracking resistance. It was found that in order to limit the Rigden voids values, a milling process should be adopted before biomass ashes reuse. The low content of organic matter and harmful fines and the effectiveness of sieving and milling treatments suggest that biomass ash may be considered as replacements for natural fillers in bituminous mixture...|$|R

Instead of a complex and time consuming fatigue involved self healing investigation, a more effective test method was developed for bituminous materials using the Direct Tension Test (DTT) with a monotonic loading-healing-reloading procedure. The results indicate that the self healing behaviour is a viscosity driven process and it is dependent on time, temperature and crack sizes.

40|$|The {{cracking}} {{phenomenon is}} connected mainly to fatigue mechanisms and to thermal actions, which induce high tensile stresses inside the pavement which provoke the arise of cracks, especially {{in areas with}} lower resistance. This process, if not faced at early stage, can develop very quickly up {{to the case of}} a complete unserviceable road superstructure. In order to avoid this limit condition, it is necessary to intervene quickly with the sealing of the cracks, by adopting reliable techniques and materials with high performances. The contribution of this paper is on the execution of a detailed analysis of the rheological properties of different <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastics</b> which can be used to seal the cracks, referring to traditional characterization (penetration, softening point) and rheological tests, such as creep-recovery with DSR at medium temperatures (30 °C) and flexural creep tests with BBR at low temperatures (- 10, - 15 and - 20 °C), before and after PAV ageing.

Thus, an alternative characterization procedure, based {{on the use of}} time sweep testing protocols and on the concept of Dissipated Energy Ratio (DER), has been proposed within NCHRP Project 9 - 10. However, the true significance of test results still needs to be thoroughly understood in order to define new acceptance and grading criteria. In this paper the Authors present the results obtained during an experimental investigation which addressed the issue of fatigue damage of modified binders and mastics.

Such a parameter, called Relative Crack Propagation Amplitude (RCPA), proved to be especially useful in highlighting the peculiar effects caused by the creation within the binder mass of an effective fatigue-resistant polymer network, in differentiating the consequences deriving from the use of different polymer types and dosages, and in comparing the performance of mastics with that of the corresponding binder...|$|R

For this, fatigue and healing tests were performed on virgin and aged binders, mastics and asphalt mixtures. <b>Bituminous</b> binders and <b>mastics</b> (virgin and aged) were tested using a Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) in oscillation model. The fatigue and healing properties of the asphalt mixtures were determined by means of a dynamic test on compacted asphalt samples. The binders, mastic and asphalt test results show a significant increment in fatigue life when rest periods are taken into account between fatigue cycles...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a laboratory study, conducted at the University of Padova Road Research Laboratory, aimed at verifying the possibility to use a particular typologies of electric arc furnace (EAF) steel slag, in substitution of the natural aggregates, in the composition of high performance <b>bituminous</b> conglomerates (Stone <b>Mastic</b> Asphalt, wearing course and binder course asphalt concretes) for road flexible pavements, characterized by a steel slag content above the 89 % in mass. The experimental trial has been articulated in a preliminary study of the physical-geotechnical properties of the EAF steel slag and in the following mix design of the bituminous mixes, {{on the basis of the}} Marshall procedure. The performance of the asphalt concretes, in terms of stiffness and moisture susceptibility, have been investigated, through dynamic modulus tests at various frequencies and indirect tensile strength tests, for both dry and wet conditions. All the three different typologies of bituminous mixtures have completely satisfied the requisites for acceptance in the road sector technical standards (Marshall Stability and Quotient up to 1530 MPa and 462 daN/mm respectively, depending on the mix) thus resulting as suitable for use in the construction of road infrastructures...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the asphalt-aggregate bond {{is one of the}} key factors which affects the mechanical resistance of bituminous mixtures and a better understanding of its performance allows the behaviour of mixture to be more accurately predicted. The asphalt-aggregate bond depends on the properties of the mastic and the mixture of fine aggregate and bitumen which bonds itself to the larger sized particles within the <b>bituminous</b> mixture. This <b>mastic</b> plays an im-portant role in the asphalt-aggregate bond because failure occurs in this part of the bituminous mixture. For the development of an adhesion test (at the University of Minho), a study was conducted to evaluate the <b>mastic</b> part of <b>bituminous</b> mixtures. A physical evaluation of the mastic was performed by sieve analysis. The material retained on each sieve was characterized by evaluating the binder content and the gradation of the fine aggregate fraction. The results of this study allow the mastic part of a given mixture to be characterised as a function of aggregate gradation and binder content. The reverse process, where the type of mixture is defined by knowing the mas-tic, is also being studied, but this is not an easy process and it only allows some mixture variables to be defined...|$|R
40|$|Traffic is {{increasing}} rapidly {{in terms of}} number of vehicles and also in axle loads. In order to maximize {{the availability of the}} pavement and to minimize hindrances to traffic because of maintenance works, long life pavements are needed. An asphalt pavement with self repairing capabilities is believed to be very useful to this respect. The self healing phenomenon of asphalt mixtures is known for many years by road engineers. Bituminous materials are expected to repair themselves during hot summers and (long) rest periods. However, the underlying mechanism is not well understood, and a proper way to measure it is not available. Research questions are: what is the self healing phenomenon, how to measure it effectively and efficiently and how to upgrade it if possible. In order to answer these questions, investigations were carried out in this thesis. This research focuses on understanding the self healing mechanism of bituminous materials and the effects of material modifications, by means of testing and modelling. The research started with a critical literature review. Preliminary research was conducted to explore possible self healing modifiers. Novel self healing modifiers like ionomers, supermolecular rubbers and nanoparticles were chosen and investigated. Upon analyzing the change of the material properties and the self healing capability due to modifications, it was observed however, that all the novel modifications used in this research are not quite beneficial for the self healing improvement of bituminous materials. A normal soft bitumen was observed to be the best healer among all the modified bitumens tested. Further research was conducted to assess the self healing capability of bituminous materials in further detail. Three test methods were developed to mimic the self healing phenomenon at different levels being from bitumen level to mixture level. The self healing phenomenon was directly related to a measurable crack. In each of the test methods used, cracks were produced first in a controlled way, and after that the healing process of these cracks was investigated. The test methods covered the following aspects:  A two-piece healing (TPH) test was developed to investigate the self healing behaviour of pure bitumen using the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR). During the TPH test, the healing process was mimicked by pressing two pieces of bitumen together in a parallel-plate system. The development of the complex shear modulus during the closure of the gap width and during healing rest periods was monitored and used as a healing indicator.  A modified direct tension test was developed to assess the self healing capability of <b>bituminous</b> <b>mastics.</b> The cracks were first introduced via mechanical loading, and then healing rest periods were applied. After healing, the specimens were reloaded to determine the recovery of the material strength; this recovery was used as a healing indicator. This test can be used to investigate the self healing capability of an open crack with two total fractured surfaces and to determine the self healing capability of meso cracks.  A beam on elastic foundation test (BOEF) was developed to investigate the self healing phenomenon of asphalt mixtures with a notched asphalt concrete beam fully glued on a low modulus rubber foundation. After a crack is produced by imposing monotonic loading, the BOEF setup allows fully closure of the crack due to the confinement of the rubber foundation. After a healing period, the beams were reloaded and the stiffness recovery and strength recovery were used as indicators of healing.  The results of the various tests showed that the self healing capability of bituminous materials can be ranked successfully at different healing times, temperatures and damage levels. The self healing process of damage in bituminous materials consists of two main phases, namely the crack closure and the strength gain phase. The driving force can be either thermal (temperature) or mechanical (by confinement, pressure). The self healing capability is related to the viscosity of the bitumen, which increases with increasing healing time, temperature and when the crack size is very small. Finite element modelling was done to further investigate the self healing phenomenon in the tests. A smeared type cohesive zone model was used to model healing by defining the stiffness and strength recovery process. In this way, the self healing phenomenon was directly linked to a crack repairing process. Based on the research results, {{a better understanding of the}} self healing phenomenon was achieved. This thesis ends by discussing some important aspects of building a durable asphalt pavement with self healing capabilities. The self healing capability of an asphalt mixture should be optimized to obtain pavements with an enhanced durability...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} testing and modelling the viscoelastic response of bituminous binders. The main goal is to find an appropriate response model for bituminous binders. The desired model should allow implementation into numerical environments such as ABAQUS. On the basis of such numerical environment, Delft University of Technology (TU) is developing mechanistic asphalt mixture design tools. These tools are based on Meso scale mechanics. For Porous Asphalt (PA) performance, such a tool is readily available in ABAQUS. Implementation of an accurate viscoelastic response model for bituminous mortar will improve the tool’s capability in explaining PA performance at various temperatures and it is therefore a primary goal of this research. In addition the response model is also thought to be of equal importance for other meso mechanics tools for asphalt concrete mixtures that will be developed in the near future. To realise the main objective of the study, first an extensive Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) testing program was carried out on <b>bituminous</b> binder, <b>mastic</b> and mortar. The program was carried out {{to get a better}} understanding of the response behaviour of binders for various loading conditions. For the pure binder and mastic testing, a cone and plate setup was developed. For the mortar testing, a specially designed mortar column setup was utilized. The frequency and time domain response of the binders was first analysed in the linear viscoelastic range. Hereafter the frequency domain response of the binders beyond the linear range response was investigated. The results showed that binders exhibit nonlinear behaviour at higher levels of shear stress. At relatively high temperatures, in the range of 30 °C and above, mortar and mastic show nonlinear behaviour at shear stresses as low as 10 kPa. At low temperatures of 0 °C and below, high shear stresses in the range of 1 MPa were observed to cause nonlinear behaviour. The second part of the study covers extensive modelling work. After a literature survey, two response models were first selected as a basis for further research; i. e. the Huet-Sayegh (HS) and the Burgers’ model. These models were then utilised to describe the frequency domain response data. It was observed that the Burgers’ model requires a number of Kelvin-Voigt elements to accurately describe experimental data. The HS model on the other hand presented an accurate description of response data. However, the HS model lacks the capability of explaining viscous deformation. For this reason the HS model was extended by adding a linear dashpot in series. The modified Huet-Sayegh (MHS) and the generalized Burgers’ model were then used to describe the frequency domain response of various materials. Results have shown that the MHS description of the response data excels that of the generalized Burgers’ model. For time domain use in numerical environments, incremental formulations of the response models were obtained. The formulations were coded and the numerical outputs were then validated by performing various simulations. The formulations were used to simulate time domain response tests. In this process parameter determination was first performed on the basis of frequency domain data. The parameters were then used to simulate time domain creep and relaxation tests. The simulation results showed that the frequency domain master curve data provided accurate material information for simulating the time domain response. The result further underlines the fact that binder’s behaviour is intrinsic, and as such their behaviour in frequency and time domain is related. It is this intrinsic behaviour of the binders that was described by the generalized Burgers’ and the MHS models. Hereafter the models were finally implemented into ABAQUS, and they are made available for use in the meso mechanics PA design tool. The results from the PA design tool showed that both models lead to comparable results. The pros and cons of the models for practical application were evaluated. For relatively small numerical models, the MHS model is suggested because of its simplicity in the number of model parameters and its high accuracy in describing material response. However, for computationally intensive numerical models, the use of the generalized Burgers’ model is suggested because of its high computational efficiency in numerical environments. Finally, the nonlinear response of binders was analyzed using Schapery’s nonlinear theory. Numerical formulation of the theory that incorporates the generalized Burgers’ model was adopted. The formulation was coded into a User Subroutine Material code (UMAT) for use in ABAQUS. In the UMAT code an iterative scheme for obtaining correct stress state was incorporated at the material level. Results from the code were verified by performing various simulations. Application of the Schapery’s nonlinear theory in the PA design tool showed that the effects of nonlinear behaviour are negligible at temperatures of 10 °C and below. However, at 20 °C and above, distinct and significant differences between linear and nonlinear simulations are observed. From the results it is concluded that common binders may be modelled as being linear viscoelastic for temperatures of 10 °C and below. At 20 °C and above nonlinear response becomes significant and, it needs to be considered in meso mechanistic computations. Road and Railway EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
