50|$|After {{years of}} being ranked A- from Fitch, A- from Standard & Poor, and A3 from Moody’s, the bank’s rankings were dropped twice in 2011.

In April 2012, Moody’s announced a possible downgrade of the <b>Bank’s</b> current <b>Financial</b> <b>Strength</b> <b>Rating</b> as well as its local currency long- and short-term deposit ratings. In November 2011, Standard & Poor’s lowered its long-term counterparty credit ratings to 'BB' from 'BB+', noting the ratings are constrained by the local currency ratings on the sovereign. As of 25 January 2012, Fitch still had Arab Bank ranked at an A-.|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} health of central banks {{and its relation}} to policy outcomes has recently been recognized as an important policy issue. While case study evidence clearly indicates that weak central bank finances can hamper effective policy implementation, the question of whether central <b>bank</b> <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> influences policy performance remains controversial. This is due, in part, to a lack of econometric evidence. The paper presents a first step toward filling this gap, by providing a quantitative evaluation of the relationship between measures of central <b>bank</b> <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> and policy performance, in particular inflation. The paper''s major finding is that there indeed is a negative relationship between central <b>bank</b> <b>financial</b> <b>strength</b> and inflation outcomes.
