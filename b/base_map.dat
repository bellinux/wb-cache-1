5|$|The {{geologic}} map of Georgia (a state within the United States) is a special-purpose map made to show geological features. Rock units or geologic strata are shown by colors or symbols to indicate {{where they are}} exposed at the surface. Structural features such as faults and shear zones are also shown. Since the first national geological map, in 1809, {{there have been numerous}} maps which included the geology of Georgia. The first Georgia specific {{geologic map}} was created in 1825. The most recent state-produced geologic map of Georgia, by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is 1:500,000 scale, and was created in 1976 by the department's Georgia Geological Survey. It was generated from a <b>base</b> <b>map</b> produced by the United States Geological Survey. The state geologist and Director of the Geological Survey of Georgia was Sam M. Pickering, Jr. Since 1976, several geological maps of Georgia, featuring the state's five distinct geologic regions, have been produced by the federal government.|$|E

25|$|As LIDAR-surveying advances, <b>base</b> <b>maps</b> {{consisting}} of 1 meter contours {{and other data}} derived from the LIDAR data get more common.

25|$|Field-work {{is carried}} out using {{a small part of}} the <b>base</b> <b>map</b> fixed to a survey board, covered with a piece of {{draughting}} film, and drawn with pencils. The final map needs to be drawn with sufficient accuracy so that a feature shown on the map can be identified clearly on the ground by the competitor, thus, field-workers need to locate features with a high level of accuracy, to ensure consistency between map and terrain. Where the map and terrain are inconsistent, the feature becomes unusable: no control point can be placed there. Periodic corrections to the map may be necessary, typically vegetation changes in forested areas.|$|E
25|$|Cartographers use a {{projection}} {{to project the}} curved {{surface of the earth}} onto a flat surface. This generates a grid that is used as a base for national topographic mapping. The projection introduces a distortion so that grid north differs from true north; magnetic north is a natural feature that differs from both. As an example: at 52° 35' N 1° 10' E (approx 7km west of Norwich, England) true north is 2° 33' west of grid north, and magnetic north is about 7° west of grid north. Magnetic north varies continually and in this example (1986) was reducing by about ½° in four years. Orienteering maps are printed using magnetic north and this requires an adjustment to be made to the <b>base</b> <b>map.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{road network}} {{was a popular}} {{addition}} to the park because it opened the valley to scenic carriage and automobile rides in most seasons, particularly south of Military Road. Opening the park to vehicular traffic provided increased public access {{on both sides of}} Rock Creek Park. The present road system continues to reflect their original purpose of providing public access to the enjoyment of extraordinary rural scenery. A comparison of a 1918 Olmsted Plan Map, a National Park Service annotated version of that <b>base</b> <b>map</b> prepared in 1941 indicating road conditions in the park, and a modern topography map prepared in 1989, illustrated that the alignment and width of the roads has not changed significantly since 1941. Similarly a comparison of a 1933 map of Rock Creek's facilities reveals that the reservation has retained a high degree of its historic integrity. Although adapted to the automobile, the designed alignment, width and the environmental surroundings of these scenic roads has not substantially changed since the 1920s. According to the 1985 Rock Creek management plan, the road system is [...] long and the standard width of roadway is [...] A major non-historic addition to the trail system of the park was the paving of bicycle routes in the 1960s and 1970s.|$|E
