40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{incremental}} equal channel angular pressing (I-ECAP) with converging <b>billets</b> is proposed and simulated numerically. It follows a recently introduced process of ECAP with converging <b>billets,</b> {{in which the}} contact surface between converging <b>billets</b> plays the same role as a movable die wall in the output channel of classical ECAP and thus reduces friction and the process force. The process productivity is doubled and material pickup, especially problematic in the output channel, avoided. However, ECAP with converging <b>billets,</b> as any ECAP-based process, suffers from a limited length of the <b>billets</b> it can process. This paper proposes an incremental version of ECAP with converging <b>billets,</b> which enables processing very long <b>billets.</b> Additionally, a new option for ECAP or I-ECAP with converging <b>billets</b> is considered, which assumes their separation with a movable tool. This tool {{can also be used}} to apply a back force. FEM simulations of all these processes enable their comparison in terms of strain distribution and the force required...|$|R

5|$|Work on the {{plutonium}} core {{had to wait}} until Windscale delivered sufficient product, which was not until late 1951. The uranium tamper proved more of a challenge for the metallurgists than anticipated, due to a shortage of machine tools and moulds, and difficulty with the vacuum furnace. The first spheres were cast in December 1951, and while they were spherical to within , there were some casting defects, and it was feared they would hinder the implosion process. The defects were repaired, and two castings were prepared for Operation Hurricane. Work on plutonium chemistry and metallurgy was carried out at Harwell, as the hot laboratory at Aldermaston was not completed until May 1952. The first plutonium <b>billet</b> was cast there from plutonium nitrate from the Chalk River Laboratories in 1951. The metallurgists chose to alloy {{the plutonium}} with gallium to stabilise it in the malleable δ phase allotrope. Not until the first <b>billet</b> arrived from Harwell in 1951 were they able to confirm that this was practical.

5|$|On the {{initiative}} of Lieutenant Victor <b>Billet,</b> a Belgian sailor, the Royal Navy Section Belge (RNSB) was created in October 1940. By 1941, the RNSB numbered 350 men with several hundred more Belgians serving on other British naval and merchant ships. Unlike the neighbouring Netherlands, which had possessed a sizeable navy, the Belgian Corps de Marine had had only few ships before the war. With the surrender in May 1940, many vessels, including A4 which had evacuated Belgian gold to Britain during the campaign, travelled to neutral Spain and interned themselves rather than return to occupied Belgium. Consequently, most of the volunteers of the RNSB had been civilian fishermen or members of the Merchant Navy rather than career soldiers.|$|E

40|$|The {{demand for}} high {{performance}} cast aluminum alloy components is often disturbed by increasing impurity elements, such as iron accumulated from recycled scraps. It is strongly required that coarse plate-like iron compound of モ-Al 5 FeSi turns into harmless form {{without the need}} for applying refining additives or expensive virgin ingots. The microstructural modification of Al- 7 mass%Si alloy <b>billets</b> with different iron contents was examined by applying ultrasonic vibration during the solidification. Ultrasonically melt-treated <b>billets</b> were thixocast right after induction heating up to the semisolid temperature of 583 ìC, the microstructure and tensile properties were evaluated in the thixocast components. Globular primary メ-Al is required to fill up a thin cavity in thixocasting, so that the microstructural modification by ultrasonic melt-treatment was firstly confirmed in the <b>billets.</b> With ultrasonic melt-treatment in the temperature range of 630 ìC to 605 ìC, the primary メ-Al transforms itself from dendrite into fine globular in morphology. The coarse plate-like モ-Al 5 FeSi compound becomes markedly finer compared with those in non-treated <b>billets.</b> Semisolid soaking up to 583 ìC, does not appreciably affect the size of モ-Al 5 FeSi compounds; however, it affects the solid primary メ-Al morphology to be more globular, which is convenient for thixocasting. After thixocasting with preheated <b>billets,</b> eutectic silicon plates are extremely refined due to the rapid solidification arising from low casting temperature. The tensile strength of thixocast samples with different iron contents does not change much even at 2 mass% of iron, when thixocast with ultrasonically melt-treated <b>billets.</b> However, thixocast Al- 7 mass%Si- 2 mass%Fe alloy with non-treated <b>billets</b> exhibits an inferior strength of 80 MPa, compared with 180 MPa with ultrasonically melt-treated <b>billets.</b> The elongation is also improved by about a factor of two in thixocastings with ultrasonically melt-treated <b>billets</b> for all iron contents of Al- 7 mass%Si alloys, for example, the elongation of 11 % in thixocast of Al- 7 mass%Si- 0. 5 mass%Fe alloy with ultrasonically melt-treated <b>billets,</b> 5 % in that with non-treated <b>billets...</b>|$|R

5|$|Kinkaid now {{faced the}} {{prospect}} of selection to rear admiral. He knew that captains normally required {{a certain amount of}} seagoing command experience to be considered, but because his tour of duty on Indianapolis had been cut short in order to take up the post in Rome, he did not have enough months, and it was unlikely that a <b>billet</b> as captain of a battleship or cruiser would come up in sufficient time before the next round of selections. He discussed the matter with head of the Officers' Detail Section at the Bureau of Navigation, Captain Arthur S. Carpender, an Annapolis classmate who had himself recently been selected for flag rank. Carpender came up with a solution: he recommended Kinkaid for command of a destroyer squadron. This was a seagoing command, although Kinkaid was somewhat senior for it. Good fitness reports as commander of Destroyer Squadron 8, based in Philadelphia, resulted in Kinkaid's promotion to rear admiral in August 1941, despite having no more than two years' worth of total command experience. He became the last of his class to be promoted to flag rank before the United States entered the war. No one ranking lower in the class was promoted to flag rank before retirement.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Moreton family declined during the English Civil War. As supporters of the Royalist cause, they found themselves isolated {{in a community of}} Parliamentarians. Little Moreton Hall was requisitioned by the Parliamentarians in 1643 and used to <b>billet</b> Parliamentary soldiers. The family successfully petitioned for its restitution, and survived the Civil War with their ownership of Little Moreton Hall intact, but financially they were crippled. They tried to sell the entire estate, but could only dispose of several parcels of land. William Moreton died in 1654 leaving debts of £3,000–£4,000 (equivalent to about £12–16 million as of 2010), which forced his heirs to remortgage what remained of the estate. The family's fortunes never fully recovered, and by the late 1670s they no longer lived in Little Moreton Hall, renting it out instead to a series of tenant farmers. The Dale family took over the tenancy in 1841, and were still in residence more than 100 years later. By 1847 most of the house was unoccupied, and the deconsecrated Chapel was being used as a coal cellar and storeroom. Little Moreton Hall was in a ruinous condition; its windows were boarded up and its roof was rotten.|$|E
5|$|Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed {{building}} with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock {{on the top}} corner of {{the front of the}} house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to <b>billet</b> officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.|$|E
