30|$|According to {{the goal}} of {{cellular}} throughput optimization in this paper, a <b>BER</b> <b>threshold</b> at a receiving end is an important benchmark for cellular throughput optimization. That is, when each receiving end just meets its own <b>BER</b> <b>threshold,</b> the corresponding throughput value is what we expect. Otherwise, excessive high throughput will not significantly improve the user experience but consume too much energy. In addition, the gap between our scheme and the optimal one depends on the number of receiving UEs that cannot satisfy their <b>BER</b> <b>threshold</b> requirements.|$|E
30|$|In practice, {{different}} network applications {{have different}} <b>BER</b> <b>threshold</b> values. Therefore, when a network application {{has a large}} <b>BER</b> <b>threshold,</b> we should not use excessive high transmission power in pursuit of absolute increase in throughput. This is {{because it is a}} waste of energy, and also, it may not improve the user experience any more.|$|E
30|$|From the {{formulas}} (10)~(12), we know that, {{the lower}} <b>BER</b> <b>threshold</b> {{will require the}} higher transmission power to ensure the user experience. Also, the user will get higher throughput. However, with the further increase of transmission power, the increase of throughput gets smaller and smaller {{when compared with the}} transmitting power. Therefore, very low <b>BER</b> <b>threshold</b> will result in poor energy efficiency.|$|E
30|$|The {{adaptive}} {{scheme is}} controlled by the measurement of the signal quality, i.e., BER, at Rx. The measured BER will then be compared to the <b>BER</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Two <b>BER</b> <b>thresholds</b> are defined in this paper, namely, upper and lower thresholds that determine the selection of one of three possible schemes denoted as Set-l.

This slight performance difference between the two approaches can be seen clearly in Fig.  9. These are {{due to the fact that}} at low SNRs, the distance between the upper and lower threshold to the benchmark non-adaptive performance curve is smaller in the non-linear threshold, compared to that in the linear approach. Hence, at low SNR the adaptive systems with non-linear threshold utilize more frequently adaptive scheme Set- 3 rather than other sets, resulting in aforementioned conditions.|$|E
30|$|From Fig.  9, one {{can also}} see that the {{adaptive}} system in a 2 I 2 O configuration provides a slightly less improvement over the non-adaptive one, compared to the 2 I 1 O configuration. The gain is about 1 – 2  dB or 20 – 37 % transmission power saving for the linear <b>BER</b> <b>threshold.</b> The non-linear <b>BER</b> <b>threshold</b> performs slightly worse than the linear <b>BER</b> <b>threshold</b> in the whole SNR region. The improvement is smaller in the 2 I 2 O configuration since the system already has a large diversity, so even the non-adaptive WBAN system {{could take advantage of}} it. Nonetheless, if we compare the error performances of the 2 I 1 O and 2 I 2 O configurations, it is intuitive that the application of the proposed adaptive schemes in the 2 I 2 O configuration provides a much better link quality up to BER of 10 − 4 that is suitable for more stringent QoS applications.|$|E

30|$|To {{address those}} issues, {{in this paper}} we propose an {{optimized}} adaptive STFC MB-OFDM UWB system as a high data rate physical (PHY) layer for a WBAN system. The STFC is employed in order to exploit the diversity of the off-body WBAN channel, which is very diverse in nature. This proposed adaptive algorithm selects a suitable set among three possible sets of modulation, STFC coding rate, and transmit signal power. Each set employs a combination between a BPSK and QPSK, a full-rate Alamouti code or a 3 / 2 -rate Sezginer-Sari code, and a normalized transmit power of 1.5, 1.0, or 0.5 as described in detail in Section 4. The Alamouti code and Sezginer-Sari code are chosen as STFC codes because they offer a full diversity, full rate, and higher rate, for Alamouti code and Sezginer-Sari code, respectively. Moreover, they have a simple decoding process as described later in Section 4.1. The switching between adaptive schemes is determined by two <b>BER</b> <b>thresholds,</b> namely, the lower and upper thresholds. In order to pursue the maximum performance and power reduction, the optimization of adaptive parameters is conducted in this work. Two most important parameters are optimized, i.e., the f factor that defines a portion of the received frame where the BER is measured and the set of adaptive scheme {{of the rest of the}} frame is updated, and the k factor which defines a distance between upper and lower <b>BER</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the adaptive algorithm. This optimized adaptive scheme results in a performance improvement by up to 6  dB, meaning a possible 75 % reduction of the total transmitted power, compared to a non-adaptive WBAN.|$|R

The purpose of our study was to assess the reliability of SVR-threshold definition in subjects taking neuroleptic, sedative, and hypnotic drugs. Fifteen subjects examined for occupational hearing loss at the Fund for Occupational Diseases in Brussels and regularly taking one or several of these drugs were compared with 27 comparable controls. In each subject the auditory thresholds were defined with both techniques: SVR (1, 2, and 3 kHz) and BER (clicks).
