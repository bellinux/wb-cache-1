50|$|Monitoring of {{population}} changes through genetic means {{can be done}} retrospectively, through analysis of 'historical' DNA recovered from museum-archived species and comparison with contemporary DNA of that species. It {{can also be used}} as a tool for evaluating ongoing changes in the status and persistence of current populations. Genetic measures of relative population change include changes in diversity (e.g. heterozygosity and allelic richness). Monitoring of relative population changes through these metrics has been performed retrospectively for Beringian bison, Galapagos tortoise, houting, Atlantic salmon, northern pike, New Zealand snapper, steelhead trout, greater prairie chicken, Mauritius kestrel and Hector's dolphin and is the subject of many ongoing studies, including Danish and Swedish brown trout populations. Measuring absolute population changes (e.g. effective population size (Ne)) can be carried out by measuring changes in population allele frequencies (‘Ftemporal’) or levels of linkage disequilibrium over time (‘LDNe’), while changing patterns of gene flow between populations can also be monitored by estimating differences in allele frequencies between populations over time.

The ability of one isolate to cause disease on M. sativa (alfalfa), Cicer arietinum (chickpea), Pisum sativum (pea), Lens culinaris (lentil) and Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) was also tested. The pathogen caused dark lesions that enlarged and coalesced causing yellowing and premature abscission of leaves, resulting in decreased shoot fresh weight in <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> plants. All P. medicaginis isolates infected <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> roots causing collar rot, brown root discoloration, yellowing of cotyledons and reduced shoot and root development. The pathogen colonized the cortex and the stele {{of plants and}} produced fertile pycnidia on infected roots. Symptoms on leaves allowed for greater discrimination in aggressiveness among isolates in comparison to symptoms on roots. No correlations were observed between the parameters measured on leaves and roots suggesting organ specialization in this pathogen. Phoma medicaginis infected leaves of alfalfa, pea, common bean and chickpea causing necrosis and tissue yellowing at 15 d post inoculation (dpi). Pycnidium production was observed on dead and dying foliar tissues of alfalfa, pea and common bean, but not on chickpea. The pathogen caused symptoms of collar rot and brown root discoloration on alfalfa, chickpea, pea and common bean, but did not cause symptoms on leaves or roots of lentil at 15 dpi.

40|$|Fifteen {{years ago}} {{subterranean}} clover (Trifolium subterraneum) and annual medics (Medicago spp.) dominated annual pasture legume sowings in southern Australia, while limited pasture legume options existed for cropping areas of subtropical Australia. Since then {{a number of}} sustainability and economic challenges to existing farming systems have emerged, exposing shortcomings in these species {{and the lack of}} legume biodiversity. Public breeding institutions have responded to these challenges by developing 58 new annual and short-lived perennial pasture legumes with adaptation to both existing and new farming systems. This has involved commercialisation of new species and overcoming deficiencies in traditional species. Traits incorporated in legumes of Mediterranean Basin origin for the Mediterranean, temperate and southern subtropical climates of Australia include deeper root systems, protection from false breaks (germination-inducing rainfall events followed by death from drought), a range of hardseed levels, acid-soil tolerant root nodule symbioses, tolerance to pests and diseases and provision of lower cost seed through ease of seed harvesting and processing. Ten new species, French serradella (Ornithopus sativus), biserrula (Biserrula pelecinus), sulla (Hedysarum coronarium), gland (Trifolium glanduliferum), arrowleaf (Trifolium vesiculosum), eastern star (Trifolium dasyurum) and crimson (Trifolium incarnatum) clovers and sphere (Medicago sphaerocarpos), button (Medicago orbicularis) and hybrid disc (Medicago tornata × Medicago littoralis) medics have been commercialised. Improved cultivars have also been developed of subterranean (T. subterraneum), balansa (Trifolium michelianum), rose (Trifolium hirtum), Persian (Trifolium resupinatum) and purple (Trifolium purpureum) clovers, burr (Medicago polymorpha), strand (M. littoralis), snail (Medicago scutellata) and <b>barrel</b> (Medicago truncatula) <b>medics</b> and yellow serradella (Ornithopus compressus). New tropical legumes for pasture phases in subtropical cropping areas include butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea), burgundy bean (Macroptilium bracteatum) and perennial lablab (Lablab purpureus). Other species and cultivars of Mediterranean species are likely to be released soon. The contributions of genetic resources, rhizobiology, pasture ecology and agronomy, plant pathology, entomology, plant chemistry and animal science have been paramount to this success. A farmer survey in Western Australia has shown widespread adoption of the new pasture legumes, while adoption of new tropical legumes has also been high in cropping areas of the subtropics. This trend is likely to increase due to the increasing cost of inorganic nitrogen, the need to combat herbicide-resistant crop weeds and improved livestock prices. Mixtures of these legumes allows for more robust pastures buffered against variable seasons, soils, pests, diseases and management decisions.

40|$|In {{leguminous plants}} such as pea (Pisum sativum), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> (Medicago truncatula), and {{chickpea}} (Cicer arietinum), 4 ′-O-methylation of isoflavonoid natural products occurs early in the biosynthesis of defense chemicals known as phytoalexins. However, among these four species, only pea catalyzes 3 -O-methylation that converts the pterocarpanoid isoflavonoid 6 a-hydroxymaackiain to pisatin. In pea, pisatin is important for chemical resistance to the pathogenic fungus Nectria hematococca. While <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> does not biosynthesize 6 a-hydroxymaackiain, when cell suspension cultures are fed 6 a-hydroxymaackiain, they accumulate pisatin. In vitro, hydroxyisoflavanone 4 ′-O-methyltransferase (HI 4 ′OMT) from <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> exhibits nearly identical steady state kinetic parameters for the 4 ′-O-methylation of the isoflavonoid intermediate 2, 7, 4 ′-trihydroxyisoflavanone and for the 3 -O-methylation of the 6 a-hydroxymaackiain isoflavonoid-derived pterocarpanoid intermediate found in pea. Protein x-ray crystal structures of HI 4 ′OMT substrate complexes revealed identically bound conformations for the 2 S, 3 R-stereoisomer of 2, 7, 4 ′-trihydroxyisoflavanone and the 6 aR, 11 aR-stereoisomer of 6 a-hydroxymaackiain. These results suggest how similar conformations intrinsic to seemingly distinct chemical substrates allowed leguminous plants to use homologous enzymes for two different biosynthetic reactions. The three-dimensional similarity of natural small molecules represents one explanation for how plants may rapidly recruit enzymes for new biosynthetic reactions in response to changing physiological and ecological pressures...|$|E

40|$|Caleosin are a {{class of}} calcium-binding {{proteins}} embedded in the phospholipid monolayer of lipid droplets. In addition to maintaining thestructure of lipid droplets, caleosin proteins areinvolved in dormancy and lipid signaling, and areassociatedwith the stress response via their histidine-dependent peroxygenase activity. To date, caleosins have been studied in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, {{little is known about}} these genes in legumes,including the most cultivated oilseed crop, soybean. In this paper, 20 caleosin genes in soybean, common bean and <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> werestudied. Among these, 13 caleosin genes, including 3 in Glycine max, 5 in Phaseolus vulgarisand 5 in Medicago truncatula, are identified for the first time. The structures, characteristics and evolution of the 20 caleosin proteins are analyzed. Expansion patterns show that tandem duplication was the main reason for the caleosin family expansion in the legume. Expression profiles indicate that L-caleosin in soybean and common bean are more important than H-caleosin, which is just the opposite in Arabidopsis thaliana. GmaCLO 2, PvuCLO 1, PvuCLO 3 and MtrCLO 3 may play important roles, while GmaCLO 6, GmaCLO 10 and MtrCLO 4 may lose their function in the examined tissues.

40|$|In the {{cropping}} soils {{of southern}} Australia, pasture phases {{based on the}} annual legume <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> (Medicago truncatula Gaertn.) provide significant inputs of organic matter and lead to improvements in soil structure and fertility. This thesis aimed to quantify the belowground input of carbon by <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> {{and the effect of}} defoliation on this input. This aids the development of simulation models of soil organic carbon, and has practical implications regarding rotation choice and grazing management. The major belowground input of carbon in annual species is found as root production. Measurement of total root biomass production, using a technique that accounted for root death and decomposition, found that it was 1. 6 to 2. 9 times the maximum live root biomass. In a year of very low rainfall, root production was a lot less than in a year of average rainfall. However, the ratio of total root production to total shoot production was higher. In both years, the total root biomass production and root:shoot ratio of <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> were greater than faba beans but similar to barley grass. Total root biomass production of a frequently defoliated <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> pasture was estimated using a ¹ ³C dilution technique where swards were pulse labelled with ¹ ³C. Root biomass production following labelling was estimated from the subsequent dilution in ¹ ³C enrichment during the remainder of the season. Although live root biomass of cut pasture was less than that of uncut pasture, total root biomass production was similar. ¹ ³C allocation data showed that this was due to greater allocation of carbon belowground by cut plants. It was concluded there must be greater turnover of root material under cut pasture. The effect of defoliation on the amount of carbon released to the soil through rhizodeposition was estimated by growing plants in pots in a labelled atmosphere in a growth cabinet. Plants were grown in a ¹ ⁴C-labelled CO₂ atmosphere, defoliated and then grown in a ¹ ³C-labelled CO₂ atmosphere. Distribution of ¹ ⁴C and ¹ ³C in the plants was compared with uncut plants. Defoliation did not {{have a significant effect on}} belowground allocation of carbon. The proportion of labelled carbon allocated belowground was 24 and 28 % for cut and uncut plants respectively. Total input of carbon into the soil was estimated to be 1. 70 (cut) and 1. 65 (uncut) times the amount of carbon recovered in root biomass. Applying these correction factors to results from the field experiments, total annual belowground input of carbon ranged from 700 to 1880 kg C/ha. As a proportion of carbon in above ground production, carbon input belowground ranged from 0. 40 to 0. 77. Defoliation at the frequency and level imposed in these experiments had no adverse effect on total belowground inputs of carbon. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Plants {{experience}} various environmental stresses, but {{tolerance to}} these adverse conditions {{is a very}} complex phenomenon. The present research aimed to evaluate a set of genes involved in osmotic response, comparing soybean and medicago with the well-described Arabidopsis thaliana model plant. Based on 103 Arabidopsis proteins from 27 categories of osmotic stress response, comparative analyses against Genosoja and Medicago truncatula databases allowed the identification of 1, 088 soybean and 1, 210 Medicago sequences. The analysis showed a high number of sequences and high diversity, comprising genes from all categories in both organisms. Genes with unknown function were among the most representative, followed by transcription factors, ion transport proteins, water channel, plant defense, protein degradation, cellular structure, organization & biogenesis and senescence. An analysis of sequences with unknown function allowed the annotation of 174 soybean and 217 Medicago sequences, most of them concerning transcription factors. However, for about 30 % of the sequences no function could be attributed using in silico procedures. The establishment of a gene set involved in osmotic stress responses in soybean and <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> will help to better understand the survival mechanisms for this type of stress condition in legumes. 201...|$|E
40|$|Medicago truncatula (<b>barrel</b> <b>medic)</b> A 17 is {{currently}} being sequenced as a model legume, complementing the sequenced root nodule bacterial strain Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 (Sm 1021). In this study, {{the effectiveness of the}} Sm 1021 -M. truncatula symbiosis at fixing N 2 was evaluated. • N 2 fixation effectiveness was examined with eight Medicago species and three accessions of M. truncatula with Sm 1021 and two other Sinorhizobium strains. Plant shoot dry weights, plant nitrogen content and nodule distribution, morphology and number were analysed. • Compared with nitrogen-fed controls, Sm 1021 was ineffective or partially effective on all hosts tested (excluding M. sativa), as measured by reduced dry weights and shoot N content. Against an effective strain, Sm 1021 on M. truncatula accessions produced more nodules, which were small, pale, more widely distributed on the root system and with fewer infected cells. • The Sm 1021 -M. truncatula symbiosis is poorly matched for N 2 fixation and the strain could possess broader N 2 fixation deficiencies. A possible origin for this reduction in effectiveness is discussed. An alternative sequenced strain, effective at N 2 fixation on M. truncatula A 17, is Sinorhizobium medicae WSM 419...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{anticipated}} {{that many of}} today’s diploid plant species are in fact paleopolyploids. Given that an ancient large-scale duplication will result in an excess of relatively old duplicated genes with similar ages, we analyzed the timing of duplication of pairs of paralogous genes in 14 model plant species. Using EST contigs (unigenes), we identified pairs of paralogous genes in each species and used the level of synonymous nucleotide substitution to estimate the relative ages of gene duplication. For nine of the investigated species (wheat [Triticum aestivum], maize [Zea mays], tetraploid cotton [Gossypium hirsutum], diploid cotton [G. arboretum], tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum], potato [Solanum tuberosum], soybean [Glycine max], <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> [Medicago truncatula], and Arabidopsis thaliana), the age distributions of duplicated genes contain peaks corresponding to short evolutionary periods during which large numbers of duplicated genes were accumulated. Large-scale duplications (polyploidy or aneuploidy) are strongly suspected to {{be the cause of}} these temporal peaks of gene duplication. However, the unusual age profile of tandem gene duplications in Arabidopsis indicates that other scenarios, such as variation in the rate at which duplicated genes are deleted, must also be considered...|$|E
40|$|Aphanomyces euteiches causes {{root rot}} disease of alfalfa, and two races of the {{pathogen}} {{have been identified}} based on the reaction of established check cultivars. A majority of alfalfa cultivars grown in regions where A. euteiches is prevalent have resistance to race 1 of the pathogen, but very few cultivars have resistance to race 2. The genetic basis of resistance in alfalfa to A. euteiches is unknown, {{in part due to}} characteristics of alfalfa that impede genetic analysis, including its tetraploid genome and susceptibility to inbreeding depression. The <b>barrel</b> <b>medic,</b> Medicago truncatula, has been suggested as a model organism for the study of legume genetics. Our objective was to evaluate plant introduction (PI) accessions of M. truncatula for resistance to A. euteiches race 2. In repeated experiments, employing standardized testing conditions used for evaluating resistance in alfalfa to A. euteiches, we identified seven M. truncatula accessions with levels of resistance similar to the resistant alfalfa check population WAPH- 5. Two M. truncatula accessions were identified that were as susceptible as the susceptible alfalfa check cultivar Saranac. The utility of M. truncatula as a model for studying the genetics of resistance in alfalfa to A. euteiches race 2 is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The genus Medicago, {{a member}} of the legume (Fabaceae) family, {{comprises}} 87 species of flowering plants, including the forage crop M. sativa (alfalfa) and the model legume M. truncatula (<b>barrel</b> <b>medic).</b> Medicago species synthesize a variety of bioactive natural products that are used to engage into symbiotic interactions but also serve to deter pathogens and herbivores. For humans, these bioactive natural products often possess promising pharmaceutical properties. In this review, we focus on the two most interesting and well characterized secondary metabolite classes found in Medicago species, the triterpene saponins and the flavonoids, with a detailed overview of their biosynthesis, regulation, and profiling methods. Furthermore, their biological role within the plant as well as their potential utility for human health or other applications is discussed. Finally, we give an overview of the advances made in metabolic engineering in Medicago species and how the development of novel molecular and omics toolkits can influence a better understanding of this genus in terms of specialized metabolism and chemistry. Throughout, we critically analyze the current bottlenecks and speculate on future directions and opportunities for research and exploitation of Medicago metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Medicago truncatula (<b>barrel</b> <b>medic)</b> {{has emerged}} as a model legume and {{accession}} A 17 is the reference genotype selected for the sequencing of the genome. In the present study we compare the A 17 chromosomal configuration with that of other accessions by examining pollen viability and genetic maps of intraspecific hybrids. • Hybrids derived from crosses between M. truncatula accessions, representative of the large genetic variation within the germplasm collection, were evaluated for pollen viability using Alexander's stain. Genetic maps were generated for the following crosses: SA 27063 × SA 3054 (n = 94), SA 27063 × A 17 (n = 92), A 17 × Borung (n = 99) and A 17 × A 20 (n = 69). • All F 1 individuals derived from crosses involving A 17 showed 50 % pollen viability or less. Examination of the recombination frequencies between markers of chromosomes 4 and 8 revealed an apparent genetic linkage between the lower arms of these chromosomes in genetic maps derived from A 17. • Semisterility and unexpected linkage relationship are both good indicators of a reciprocal translocation. The implications of the A 17 distinctive chromosomal rearrangement on studies of genetic mapping, genome sequencing and synteny between species are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Metabolic {{profiling}} of elicited <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> (Medicago truncatula) cell cultures using high-performance {{liquid chromatography}} coupled to photodiode and mass spectrometry detection revealed the accumulation of the aurone hispidol (6 -hydroxy- 2 -[(4 -hydroxyphenyl) methylidene]- 1 -benzofuran- 3 -one) as a major response to yeast elicitor. Parallel, large-scale transcriptome profiling indicated that three peroxidases, MtPRX 1, MtPRX 2, and MtPRX 3, were coordinately induced with the accumulation of hispidol. MtPRX 1 and MtPRX 2 exhibited aurone synthase activity based upon in vitro substrate specificity and product profiles of recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Hispidol possessed significant antifungal activity relative to other M. truncatula phenylpropanoids tested but has not been reported in this species before and was not found in differentiated roots in which high levels of the peroxidase transcripts accumulated. We propose that hispidol is formed in cell cultures by metabolic spillover when the pool of its precursor, isoliquiritigenin, builds up {{as a result of}} an imbalance between the upstream and downstream segments of the phenylpropanoid pathway, reflecting the plasticity of plant secondary metabolism. The results illustrate that integration of metabolomics and transcriptomics in genetically reprogrammed plant cell cultures is a powerful approach for the discovery of novel bioactive secondary metabolites and the mechanisms underlying their generation...|$|E
40|$|Aphids {{and related}} insects feed {{from a single}} cell type in plants: the phloem sieve element. Genetic {{resistance}} to Acyrthosiphon kondoi Shinji (bluegreen aphid or blue alfalfa aphid) has been identified in Medicago truncatula Gaert. (<b>barrel</b> <b>medic)</b> and backcrossed into susceptible cultivars. The status of M. truncatula as a model legume allows an in-depth study of defense against this aphid at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels. In this study, two closely related resistant and susceptible genotypes were used to characterize the aphid-resistance phenotype. Resistance conditions antixenosis since migratory aphids were deterred from settling on resistant plants within 6 h of release, preferring to settle on susceptible plants. Analysis of feeding behavior revealed the trait affects A. kondoi {{at the level of}} the phloem sieve element. Aphid reproduction on excised shoots demonstrated that resistance requires an intact plant. Antibiosis against A. kondoi is enhanced by prior infestation, indicating induction of this phloem-specific defense. Resistance segregates as a single dominant gene, AKR (Acyrthosiphon kondoi resistance), in two mapping populations, which have been used to map the locus to a region flanked by resistance gene analogs predicted to encode the CC-NBS-LRR subfamily of resistance proteins. This work provides the basis for future molecular analysis of defense against phloem parasitism in a plant model system...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium wilt, {{caused by}} several formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum, is an {{important}} disease of most crop and pasture legumes, including field pea (Pisum sativum), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), lucerne (alfalfa, Medicago sativa) and <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> (M. truncatula). Medicago truncatula {{is an important}} pasture legume and a model legume species. Hence, {{it can be used}} to increase our knowledge of resistance mechanisms efficient to block F. oxysporum infection if its response to the disease is characterised. We evaluated the physiological and susceptibility responses to the disease of two contrasting M. truncatula genotypes, and the effect of several cultural conditions known to affect the disease incidence, such as plant age at infection time, growth substrate and the method of inoculation. Our results indicated that the A 17 accession harbours a moderate level of resistance to the disease. We also showed that the method of inoculation strongly affected development of fusarium wilt disease in this model species, whereas it was not significantly altered by plant age or the inorganic growth substrate tested. In addition, we describe a rapid change in leaf temperature after infection, which can be used as an indirect parameter to confirm fungal infection at a very early stage of the interaction.

40|$|The {{likelihood}} of duplicate gene retention following polyploidy varies by functional properties (e. g. gene ontologies or protein family domains), but {{little is known}} about the effects of whole-genome duplication on gene networks related by a common physiological process. Here, we examined the effects of both polyploid and nonpolyploid duplications on genes encoding the major functional groups of photosynthesis (photosystem I, photosystem II, the light-harvesting complex, and the Calvin cycle) in the cultivated soybean (Glycine max), which has experienced two rounds of whole-genome duplication. Photosystem gene families exhibit retention patterns consistent with dosage sensitivity (preferential retention of polyploid duplicates and elimination of nonpolyploid duplicates), whereas Calvin cycle and light-harvesting complex gene families do not. We observed similar patterns in <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> (Medicago truncatula), which shared the older genome duplication with soybean but has evolved independently for approximately 50 million years, and in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), which experienced two nested polyploidy events independent from the legume duplications. In both soybean and Arabidopsis, Calvin cycle gene duplicates exhibit a greater capacity for functional differentiation than do duplicates within the photosystems, which likely explains the greater retention of ancient, nonpolyploid duplicates and larger average gene family size for the Calvin cycle relative to the photosystems...|$|E
40|$|Oligopeptides {{have been}} {{recognized}} as signalling molecules playing {{an important role in}} plant cell growth and development. Phytosulfokine-alpha (PSK), a plant-specific disulfated pentapeptide, is involved at nanomolar concentrations in initial steps of cellular dedifferentiation, proliferation, and re-differentiation, with a biological function similar to that of plant hormones. On the other hand, legume crops are generally known for their recalcitrance to in vitro regeneration approaches, which has restrained the exploitation of biotechnological tools for their genetic improvement. Against this background, we added PSK at concentrations of 10 - 10 to 10 - 6 M, to semisolid MS-based culture media previously shown to permit some regeneration responses with a number of genotypes of pea (Pisum sativum), Medicago truncatula and also the highly recalcitrant faba bean (Vicia faba). Callus, cell suspensions and embryo-derived explants of <b>barrel</b> <b>medic</b> R 108, pea cvs Frisson and Cameor and a zero vicin, zero tannin faba bean genotype were tested and their embryogenic and organogenic regeneration competence was assessed. PSK had a strong and significant enhancing effect on the regeneration competence of all genotypes, producing somatic embryos and organs that yielded regenerated plants of both pea and M. truncatula, and with a major organogenic effect leading to plant regeneration with faba bean where somatic embryos, although produced, failed to convert into viable plants. This is the first report on the use of PSK with legume species...|$|E
