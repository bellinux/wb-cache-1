The results show that reflection of supersonic disturbances <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> makes <b>the</b> confined supersonic mixing layer more unstable than the unconfined free shear layer. Decreasing the distance between <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> makes <b>the</b> flow more unstable. However, subsonic disturbances are relatively unaffected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> Heat release and Mach number hardly change the growth rates of supersonic disturbances. The most unstable supersonic disturbances are two-dimensional in rectangular channel flows, but three-dimensional in partially confined flows. Finally, the reactants are not strongly mixed by supersonic instabilities, which mainly disturb one side of the layer...|$|R
