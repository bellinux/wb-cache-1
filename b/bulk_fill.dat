50|$|In the 1930s, Crosman {{began to}} {{experiment}} with CO2 power. Like other CO2 guns of the day, they were <b>bulk</b> <b>fill,</b> which meant that liquid CO2 was loaded into a pressurized reservoir on the gun. Other manufacturers started to use 8 gram CO2 bulbs used in soda dispensers. Crosman capitalized on this in 1954 by introducing a new 12 gram CO2 bulb, called a Powerlet. The new Powerlet gave more shots per bulb than the soda bulb, and {{with the addition of}} a simple spacer, a Powerlet gun could use the shorter 8 gram bulb.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{temperature}} {{change is not}} readily addressable, other than {{by the use of}} readily adjustable sights, so the shooter can adjust the sights to match the point of impact based on the current ambient conditions. In the case of rapid fire, there is a solution that can provide far greater stability for many guns. The original CO2 airguns were filled from an external source of CO2, but in 1954 Crosman introduced the 12 gram Powerlet, a compact, disposable tank now ubiquitous in inexpensive CO2 airguns. The downside to these is that the small quantity of CO2 liquid cools down quickly, leading to a rapid drop in velocity and a changing point of impact. By moving to a <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> system, with a much larger tank, there is more liquid available, and the greater mass will cool far more slowly.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{determine}} the total volumetric {{change and the}} relative speed of shrinkage of <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites during polymerization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A specially designed electronic mercury dilatometer was used to {{determine the}} volumetric change. The light intensity was 500 mW/cm 2. The mercury dilatometer measured the volumetric change every 0. 5 seconds during the 35 second irradiation exposure time. The materials tested were Z 250 as standard and control. Four <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites were tested. RESULTS: The sequence of total volumetric change was found to be: Z 250 < Filtek <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> < Xtra-Base <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> < SDR < Venus <b>bulk</b> <b>fill.</b> The speed of shrinkage of the <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowables was faster than that of Z 250, while the 2 flowables with the highest shrinkage speed (SDR and Venus) also had the highest total volumetric change. Of the different materials tested the volumetric change of Z 250 (1. 13 %) was the lowest and significantly less (p< 0. 05) than that of SDR (1. 55 %) and Venus (1. 72 %). The material with the highest filler content (Z 250) also showed the lowest shrinkage (1. 13 %) but this effect could not be seen in the flowables. In general, it was found that a 35 second irradiation period (with a light intensity of 500 mW/cm 2) was satisfactory for complete polymerization of the resins. CONCLUSIONS: The volumetric changes and speed of shrinkage were higher for all 4 <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites than for Z 250. SDR and Venus flowables had the fastest and highest volumetric shrinkage. Clinical significance: The manufacturers of <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites advocate filling layers of 4 mm.

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Objectives: To {{determine}} the total volumetric {{change and the}} relative speed of shrinkage of <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites during polymerization. Background: The volumetric change that occur during the polymerization of dental composite restorations {{are considered to be}} one of the most significant contributing factors when considering the failure in composite restorations. Volumetric shrinkage of more than 2 % is considered to be enough to result in the occurrence of secondary caries resulting in fracture of restorations and failure in the adhesive layer of a resin restoration. The total volumetric change of dental resins can be attributed to three main factors: Firstly, the polymerization reaction that results in the formation of a polymer chain. Secondly, the increase of the exothermic thermal effects produced by the polymerization reaction and thirdly, light irradiance energy that is transferred to the dental resin. Materials and Methods: A specially designed electronic mercury dilatometer at the UWC Oral and Dental Research Institute was used to {{determine the}} volumetric change. The light intensity was set at 500 mW/cm 2. The mercury dilatometer measured the volumetric change every 0. 5 seconds during the 35 second irradiation exposure time. The materials tested were Z 250 as the control and four <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites. The volume of voids within the cured material samples were assessed with a Micro- 3 D ct reconstruction (General Electric Phoenix). Results: The sequence of total volumetric change from least to most were: Z 250 < Filtek <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> < Xtra-Base <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> < SDR < Venus <b>bulk</b> <b>fill.</b> The speed/rate of shrinkage of the <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites were faster than that of Z 250, while the 2 <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowables with the highest shrinkage speed (SDR and Venus) also had the highest total volumetric change. Of the different materials tested the volumetric change of Z 250 (1. 13 %) was the lowest and significantly less (p< 0. 05) than that of SDR (1. 56 %) and Venus (1. 72 %). The Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison test indicated that the material with the highest filler content (Z 250) also showed the lowest shrinkage (1. 13 %) but this effect of the filler content could not be seen in the <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites. The volume of the voids within the test specimens were determined and were represented as a percentage of the cured volume (49. 087 mm³). Venus had the largest percentage of voids (1. 18 %) in the test specimen (specimen volume: 49. 087 mm³), followed by Z 250 with 0, 5248 %, Xtra base with 0, 00015 %, SDR with 0, 00059 % and Filtek <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> with 0, 00069 %. Conclusions: The volumetric changes and rate of shrinkage were higher for all 4 <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composites than for Z 250.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Despite {{advances}} and innovations in restorative dentistry, microleakage {{remains one of}} the main problems in this area. Objective To evaluate in vitro marginal microleakage of <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> resins in class II cavities, with cervical termination in the dentin. Material and method Cavities, standardized on the mesial and distal surfaces, were prepared in forty top molars and randomly assigned to four groups (n = 10), according to the resin used. G 1 (control) : Filtek Z 350 (3 M/ESPE); G 2 : Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> flow (3 M/ESPE); G 3 : Surefill SDR (Dentsply); G 4 : X-tra (Voco). These were further subdivided into subgroups according to the strategy used to apply the adhesive (self-etch technique and conventional). After storage for 24 hours in an oven (37 °C), the samples were submitted to the thermocycling test (500 cycles: 5 °C/ 55 °C). They were later waterproofed, immersed in Basic Fuchsin (0. 5 %) and sectioned in the mesial-distal direction for evaluation using a stereo magnifying glass at 40 X (Coleman) Scores from 0 to 3 were assigned according to the microinfiltration observed. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, with a significance level of 5 %, were used for statistical analysis. Result There was no statistically significant difference between the <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> resins when the total acid-etching technique was used. Only the Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flow resin presented statistically significant results when the application of the adhesive system strategy was considered, with worse results, in relation to other groups, when it the self-etching strategy was considered.

Standard class II cavities were prepared in teeth and restored with 3 M <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composite in group 1, SonicFill <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composite in group 2 and Z 250 conventional composite in group 3. Single Bond 2 bonding agent was used in all cavities. The teeth were then thermocycled and immersed in 1 M silver nitrate solution. The teeth were then mesiodistally sectioned and evaluated under a stereomicroscope at´ 10 magnification. Dye penetration depth was recorded in microns and {{data were analyzed using}} one-way ANOVA. Results: The mean (± standard deviation) dye penetration depth in the gingival margins was 543 ± 523 µm, 343 ± 290 µm and 597 ± 590 µm for 3 M <b>bulk</b> <b>fill,</b> SonicFill and Z 250 conventional composite, respectively.

40|$|Statement of Problem: For many years, {{application}} of the composite restoration with a thickness less than 2 mm for achieving the minimum polymerization contraction and stress has been accepted as a principle. But through the recent development in dental material a group of resin based composites (RBCs) called <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> is introduced whose producers claim the possibility of achieving a good restoration in bulks with depths of 4 or even 5 mm. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of irradiation times and bulk depths {{on the degree of}} cure (DC) of a <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composite and compare it with the universal type. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on two groups of dental RBCs including Tetric N Ceram <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> and Tetric N Ceram Universal. The composite samples were prepared in Teflon moulds with a diameter of 5 mm and height of 2, 4 and 6 mm. Then, half of the samples in each depth were cured from the upper side of the mould for 20 s by LED light curing unit. The irradiation time for other specimens was 40 s. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water, the microhardness of {{the top and bottom of}} the samples was measured using a Future Tech (Japan- Model FM 700) Vickers hardness testing machine. Data were analyzed statistically using the one and multi way ANOVAand Tukey’s test (p = 0. 050). Results: The DC of Tetric N Ceram <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> in defined irradiation time and bulk depth was significantly more than the universal type (p < 0. 001). Also, the DC of both composites studied was significantly (p < 0. 001) reduced by increasing the bulk depths. Increasing the curing time from 20 to 40 seconds had a marginally significant effect (p ≤ 0. 040) on the DC of both <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> and universal studied RBC samples. Conclusions: The DC of the investigated <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composite was better than the universal type in all the irradiation times and bulk depths. The studied universal and <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> RBCs had an appropriate DC at the 2 and 4 mm bulk depths respectively and using the recommended curing time of 40 s can led to the slightly better value of DC in both composites...|$|E

Materials and Methods: The upper surfaces of prepared composite discs were polished with Sof-Lex discs. The samples were subjected to a thermocycling process for 3000 cycles, then immersed in the prepared mixture solution for two weeks. Before and after the aging simulation, profilometer and spectrophotometer were used to measure surface roughness (Ra) and color of the composite discs. The color change (ΔE) of each material was calculated. Results: The ΔE values showed a statistically significant difference among the studied materials (p< 0. 001). The Ra values of X-tra fil, Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> Flowable, SonicFill, and Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> Posterior were significantly increased by the aging process (p< 0. 001), while G-aenial Universal Flo, Filtek Ultimate, and Herculite XRV Ultra showed steady roughness (p< 0. 001).

Class I cavities (4 x 5 x 4 mm), C-factor = 4. 2, were performed on caries-free human third molars and randomly divided into five groups (n = 6) : FSI (Filtek Supreme XTE incremental insertion); FSS [(Filtek Supreme XTE single insertion(SI) ]; TBF [(Tetric Bulk Fill: SI and manual filling (MF) ]; SFM (Sonic Fill: SI/MF); and SFS (SonicFill: SI and sonic filling). The teeth were scanned and analyzed by μCT at T 0, after filling the cavity with resin, and at T 1, after polymerization for VG and VV, and for VS (T 1 -T 0). There was statistically significant difference in VS in μCT for the FSI and FSS groups and between SFS and FSS {{as well as some}} difference in VV for FSI and <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> resin composites and no difference in VG between the conventional technique and <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composites. <b>Bulk</b> <b>fill</b> resin composites presented similar VS and gap formation to those of incrementally inserted conventional resin composites. There is a moderate and weak positive correlation between polymerization shrinkage and gap formation and void, respectively.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the marginal sealing ability of a <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable resin composite on both enamel and dentin substrates. Materials and Methods: 48 non-carious molars were selected and four Class-V cavities were prepared at the CEJ of each sample. Cavities were filled with Venus Diamond (Heraeus Kulzer); Venus Diamond Flow (Heraeus Kulzer) and Surefil SDR (Dentsply). Samples {{were divided into two}} groups: First group samples were immersed in a methylene blue solution for 30 min at 25 °C. Second group samples were artificially aged and then treated with methylene blue. Samples were sectioned {{in the center of the}} restoration and observed with a 40 x stereomicroscope, and the percentage of cavity infiltration was calculated. Results: Results were analyzed statistically by ANOVA (P < 0. 05). The amount of infiltration was significantly lower for the enamel substrate compared with dentin (P = 0. 0001) and in samples immediately immersed in methylene blue compared with those that were artificially aged (P = 0. 011). The interaction between the composite material and the marginal substrate significantly affected dye penetration (P = 0. 006). Conclusions: <b>Bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable resins provided significantly better marginal seal in dentin, both before and after artificial ageing. Nanohybrid resin composites and <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable resins showed similar microleakage values at enamel margins.

40|$|Using the topological flux {{insertion}} procedure, the ground-state degeneracy of an insulator on {{a periodic}} lattice with filling factor nu=p/q {{was found to}} be at least q-fold. Applying the same argument in a lattice with edges, we show that the degeneracy is modified by the additional edge density nuE associated with the open boundaries. To carry out this generalization we demonstrate how to distinguish between bulk and edge states, and follow how an edge modifies the thermodynamic limit of Oshikawa's original argument. In particular, we also demonstrate that these edge corrections may even make an insulator with integer <b>bulk</b> <b>filling</b> degenerate...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theories}} {{suggest that}} the excitations of certain quantum Hall states may have exotic braiding statistics {{which could be used}} to build topological quantum gates. This has prompted an experimental push to study such states using confined geometries where the statistics can be tested. We study the transport properties of quantum point contacts (QPCs) fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs two dimensional electron gas that exhibits well-developed fractional quantum Hall effect, including at <b>bulk</b> <b>filling</b> fraction 5 / 2. We find that a plateau at effective QPC filling factor 5 / 2 is identifiable in point contacts with lithographic widths of 1. 2 microns and 0. 8 microns, but not 0. 5 microns. We study the temperature and dc-current-bias dependence of the 5 / 2 plateau in the QPC, as well as neighboring fractional and integer plateaus in the QPC while keeping the <b>bulk</b> at <b>filling</b> factor 3.

30|$|Different testing methods, such as shear and tensile bond strength, {{have been}} used to measure dentin bond strength. One {{disadvantage}} of these methods is that they are generally performed on flat dentin surfaces, where the C-factor is very low and the shrinkage stress is not directed at the bonding interface. For these reasons, the push-out bond strength test was used in the present study. The advantage of using the push-out bond strength test is that adhesion and composite polymerization occur in a high C-factor cavity that was <b>bulk</b> <b>filled</b> with the composite, similar to clinical conditions, with increased stress generation directed to the bonding area [23].|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with a <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable material (SDR) and a traditional resin composite. METHODS: Thirty maxillary and 30 mandibular first molars were selected based on similar dimensions. After cleaning, shaping and filling of the root canals and adhesive procedures, specimens were assigned to 3 subgroups for each tooth type (n= 10) : Group A: control group, including intact teeth; Group B: access cavities were restored with a traditional resin composite (EsthetX; Dentsply-Italy, Rome, Italy); Group C: access cavities were restored with a <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composite (SDR; Dentsply-Italy), except 1. 5 mm layer of the occlusal surface that was restored with the same resin composite as Group B. The specimens were subjected to compressive force in a material static-testing machine until fracture occurred, the maximum fracture load of the specimens was measured (N) {{and the type of}} fracture was recorded as favorable or unfavorable. Data were statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni tests (P< 0. 05). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found among groups (P< 0. 05). Fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored with a traditional resin composite and with a <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> flowable composite (SDR) was similar in both maxillary and mandibular molars and showed no significant decrease in fracture resistance compared to intact specimens.

Forty specimens were prepared from SureFill and SonicFill <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composite resins, 20 each. All specimens were stored dry for 24 [*]h. Each group was divided into 2 subgroups: stored in ethanol (E) 75 % or in methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) 100 % for 24 [*]h. Crosslink density was evaluated by calculating {{the difference between the}} Vickers hardness numbers of the specimens stored dry and after their storage in FSOS. The data were statistically analyzed using t-test. Results. The means of crosslink density in E and MEK were 6. 99 % and 9. 44 % for SureFill and 10. 54 % and 11. 92 % for SonicFill, respectively. t-test displayed significant differences between crosslink densities of SureFill and SonicFill: (P< 0. 0001) in E and (P= 0. 02) in MEK and between crosslink densities of SureFill in E and MEK (P= 0. 02).

40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Resin filled dental {{composite}} materials {{has been introduced}} into dental practice since mid- 1960 s as an aesthetic restorative material for anterior teeth (Bowen, 1962 cited in Peutzfeldt, 1997). Since then, they have undergone several developments {{in order to enhance}} the longevity and performance of these materials. Resin filled dental composites consist of three main components namely, organic resin matrix which consists of a monomer, an initiator system and a stabilizer system, inorganic filler such as quartz, silica, etc. and coupling agent such as organo-silane coupling agent that chemically bonds the inorganic fillers to the organic resin matrix (Phillips, 1973). The properties and the performance of the resin filled dental composites are basically dependent upon the components of the materials. Some properties are related to the resin matrix, whereas others are related to the inorganic fillers and coupling agent. Furthermore, properties such as polymerization shrinkage and water sorption are dependent on both the inorganic fillers and the organic resin matrix (Asmussen, 1975; Hashinger and Fairhust, 1984; Munksgaard et al., 1987). Aim and objectives: The aim and the objectives {{of this study was to}} compare the water sorption and solubility of four bulk-fill dental resin {{composite materials}} namely, two conventional viscosity bulk-fill (Surefil <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composite and Tetric N Ceram <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill)</b> and two low viscosity bulk-fill flowable dental composite materials (Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> flowable restorative and Surefil SDR Flow). Materials and methods: Four types of bulk-fill composite restorative materials (2 bulk-fill conventional viscosity (Surefil <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> composite and Tetric N Ceram <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill)</b> and 2 bulk-fill flowable low viscosity (Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> flowable restorative and Surefil SDR Flow) were used to analyse the water sorption and solubility for each resin composite type. Thirty specimens for each type of material were prepared, giving the total number of specimens to be 120 (n= 120). To standardize this study Vita shade A 2 was used for all the material types. All specimens were prepared in a Teflon mould with internal diameter of 15 ± 1 mm and thickness of 1 ± 0. 1 mm in accordance with ISO 4049. The light curing unit used for all specimens was Elipar™ S 10, (3 M ESPE, Germany) at an output of 1200 mW/cm 2 and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to curing, the intensity of the light was checked using Cure Rite visible curing light meter (Caulk, USA) to ensure light output consistency between specimens and was found to be 1200 mW/cm 2. All the specimens were first removed from the Teflon mould as prepared and described previously and placed in an oven at 37 ºC until their weights were constant and these weights were recorded as m 1 by using an analytic balance (OHAUS, TS 400 D, USA). Ten specimens of each type of resin filled composite were then immersed individually in glass containers filled with 10 ml distilled water and placed in the oven at 37 ± 1 ºC for 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days respectively. The specimens were removed; surface water was blotted with tissue paper until free from visible moisture and weighed using the analytic balance (OHAUS, TS 400 D, USA). The resultant weights were recorded as m 2. The specimens were then placed in a desiccator containing silica gel (Associated Chemical Enterprises, ZA) and freshly dried for two hours in an oven at 58 ºC and then weighted to obtain m 3. According to Oysaed and Ruyter formula (Oysaed and Ruyter, 1986), the water sorption and solubility was calculated using the following equation: i. Water sorption (SP) = m 2 -m 3 / v., ii. Water solubility (SI) = m 1 -m 3 / v - where v is the volume of the specimen. For monomer leakage high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify monomers. The water that contained stored specimens was transferred to a refrigerator immediately after the specimens were removed until HPLC analysis was carried out to determine the amount of monomers that leached out of the cured composite specimens. Results: A significant difference between the materials (p 0. 05 two way ANOVA test). The amounts of eluted monomers from bulk-fill conventional viscosity materials (Surefil <b>bulk</b> <b>fill</b> and Tetric N Ceram <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill)</b> were higher than bulk-fill flowable materials (Surefil SDR Flow and Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> flowable restorative). Of all the monomers tested UDMA eluted more than Bis-GMA and TEGDMA. Overall UDMA monomer eluted the most, followed by Bis-GMA and the TEGDMA. Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, the results of this study did not support the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the water sorption. The bulk-fill low viscosity flowables showed lower water sorption than the conventional viscosity bulk-fills. Surefil SDR Flow was significantly lower than the other materials followed by Filtek <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> flowable restorative and Tetric N-Ceram <b>Bulk</b> <b>Fill</b> and the highest overall means were recorded for Surefil <b>bulk</b> <b>fill.</b> For water solubility the overall means for the flowables of Filtek and SDR were smaller than Surefil and Tetric N-Ceram. For monomer elution three monomers were detected of which UDMA monomer eluted the most, followed by Bis-GMA and the TEGDMA. With regards to the elution of monomers, it was found that 3 monomers named UDMA eluted more than Bis-GMA and TEGDMA...|$|E
