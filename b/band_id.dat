The present study aims to assess different protocols for the isolation of GALT cells from an important fish species in the Mediterranean aquaculture, the gilthead seabream. Mechanical, chemical and enzymatic treatments were assayed. Nylon wool columns and continuous density gradients were used for further separation of cell subpopulations. Light microscopy and flow cytometry showed that the highest density band (HD) consisted of a homogeneous lymphocytic population, whereas the intermediate density <b>band</b> (<b>ID)</b> corresponded to epithelial and secretory cells and some lymphocytes. Respiratory burst activity of total cell suspensions revealed very low numbers of potential phagocytic cells, reflecting results from light microscopy and reports in other teleost species.

30|$|The Raman spectra {{exhibited}} significant fluorescence emissions {{as evidenced}} by the increasing background intensity toward the higher frequency (larger Raman shift). After a linear baseline correction from 1, 000 to 2, 000 cm- 1, the Raman spectra were fitted by two Lorentzian bands, with the aim of extracting individual band parameters (peak position, full width at half maximum (FWHM), peak intensity, and band area; Fig. 6 (b)), as described in Raynal (2003). The obtained values of peak position and FWHM of the G band are plotted in Fig. 7 (a), and the peak positions and FWHMs of the D bands are shown in Fig. 7 (b). The peak intensity ratio of D <b>band</b> (<b>ID)</b> to that of G band (IG) (ID/IG) and the band area ratio of D band to the sum of D and G bands (AD/A(D+G)) (%) are presented in Fig. 7 (c). These parameters indicate the degrees of structural organization (ordering) of terrestrial carbonaceous material (Wopenka and Pasteris, 1993). With increasing ordering, the FWHM of the G and D bands can be seen to become narrower and the peak position (frequency) of the G bands to become larger. These bands have already been reported for insoluble organic matter from carbonaceous chondrites (Busemann et al., 2007) and used as an indicator of thermal metamorphism of carbonaceous chondrites (Bonal et al., 2006).|$|E

5000|$|TVEs thrived from 1978 to 1989, {{and were}} largely {{dismantled}} between 1989 and 1996. Scholars {{have given a}} number of reasons for their success. [...] The political institutional environment favored these “public” enterprises {{during the early years of}} reform, since private businesses faced severe restrictions and discrimination in terms of resources and regulations. Also, the fiscal decentralization of the early 1980s gave greater decision-making power to local governments and linked fiscal revenue to the career potential of local officials, creating strong incentives for them to promote these enterprises. [...] The TVEs moved in to take advantage of the gaps left in the market by the State-Owned Enterprises to produce colorful elastic <b>bands,</b> <b>ID</b> card holders, etc. The TVEs benefited from first mover advantage as there was no competition in the early stages from private firms due to restrictions on the markets. The pent-up demand in China for a host of products provided ample profit-making opportunities for enterprises operating at this early juncture. Moreover, TVEs were helped by massive loans from the state banking system.|$|R

40|$|A {{polymorphism}} of the angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) gene {{has recently}} been reported and analysis of this polymorphism has indicated that it is associated with several cardiovascular diseases. However, the results are still controversial and such association {{has not yet been}} established conclusively. To determine whether the ACE gene may be responsible for essential hypertension in a Japanese population, we also compared the distribution of genotypes and the allele frequency of this polymorphism in our findings of a Japanese population with these features in other countries. Eighty-seven hypertensive patients with a family history of essential hypertension and 95 normotensive patients whose parents had no such history were enrolled in the study. Polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by using the polymerase chain reaction. Homozygotes for this polymorphism had either a 490 -bp band (II) or a 190 -bp band (DD) and heterozygotes had both <b>bands</b> (<b>ID).</b> In hypertensive subjects, the numbers and frequency of the ACE genotypes were: II, 44 (0. 51); ID, 26 (0. 30); DD, 17 (0. 19). In normotensive subjects these were: II, 35 (0. 37); ID, 43 (0. 45); DD, 17 (0. 18). There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups in derived allele frequencies (chi 2 = 1. 41). The difference between the overall allelic frequency in Japan and that reported in several other countries was significant.

40|$|Background: Medication {{safety is}} of {{increasing}} importance {{and understanding the}} nature and frequency of medication errors in the Emergency Department (ED) will assist in tailoring interventions which will make patient care safer. The challenge with the literature to date is the wide variability {{in the frequency of}} errors reported and the reliance on incident reporting practices of busy ED staff. Methods: A prospective, exploratory descriptive design using point prevalence surveys was used to establish the frequency of observed medication errors in the ED. In addition, data related to contextual factors such as ED patients, staffing and workload were also collected during the point prevalence surveys to enable the analysis of relationships between the frequency and nature of specific error types and patient and ED characteristics at the time of data collection. Results: A total of 172 patients were included in the study: 125 of whom patients had a medication chart. The prevalence of medication errors in the ED studied was 41. 2 % for failure to apply patient <b>ID</b> <b>bands,</b> 12. 2 % for failure to document allergy status and 38. 4 % for errors of omission. The proportion of older patients in the ED did not affect the frequency of medication errors. There was a relationship between high numbers of ATS 1, 2 and 3 patients (indicating high levels of clinical urgency) and increased rates of failure to document allergy status. Medication errors were affected by ED occupancy, when cubicles in the ED were over 50 % occupied, medication errors occurred more frequently. ED staffing affects the frequency of medication errors, there was an increase in failure to apply <b>ID</b> <b>bands</b> and errors of omission when there were unfilled nursing deficits and lower levels of senior medical staff were associated with increased errors of omission. Conclusions: Medication errors related to patient identification, allergy status and medication omissions occur more frequently in the ED when the ED is busy, has sicker patients and when the staffing is not at the minimum required staffing levels...|$|R
30|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{analysis was}} also performed at clear and hazy {{regions of the}} knife, which are circled in Fig.  3 b and the results presented in Fig.  4 c. In both the hazy and clear regions peaks at 1355, 1594 and 2919  cm− 1 were identified. The 1594 and 1355  cm− 1 signals are near frequencies attributed to ring stretching in polyaromatic compounds, or disordered graphitic carbon species, at 1580 and 1360  cm− 1. These are generally {{referred to as the}} G band and D band, respectively [37 – 39]. The ratio of the G and D <b>band</b> intensities (<b>ID</b> and IG) {{is a measure of the}} graphitization level, as the G band alone is present in highly ordered graphite while the D band appears, and increases in intensity with increasing disorder [39, 40]. The ID/IG ratios for the hazy and clear regions of the knife are 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, indicating a relatively low degree of graphitization. Further, the intensity of both the G and D bands is much higher in the hazy region of the knife. Taken together, these observations indicate a higher abundance of a disordered C–H species in the visibly hazy regions. Additionally, the region from 2700 to 3000  cm− 1 in Raman spectra is generally attributed to the C–H stretching mode in alkyl hydrocarbons [37, 39]. Both the clear and hazy regions of the knife contain a peak at 2919  cm− 1, however, the intensity is significantly higher in the hazy region.|$|R

SIM Group is an umbrella enterprise having several textile-oriented companies under a single ownership. This report illustrates current condition and problems concerning safety and security of its workers. The objective of this report is to access the employee safety and security issues from a perspective of human resources management, and provide some recommendations based on the accessed findings. To fulfill this objective, a survey using 13 semi-structured questionnaire is conducted where quota sampling method is utilized having a sample size of 30 from all three major sections of the company. In addition, direct observation of the intern {{is also used to}} access further facts that are not captured by survey. Findings from both sources are compiled to provide the recommendations. The findings reveal that, although SIM Group does have several nice features regarding employee safety and security, it is not free from serious drawbacks. Among them, the most severe ones are that most of the personal protective equipments are not replaced regularly; some of those, such as mask, are uncomfortable; a big portion of the workers do not wear these protective equipments; and the ribbon <b>band</b> of <b>ID</b> card and unsmooth dyeing floor may cause accident.

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{by means}} of high resolution angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy the classical one-dimensional organic conductor TTF-TCNQ and the inorganic one-dimensional conductor (TaSe,) 21. We measure dispersive features (<b>ID</b> <b>bands)</b> in accordance with band structure calculations. We observe typical bulk specific properties like the band periodicities (i. e. the Fermi wavevector) and the CDW-gap, which are in agreement with other experimental techniques. Peculiar for one-dimensional systems, we do not observe a real Fermi level crossing of a quasi-particle state. Instead the spectral weight near the chemical potential is strongly suppressed, and we observe a pseudogap in the normal state in both systems. For the organic system our data suggest that electronic correlations are important. Our temperature dependent data further reveal that the pseudogap persists even above the mean field temperature, indicating that CDW-fluctuations cannot account for the pseudogap. For the inorganic compound CDW-fluctuations cannot be neglected in the measured temperature range. Nevertheless the observed energy scale of the pseudogap is much larger than expected from these fluctuations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{inductively coupled plasma}} {{mass spectrometry}} (LA-ICP-MS) has become. established as a very efficient and sensitive trace, ultratrace, and surface analytical technique in the life sciences. We have developed a new analytical imaging technique using LA-ICP-MS to study element distribution in biological tissues. Nowadays, imaging LA-ICP-MS using double-focusing sector field (LA-ICP-SFMS) or quadrupole-based mass spectrometers (LA-ICP-QMS) can be applied as an exciting tool providing new information on the pathophysiology, pharmacology, and toxicology of elements of interest in biological systems. The quantitative determination of elements (e. g., Cu, Fe, Zn, Se, and others) in biological tissues is of growing interest especially in brain research (e. g., for studying neurode-generative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease). LA-ICP-SFMS was employed to produce images of detailed regionally specific element distributions in thin tissue sections of different sizes (such as control human or rat brain tissues or tumor regions). In addition, imaging MS using LA-ICP-QMS was applied to study the uptake and transport of nutrient and toxic elements in plant tissues. Besides the quantitative imaging of essential and toxic elements in tissues, powerful analytical techniques are also required for the determination and characterization of phosphoproteins and metal-containing proteins within a large pool of proteins, after electrophoretic separation [e. g., blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) ] into ID and 2 D gels. LA-ICP-MS was used to detect metalloproteins in protein <b>bands</b> of <b>ID</b> gels or protein spots separated after 2 D gel electrophoresis (2 D-GE). In addition to elemental determination by LA-ICP-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, or MALDI-MS, was employed to identify metal-containing proteins. Recent progress {{will be discussed in}} applying LA-ICP-MS in the life sciences, including the imaging of thin slices of tissue and applications in proteome analysis in combination with MALDI-MS to investigate phosphoproteins and metal-containing proteins...|$|R
