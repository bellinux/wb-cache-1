5|$|In the 1990s, after Waterloo {{station was}} chosen as the British {{terminus}} for the Eurostar train service, Florent Longuepée, a municipal councillor in Paris, wrote to the British Prime Minister requesting that the station be renamed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it was upsetting for the French to be reminded of Napoleon's defeat when they arrived in London by Eurostar. There is a name counterpart in Paris: the Gare d'Austerlitz is named after the Battle of Austerlitz, one of Napoleon's greatest victories (over the Russians and Austrians).|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} with a quiet, {{sensitive}} 15-year-old boy named Charlie writing letters about his life to an unknown recipient. Charlie chooses that person <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he heard the person was nice and thought that this person would not be judgmental. He discusses {{his first year at}} high school, grappling with two traumatic experiences from his past: the suicide of his only middle-school friend, Michael Dobson, a year before, and the death of his favorite aunt, Helen, during his early childhood.|$|E

6000|$|Answ. Hast thou no sins? If thou hast, carry them, and {{exchange}} them for His righteousness; <b>because</b> <b>He</b> hath <b>said,</b> [...] "Cast thy burden upon the Lord, and He shall sustain thee" [...] (Psa 54:22); and again, <b>because</b> <b>He</b> hath <b>said,</b> though thou be heavy laden, yet if thou do but come to Him, He will give thee rest (Matt 11:28).|$|R
5|$|Several {{actors were}} offered {{the role of}} Judah Ben-Hur before it was {{accepted}} by Charlton Heston. Burt Lancaster stated he turned down the role because he found the script boring and belittling to Christianity. Paul Newman turned it down <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he didn't have the legs to wear a tunic. Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson, Geoffrey Horne, and Leslie Nielsen were also offered the role, as {{were a number of}} muscular, handsome Italian actors (many of whom did not speak English). Kirk Douglas was interested in the role, but was turned down in favor of Heston, who was formally cast on January 22, 1958. His salary was $250,000 for 30 weeks, a prorated salary for any time over 30 weeks, and travel expenses for his family.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

60|$|He {{went off}} grumbling {{and telling me}} to be careful, and I put my pipe out and {{walked up and down}} the wharf thinking.

Chris Reid was replaced by David Gentili as the Conservative candidate for Toronto Centre. Expenditures listed for Gentili include expenditures reported by Reid.|$|E
25|$|The first judge {{assigned}} to the case recused himself <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he had a negative opinion of Miller dating to 2004 when he was Miller's judicial supervisor. Miller filed a preliminary injunction {{as part of the}} suit, asking that the federal judge immediately order the State to stop counting the ballots, due to irreparable harm that would happen if the counting continued, but the request was denied.|$|E
25|$|Erik sets sail {{from near}} Snæfellsjökull and reaches {{the coast of}} a glacial land. He travels south along the coast searching for a {{habitable}} area. After two years of exploring the country, he returns to Iceland and tells of his discoveries.

25|$|His {{relationship}} with Straus was often strained. Giroux, more the literary man, was often {{at odds with}} Straus, who was primarily a businessman. Farrar, Straus & Giroux never published his 25th-anniversary anthology, which he also edited, as Straus took offense to his portrayal in Giroux's introduction. Giroux did not complete his memoirs <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{he did not want}} to write negatively about Straus. For his part, Straus counted Giroux's joining his company as the significant event in its history.|$|E
25|$|Lulz Security {{claimed that}} some of its hacks, {{including}} its attack on PBS, were motivated {{by a desire to}} defend WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning. A Fox News report on the group quoted one commentator, Brandon Pike, who claimed that Lulz Security was affiliated with the hacktivist group Anonymous. Lulz Security claimed that Pike had actually hired it to hack PBS. Pike denied the accusation and claimed it was leveled against him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> Lulz Security was a splinter of Anonymous.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Shamar Rinpoche went on {{a secret}} visit to Lhasa to {{investigate}} whether Thaye Dorje was the reincarnation of the Karmapa, <b>because,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> the boy appeared {{to him in a}} dream. In March 1994, Thaye Dorje and his family escaped from Tibet to Nepal and then to India, where Shamar Rinpoche formally recognized him as the 17th Karmapa. In 1994 Thaye Dorje was enthroned by the 14th Kunzig Shamarpa as the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa at the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute in New Delhi, India.|$|E
50|$|Cancemi {{opposed the}} violent {{terrorist}} strategy and feared {{for his life}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> so. Riina’s brother in law Leoluca Bagarella also suspected that Cancemi had been behind the arrest of the Mafia boss.|$|R

25|$|Going {{into the}} 2001 NHL Entry Draft having been named the Top CHL Prospect, Spezza was drafted second overall by the Ottawa Senators after Ilya Kovalchuk {{went to the}} Atlanta Thrashers.

During the summer of 2001, Spezza passed on {{an invitation to the}} Canadian junior team's summer camp <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he wanted to prepare for his first NHL camp.|$|E

25|$|Doctor Who {{producer}} Barry Letts {{offered the}} part of Sarah Jane to actress April Walker, who accepted the role and was duly contracted by the BBC. During rehearsals for The Time Warrior, {{it became clear to}} Jon Pertwee and Letts that the two leads had little rapport and were physically mis-matched (Pertwee demanded the part be recast, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he would not play opposite an actress who was taller than he). Letts therefore released Walker from her contract (though she was still paid in full for season 11). Letts began a second batch of auditions and saw Elisabeth Sladen after a recommendation from fellow BBC producer Bill Slater, who had twice cast the actress recently in separate episodes of Z-Cars. Sladen performed her audition alongside actor Stephen Thorne and after impressing Letts, he arranged for her to meet Pertwee before any decisions were made. Pertwee stood behind Sladen and gave a 'thumbs-up' to Letts who then offered her the role.|$|E

500|$|Developments {{in modern}} French music were a major {{influence}} on Messiaen, particularly the music of Claude Debussy and his use of the whole-tone scale (which Messiaen called Mode 1 in his modes of limited transposition). Messiaen rarely used the whole-tone scale in his compositions <b>because,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> after Debussy and Dukas there was [...] "nothing to add", but the modes he did use are all similarly symmetrical.|$|E
500|$|Chapman {{published}} his memoirs, A Liar's Autobiography, in 1980, choosing the title <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "it's {{almost impossible to}} tell the truth".

Chapman was scheduled to perform a bungee jump himself, but it was cancelled due to safety concerns.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producers}} Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana {{reviewed the}} script {{after it was}} finished and made minor suggestions for changes. In the original script, Yoshimura made Pembleton more confrontational with the firefighters and emergency personnel, but {{this aspect of the}} script was changed when Fontana suggested it was too distracting. NBC executives indicated they would have preferred Lewis and Falsone find Lange's girlfriend and bring her back to the subway station before Lange died, but Yoshimura described that scenario as a [...] "typical TV ending" [...] and was vehemently opposed to any such change. Fontana also defended the original ending <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> Pembleton ends up filling the role that Lange's girlfriend would have filled.|$|E
