50|$|Principal {{action is}} {{inhibition}} of protein denaturation.Use of chloroacetamide in the alkylation step, followed by acid hydrolysis produces <b>bendazac</b> (instead of benzydamine).|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>bendazac</b> in the plasma and some rat tissues was studied after single oral administration of 14 C <b>bendazac</b> L-lysine salt. The drug is distributed in varying amounts in the liver, kidneys, spleen, muscle, plasma and lens. In these tissues, the drug kinetics is similar, {{except for the}} lens where elimination of the drug is slower. More than 80 % of the radioactivity administered is excreted through the urine and feces. Fecal excretion {{is due to the}} high biliary excretion...|$|E
40|$|Ocular and {{systemic}} absorption of <b>bendazac</b> was investigated after topical administration to rabbits of 0. 5 % solutions of <b>bendazac</b> lysine in different polysaccharide vehicles. The {{results show that}} the drug is absorbed into the retina-choroid via an extracorneal, or sclero-conjunctival route; the iris and the ciliary body are presumably supplied via both the transcorneal and the extracorneal pathways. The extent of absorption via the extracorneal route is not related to vehicle viscosity but rather to the chemical features of vehicle. The transcorneal penetration appears to be hindered by the binding of the drug to corneal tissues...|$|E
40|$|The ocular {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>bendazac</b> {{were studied}} in rabbits, following intravenous administration of <b>bendazac</b> lysine. The compound and its 5 -hydroxyderivative were determined in different eye compartments and plasma by radioassay, using [14 C]bendazac, and HPLC. The highest concentrations {{were found in}} the iris and in descending order in the ciliary body, retina, cornea, tears, aqueous humor, vitreous, and lens. The time course of concentrations in the plasma, aqueous and vitreous humor, ciliary body, and retina showed kinetics described by the exponential equation y = ae(bx) with a half-life of 2. 47, 4. 56, 3. 59, and 3. 22 hr, respectively; in the lens the half-life was 17. 77 hr...|$|E
40|$|Condensation diseases' are {{heterogeneous}} pathological {{conditions in}} which the primary pathogenetic step {{is the loss of}} solubility of specific substances, resulting in the formation of a condensed phase. Typical examples are cataract, nephrolithiasis, gallstone disease and certain rheumatic {{conditions in which}} protein denaturation, aggregation and precipitation may occur. Since the condensing molecules are often proteins, antidenaturant agents should be considered rational drugs for the treatment of these diseases. Surprisingly, however, only a few molecules with these properties are currently available for therapeutic use, including <b>bendazac</b> for cataract...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{hydrophobic}} substances like {{bile salts}} (cholate, deoxycholate, chenodeoxycholate, lithocholate and their conjugates with glycine and taurine), fatty acids (caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid) {{were much more}} active (EC(50) congruent to 10 (- 4) - 10 (- 5) M) than selected amino acids (EC 50 > 10 (- 2) M) and inorganic salts (EC(50) congruent to 10 (- 1) M) in inhibiting heat-induced denaturation of human serum albumin in vitro. Fish oil, rich in n- 3 -polyunsaturated acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, administered p. o. (1 ml/kg) in the rat, protected ex vivo (after 2 hr) serum against heat-induced denaturation more than <b>bendazac,</b> a known antidenaturant drug. Thus, we speculated that the antidenaturant activity of fish oil may be partly tin addition to the known effect on endogenous eicosanoid composition) responsible for its beneficial effects in rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic conditions. In this connection, it is of note that the in vitro antidenaturant activity of fish oil fatty acids was {{higher than that of}} known antidenaturant drugs such as <b>bendazac</b> and bindarit and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like phenylbutazone and indomethacin which could exert beneficial effects in chronic inflammatory conditions by stabilizing endogenous proteins...|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with the clinical trial of an anti-cataract drug (<b>Bendazac</b> lysine) a number of examination methods {{were used to assess}} the progress of the cataract: slitlamp examination, visual acuity determination, and the measurement of the contrast sensitivity, light scatter in the eye and the autofluorescence and transmission of the lens. In this article the measurements of 43 patients (43 eyes) are presented, taken at the time that medication was started. In this way we can get an impression of the value of these measurements for the study of cateractous lenses. The contrast sensitivity of the cataractous eye is lowered for all spatial frequencies as compared with the normal population. Light scatter is greatly increased. The autofluorescent profile of the lens with nuclear cateract differs markedly from that of the lens with cortical cataract...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{numerous}} epidemiological {{and animal}} models, {{it can be}} inferred that oxidative stress is {{a key factor in}} cataract formation. Production of reactive oxygen species and reduction of endogenous antioxidants both contribute to cataract formation. In the cataractogenous process, lens proteins lose sulfhydryl groups and become thiolated or cross-linked by disulfide bonds. The resultant high molecular weight aggregates become insoluble and affect lens transparency. All these are consequences of changes in the redox state. A mixed protein-thiol and protein-protein disulfide bond precedes the morphological changes of cataract. Normally, sustained high levels of reduced glutathione provide a protective effect, while depletion of glutathione causes damage to epithelial cells and fiber cells. UV rays in the ambient environment evoke reactive oxygen species formation and also contribute to cataracts. The reduction in free UV filters and increase in their binding to lens proteins make the lens more predisposed to UV damage and oxidation. In the aqueous humor of cataract lenses, there is a decrease in antioxidant enzymes and increase in nitric oxide, which demonstrates the relationship between oxidative stress and cataracts. Though surgical intervention is the standard treatment for cataracts, experimental medical therapies for cataracts are under extensive investigation. Carnosine, a pro-drug of carnosine-N-acetylcarnosine, <b>bendazac,</b> ascorbic acid, and aldose reductase inhibitors are under therapeutic evaluation, and prevention of cataract formation may be possible in the future...|$|E
40|$|Compounds {{capable of}} {{inhibiting}} protein aggregation may find pharmacological {{applications in the}} treatment of a number of diseases called protein condensation diseases [Benedek (1997) ], which include cataract, biliary and urinary lithiasis and certain rheumatic diseases. We examined the effect of selected compounds on heat-induced aggregation human serum albumin (HSA), IgG and lysozyme. HSA (0. 2 % w/v in 0. 066 M sodium phosphate pH 5. 3 at 22 degrees C), IgG (0. 5 % w/v in 0. 066 M Tris pH 8. 0 at 22 degrees C), and L (0. 2 % w/v in 0. 066 M CAPS pH 11. 0 at 22 degrees C) were heated for 30 min at 70 degrees C in {{the presence or absence of}} different concentrations of the substance under examination and heat-induced aggregation of 100 microl aliquots was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 595 nm using an automatic microplate reader. In these conditions, inhibition of aggregation could be due to an anti-denaturant effect or to interferences with the aggregation of denatured molecules, as previously described [Saso, Casini et al. (1998) ]. However, this distinction may not be pharmacologically relevant when the target of the therapy is the prevention of abnormal phenomena of protein aggregation. Inorganic salts like NaCl and CaCl 2 were active on the three proteins (IgG > HSA > L) but many ligands of HSA such as tryptophan, N-acetyl-tryptophan, caprylic acid, capric acid, cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid and <b>bendazac</b> were active on their carrier but not on IgG and L, indicating that the latter proteins are more difficult to protect and that specific anti-denaturant and/or anti-aggregant compounds should be developed...|$|E
