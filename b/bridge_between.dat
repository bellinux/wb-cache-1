As {{part of the}} project, {{the section of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> Brown and West Main Streets would be removed—allowing for the canal bed to be filled in and the road to be rebuilt—while the segment between West Main Street and Exchange Boulevard would be rehabilitated. The portion of Broad Street between Allen and Main Streets was closed to all traffic in February and was originally scheduled to open on October30. It finally reopened to traffic on December3.|$|E

5|$|According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} in the early 1870s by the New York and Boston Air Line Railroad. The details on this bridge are largely unknown, but contradictory evidence exists placing {{the construction of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> 1876 and 1877. According to Marshall, the Air Line Railroad was completed in 1873 and the Colchester branch was completed in 1877.|$|E
5|$|After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French {{public was}} {{generally}} indifferent. Carmen initially gained its reputation {{through a series}} of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.|$|E

5|$|Ebla's first kingdom is {{an example}} of early Syrian {{centralized}} states, and {{is considered one of the}} earliest empires by scholars, such as Samuel Finer, and Karl Moore, who consider it the first-recorded world power.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, plans for Stord Airport, Sørstokken were launched. The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again {{brought up in}} 1982 as the {{industry}} on Bømlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport. A committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in May 1983 {{to look into the}} possibilities for a bridge. Led by Bømlo Mayor Arne M. Haldorsen, it issued Engineer Harald Møyner the task to author a report and recommendation. He made three proposals: a pontoon or suspension <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> Foldrøyhomen and Litlaneset; a suspension <b>bridge</b> <b>between</b> Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate just south of the new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near the airport, but stated that one closer further away would be fine.|$|E
