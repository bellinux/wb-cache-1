6000|$|... "Why, Mother, how can {{you think}} of such a thing? Not more than six or eight will {{probably}} come, so I shall hire a <b>beach</b> <b>wagon</b> and borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce." [...] (Hannah's pronunciation of char-a-banc.) ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{the sense}} that Mavering professed to have {{received}} from it, when he {{jumped out of the}} <b>beach</b> <b>wagon</b> in which he had preceded the other carriages through the weird forest lying between the fringe of farm fields and fishing-villages on the western shore of the island and these lonely coasts of the bay. As far as the signs of settled human habitation last, the road is the good hard country road of New England, climbing steep little hills, and presently leading through long tracts of woodland. But at a certain point beyond the furthest cottage you leave it, and plunge deep {{into the heart of the}} forest, vaguely traversed by the wheel-path carried through since the island was opened to summer sojourn. Road you can hardly call it, remembering its curious pauses and hesitations when confronted with stretches of marshy ground, and its staggering progress over the thick stubble of saplings through which it is cut. The progress of teams over it is slow, but there is such joy of wildness in the solitudes it penetrates that; if the horses had any gait slower than a walk, one might still wish to stay them. It is a Northern forest, with the air of having sprang quickly up in the fierce heat and haste of the Northern summers. The small firs are set almost as dense as rye in a field, and in their struggle to the light they have choked one another so that there is a strange blight of death and defeat on all that vigour of life. Few of the trees have won any lofty growth; they seem to have died and fallen when they were about to outstrip the others in size, and from their decay a new sylvan generation riots rankly upward. The surface of the ground is thinly clothed with a deciduous undergrowth, above which are the bare, spare stems of the evergreens, and then their limbs thrusting into one another in a sombre tangle, with locks of long yellowish-white moss, like the grey pendants of the Southern pines, dripping from them and draining their brief life.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} the 4CV was the Renault <b>Beach</b> <b>Wagon,</b> {{also known as the}} Renault Jolly. 50 of these were built by Ghia in 1961 using {{consecutively}} serial numbered 4CV's; approximately a dozen are estimated to exist today.|$|E

50|$|Florida {{became a}} state in 1845, and British and American {{permanent}} settlers started to arrive. They began to displace the various tribes, including the Seminoles, who fought back. One Seminole War raid in 1856 resulted in four deaths. A resident, Arad Shelton, took their bodies north to New Smyrna <b>Beach</b> by <b>wagon.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brinkley {{addressed}} the defeated group, of whom {{her husband was}} one, as they came up the <b>beach</b> toward the <b>wagons.</b> [...] "Do you think that display was calculated to inspire the lower middle classes with respectful envy?" ...|$|R
50|$|Rowallan {{served as}} the winter home for the entire {{extended}} Lindsay family. Nannies and children were everywhere. There are pictures and movies {{of them in their}} goat carts, pony carts and swimming at Daytona Beach. Adults attended functions at the old Ormond Beach Hotel, went shooting and rode horseback. They drove in horse driven buggies and later in their <b>beach</b> <b>wagon.</b> They {{were among the first to}} drive cars on Ormond Beach.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ross sighed herself away, and Ted flew {{up to his}} garret {{corner with}} a choking in his throat. He couldn't go to stay with Jimmy--he couldn't give up the picnic! Why, {{he had never been}} at a picnic; {{and they were going to}} drive to the hotel <b>beach</b> in <b>wagons,</b> and have swings, and games, and ice cream, and a boat sail to Curtain Island! He had been looking forward to it, waking and dreaming, for a fortnight. He must go. But poor little Jimmy! It was too bad for him to be left all alone.|$|R
