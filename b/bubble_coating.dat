40|$|Microbubbles {{stabilized}} by a surfactant or {{polymer coating}} {{are the most}} effective form of contrast agent available for ultrasound imaging. They have shown great potential {{as a means of}} quantifying tissue perfusion, in particular determining physiologically significant parameters such as relative vascular volume and flow velocity. Clinical implementation of quantitative imaging procedures, however, has been hindered by poor characterisation of the complex relationship between microbubble concentration, scattering and image intensity. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe theoretical and experimental investigations of the physical phenomena underlying these effects, such as the time, pressure and frequency dependence of microbubble behaviour, the influence of the <b>bubble</b> <b>coating,</b> size distribution and concentration; and to discuss the challenges involved in developing accurate quantitative imaging protocols. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In this study, we {{devise a}} method to {{generate}} homogeneous particles from a bubble suspension, with the capability to control loading {{and the structure of}} bubbles. Ideally, a process such as this would occur at the interface between daughter bubble formation (instant) and gaseous diffusion (gradual). Interestingly, the budding mechanism in micro-organisms is one that demonstrates features of the desired phenomena (although at a much slower rate), as viruses can eject and evolve structures from their membranes. With these natural concepts, a bubble's surface can also be made to serve as a platform for particle generation, which transfers significant elements from the initial <b>bubble</b> <b>coating</b> to the newly generated structures. Here, we illustrate this by preparing coated bubbles (approx. 150 µm in diameter) using a hydrophobic polymer, which may be comparable to naturally occurring bubble coatings (e. g. organic matter forming part of bubble coatings in the sea), and dye (which can demonstrate entrapment of smaller quantities of a desired moiety) and then observe particle generation (approx. 500 nm). The process, which may be driven by a polymerosome-forming mechanism, also illustrates how additional uniform sub-micrometre-scale structures may form from a bubble's surface, which may have also previously been attributed to gas diffusion. In addition, such methods of particle formation from a bubble structure, the incorporation of chemical or biological media via an in situ process and subsequent release technologies have several areas of interest across the broad scientific community...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of droplets and bubbles with ultrasound {{has been studied}} extensively in the last 25 years. Microbubbles are broadly used in diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications, for instance, as ultrasound contrast agents. They have a similar size as red blood cells, and thus are able to circulate within blood vessels. Perfluorocarbon liquid droplets can be a potential new generation of microbubble agents as ultrasound can trigger their conversion into gas bubbles. Prior to activation, they are {{at least five times}} smaller in diameter than the resulting bubbles. Together with the violent nature of the phase-transition, the droplets can be used for local drug delivery, embolotherapy, HIFU enhancement and tumor imaging. Here we explain the basics of bubble dynamics, described by the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, bubble resonance frequency, damping and quality factor. We show the elegant calculation of the above characteristics for the case of small amplitude oscillations by linearizing the equations. The effect and importance of a <b>bubble</b> <b>coating</b> and effective surface tension are also discussed. We give the main characteristics of the power spectrum of bubble oscillations. Preceding bubble dynamics, ultrasound propagation is introduced. We explain the speed of sound, nonlinearity and attenuation terms. We examine bubble ultrasound scattering and how it depends on the wave-shape of the incident wave. Finally, we introduce droplet interaction with ultrasound. We elucidate the ultrasound-focusing concept within a droplets sphere, droplet shaking due to media compressibility and droplet phase-conversion dynamics...|$|E

40|$|The {{interactions}} between two particle-stabilised air bubbles in aqueous electrolyte were studied using a coalescence rig. The bubble stability and {{the dynamics of}} the coalescing bubbles were investigated in the presence of adsorbed spherical alumina particles with a d₅₀ of 24. 2 µm and a density of 3. 64 g/cm³. Coalescence events were recorded using high-speed video imaging for both symmetric (both <b>bubbles</b> <b>coated)</b> and asymmetric (one <b>bubble</b> <b>coated)</b> geometries. It was found that the coalescence time (the time between initial bubble-bubble contact and rupture) {{is directly related to the}} number of particles adsorbed to the bubble interface. The coalescence dynamics of the bubbles were modelled with a simple damped harmonic oscillator model. It was found that increasing bubble surface coverage by particles resulted in an increased damping coefficient. Both the bubble stability and rigidity of the alumina-air bubble system were found to be higher than previous studies using glass particles. The fraction of particles detached upon bubble coalescence confirmed that bubble coverage had no significant effect on the fraction of particles detached although this was lower than in previous studies. Physical characteristics such as particle size, dispersity, roughness and density were considered for their role in the behaviour of the particle-stabilised bubbles...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} bubble size distributions in the ocean, but the measured size range does not normally extend to bubbles with a radius below 20 ?m. Bubbles smaller than this {{are thought to}} {{have a significant effect on}} the optical properties of the ocean, potentially affecting remotely sensed measurements of ocean color and the optical detection of particulates and dissolved matter. Such optical data are becoming the major source of oceanic information about algal blooms, primary productivity, sediment loading and the spread of pollutants. The challenges associated with measuring these bubbles are difficulty of calibrating sensors with independent bubble size measurements and lack of knowledge about the organic coating on the bubbles. This paper describes simultaneous oceanic measurements of these small bubbles using independent optical and acoustical techniques. These measurements agree well, and an investigation of the <b>bubble</b> <b>coating</b> parameters was made. Both the optical and acoustical properties of bubbles are affected by this organic coating, and a comparison of these measurements narrows down the choice of possible coating parameters. Our results suggest that the bubbles measured in this study were likely to have a coating with a thickness of 10 nm and a refractive index of 1. 18, and that the coating thickness is the more important parameter for optical inversions. The research described here is the first attempt to constrain these parameters in the ocean using two independent techniques and suggests that further studies of this type could result in significant insight into oceanic bubble coatings...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTargeted {{molecular}} imaging with ultrasound {{contrast agent}} microbubbles {{is achieved by}} incorporating targeting ligands on the <b>bubble</b> <b>coating</b> and allows for specific imaging of tissues affected by diseases. Improved understanding of the interplay between the acoustic forces acting on the bubbles during insonation with ultrasound and other forces (e. g. shear due to blood flow, binding of targeting ligands to receptors on cell membranes) can help improve the efficacy of this technique. This work focuses {{on the effects of}} the secondary acoustic radiation force, which causes bubbles to attract each other and may affect the adhesion of targeted bubbles. First, we examine the translational dynamics of ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles in contact with (but not adherent to) a semi-rigid membrane due to the secondary acoustic radiation force. An equation of motion that effectively accounts for the proximity of the membrane is developed, and the predictions of the model are compared with experimental data extracted from optical recordings at 15 million frames per second. A time-averaged model is also proposed and validated. In {{the second part of the}} paper, initial results on the translation due to the secondary acoustic radiation force of targeted, adherent bubbles are presented. Adherent bubbles are also found to move due to secondary acoustic radiation force, and a restoring force is observed that brings them back to their initial positions. For increasing magnitude of the secondary acoustic radiation force, a threshold is reached above which the adhesion of targeted microbubbles is disrupted. This points to the fact that secondary acoustic radiation forces can cause adherent bubbles to detach and alter the spatial distribution of targeted contrast agents bound to tissues during activation with ultrasound. While the details of the rupture of intermolecular bonds remain elusive, this work motivates the use of the secondary acoustic radiation force to measure the strength of adhesion of targeted microbubbles...|$|E

The time taken for two bubbles to coalesce was determined as a function of the fractional coverage of the surface by particles. The results suggested that the coalescence time increases with the bubble surface coverage. Interestingly, it was found that although the particles did not have any physical role in film rupture at low surface coverage, they still added resistance to film drainage. For particle-loaded bubbles, the initial resistance was due to the lateral capillary interactions between particles on the interface, which hold the particles firmly together. The coalescence dynamics of bubbles was also observed to be affected by the presence of attached particles...|$|R

40|$|A dual-frequency {{acoustic}} levitator containing {{water was}} developed for studying bubble and drop dynamics in low gravity. It was flown on USML- 1 where it {{was used in the}} Glovebox facility. High frequency (21 or 63 kHz) ultrasonic waves were modulated by low frequencies to excite shape oscillations on bubbles and oil drops ultrasonically trapped in the water. Bubble diameters were typically close to 1 cm or larger. When such large bubbles are acoustically trapped on the Earth, the acoustic radiation pressure needed to overcome buoyancy tends to shift the natural frequency for quadrupole (n = 2) oscillations above the prediction of Lamb's equation. In low gravity, a much weaker trapping force was used and measurements of n = 2 and 3 mode frequencies were closer to the ideal case. Other video observations in low gravity include: (i) the transient reappearance of a bulge where a small bubble has coalesced with a large one, (ii) observations of the dynamics of <b>bubbles</b> <b>coated</b> by oil indicating that shape oscillations can shift a <b>coated</b> <b>bubble</b> away from the oil-water interface of the coating giving a centering of the core, and (iii) the agglomeration of bubbles induced by the sound field...|$|R

To investigate adapting this approach, the foaming properties of some organics (Hexane, Heptane, Hexadecane, Petroleum Ether, Toluene, Benzene and Kerosene and their binary mixtures) of potential interest in oily bubble bitumen flotation were investigated. Silicone oil was found to be a good foaming agent in some cases. Bubble stability and film thickness experiments were carried out to help select candidate organics. Surface tension and dynamic viscosity measurements were conducted to examine the mechanism of foaming.

40|$|A {{process is}} {{proposed}} for fabrication of lightweight spherical reflectors {{in outer space}} for telescopes, radio antennas, and light collectors that would be operated there. The process would obviate the relatively massive substrates and frames needed to support such reflectors in normal Earth gravitation. According to the proposal, fabrication of a reflector would begin with blowing of a bubble to the specified reflector radius. Taking advantage of the outer-space vacuum as a suitable environment for evaporative deposition of metal, a metal-evaporation source would be turned on and moved around the bubble to deposit a reflective metal film over the specified reflector area to a thickness of several microns. Then the source would be moved and aimed to deposit more metal {{around the edge of}} the reflector area, increasing the thickness there to approximately equal to 100 micron to form a frame. Then the bubble would be deflated and peeled off the metal, leaving a thin-film spherical mirror having an integral frame. The mirror would then be mounted for use.

In many of these applications, the stability of the microbubbles is crucial to their effectiveness. Controlling this, however, represents a considerable challenge. In this study, the potential for stabilizing microbubbles using solid nanoparticles adsorbed onto their surfaces was explored. A new theoretical model has been developed to describe the influence of interfacially adsorbed solid particles upon the dissolution of a gas bubble in a liquid. The aim of this work was to test experimentally the prediction of the model that the presence of the nanoparticles would inhibit gas diffusion and coalescence/disproportionation, thus increasing the life span of the bubbles. Near-monodisperse microbubbles (~ 100 μm diameter) were prepared using a microfluidic device and coated with a surfactant, with and without the addition of a suspension of spherical gold nanoparticles (~ 15 nm diameter).

The foam grows linearly with time during the supply of the fatty acid solution. When we stop the supply of the fatty acid the foam growth stops.

We study this deflation and show that a combined analysis of the shape and wrinkling characteristics enables us to determine the elastic properties in situ. Shape contours are analyzed and fitted using shape equations derived from nonlinear membrane-shell theory to give the elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and stress distribution of the membrane. We include wrinkles, which generically form upon deflation, within the shape analysis. Measuring the wavelength of wrinkles and using the calculated stress distribution gives the bending stiffness of the membrane.

40|$|The {{merits of}} {{ultrasound}} contrast agents (UCAs) were already {{known in the}} 1960 s. It was, however, not until the 1990 s that UCAs were clinically approved and marketed. In these years, it was realized that the UCAs are not just efficient ultrasound scatterers, but that their main constituent, the coated gas microbubble, acts as a nonlinear resonator and, as such, is capable of generating harmonic energy. Subharmonic, ultraharmonic, and higher harmonic frequencies of the transmitted ultrasound frequency have been reported.

40|$|Bubbles are dynamic {{objects that}} grow and rise or shrink and disappear, {{often on the}} scale of seconds. This {{conflicts}} with their uses in foams where they serve to modify the properties of the material in which they are embedded. <b>Coating</b> the <b>bubble</b> surface with solid particles has been demonstrated to strongly enhance the foam stability, although the mechanisms for such stabilization remain mysterious. In this paper, we reduce the problem of foam stability {{to the study of the}} behavior of a single spherical <b>bubble</b> <b>coated</b> with a monolayer of solid particles. The behavior of this armored bubble is monitored while the ambient pressure around it is varied, in order to simulate the dissolution stress resulting from the surrounding foam. We find that above a critical stress, localized dislocations appear on the armor and lead to a global loss of the mechanical stability. Once these dislocations appear, the armor is unable to prevent the dissolution of the gas into the surrounding liquid, which translates into a continued reduction of the bubble volume, even for a fixed overpressure. The observed route to the armor failure therefore begins from localized dislocations that lead to large-scale deformations of the shell until the bubble completely dissolves. The critical value of the ambient pressure that leads to the failure depends on the bubble radius, with a scaling of ΔP_{collapse}∝R^{- 1 }, but does not depend on the particle diameter. These results disagree with the generally used elastic models to describe particle-covered interfaces. Instead, the experimental measurements are accounted for by an original theoretical description that equilibrates the energy gained from the gas dissolution with the capillary energy cost of displacing the individual particles. The model recovers the short-wavelength instability, the scaling of the collapse pressure with bubble radius, and the insensitivity to particle diameter. Finally, we use this new microscopic understanding to predict the aging of particle-stabilized foams, by applying classical Ostwald ripening models. We find that the smallest armored bubbles should fail, as the dissolution stress on these bubbles increases more rapidly than the armor strength. Both the experimental and theoretical results can readily be generalized to more complex particle interactions and shell structures...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{advances}} in ultrasound imaging technology {{have led to}} the development of targeted microbubble contrast agents; micrometer sized encapsulated <b>bubbles</b> <b>coated</b> with binding agents. Their gas core gives them high echogenicity, scattering incident ultrasound and allowing them to oscillate to producing a detectible sound of their own. The binding agent allows them to be used for molecular imaging. The work in this thesis aims to provide a better understanding of the behaviour of microbubble contrast agents, but with a focus on their use as molecular imaging agents. The thesis starts with an introduction to microbubble contrast agents, stating their current clinical usage both as a normal contrast agent and for molecular imaging and highlighting their strengths and limitations. In the following chapter, the theory behind the modelling of microbubble motions is introduced, discussing modelling bubble oscillations using the Rayleigh-Plesset equation, and the translation of a bubble in an acoustic field through Bjerknes forces. The first piece of novel work to be presented in this thesis is in the form of a model for non-spherical oscillations in microbubble contrast agents, with the application of modelling the destruction of microbubble contrast agents. A Boussinesq-Scriven approach was taken, to adapt a pre-existing model for shell free bubbles by taking into account the viscoelastic effect of the shell. Results calculated using the developed model showed a significant difference in destruction threshold between the shelled and shell-free bubbles. The second piece of work focuses on the effects of an ultrasound field on adherent microbubbles including their detachment and deflation. Analysis of experimental results on targeted microbubbles adherent to a micro-tube with flow shows that the effects of ultrasound are significant even at relatively low acoustic pressure. As acoustic pressure is increased, the percentage of detached and/or deflated microbubbles does also. Four forces are identified which could be responsible for detachment, namely, shear, primary and secondary Bjerknes, and oscillations and their relative significance is investigated. The results from this work are then used to make suggestions about the clinical imaging for targeted contrast agents. The final novel piece of work presented is a dual transducer arrangement as a potential method of increasing targeted microbubble binding efficiency through the creation of a simple one-dimensional acoustic manipulator, capable of being implemented in any clinical ultrasound scanner with a phased array. Simulations and experimental investigations were carried out on the system in order to demonstrate the feasibility of such an acoustic manipulator and to gain understanding of its practicalities.

40|$|Microbubbles are {{currently}} used as contrast agents for diagnostic imaging {{on account of}} their high scattering efficiency and non-linear response to ultrasound. The exact nature of this response depends not only upon the bubble size and imposed sound field but also the bubble environment: physical properties of the surrounding liquid, <b>bubble</b> surface <b>coating,</b> ambient temperature, pressure and proximity to other bubbles or surfaces. This dependence can potentially be exploited for the microscale interrogation of a liquid to detect, e. g. changes in viscosity or the presence of particular chemical species.

Conventional microscope setups for microbubble studies have their optical axis perpendicular to the wall (top view); consequently they have a limited view of the deformation of the bubble. We developed a method to image the bubble in a side view by integrating a mirror in the microscope setup. The image was recorded at 14. 5 million frames per second by a high-speed camera. When insonified by a 1 -MHz, 140 -kPa ultrasound pulse, a 9 -microm diameter <b>coated</b> <b>bubble</b> appeared spherical in the top view, but strongly nonspherical in the side view. Its shape was alternatively oblate and prolate, with maximum second order spherical harmonic amplitude equal to the radius...|$|R
40|$|Composite vitreous-enameled {{steel sheet}} {{have become more}} {{attractive}} for structural applications. In this chapter, an investigation on the residual stresses, introduced during the manufacturing of these materials, is reported. The local structure evidences the presence of <b>bubbles</b> in the <b>coating</b> and the interface domain between the substrate and the external layer made of a complex material system where the ceramic and the metal constituents are mixed. This particular local structure can affect the distribution and entity of the residual stresses. Digital images of cross-section micrographs have been processed and used to discretize the material microstructure into a mesh suitable for finite element analysis. The residual stresses have been evaluated on coatings manufactured with different technologies and, in particular, {{the effect of the}} presence of bubbles on the stresses has been highlighted...|$|R
