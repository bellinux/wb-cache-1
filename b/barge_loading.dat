50|$|Smithshire {{came into}} being with the {{building}} of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1888. It is the only population center in Ellison Township. The abandoned town of Ellison was two miles (3 km) from Smithshire. Ellison began in the 1830s, but suffered from a catastrophic tornado in 1858, dampening its growth. The remaining community moved to Smithshire with the coming of the railroad. Smithshire is the location of the corporate offices of Twomey Company Twomey Company. Twomey Company was a family owned agribusiness corporation, beginning in 1945. Consolidated Grain and Barge purchased the Twomey Company in 2012. Twomey Co had storage capacity for 51 million bushels when it was sold. Twomey Company operated in several western Illinois locations, including a <b>barge</b> <b>loading</b> facility on the Mississippi River.|$|E

50|$|His {{work was}} further {{researched}} and improved by a German engineer Nikolaus August Otto, who was later to invent the first 4-stroke engine to efficiently burn fuel directly in a piston chamber. In August 1864 Otto met Eugen Langen who, being technically trained, glimpsed {{the potential of}} Otto's development, and {{one month after the}} meeting, founded the first engine factory in the world, NA Otto & Cie, in Cologne. In 1867 Otto patented his improved design and it was awarded the Grand Prize at the 1867 Paris World Exhibition. This atmospheric engine worked by drawing a mixture of gas and air into a vertical cylinder. When the piston has risen about eight inches, the gas and air mixture is ignited by a small pilot flame burning outside, which forces the piston (which is connected to a toothed rack) upwards, creating a partial vacuum beneath it. No work is done on the upward stroke. The work is done when the piston and toothed rack descend under the effects of atmospheric pressure and their own weight, turning the main shaft and flywheels as they fall. Its advantage over the existing steam engine was its ability to be started and stopped on demand, making it ideal for intermittent work such as <b>barge</b> <b>loading</b> or unloading.|$|E
