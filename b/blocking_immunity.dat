40|$|Malaria transmission-blocking {{immunity}} {{has been}} studied in natural malaria infections in man, during infections in animals and following artificial immunization of animals with sexual stage malaria parasites. Effective immunity, which prevents infectivity of a malarial infection to mosquitoes, has been observed under all of these circumstances. Two general types of effector mechanism have been identified. One is an antibody mediated mechanism which acts against the extracellular sexual stages of the parasite within the midgut of a blood feeding mosquito. The other is a cytokine mediated mechanism which inactivates the gametocytes of the parasites while in the circulation of the vertebrate host. Both effects have been observed during natural infections and following artificial immunization. The basis of induction of transmission-blocking immunity, including {{the nature of the}} memory for such immunity, however, may be very different in different host/parasite systems and during natural infection of following artificial immunization.

40|$|Kaposi sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) {{is a human}} ƴ - herpesvirus {{associated with}} several human malignancies. The replication and transcription activator (RTA) is necessary and sufficient for the switch from KSHV latency to lytic replication. Toll-interleukin- 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptorinducing β-interferon (TRIF, also called TIR-domain-containing adaptor molecule- 1 (TICAM- 1)) is a signaling adaptor molecule that is critically involved in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR- 3) and TLR- 4 signaling pathways for type I interferon (IFN) production, {{a key component of}} innate immunity against microbial infection. In this report, we find a new mechanism by which RTA <b>blocks</b> innate <b>immunity</b> by targeting cellular TRIF. RTA specifically degrades TRIF by shortening the half-life of TRIF protein. This RTA-mediated degradation is at least partially mediated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway because proteasome inhibitors as well as knockdown of cellular ubiquitin expression alleviate the degradation. RTA may not directly interact with TRIF and may activate TRIF degradation indirectly through an unknown mediator(s). RTA targets multiple regions of TRIF and may use its ubiquitin ligase domain for the degradation. In addition, physiological levels of TRIF protein are down-regulated duringKSHVlytic replication when RTA is expressed. Finally, RTA down-regulates doublestranded RNA-initiated activation of TLR- 3 pathway, in the absence of degradation of IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF- 7). Taken together, these data suggest that KSHV employs a novel mechanism to <b>block</b> the innate <b>immunity</b> by degrading TRIF protein.

Lymphocyte sensitization to tumor-specific membrane antigens was demonstrated by the proliferative response of lymphocytes in the presence of autochthonous tumor cells. Paradoxically, one-half of the patients could not be sensitized to a primary antigen, dinitrochlorobenzene; existing delayed hypersensitivity was also depressed, as measured by skin tests and lymphocyte transformation in response to common antigens. A heat-stable factor in patients' sera <b>blocked</b> cell-mediated tumor <b>immunity.</b> In addition, these "enhancing" sera consistently suppressed the blastogenic response of autologous and homologous lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin and to membrane antigens on allogeneic cells in the one-way mixed lymphocyte culture. When patients' leukocytes were washed and autologous plasma replaced with normal plasma, reactivity in the mixed lymphocyte culture increased to normal values. In vitro immunosuppressive activity in patients' plasma or sera correlated with depressed delayed hypersensitivity. After removal of the tumor, suppressor activity disappeared. IgG fractions of patient sera contained strong immunosuppressive activity. These data suggest that the suppressor factor may be an isoantibody elicited by the tumor that also binds to receptors on the lymphocyte membrane. In addition to specifically <b>blocking</b> cell-mediated tumor <b>immunity,</b> enhancing sera may broadly depress host immunocompetence...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{to support}} an irnmunostimulafion theory of tumor growth has {{recently}} been reviewed by Prehn (1, 2). Basically the immunostimulation theory proposes that both humoral and cellular immune responses can, under certain conditions, facilitate tumor growth by direct effect upon the tumor cells. Enhancement of tumor cell growth, on the other hand, {{is thought to be}} due to an enhancing antibody which acts by <b>blocking</b> cell-mediated <b>immunity</b> and thus indirectly facilitates tumor cell growth (3). The immunity effect proposed by Prehn is a biphasic one; that is, mild immune response to tumor cells accelerates tumor cell growth, whereas a strong immune response is cytotoxic (1, 2, 4). There is a large body of literature on the ability of the lymphocyte to undergo blast transformation with a concomitant increase in DNA synthesis upon exposure to plant lectins, bacterial mitogens, and antilymphocyte antibody.

40|$|The anti-tuberculosis-vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is {{the most}} widely used vaccine in the world. In {{addition}} to its effects against tuberculosis, BCG vaccination also induces non-specific beneficial effects against certain forms of malignancy and against infections with unrelated pathogens. It has been recently proposed that the non-specific effects of BCG are mediated through epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, a process called trained immunity. In the present study we demonstrate that autophagy contributes to trained immunity induced by BCG. Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy <b>blocked</b> trained <b>immunity</b> induced in vitro by stimuli such as beta-glucans or BCG. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the autophagy genes ATG 2 B (rs 3759601) and ATG 5 (rs 2245214) influenced both the in vitro and in vivo training effect of BCG upon restimulation with unrelated bacterial or fungal stimuli. Furthermore, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of autophagy blocked epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes at the level of H 3 K 4 trimethylation.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (mAb) {{have been}} raised against Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte stage protein extracts, {{in an effort to}} identify novel parasite antigens that might mediate malaria transmission- <b>blocking</b> <b>immunity.</b> mAb 1 A 1 identified Pfs 2400, a sexual stage-specific antigen of greater than 2 megadaltons, that is associated with the outer leaflet of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane in mature circulating gametocyte-infected red blood cells. Upon induction of gametogenesis, Pfs 2400 partitions between the gamete plasmalemma and the degenerating erythrocyte membrane. The antigen is no longer detectable in the fully emerged gamete. mAb 1 A 1 dramatically reduces the number of oocysts formed in P. falciparum gametocyte-fed mosquitoes. The cognate antigen is probably the product of the Pf 11. 1 gene (Scherf et al. 1988. EMBO [Eur. Mol. Biol.

40|$|Background: Gametogenesis and {{fertilization}} play crucial {{roles in}} malaria transmission. While male gametes {{are thought to}} be amongst the simplest eukaryotic cells and are proven targets of transmission <b>blocking</b> <b>immunity,</b> little is known about their molecular organization. For example, the pathway of energy metabolism that power motility, a feature that facilitates gamete encounter and fertilization, is unknown. Methods: Plasmodium berghei microgametes were purified and analysed by whole-cell proteomic analysis for the first time. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD 001163. Results: 615 proteins were recovered, they included all male gamete proteins described thus far. Amongst them were the 11 enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. The hexose transporter was localized to the gamete plasma membrane and it was shown that microgamete motility can be suppressed effectively by inhibitors of this transporter and of the glycolytic pathway.

TBI was determined in blood from gametocyte carriers in a bioassay (Direct Membrane Feeding Assay), with either autologous plasma (OWN) or control serum (AB). Mosquito infection rates (IR) were compared. infection rates correlated positively with gametocyte and oocyst densities. Three TBI indicators were analysed: the proportion of transmission reducers (IRAB > IROWN, P < 0. 01), the mean intensity of TBI (IRAB - IROWN), and the contribution of TBI to total inhibition [(IRAB-IROWN) /(100 -IROWN) ]. we could not discriminate between areas with regard to either the proportion of transmission reducers (urban 15 % and rural 29 %) or the mean levels of TBI (urban 10 % and rural 9 %), or contribution of TBI to total inhibition (urban 10 % and rural 13 %). there was no relationship between TBI indicators and age, but a trend of increasing values was observed with rising gametocytaemia, which was considered as a confusing factor. a multivariable analysis showed that the probability of being a reducer was 4. 6 fold higher in the rural area than in the urban district...|$|E
40|$|Malaria is a {{vector-borne disease}} that is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most serious public health problems due to its high global mortality and morbidity rates. Although multiple strategies for controlling malaria have been used, many have had limited impact due to the appearance and rapid dissemination of mosquito resistance to insecticides, parasite resistance to multiple antimalarial drug, and the lack of sustainability. Individuals in endemic areas that have been permanently exposed to the parasite develop specific immune responses capable of diminishing parasite burden and the clinical manifestations of the disease, including blocking of parasite transmission to the mosquito vector. This is referred to as transmission <b>blocking</b> (TB) <b>immunity</b> (TBI) and is mediated by specific antibodies and other factors ingested during the blood meal that inhibit parasite development in the mosquito. These antibodies recognize proteins expressed on either gametocytes or parasite stages that develop in the mosquito midgut and are considered to be potential malaria vaccine candidates. Although these candidates, collectively called TB vaccines (TBV), would not directly stop malaria from infecting individuals, but would stop transmission from infected person to non-infected person.

With added transforming growth factor (TGF) -β, both immature and mature populations of dendritic cells (DCs) induced antigen-specific Foxp 3 + T regs from Foxp 3 − precursors. Using endogenous TGF-β, DCs from gut-associated mesenteric lymph nodes were capable of differentiating Foxp 3 +T regs. Spleen DCs were 100 -fold more potent than DC-depleted APCs for the induction of T regs and required 10 -fold lower doses of peptide antigen. Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) was essential, but could be provided endogenously by T cells stimulated by DCs, but not other APCs.

Tumor immunity is often mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) whose activation {{is supported by}} Th 1 cytokines. Since IL- 4 directs Th 2 development and {{has been shown to}} inhibit Th 1 -dominated responses, we assumed that IL- 4 –deficient (IL- 4 �� �) mice would develop vigorous CTL-mediated tumor immunity compared with IL- 4 –competent (IL- 4 �� �) mice. Surprisingly, IL- 4 �� � mice were severely impaired to develop tumor immunity to both a mammary adenocarcinoma line and a colon carcinoma line. The lack of tumor immunity in IL- 4 �� � mice was associated with reduced IFN- � production, diminished levels of tumor-reactive serum IgG 2 a, and undetectable CTL activity, indicating a defective Th 1 response in the absence of endogenous IL- 4.

40|$|One {{approach}} {{towards the}} development of a vaccine against malaria is to immunize against the parasite sexual stages that mediate transmission of the parasite from man to mosquito. Antibodies against these stages, ingested with the blood meal, inhibit the parasite development in the mosquito vector, constituting "transmission <b>blocking</b> <b>immunity.</b> " Most epitopes involved in transmission-blocking immunity depend on the tertiary conformational structure of surface antigens. However, one of the transmission-blocking monoclonal antibodies we have raised against Plasmodium vivax reacts with a linear epitope on both asexual stages and gametes. This monoclonal antibody (A 12) is capable of totally blocking development of the parasite in the mosquito host when tested in membrane feeding assays with gametocytes from P. vivax-infected patients. Immune screening of a P. vivax lambda gt 11 genomic expression library with A 12 led to the isolation of a clone to which was mapped the six-amino acid epitope recognized by A 12. Antisera raised in mice against a 12 -mer synthetic peptide containing this epitope coupled to bovine serum albumin not only had high titers of antipeptide antibodies as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but in addition recognized the same 24 - and 57 -kD parasite components as A 12 on Western blots and reacted with the parasite by immunofluorescence.

40|$|Attempts {{to raise}} {{effective}} immunity against cancer are benefiting from {{information on the}} nature of the immunity involved and its regulation and, perhaps, now it is time to step back and define our approach in molecular terms prior to clinical testing. Although there are immunological differences between mice and patients, results from murine studies are encouraging early 'translation' of concepts to the clinic and it is vital to take immunological principles emerging from mice into clinical vaccine design. One is the requirement to break tolerance against over-expressed self-antigens, a potentially risky procedure but necessary for several cancer targets. A study in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology attempts to do this by using xenogeneic antigens, albeit with variable outcome. The unstated goal is to activate T-cell help but this can be achieved more effectively by harnessing a predictable anti-microbial repertoire. The second issue lies in the delivery of antigen. One strategy is "prime/boost" using DNA priming and boosting with a viral vector; however, this induces <b>blocking</b> <b>immunity</b> against viral proteins, and must be used judiciously.

40|$|In areas endemic for schistosomiasis, {{there is}} great {{heterogeneity}} in antibody isotype responses to parasite antigens amongst infected individuals. At the population level, the isotype composition of antibody responses undergoes dynamic changes which {{are associated with the}} age of infected individuals. Here we examine the IgG subclass responses to Schistosoma mansoni eggs (soluble egg antigens; SEA) of infected individuals by immunoblot and ELISA. By controlled treatment of SEA-coated ELISA plates and immunoblot nitrocellular strips with sodium periodate, in order to oxidize terminal carbohydrate residues selectively, we were able to relate individuals subjects' isotype responses to the different antigens that they responded to, and to the presence of putative carbohydrate and peptide epitopes on those antigens. IgG 2 responses were restricted strictly to sodium periodate-sensitive carbohydrate epitopes and antigens of relatively high molecular weight. These antigens were not usually recognized by other isotypes and, therefore, they were only recognized by individuals who had high levels of IgG 2. IgG 1 and IgG 3 responses were directed against both carbohydrate and peptide epitopes, whereas IgG 4 responses were restricted to periodate-resistant epitopes. This suggests that the fall in IgG 2 responses, and reciprocal rise in IgG 4 antibodies, seen in young children as their intensities of schistosome infection increase, is not the result of isotype switching, and that, if these two subclasses are involved in <b>blocking</b> <b>immunity</b> to schistosomiasis, they are operating independently...|$|E

We used this animal to test the hypothesis that intervention with agents that <b>block</b> innate <b>immunity</b> and diabetes is associated with a shift in the gut microbiota. We observed that infection with KRV results in the induction of proinflammatory gene activation in both the spleen and pancreatic lymph nodes. Furthermore, administering animals the histone deacetylase inhibitor ITF- 2357 and IL- 1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra) induced differential STAT- 1 and the p 40 unit of IL- 12 /IL- 23 gene expression.

ITF- 2357 and Anakinra modulated the abundance of 23 and 8 bacterial taxa in KRV-infected animals, respectively, of which 5 overlapped between the two agents. Lastly, principal component analysis implied that ITF- 2357 and Anakinra induce distinct gut microbiomes compared with those from untreated animals or rats provided KRV only.

Supernatants were analyzed with a multiplex cytokine detection system (human Th 1 /Th 2 cytokine Cytometric Bead Array) by flow cytometry. Control of bacterial growth was evaluated by using an in vitro experimental model in which virulent M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages were cultured with T cells in {{the presence or absence of}} Tim- 3 and PD- 1 blocking antibodies. Interleukin- 1 beta treatment of infected macrophages was evaluated by enumerating colony-forming units. Results: We showed that HIV+ patients had an increased expression of Tim- 3 in T cells and were able to control bacterial growth before ART administration. By blocking Tim- 3 and PD- 1, macrophages and T cells recovered their functionality and had a higher ability to control bacterial growth; this result was partially dependent on the restitution of cytokine production. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated that increased Tim- 3 expression can limit the ability of the immune system to control the infection of intracellular bacteria such as M. tuberculosis. The use of ART and the in vitro manipulation of the Tim- 3 and PD- 1 molecules restored the functionality of T cells and macrophages to restrict bacterial growth. Our results provide a novel immune strategy that may be implemented in the near future in order to improve the immune responses in HIV+ patients...|$|R
40|$|Background. Noise {{immunity}} {{codes are}} widely used in the modern telecommunication systems. The methodology of properties count of convolutional codes, offered by authors before, to the equivalent parameters of block codes gave the opportunity to use the known and new methodologies of estimation of noise <b>immunity</b> <b>block</b> codes for the corresponding estimations of convolutional codes. Objective. The {{purpose of this paper}} is the estimation of maximum possibilities of block and convolutional noise immunity codes in the reliability co-ordinates on the basis of accordance of their equivalent parameters. Methods. Based on Plotkin?s and Varshamov-Gilbert?s boundaries usage the lines of theoretic error-correcting boundary of block and convolutional codes are built in reliability coordinates. The lines allow finding maximum channel probability of error for which error-correcting code exists that can ensure necessary reliability. Results. Due to search methodic of convolutional code parameters that are equivalent by correcting abilities to block code parameters, complex assessment of error-correcting, informational and forming complexity properties is made on different kinds of error-correcting codes. Conclusions. For each probability of symbol errors in a communication channel it is possible to estimate the expedience of the use of block and convolutional codes from the standpoint of the necessary reliability provision, informative efficiency and complication of encoding. Investigational limits allow defining maximally possible probability of error, at which there is a code, able to provide necessary authenticity on the output of decoder. ????????????. ? ??????????? ???????????????????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????????? ????. ????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ????????? ??????? ??????????? ????? ? ????????????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ???? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ????? ???????? ?????? ?????????????????? ??????? ????? ??? ??????????????? ?????? ??????????? ?????. ???? ????????????. ????? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ?? ????????? ???????????? ?? ????????????? ??????????. ???????? ??????????. ?? ????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????? ???????? ? ????????-????????? ??? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ? ??????????? ??????????? ????????? - ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????? ????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ????? ? ??????????? ?????????????. ????????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????, ??? ??????? ??? ?????????? ???, ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????. ?????????? ????????????. ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????, ????????????? ?? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?????, ??????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ????? ?????? ????? ?????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ????????????? ? ????????? ???????????. ??????. ??? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????? ????? ???????? ??????? ???????????????? ????????????? ???????? ??? ???????????? ???? ? ????? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????????, ?????????????? ????????????? ? ????????? ???????????. ????????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ??????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ???????? ? ?????? ??????, ??? ??????? ??? ?????????? ???, ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????????? ?? ?????? ????????...|$|R
40|$|Infection {{of cells}} with DNA viruses {{triggers}} innate immune responses mediated by DNA sensors. cGMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) {{is a key}} DNA sensor that produces the cyclic dinucleotide cGMP-AMP (cGAMP) upon activation, which binds to and activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING), leading to IFN production and an antiviral response. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a DNA virus that is linked to several human malignancies. We report that KSHV infection activates the cGAS-STING pathway, and that cGAS and STING also {{play an important role}} in regulating KSHV reactivation from latency. We screened KSHV proteins for their ability to inhibit this pathway and identified six viral proteins that block IFN-β activation through this pathway. This study is the first report identifying multiple viral proteins encoded by a human DNA virus that inhibit the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway. One such protein, viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF 1), targets STING by preventing it from interacting with TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK 1), thereby inhibiting STING's phosphorylation and concomitant activation, resulting in an inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway. Our data provide a unique mechanism for the negative regulation of STING-mediated DNA sensing. Moreover, the depletion of vIRF 1 in the context of KSHV infection prevented efficient viral reactivation and replication, and increased the host IFN response to KSHV. The vIRF 1 -expressing cells also inhibited IFN-β production following infection with DNA pathogens. Collectively, our results demonstrate that gammaherpesviruses encode inhibitors that <b>block</b> cGAS-STING-mediated antiviral <b>immunity,</b> and that modulation of this pathway is important for viral transmission and the lifelong persistence of herpesviruses in the human population...|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium {{falciparum malaria}} {{is a major}} cause of {{mortality}} and severe morbidity. Its virulence is related to the parasite's ability to evade host immunity through clonal antigenic variation and tissue-specific adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IEs). The P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP 1) family is central to both. Here, we present evidence of a P. falciparum evasion mechanism not previously documented: the masking of PfEMP 1 -specific IgG epitopes by nonspecific IgM. Nonspecific IgM binding to erythrocytes infected by parasites expressing the PfEMP 1 protein VAR 2 CSA (involved in placental malaria pathogenesis and protective <b>immunity)</b> <b>blocked</b> subsequent specific binding of human monoclonal IgG to the Duffy binding-like (DBL) domains DBL 3 X and DBL 5 ε of this PfEMP 1 variant. Strikingly, a VAR 2 CSA-specific monoclonal antibody that binds outside these domains and can inhibit IE adhesion to the specific VAR 2 CSA receptor chondroitin sulfate A was unaffected. Nonspecific IgM binding protected the parasites from FcγR-dependent phagocytosis of VAR 2 CSA(+) IEs, but it did not affect IE adhesion to chondroitin sulfate A or lead to C 1 q deposition on IEs. Taken together, our results indicate that the VAR 2 CSA affinity for nonspecific IgM has evolved to allow placenta-sequestering P. falciparum to evade acquired protective immunity without compromising VAR 2 CSA function or increasing IE susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis. Furthermore, functionally important PfEMP 1 epitopes not prone to IgM masking are likely to be particularly important targets of acquired protective immunity to P. falciparum malaria...|$|R
40|$|Biomaterials {{are being}} {{extensively}} used in various biomedical fields; however, they are readily infected with microorganisms, thus posing {{a serious threat}} to the public health care. We herein presented a facile route to the antibacterial modification of an important A-B-A type biomaterial using poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether (mPEG) - poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) -mPEG as a typical model. Inexpensive, commercial bis(2 -hydroxyethyl) methylammonium chloride (DMA) was adopted as an antibacterial unit. The effective synthesis of the antibacterial copolymer mPEG-PCL-~~~-PCL-mPEG (where ~~~ denotes the segment with DMA units) was well confirmed by FTIR and 1 H NMR spectra. At an appropriate modification extent, the DMA unit could render the copolymer mPEG-PCL-~~~-PCL-mPEG highly antibacterial, but did not largely alter its fascinating intrinsic properties including the thermosensitivity (e. g., the body temperature-induced sol-gel transition), non-cytotoxicity, and controlled drug release. A detailed study on the sol-gel-sol transition behavior of different copolymers showed that an appropriate extent of modification with DMA retained a sol-gel-sol transition, despite the fact that a too high extent caused a loss of sol-gel-sol transition. The hydrophilic and hydrophobic balance between mPEG and PCL was most likely broken upon a high extent of quaternization due to a large disturbance effect of DMA units at a large quantity (as evidenced by the heavily depressed PCL segment crystallinity), and thus the micelle aggregation mechanism for the gel formation could not work anymore, along with the loss of the thermosensitivity. The work presented here is highly expected to be generalized for synthesis of various <b>block</b> copolymers with <b>immunity</b> to microorganisms. Light may also be shed on understanding the phase transition behavior of various multiblock copolymers. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Negative costimulation on T {{cells is}} {{exploited}} by both prostate cancer and melanoma to evade antitumor <b>immunity.</b> <b>Blocking</b> such mechanisms restores antitumor immunity as was {{demonstrated by the}} improved survival of patients with metastatic melanoma after treatment with an antibody blocking the CTLA- 4 inhibitory receptor (ipilimumab). Enhanced expression of another inhibitory immunoreceptor, programmed death- 1 (PD- 1), and its ligand, PD-L 1, was found to correlate with a poor prognosis in prostate cancer and melanoma. PD- 1 -blocking antibodies are being developed to modulate antitumor immune responses. To support preclinical and clinical development of anti-PD- 1 therapy, we sought to develop biomarker assays that can detect the effect of PD- 1 -blocking agents in whole blood and {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}}. In this study, we assessed the effect of PD- 1 blockade in modulating super antigen (staphylococcus enterotoxin B) -induced and recall antigen (tetanus toxoid) -induced T-cell reactivity in vitro using whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with advanced melanoma, prostate cancer, and healthy controls. PD- 1 blockade was found to shift antigen-induced cellular reactivity toward a proinflammatory Th 1 /Th 17 response, as evidenced by enhanced production of interferon gamma, interleukin (IL) - 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL- 6, and IL- 17 and reduced production of the Th 2 cytokines IL- 5 and IL- 13. It {{is interesting to note that}} suppression of Th 2 responsivity was seen with whole blood cells only from patients with cancer. Taken together, we identified novel biomarker assays that might be used to determine the functional consequences of PD- 1 blockade in peripheral blood cells from patients with cancer. How these assays translate to the local antitumor response remains to be established in a clinical setting...|$|R
