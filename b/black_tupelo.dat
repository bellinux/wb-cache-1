50|$|Eastern towhees may {{associate}} with and avoid certain plants. In Nevada, Towhees seem to prefer a habitat {{in which they}} are camouflaged such as flowering quince which matches their rufous coloration. In riparian vegetation in Iowa, eastern towhee density was significantly (p≤0.01) positively associated with total plant and vine species richness and negatively correlated with forb and deciduous tree species richness. In West Virginia, eastern towhees were associated with plant species that occurred on drier ridgetops, such as blackberry (p<0.02), black cherry (p<0.002), and black locust (p<0.04). These sites tended to have open canopies and low tree density. Eastern towhee density was negatively associated with plants of the moister parts of this study area, such as <b>black</b> <b>tupelo</b> (Nyssa sylvatica, p<0.006), red maple (p<0.001), and witch hazel (p<0.03). In central New Jersey eastern towhees were significantly (p=0.03) more abundant in gray dogwood (Cornus racemosa) shrubland than either eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana) or multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) shrublands.|$|E

50|$|The frosted flatwoods {{salamander}} breeds in small, shallow, ephemeral ponds, generally {{characterized by}} an overstory of pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) and <b>black</b> <b>tupelo</b> (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora) and a diverse understory of native grasses and herbs. Adult salamanders {{spend most of the}} year underground in burrows, especially those of crayfish, where they feed on a variety of small invertebrates. From September through December, adults migrate from surrounding upland habitats to their natal wetlands during rainfall events associated with passing cold fronts. Courtship presumably occurs within dry pond basins or very shallow water, where the female accepts a spermatophore that has been deposited on the substrate by the male. Females lay eggs in small groups, usually within clumps of moist vegetation or in the entrances of crayfish burrows in the dry pond basin. The eggs hatch in response to inundation by rising water levels in the pond basins. The larval period lasts about three months, with metamorphs leaving the breeding ponds in late spring. Sexual maturity is approximately one to two years for males and two to three years for females.|$|E
50|$|What {{this all}} adds up to is a tragic, fever-dream realism. Though the world Harriet discovers is unquestionably haunted, there is nothing magical about it, or about the furious, lyrical {{rationality}} of Tartt's voice. Her book is a ruthlessly precise reckoning of {{the world as it is}} -- drab, ugly, scary, inconclusive -- filtered through the bright colors and impossible demands of childhood perception. It grips you like a fairy tale, but denies you the consoling assurance that it's all just make-believe. Comparisons, in any case, are beside the point. This novel may be a hothouse flower, but like that fatal <b>black</b> <b>tupelo</b> tree, it has its own authority, its own darkness. This was the hallmark of Harriet's touch, Hely reflects. She could scare the daylights out of you, and you weren't even sure why. Harriet's gift is also Tartt's. The Little Friend might be described as a young-adult novel for grown-ups, since it can carry us back to the breathless state of adolescent literary discovery, when we read to be terrified beyond measure and, through our terror, to try to figure out the world and our place in it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} suggests that bark beetles detect and avoid release points of volatile compounds associated with nonhost species, and thus such nonhost volatiles may have potential utility in the management of bark beetles. We used a coupled gas chromatograph-electroantennographic detector (GC-EAD) to assay the olfactory sensitivity of the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann, to volatiles from leaves and bark of eight species of nonhost angiosperm trees that are common in the range of D. frontalis. Tree species sampled were red maple (Acer rubrum L.), mockernut hickory [Carya alba (L.) Nutt. ex Ell. ], sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.), <b>black</b> <b>tupelo</b> (Nyssa sylvatica Marsh.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), southern red oak (Quercus falcata Michx.), blackjack oak [Quercus marilandica (L.) Muenchh. ], and water oak (Quercus nigra L.). Beetle antennae responded to a total of 28 identifiable compounds in these samples. The relative olfactory responsive-ness to 14 of these, as well as to nonanoic acid and four additional volatiles reported to be associated with nonhost an-giosperms, was assessed in GC-EAD analyses of synthetic di-lutions spanning six orders of magnitude. The largest response voltage amplitudes were obtained with trans-conophthorin, nonanoic acid, terpinen- 4 -ol, phenylethyl alcohol, and eucalyp-tol, whereas the lowest response thresholds were to nonanoic acid, nonanal, linalool, (E) - 2 -hexen- 1 -ol, and phenylethyl alco-hol. Funnel traps baited with various combinations of eleven antennally-active angiosperm volatiles along with a standard attractant captured significantly fewer male and female D. frontalis than traps baited with the standard attractant alone. Our data suggest that a diversity of semiochemicals may be involved in host species discrimination by D. frontalis, and several may have utility in their management...|$|E
