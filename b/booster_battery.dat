50|$|The E.28/39 lacked {{features}} {{that would be}} considered key to an active combat fighter, such as the lack of radio sets. The original engine was started by an Austin Seven car engine, which was connected by a flexible drive; later on, this arrangement was replaced by an electronic starter system that used a ground <b>booster</b> <b>battery</b> instead. The cockpit, which was accessed by a sliding canopy lacked pressurisation or any form of climate control, such as heating systems. While pilots were intended to wear electrically-heated flight suits, {{the lack of an}} onboard generator and limited battery capacity, the latter being prioritised towards the automated sensors and recording devices that captured the results of each flight, this was not possible and pilots {{had to put up with}} the cold conditions throughout a given flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{facilities}} include 14 dedicated operation theatres, laboratories, CT scan and MRI scans. Upon completion, {{the premises}} {{will have two}} blocks, namely, the hospital and a college with eight departments. The 400-bed hospital will also have a 500-seater conference hall. It will also have a hospital management information system with a storage capacity of 60 terabytes specifically to store patient information, including investigations and the treatment given. Other facilities would include two cath labs with diagnostic imaging equipment separately for the heart and brain, an emergency room {{near the entrance to}} the building, Wifi connectivity, mobile phone signal <b>boosters,</b> <b>battery</b> cars on every floor and in the compound and 150 surveillance cameras. The intensive care units have seventy electro-hydraulically operated imported beds with digital touch screens. Drinking water is dispensed by means of 10 water dispensers on each floor, which are sourced from the reverse osmosis plant with a capacity of 6,000 litres of water per hour, operated by remote monitoring software.|$|R
50|$|A {{vehicle with}} a flat battery can be jump started by the battery of another vehicle or by a {{portable}} <b>battery</b> <b>booster,</b> after which a running engine (but running faster than idle speed) will continue to charge the battery.|$|R
5000|$|MotoMaster {{has its own}} sub-brands to {{distinguish}} premium products such as [...] "Eliminator" [...] which distinguished premium products from their less expensive lines for items like automotive <b>batteries,</b> <b>booster</b> packs and <b>battery</b> charges. The 'Rough Rider' light truck tire sub-brand was replaced with 'Total Terrain' in recent years. 'Formula 1' was created initially to push their synthetic lines but expanded with the disappearance of other lines into conventional, diesel, marine, transmission and power steering oils {{as well as a}} number of other gear oils. Despite the expansion, MotoMaster's Supreme sub-brand continues to exist as an entry level oil product. The 'Mastercraft' sub-brand is their mid-level tool-line, such as screw drivers and socket sets while 'Mastercraft Maximum' is their premium tool brand. JobMate is a rebranded product line for entry-level tools sold by Canadian Tire ...|$|R
50|$|The MZ-D {{was derived}} from the top-of-the-line Pentax film camera of the time, the MZ-S. To give space for the extra {{circuitry}} and battery power required for a digital camera, the MZ-D shape incorporated {{the size and shape of}} the MZ-S' optional <b>battery</b> <b>booster</b> and vertical grip. It also shared the Pentax KAF2 lens mount.|$|R
50|$|The {{optional}} Power <b>Booster</b> PB-E1 or <b>Battery</b> Pack BP-E1 {{attach to}} the base of the camera. The booster (PB-E1) holds 8 AA batteries or an optional Ni-Cad pack, and boosts the standard drive from 3 frames per second to 6. The Power Booster E1 has its own shutter release and input dial for use when shooting in the vertical format. The battery pack (BP-E1) is a lighter and simpler accessory. This holds 4 AA cells and a lithium battery, and you can select between the two power sources with a switch. It provides a grip for vertical shots but no additional controls. The major appeal of the Battery Pack BP-E1 is that is lighter and less expensive than the power booster.|$|R
