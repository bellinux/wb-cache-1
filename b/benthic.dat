5|$|A {{total of}} 13 <b>benthic</b> macroinvertebrates were {{observed}} by the West Branch Susquehanna Restoration Coalition at site T-1. Five were observed at site T-2 and three were observed at site T-3. The <b>benthic</b> macroinvertebrates included two specimens each of Leuctra, , Dicranota, Diplectrona, and Hydropsyche Chironomidae. One specimen of Sialis was observed. The <b>benthic</b> macroinvertebrates included three specimens of Chironomidae, and one each of Tipula and Trepobates. The <b>benthic</b> macroinvertebrates included one specimen each of Chironomidae, Hydropsyche, and Ceratopsyche.|$|E
5|$|<b>Benthic</b> {{sediment}} buildup causes {{biological damage}} and reduces aquatic biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{species of}} <b>benthic</b> foraminifera became extinct during the K–Pg {{extinction}} event, presumably because {{they depend on}} organic debris for nutrients, since the biomass in the ocean {{is thought to have}} decreased. As the marine microbiota recovered, however, it is thought that increased speciation of <b>benthic</b> foraminifera resulted from the increase in food sources. Phytoplankton recovery in the early Paleocene provided the food source to support large <b>benthic</b> foraminiferal assemblages, which are mainly detritus-feeding. Ultimate recovery of the <b>benthic</b> populations occurred over several stages lasting several hundred thousand years into the early Paleocene.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises eat a {{wide variety}} of creatures. The stomach {{contents}} of harbour porpoises suggests that they mainly feed on <b>benthic</b> fish, and sometimes pelagic fish. They may also eat <b>benthic</b> invertebrates. In rare cases, algae, such as Ulva lactuca, is consumed. Atlantic porpoises are thought to follow the seasonal migration of bait fish, like herring, and their diet varies between seasons. The stomach contents of Dall's porpoises reveal that they mainly feed on cephalopods and bait fish, like capelin and sardines. Their stomachs also contained some deep-sea <b>benthic</b> organisms.|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} {{is an alternative}} explanation for why organisms such as coral reef fish and <b>benthic</b> marine invertebrates such as sponges and nudibranchs have come to resemble each other.|$|E
5|$|Hawksbills show {{a degree}} of {{fidelity}} after recruiting to the <b>benthic</b> phase, however movement to other similar habitats is possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{just five}} bird species were {{confirmed}} in the watershed, while for fish, <b>benthic</b> invertebrates, and certain insects {{there were no}} confirmed observations, {{in part due to}} insufficient site coverage.|$|E
5|$|Mysids {{are found}} {{throughout}} the world in both shallow and deep marine waters {{where they can be}} <b>benthic</b> or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many <b>benthic</b> species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in the laboratory for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.|$|E
5|$|Sphaeromatidea – <b>Benthic</b> isopods {{mostly from}} the {{southern}} hemisphere with respiratory pleopods inside a branchial chamber. This suborder now includes part of the formerly recognised suborder Flabellifera.|$|E
5|$|Spotted {{eagle ray}} preys mainly upon bivalves, crabs, whelks, <b>benthic</b> infauna they also feed on mollusks, crustaceans, {{particularly}} malacostracans. and also upon hermit crabs, shrimp, octopuses, and some small fish.|$|E
5|$|Suborder Polystilifera. Includes about 100 pelagic and 50 <b>benthic</b> species. Their pads bear many tiny stylets.|$|E
5|$|The diet of H.gammarus mostly {{consists}} of other <b>benthic</b> invertebrates. These include crabs, molluscs, sea urchins, starfish and polychaete worms.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of <b>benthic</b> invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on <b>benthic</b> invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|Valvifera – A {{large group}} of <b>benthic,</b> marine isopods with {{respiratory}} pleopods inside a branchial chamber under the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large numbers of organisms {{actually}} consumed by the walrus, its foraging has a large peripheral impact on <b>benthic</b> communities. It disturbs (bioturbates) the sea floor, releasing nutrients into the water column, encouraging mixing and movement of many organisms and increasing the patchiness of the benthos.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{are being}} made to monitor the water quality of the Fonteyn Kill, led by Vassar College's Environmental Research Institute and the Cornell University Cooperative Extension Dutchess County Environment Program. Three sites are {{regularly}} sampled for water quality while devices such as sondes continuously record temperature, conductivity, and pH. <b>Benthic</b> macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and fecal coliform counts are also run.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and <b>benthic</b> invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E
5|$|Four {{species of}} {{metazoan}} zooplankton {{have been recorded}} in the lake, namely, Drepanopus bispinosus, Paralabidocera antarctica (Copepoda), Rathkea lizzioides (Anthomedusae) and a cydippid ctenophore (not named). Also found in the <b>benthic</b> community here are several species of Holotricha, two species of nematode, and many marine amphipods and tardigrades.|$|E
5|$|In {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part of}} the <b>benthic</b> community. They are detritivores and are microphagous, sucking dead or living organic material, diatoms, bacteria and small protozoa into their mouths by the muscular action of the pharynx. They are themselves eaten by turbellarians and other small macrofauna.|$|E
5|$|Some seabed–dwelling {{species are}} highly {{effective}} ambush predators. Angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage {{to lie in}} wait and suck prey into their mouths. Many <b>benthic</b> sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} <b>benthic</b> (living on the seabed) and others pelagic (living in mid-water), {{but most are}} found close to, {{crawling}} on or burrowing into the mud or sand. Most marine species are <b>benthic</b> by day but leave the seabed at night to become planktonic. Locomotion is mostly by swimming, the pleopods being used for this purpose. Some mysids live among algae and seagrasses, some are solitary while many form dense swarms. Mysids form {{an important part of}} the diet of such fish as shad and flounder. In general, they are free-living, but a few species, mostly in the subfamily Heteromysinae, are commensal and are associated with sea anemones and hermit crabs. Several taxa have also been described from different freshwater habitats and caves. Mysis relicta and its close relatives inhabit cold, deep lakes and have a diurnal cycle of vertical migrations.|$|E
5|$|The Solsville member {{contains}} well preserved bivalves, gastropods, and brachiopods. These shellfish {{lived in}} the <b>benthic</b> zone {{at the bottom of}} marginal marine to open marine environments that existed west of the ancient Catskill Delta.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch at night, and {{the larvae}} swim {{to the water}} surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage {{involves}} three moults and lasts for 15–35 days. After the third moult, the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult, and adopts a <b>benthic</b> lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they {{are known to be}} capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the <b>benthic</b> phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray whale}} {{has been placed}} {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the right whales and the rorquals. The gray whale is the only <b>benthic</b> feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} algae {{are regularly}} monitored and removed {{to protect the}} <b>benthic</b> habitat. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{lake was}} deep {{enough for the}} {{development}} of planktonic diatoms, including the dominant Cyclotella choctawatcheeana. Other diatoms noted in Lake Tauca are the <b>benthic</b> Denticula subtilis, the epiphytic Achnanthes brevipes, Cocconeis placentula and Rhopalodia gibberula, the planktonic Cyclotella striata and the tychoplanktonic Fragilaria atomus, Fragilaria construens and Fragilaria pinnata. Epithemia has also been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle and}} upper reaches of Tangascootack Creek are nearly devoid of life due to acid mine drainage. However, the {{headwaters}} have some aquatic life, as they are further upstream. Brook trout and three other species of fish inhabit the creek. 13 species of <b>benthic</b> macroinvertebrate also inhabit it.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives on}} hard <b>benthic</b> substrates, {{typically}} rocks. It lives on pebbles, sometimes on boulders, and rarely on dead wood. It tolerates mild organic pollution, low oxygen content (down to below 2mg/liter) {{but it does}} not tolerate long periods of droughts, or ice. It lives in mesotrophic waters, and sometimes in oligotrophic waters.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It was found that a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It was found that the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that <b>benthic</b> marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1999 for the City of Portland by researchers from Portland State University found that Johnson Creek had marginal conditions for macroinvertebrates, {{an important source}} of food for fish and other aquatic life. The study compared differences in these life forms and in water chemistry from two urban streams, Johnson Creek and Tryon Creek in southwest Portland, with two nearby rural streams and found that <b>benthic</b> communities in the urban streams were degraded compared to the regional reference creeks.|$|E
5|$|Asides from Brancasaurus, other {{constituents}} of the Bückeberg Group are <b>benthic</b> invertebrates, including neomiodontid bivalves; hybodont sharks, including Hybodus, Egertonodus, Lonchidion, and Lissodus; the actinopterygian fish Caturus, Lepidotes, Coelodus, Sphaerodus, Ionoscopus, and Callopterus, which Brancasaurus would have preyed on in surface waters; the turtle Desmemys; crocodilians, including Goniopholis, Pholidosaurus, and Theriosuchus; the theropod Altispinax; the marginocephalian Stenopelix; and an ankylosaur referred to Hylaeosaurus. Other indeterminate remains {{have been assigned}} to pterosaurs; the crocodilian clades Hylaeochampsidae and Eusuchia; and the dinosaurian clades Dryosauridae, Ankylopollexia, Troodontidae, and Macronaria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Benthic</b> in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Communities in the {{watershed}} of West Branch Fishing Creek include Central and Elk Grove. Lumbering was an industry in {{the watershed}} in the late 1800s. Fish species living in West Branch Fishing Creek include brown trout, brook trout, and sculpin. The {{upper reaches of the}} creek are designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. There is significant <b>benthic</b> algae coverage in the lower reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{destruction}} {{represents a}} threat to biodiversity in Croatia, as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats, while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded. A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species, with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones. The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the <b>benthic</b> habitat. Agricultural monocultures have also been identified as {{a threat to}} biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{knowledge}} of the taxonomy, biogeography and natural history of deep sea communities prevents accurate assessment {{of the risk of}} species extinctions from large-scale mining. Data acquired from the abyssal North Pacific and North Atlantic suggest that deep-sea ecosystems may be adversely affected by mining operations on decadal time scales. In 1978, a dredge aboard the Hughes Glomar Explorer, operated by the American mining consortium Ocean Minerals Company (OMCO), made a mining track at a depth of 5000meters in the nodule fields of the CCFZ. In 2004, the French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea (IFREMER) conducted the Nodinaut expedition to this mining track (which is still visible on the seabed) to study the long-term effects of this physical disturbance on the sediment and its <b>benthic</b> fauna. Samples taken of the superficial sediment revealed that its physical and chemical properties had not shown any recovery since the disturbance made 26 years earlier. On the other hand, the biological activity measured in the track by instruments aboard the manned submersible bathyscaphe Nautile did not differ from a nearby unperturbed site. This data suggests that the <b>benthic</b> fauna and nutrient fluxes at the water–sediment interface has fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{habitats}} can {{be divided}} horizontally into coastal and open ocean habitats. Coastal habitats extend from the shoreline {{to the edge of}} the continental shelf. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only 7 percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats {{can be divided}} vertically into pelagic (open water), demersal (just above the seabed), and <b>benthic</b> (sea bottom) habitats. A third division is by latitude: from tropical to temperate to polar waters.|$|E
