METHODS: This manuscript discusses {{the inadequacy of}} <b>bars</b> <b>graphs</b> to present continuous data. RESULTS: Simulated data show that box plots and dot plots are more-feasible tools to describe continuous data. CONCLUSIONS: These plots are preferred to represent continuous variables since they effectively describe the range, shape, and variability of observations and clearly identify outliers. By contrast, <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> address only measures of central tendency. <b>Bar</b> <b>graphs</b> should be used only to describe qualitative data...|$|R
40|$|Cleveland (1985) {{claimed that}} {{comparative}} judgments hould {{be most effective}} when evaluating two graphical components aligned to the same baseline. Hence, <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> (<b>bars</b> arranged side by side) should generally be better than stacked <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> (one <b>bar</b> placed above the other). However, stacked <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> {{may be more effective}} for part-to-whole proportion judgments, since the whole is represented explicitly (an emergent feature resulting from the arrangement of the bars). Thirty-five participants were shown bar or stacked <b>bar</b> <b>graphs,</b> and compared one bar to the other in a part-to-part proportion judgment, or one bar to the sum in a part-to-whole judgment. Completion times and absolute rror were recorded for each condition. Participants made larger errors with stacked <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> in part-to-part tasks, but graph type had little effect on error for part-to-whole tasks. Participants took more time with the <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> in the part-to-whole task, but there was little time difference between the graph types in part-to-part tasks. In general, bars were better for the part-to-part task, and stacked bars better for the part-to-whole task. The results show that Cleveland’s claim does not hold true across graph reading tasks...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{descriptive}} {{study was to investigate}} grade four and grade six students' understanding of the information conveyed by <b>bar</b> <b>graphs.</b> In particular, the effects of various characteristics of familiarity of the graph topic, the arrangement of the data, and scale on students' ability to read, interpret and predict from <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> were examined. [...] Five elementary schools participated in the study. This resulted in a sample of 121 grade four students and 127 grade six students. Each student was administered a written test designed by the author which consisted of four <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> with three questions per graph. On the basis of the written responses, 35 students from grade four and 37 students from grade six were given audiotaped interviews to obtain additional information. The responses for each graph were then categorized, and the major errors were discussed in terms of the frame theory model developed by Davis (1984). [...] At least 15 types of errors were documented. While some of these were reading-language and computation errors, the majority were graph-based errors. Four general categories were identified namely: data arrangement, topic, scale, and the fact the information was not shown on the graph. [...] Overall, students at both grade levels had little difficulty reading <b>bar</b> <b>graphs,</b> more difficulty interpreting <b>bar</b> <b>graphs,</b> and had major difficulty knowing when prediction from <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> was possible. The frequency of reading-language, computation, and particularly scale errors was higher at the grade four level than at the grade six level. However, errors involving pattern arrangements of the data occurred in similar frequencies for both grades and it was concluded that both grade four and grade six students have similar but flawed graph frames...|$|R

50|$|In 1984, {{recently}} appointed Editor-in-Chief Rob Markey sought {{feedback from}} {{students and faculty}} and then overhauled the system in time to create a 1985-1986 Semester I edition, {{the first issue of}} the Critical Review to cover a single semester. The editors introduced the now standard two-reviews-per-page format, with <b>bar</b> <b>graphs,</b> which were meant to depict the general distribution of student responses. The <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> were implemented in order to improve the accountability of the Critical Review by balancing the written summaries with objective data from the student surveys and by presenting sample sizes, so that professors would know the reviews were not based on the comments of just one or two students. The editors also created customized software to make it easy to produce the <b>bar</b> <b>graphs.</b> They developed a matching questionnaire to generate the student input on the courses in quantitative form. However, at this point the Critical Review still relied on professors to distribute its questionnaires, which some refused to do or did haphazardly. The publication also accepted departmental evaluation forms as an alternative to its own questionnaire. As a result, <b>bar</b> <b>graphs</b> were not available for many classes. Nevertheless, having found a satisfactory and manageable system to which Brown students and faculty responded favorably, subsequent editors changed relatively little about the format, process, and policy of the Critical Review over the next few years.|$|R
