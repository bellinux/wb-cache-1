50|$|The {{basic design}} dates {{back more than}} a century. It {{consists}} of a double-wall gas generator, a perforated <b>burner</b> <b>ring,</b> and an inner preheat chamber. A similar design was patented in 1904 by New York coppersmith J. Heinrichs. Trangia has been selling a commercial version of the design since 1925, and Safesport marketed a stainless-steel stove in the 1990s. The Trangia stove burner is made from brass, although all the other associated parts that come with it are aluminium.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to show the design, build, and test process for a {{portable}} beer brewing rack. The rack {{is designed to be}} compact, yet still be able to hold all of the necessary components for brewing: two 15 -gallon insulated kettles, two gas burners, and an instant hot water heating system. These components can be supported in any configuration at multiple height intervals on the center tree during the brewing process. The rack is designed to be resistant to tipping over when brewing while requiring less than two square feet of floor space when stored. This report shows the design of the center tree and mounting system, the legs and hinges, and the burner and associated racks. Stress and bending calculations are shown for these components as well as the mounting pins, <b>burner</b> <b>rings,</b> and foot locking pins. This report discusses design and manufacturing issues of the above parts and the timeline for creating the whole system. The center tree, burner racks, and feet were all successful in their design size and length. The manufacturing method used was inefficient in scheduling, the original and improved timeline are discussed in this report. The original and redesigned hinges and <b>burner</b> <b>rings</b> are also discussed. This report covers the design, build, and testing process/timeline; the budget and itemized costs of the system; and the limitations/abilities of the rack...|$|R

40|$|Object of {{this paper}} are {{experimental}} and numerical investigations of the Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown (CIVB) phenomenon in a free straight vortex. The experiments were performed using a swirl generation device. A swirling jet of premixed methane/air is ejected by this device into the ambient surrounding air. At some distance above the swirler nozzle, there is a <b>ring</b> <b>burner</b> mounted which holds a stationary flame. When conditions for a flashback are met, the flame of the <b>ring</b> <b>burner</b> propagates against the main flow back to the nozzle. Numerical simulations of the flashback event were performed using the open source finite volume code OpenFOAM. To model the influence of turbulence, the large-eddy simulation technique was applied. For combustion modelling, a flame surface wrinkling model was used. LES simulations confirmed {{the fact that the}} CIVB appears in the vortex configuration considered. Detailed analysis of the LES data allows to estimate contributions of different physical mechanisms to the CIVB...|$|R

As she bumps into the girls, they are speechless at her unexpected reemergence and she explains that her return to Rosewood is due to Toby and Yvonne's engagement. Later, Toby arrives {{at the police station}} and crosses paths with his stepsister. He argues with Jenna about her arrival to town though she assures him that her intentions are to solely make amends. After Hanna and Mona find Hanna's golden bracelet on Elliott's car, they hear his <b>burner</b> phone <b>ringing.</b> When Mona answers the call, Jenna's voice is heard from the other end answering “Hi, Archer, can you hear me? It's Jenna, Jenna Marshall”, thus revealing Elliott's real name and that she's somehow involved in A.D.'s game.|$|R

This consists of a standard <b>burner</b> (with simmer <b>ring),</b> small wind shield, 800 ml pot, 15 cm frying pan and pot/pan grip (handle). The entire package weighs just 330 grams, according to Trangia's website. The Mini Trangia is much more portable than the standard-sized Trangia and is even lighter than most liquid-fuelled, pressure stoves (which don't include pots or pans in the weight).

40|$|In {{this thesis}} three {{different}} combustion systems, equipped {{with either a}} single or multiple ?ameless combustion burner(s), are discussed. All these setups were investigated both experimentally and numerically, i. e., using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Flameless combustion is a combustion technology capable of accomplishing the combination of high energy ef?ciency (by preheating of the combustion air) and low emissions, especially nitrogen oxides (NOx). These high combustion air preheat temperatures normally account for increased thermal formation of NOx, however, in ?ameless combustion, by delayed mixing of the fuel and oxidizer and high internal ?ue gas recirculation, the rates of these reactions are decreased. Nitrogen oxide {{plays a key role}} in acid rain formation and the generation of photochemical smog. The ?rst setup that has been investigated is a furnace equipped with two regenerative ?ameless combustion burner pairs, with a thermal power of 100 kWth each, located at the laboratories of Kungliga Tekniska H¨ gskolan (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden (Chapter 4). The objective of this study is to investigate the performance of the furnace operating in two different ?ring modes, parallel and staggered. The furnace performance is de?ned as the energy ef?ciency and the NO emissions. Experimental results show that for parallel ?ring mode both the ef?ciency was higher and the NO emissions were lower compared to staggered ?ring mode. With the use of the CFD simulations, it was shown that in parallel mode the radiative heat transfer was higher due to formation of a larger zone with gases with improved radiative properties and that higher velocities along the cooling tubes, due to lower momentum destruction, led to higher convective heat transfer. Both of these heat transfer methods contributed to the higher energy ef?ciency in parallel ?ring mode. Additionally, the lower formation of NO emissions in parallel ?ring mode was due to the fact that the low-momentum fuel jets merged slower with the high-momentum combustion air jets, resulting in more internal ?ue gas recirculation and a less intense combustion zone. Moreover, it was found that NOx was formed via the thermal and N 2 O intermediate pathways. No prompt NO was formed, while the reburning pathway resulted in a reduction of the total NO emissions. The second setup is a 300 kWth furnace equipped with three pairs of regenerative ?ameless combustion burners, located at Delft University of Technology (DUT) in the Netherlands (Chapter 5). An experimental parametric study was performed, varying the positions of the burners in the furnace (the <b>burner</b> con?guration), the ?<b>ring</b> mode (parallel and staggered), the excess air ratio and the cycle time, with the objective to optimize the furnace performance. Since similar trends in the furnace performance, as for the furnace at KTH, comparing parallel and staggered ?ring mode, were observed, staggered mode was exempted from further analysis. Additionally, one of the ?ve investigated burner con?gurations has also been exempted due to a signi?cant lower energy ef?ciency compared to the other con?gurations. The experimental results show that the burner positioning and the cycle time had a signi?cant in?uence on the temperature inside the regenerators, and thus on the preheat temperature of the combustion air. This temperature turned out to be important regarding the CO emissions. Furthermore, it was found that comparing different cases ?ring in ?ameless mode, an improved temperature uniformity in the furnace was not re?ected by a higher energy ef?ciency. Finally, a horizontal setup of the ?<b>ring</b> <b>burners</b> (the three ?<b>ring</b> <b>burners</b> positioned in a horizontal row) improved the energy ef?ciency at similar temperature uniformities. Steady CFD simulations have been performed for this furnace for four different <b>burner</b> con?gurations ?<b>ring</b> in parallel mode (Chapter 6). During the careful selection of the set of physical models to be used, it was found that, due to relatively low Reynolds numbers in the cooling air ?ow in the annulus of the cooling tubes, predictions of the heat extraction rates of these cooling tubes were improved by treating the ?ow in the cooling tubes as laminar. Furthermore, the applied error tolerance of the ISAT procedure was insuf?cient for accurate species concentration predictions, however, based on analysis of the main species concentrations in the ?ue gas, this inaccuracy did not in?uence the overall predictions. It was possible to explain the most important results of the experimental study using the CFD simulations. In the ?rst place, it was found that a recirculation zone between the upper ?<b>ring</b> <b>burners</b> and the stack in two con?gurations resulted in a smaller fraction of the ?ue gases leaving the furnace via the stack compared to the other two con?gurations. Thus, a larger fraction of the ?ue gas left the furnace via the regenerating burners, which resulted in higher preheat temperatures of the combustion air. Secondly, the experimentally observed differences in the temperature uniformity between the four con?gurations could be explained by the presence of less or more pronounced recirculation zones, the latter leading to higher temperature uniformities in the furnace. Finally, it was con?rmed that the jets of the burners showed similar merging behaviour for different burner con?gurations, leading to similar NO emissions, a trend that was also observed in the experiments. The third setup is a prototype ?ameless combustion gas turbine combustor (Chapter 7). The combustor was ?red with various Low Calori?c Value (LCV) gases. The in?uence of several parameters (the fuel composition, the outlet temperature and the inlet nozzle diameter) on the CO and NO emissions has been investigated. In the ?rst place, it was shown that this prototype ?ameless combustion gas turbine combustor could be operated in ?ameless mode ?ring the LCV gases. Moreover, for both pollutants ultra-low emissions (single-digit) have been achieved. In the CFD simulations, different turbulence models and chemistry mechanisms have been compared, leading to a set with models which gave the best results. Comparing the measured and predicted axial temperature pro?les in the combustor, it was concluded that the observed discrepancies were within the range of uncertainty in what are optimal values of the model constants. From NO calculations, ultra-low emission combustion was con?rmed. Also, it was found that 90 % of the NO was formed via the N 2 O path, and the remaining 10 % via the thermal pathway. No prompt NO was formed, a trend also observed for the KTH furnace. In conclusion, important knowledge on the behaviour of furnaces equipped with multiple ?ameless combustion burners has been attained. Especially, the in?uence on the furnace performance of the ?ring con?guration of the burners and the burner positioning in the furnace will contribute to more successful (industrial) application of this combustion technology in the future. Recommendations for the installation of ?ameless combustion burners in large industrial-scale furnaces have been proposed. Finally, the shown possibility of ?ring a (prototype) gas turbine combustor with low calori?c value gases in ?ameless mode, enables the utilization of biomass derived gaseous fuels in existing equipment.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the production of metal-coated optical fibres, the fibres being drawn within a vacuum. Most common methods for producing optical fibres employ an oxy-gas <b>ring</b> <b>burner</b> or an inert gas resistance furnace to reach the high temperatures necessary to melt silica. These methods have the disadvantage of exposing the molten or hot silica fibre to the atmosphere before a protective coating is applied, thereby increasing the possibility of contaminants being present at the fibre surface. A novel though more elaborate method of producing fibres is described, with preliminary experimental results. Vacuum production allows the fibre to be metal-coated, using a magnetron sputtering technique, before exposure to the atmosphere, and the methods by which this is achieved are described. An electromagnetically operated optical fibre switch utilising a ferromagnetically-coated optical fibre is also described. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} various operational {{parameters of}} a 200 -MWe, wall-fired, lignite utility boiler under different loads. The parameters measured were gas temperature, gas species concentration, char burnout, component release rates (C, H and N), furnace temperature, heat flux, and boiler efficiency. Cold air experiments {{of a single}} burner were conducted in the laboratory. A double swirl flow pulverized-coal <b>burner</b> has two <b>ring</b> recirculation zones that start in the secondary air region of the burner. With increasing secondary air flow, the air flow axial velocity increases, the maximum values for the radial velocity, tangential velocity, and turbulence intensity all increase, and there are slight increases in the air flow swirl intensity and the recirculation zone size. With increasing load gas, the temperature and CO concentration in the central region of burner decrease, while O 2 concentration, NOx concentration, char burnout, and component release rates of C, H, and N increase. Pulverized-coal ignites farther into the burner, in the secondary air region. Gas temperature, O 2 concentration, NOx concentration, char burnout and component release rates of C, H, and N all increase. Furthermore, CO concentration varies slightly and pulverized-coal ignites closer. In the side wall region, gas temperature, O 2 concentration, and NOx concentration all increase, but CO concentration varies only slightly. In the bottom row burner region the furnace temperature and heat flux increase appreciably, but the increase become more obvious {{in the middle and}} top row burner regions and in the burnout region. Compared with a 120 -MWe load, the mean NOx emission at the air preheater exits for 190 -MWe load increases from 589. 5 Â mg/m 3 (O 2 Â =Â  6 %) to 794. 6 Â mg/m 3 (O 2 Â =Â  6 %), and the boiler efficiency increases from 90. 73 % to 92. 45 %.
