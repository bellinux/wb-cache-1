40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{introduces}} a coastal structure design {{to protect a}} reclamation site, which will be fixed {{at a level of}} + 8 m above the chart datum. A jetty will be also used for loading and unloading of materials from the plant that will be developed on the nearby reclamation site. From the given site contours and water depth data, the bottom slope of the sandy foreshore can be determined. In order to design the coastal structure, the wave climate must be considered and analyzed in priority. For the vertical breakwater to be located {{on the other side of}} the <b>berth</b> <b>jetty,</b> the required base and height was determined. In addition, the seawalls for the reclamation platform were analyzed at different water depths...|$|R

50|$|In July 1949 the Pakistan Ministry of Communications requisitioned Bhombal's {{services}} as a special officer {{for the development of}} Chittagong Port in East Pakistan. However within two weeks of his arrival he was given the duties of Deputy Conservator, in which capacity he was to pilot ships {{in and out of the}} port and to train men. In addition to these duties, Bhombal completed the laying of five heavy first-class moorings which greatly increased the capacity of Chittagong Port, allowing it to take double the amount of foreign-going vessels. Previously the port had only six <b>jetty</b> <b>berths</b> and one mooring.

50|$|In boating, a fender is {{a bumper}} used {{to absorb the}} kinetic energy of a boat or vessel <b>berthing</b> against a <b>jetty,</b> quay wall or other vessel. Fenders, used on all types of vessels, from cargo ships to cruise ships, ferries and {{personal}} yachts, prevent damage to vessels and berthing structures. To do this, fenders have high energy absorption and low reaction force. Fenders are typically manufactured out of rubber, foam elastomer or plastic. Rubber fenders are either extruded or made in a mold. The type of fender that is most suitable for an application depends on many variables, including dimensions and displacement of the vessel, maximum allowable stand-off, berthing structure, tidal variations and other berth-specific conditions. The size of the fender unit {{is based on the}} berthing energy of the vessel which is related to the square of the berthing velocity.|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{of various}} {{hydraulic}} parameters such as wave heights {{for the research}} and the practical purpose in the coastal fields {{is one of the}} critical and challenging but equally important criteria in the field of ocean engineering for the design and the development of hydraulic structures such as construction of sea walls, break waters, oil jetties, fisheries harbors, all other structures, and the ships maneuvering, embankments, <b>berthing</b> on <b>jetties.</b> This paper elucidates the development of “SeaBuoySoft online software system for coastal field‟s wave height data collection” for the coastal application work. The system could be installed along with the associated hardware such as a Digital Waverider Receiver unit and a Waverider Buoy at the shore. The ocean wave height data, transmitted by wave rider buoy installed in the shallow/offshore waters of sea is received by the digital waverider receiver unit and it is interfaced to the SeaBuoySoft software. The design and development of the software system has been worked out in-house at Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune, India. The software has been developed as a Windows based standalone version and is unique of its kind for the reception of real time ocean wave height data, it takes care of its local storage of wave height data for its further analysis work as and when required. The system acquires real time ocean wave height data round the clock requiring no operator intervention during data acquisition process on site...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to understand how}} estuarine stability responded to artificial deepening of the seabed within the Tamar Estuary. This was achieved by the conduct of a bathymetric survey and comparison against archived survey data. The dredging had been conducted {{in preparation for the}} construction of a proposed <b>jetty</b> <b>berth,</b> which was subsequently abandoned. A bathymetric survey of the dredge site was conducted using an R 2 Sonic 2024 multibeam system. A statistical comparative analysis was conducted to assess sedimentation in the immediate area by comparing depths observed in; the acquired survey data, archived MOD surveys and Admiralty Charts Digital terrain models of three surveys were used to conduct volumetric comparisons. Very little sedimentation occurred over the majority of the survey area (from September 2003 to March 2012). The greatest accumulation of sediment was on the intertidal area flanking the dredged area, and around the rectangular perimeter of the dredged site. The intertidal mud banks adjacent to the dredged area expanded dramatically (≤ 60 m) over a four year period (from September 2003 to May 2007), with a notable decrease in the rate of advancement (of the intertidal region) between May 2007 and March 2012 (≤ 16 m). These observations were attributed to natural reestablishment of the area aided by a modified hydrodynamic regime. An assessment of dredging activity in the area upstream of the dredged area suggested that anthropological influences did not contribute to local sedimentation. Therefore, sedimentation which occurred at dredged site was considered to be derived from fluvial sources. Error budgets from each survey were compared to provide an estimated error margin for temporal depth changes. An estimated error margin of (+/-) 0. 6 m was consistent for depths in all three surveys...|$|R
40|$|The port of Kandla, {{which is}} {{situated}} in the north west of India and is subject to a large tidal variation of about 5 metres, is preparing a major expansion plan. The capacity of the harbour will be increased in two ways. Firstly the construction of several <b>berths</b> and <b>jetties</b> will allow more ships to be handled on a yearly basis. Secondly deepening of the harbour and its approaches will allow ships with a larger draught to call upon the port. It is this deepening that causes concern. The Kandla Port Trust (KPT) and the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) have calculated the amounts of cubic metres {{that will have to}} be dredged in order to raise the permissible draught from 10. 7 to 14 metres. Especially the maintenance dredging posts a problem. KPT and CWPRS have calculated that between 90 and 111 million m 3 have to be dredged annually to maintain the required depths. This is an increase by a factor 20 from the present 5 million m 3. The costs that accompany this huge increase of dredging exceeds the extra generated income by large. As no details are known about the calculation methods of both KPT and CWPRS and the expected dredging amounts seem unrealistically high, a goal of this study is to simulate the future situation and determine the dredging amounts that will arise. A second goal is to determine the effects of training walls on the sedimentation in the approach channel, where the largest increase in maintenance dredging is expected. A process-based software package, Delft 3 D, developed by WLI Delft Hydraulics will be used to simulate the reality. The set up and calibration of the model has led to mixed results. In Kandla Creek, where the port is situated, the flow velocities calculated by the model resemble the measured data quite good. In the area around the approach channel (Sogal Channel), the flow velocities are too low in comparison with reality. This has consequences for the morphodynamics in the region. The morphological development in Kandla Creek shows better results than the morphological activity in the shallower vicinity of the approach channel, where little to no morphological change has occurred. The simulation of the future situation has led to the calculation of a significantly lower increase in maintenance dredging than found by KPT and CWPRS. Even though assumptions have been made the increase amounted to a more realistic magnitude of a factor 3. The costs that accompany this increase are significantly smaller than the extra income generated by the expansion. Implementing training walls to divert or contract the flow in order to decrease sedimentation by means of natural flushing of Sogal Channel will not be necessary from an economical point of view. The simulation of a few training wall layouts however has been done to obtain insight in the morphological development of the approach channel. The first concept consists of a wall in line with the main flow direction. The idea is to guide the flow more into the main channel creating more natural flushing and stabilising the channel in its present position. The effect of this proposal however is negligible, as the main flow isn't deflected enough. The flow velocity in the bend of the channel is increased only marginally, especially in the creek outfall. The extra erosion in that area isn't beneficial as the depth is large enough already. In order for this concept to be more effective a larger portion of the flow (both ebb and flood) needs to be directed into the channel and therefore the training wall has to be less in line with the existing flow direction. The model has to be adjusted to create a different alignment of the wall. The other two concepts block a part of the flow and only allow water to flow through the channel. This is done by implementing training walls perpendicular to the flow direction. The first of these concepts consists of a staggered wall, which does not block the flow completely. Water is able to flow through the wall, albeit that the flow is severely hindered. The second layout blocks the flow completely and all of the water is directed through the channel. Both concepts have a favourable effect on the morphological development of the bend in the channel, which becomes subject to erosion. The problem however is shifted towards other parts of the approach channel, which become subject to sedimentation. The effect is roughly twice -as large in case of total blockage than in case of the staggered training wall. The impact of these proposals is very severe. The rate of morphological change is very high as the present hydrodynamic situation is gravely affected. It is not clear what the effect will be in the long run. The results of the simulations have to be interpreted cautiously. In the process of modelling assumptions have been made. A few of these assumptions had to be made due to a shortage of data, while others have been made in order to simplify the problem so that it could be dealt within the scope of this study. The quantitative results cannot serve as a basis on which conclusions are formulated. A qualitative analysis however is possible, which can be found in this report. The overall conclusion of this study is that the best way to enlarge and maintain the maximum permissible draught is to increase dredging. The extra costs of the increase in maintenance dredging weighs up to the extra-generated income. Furthermore the impact of the different training walls is too severe and the uncertainties that accompany this impact in the long run are too plentiful.
