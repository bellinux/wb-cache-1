Such a TRD, envisaged for electron/pion identification, {{is part of}} the setup of the CBM detector at FAIR [1]. To cope with the envisaged rates of up to 100 kHz/cm 2, we have chosen as detectors multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPCs) of 6 mm thickness, with anode wires of 20 μm diameter with a pitch of 2 and 3 mm. Transition radiation (TR) is produced in radiators composed of polypropylene foils of 20 μm thickness (d 1), regularly spaced by a distance (d 2) of either 200 or 500 μm, with the number of foils Nf of 220 or 120, respectively.

Rigorous quality assurance (QA) processes were undertaken to ensure the validity and reliability of the radiation therapy treatment plan data. Method: QA processes included a planning benchmarking exercise and a periodic audit of target and normal tissue delineation. Centralised electronic review of digital plan data for external-beam radiotherapy was undertaken to detect protocol variations. The impact of clinical factors and feedback to submitting centres during the trial on variation rates was investigated. Results: Twenty-three centres across Australia and New Zealand recruited 1071 participants to the trial. Treatment plans for 754 participants receiving external-beam treatment alone were reviewed. From these, 1185 minor and 86 major variations were identified, leading to feedback to treating centres to reduce variations for subsequent patients&# 039; treatment and plans, suggesting improvement in treatment quality through these QA programs. Participant anatomical factors (delineated clinical target volume and rectal volume) and treatment planning factors (beam energy, <b>beam</b> <b>definition</b> and patient position orientation) were found to significantly impact variation rates. The dummy run demonstrated disagreement in identification of {{the base of the}} prostate and the superior extent of the rectum.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to assess the}} sensitivity of X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XFS) for quantitative evaluation of metal particle content in engine oil suspensions and the feasibility of real-time, dynamic wear metal analysis. The study was focused on iron as the majority wear metal component. Variable parameters were: particle size, particle concentration and oil velocity. A commercial XFS spectrometer equipped with interchangeable static/dynamic (flow cell) sample chambers was used. XFS spectra were recorded for solutions of Fe-organometallic standard and for a series of DTE oil suspensions of high purity spherical iron particles of 2 g, 4 g, and 8 g diameter, at concentrations from 5 ppm to 5, 000 ppm. Real contaminated oil samples from Langley Air Force Base aircraft engines and NASA Langley Research Center wind tunnels were also analyzed. The experimental data conform the reliability of XFS as the analytical method of choice for this project. Intrinsic inadequacies of the instrument for precise analytic work at low metal concentrations were identified as being related to the particular x-ray <b>beam</b> <b>definition,</b> system geometry, and flow-cell materials selection. This work supports a proposal for the design, construction and testing of a conceptually new, miniature XFS spectrometer with superior performance, dedicated to on-line, real-time monitoring of lubricating oils in operating engines. Innovative design solutions include focalization of the incident x-ray beam, non-metal sample chamber, and miniaturization of the overall assembly. The instrument would contribute to prevention of catastrophic engine failures.

An analytical formulation that allows to get the displacement in this non-linear part, i. e. between the winkling load and the collapse load has recently been written.

50|$|The D86 width {{is defined}} as the {{diameter}} of the circle that is centered at the centroid of the beam profile and contains 86% of the beam power. The solution for D86 is found by computing the area of increasingly larger circles around the centroid until the area contains 0.86 of the total power. Unlike the previous <b>beam</b> width <b>definitions,</b> the D86 width is not derived from marginal distributions. The percentage of 86, rather than 50, 80, or 90, is chosen because a circular Gaussian beam profile integrated down to 1/e2 of its peak value contains 86% of its total power. The D86 width is often used in applications that are concerned with knowing exactly how much power is in a given area. For example, applications of high-energy laser weapons and lidars require precise knowledge of how much transmitted power actually illuminates the target.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} for the characterization {{of the quality of}} a laser beam that is not based on particular criteria for <b>beam</b> width <b>definition.</b> The Lorenz curve of a light beam is a sophisticated version of the so-called power-in-the-bucket curve, formed by the partial sums of discretized joint intensity distribution in the near and far fields sorted in decreasing order. According to majorization theory, a higher Lorenz curve implies that all measures of spreading in phase space, and, in particular, all Rényi (and Shannon) entropy-based measures of the beam width products in near and far fields, are unanimously smaller, providing a strong assessment of a better beam quality. Two beams whose Lorenz curves intersect can only be considered of relatively better or lower quality according to specific criteria, which can be inferred from the plot of the respective Lorenz curves.

Particular concern is given to the use of multi-leaf collimator (MLC) technology for photon <b>beam</b> <b>definition</b> when abutted to extended source-to-surface (SSD) electron beams. We made dosimetric comparison between MLC and Cerrobend® shielding for use in an abutment situation. The effects of extending the SSD of the electron beam were also assessed. We checked the ability of a Pinnacle 3 v 7. 6 treatment planning system (TPS) to correctly model the dosimetry resulting from this extended electron beam SSD. Volumetric simulations of composite dosimetry resulting in water were conducted in MATLAB® for variations of surface abutment gap, and photon beam shielding type and angle. Visualization Toolkit (VTK) script was developed to visualise the resulting dosimetry. The effect of extending the SSD of the electron beam increases the beam penumbra significantly, exacerbating the challenge of matching this field to a photon beam edge. Furthermore, the TPS was shown to inaccurately model the electron beam penumbra for the extended SSD conditions. The employment of MLC shielding provides for some advantages over Cerrobend® in terms of overall composite hotspot volumes and coldspot magnitudes, though introduces detrimental dosimetric inhomogeneities in the underlying volume. Distinctly, no combination of abutment gap and shielding variables resulted in dosimetry in the range of 90 % to 110 % at the depth of dmax for the beam energies considered here. We provided tabulated data across these variables to outline the trade-offs present, and aid clinical decisions regarding this challenging dosimetri...|$|E
40|$|The main {{laws that}} govern the charge {{redistribution}} in space charge dominated (SCD) beam during its transport through a periodical channel with solenoidal focusing are considered. Physical mechanisms of halo production and establishment of uniform distribution inside core for matched and mismatched beams are described. The computer codes KERN+HALO generated for redistribution process of charge density and kinetic and potential energies visual representation are described. We have a clear knowledge of matched (or ideal) beam only in case when space charge does not change a frequency of transverse oscillations. The matched (or ideal) beam is a one which transverse behavior is repeated (or has a smooth change) from one period to the next. The question "What a matched beam imply? ” is arisen when the above definition is extended on the case when space charges essential for transverse oscillation frequency. We can denote that ideal beam has well-known K-V distribution and this distribution must be used for focusing field calculation and for a choice of bore radius. But real beam distributions differ from K-V one and its redistribution during beam transport leads to beam size and emittance growths. It means that such ideal <b>beam</b> <b>definition</b> results in an serious error of bore radius. The SCD-beam investigations in channel with different initial beam transverse distributions were made by authors in order to answer on the above question. A simple model must be chosen for better understanding of process of SCD-beam redistribution. It can be a continuous cylindrical beam transporting in longitudinal magnetic field. In this case a Coulomb force calculation is very much simplified. Within {{the context of this}} model {{there are only a few}} characteristics for understanding the cause and effect of halo formation. Only distributions with beam density growth(or keeping constant) from the origin to outlying area were considered as initial ones [1].

40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} impact of {{incremental}} modifications of treatment planning and delivery technique, as well as patient anatomical factors, on late gastrointestinal toxicity using data from the TROG 03. 04 RADAR prostate radiotherapy trial. Methods: The RADAR trial accrued 813 external beam radiotherapy participants during 2003 – 2008 from 23 centres. Following review and archive to a query-able database, digital treatment plans and data describing treatment technique for 754 patients were available for analysis. Treatment demographics, together with anatomical features, were assessed using uni- and multivariate regression models against late gastrointestinal toxicity at 18 -, 36 - and 54 -month follow-up. Regression analyses were reviewed in the context of dose-volume data for the rectum and anal canal. Results: A multivariate analysis at 36 -month follow-up shows that patients planned using a more rigorous dose calculation algorithm (DCA) was associated with a lower risk of stool frequency (OR: 0. 435, CI: 0. 242 – 0. 783, corrected p = 0. 04). Patients using laxative as a method of bowel preparation had higher risk of having increased stool frequency compared to patients with no dietary intervention (OR: 3. 639, CI: 1. 502 8. 818, corrected p = 0. 04). Despite higher risks of toxicities, the anorectum, anal canal and rectum dose-volume histograms (DVH) indicate patients using laxative had unremarkably different planned dose distributions. Patients planned with a more rigorous DCA had lower median DVH values between EQD 2 ₃ = 15 Gy and EQD 2 ₃ = 35 Gy. Planning target volume (PTV), conformity index, rectal width and prescription dose were not significant when adjusted for false discovery rate. Number of beams, beam energy, treatment <b>beam</b> <b>definition,</b> positioning orientation, rectum-PTV separation, rectal length and mean cross sectional area did not affect the risk of toxicities. Conclusions: The RADAR study dataset has allowed an assessment of technical modifications on gastrointestinal toxicity. A number of interesting associations were subsequently found and some factors, previously hypothesised to influence toxicity, did not demonstrate any significant impact. We recommend trial registries be encouraged to record technical modifications introduced during the trial in order for more powerful evidence to be gathered regarding the impact of the interventions...|$|E
40|$|The {{emittance}} as {{the available}} phase space area {{is defined as}} the product of the elementary cell area {delta}{Omega} and exp(S), where S is the normalized entropy of a particle <b>beam.</b> The <b>definition</b> is {{based on the fact that}} the factor exp(S) can be interpreted as the number of the occupied cells. For particle beams, a closed expression for the emittance in terms of the phase space distribution function is obtained which is independent of {delta}{Omega}. To compute the emittance of the radiation beam, it is necessary to find the eigenvalues of the correlation operator. An explicit solution is found for the case of a partially coherent radiation beam which is a stochastic superposition of coherent Gaussian beams with a Gaussian probability distribution. Such a beam is a reasonable model for undulator radiation by beam of electrons. From the requirement that the radiation emittance reproduces the particle beam emittance in the incoherent limit, the elementary cell area {delta}{Omega} is determined unambiguously to be {lambda}, the radiation wavelength. The emittance in the incoherent limit then becomes {lambda}...|$|R

40|$|The Neutrino Factory is {{designed}} to produce an intense high energy neutrino beam from stored muons. The majority of the muons are obtained from the decay of pions, produced by a proton beam impinging on a free-flowing mercury-jet target and captured by a high magnetic field. It is important to capture a large fraction of the produced pions to maximize {{the intensity of the}} neutrino beam. Various optimisation studies have been performed with the aim of maximising the muon influx to the accelerator and thus the neutrino beam intensity. The optimisation studies were performed with the use of Monte Carlo simulation tools. The production of secondary particles, by interactions between the incoming proton beam and the mercury target, was optimised by varying the proton beam impact position and impact angles on the target. The proton beam and target interaction region was studied and showed to be off the central axis of the capture section in the baseline configuration. The off-centred interaction region resulted in off-centred secondary particles. A new proton <b>beam</b> <b>definition</b> was introduced to bring the secondary particle back on the central axis. The path length was increased by varying the proton beam impact position and impact angles on the target while keeping the production of secondary particles centred. The optimisations increased the muon influx to the accelerator. In addition shape fluctuations of the free-flowing mercury jet target was introduced and studied. The study showed only a small performance decrease. The capture efficiency of the capture and tapering sections was studied by using alternative solenoid magnet geometries, alternative solenoid magnet configurations and therefore alternative magnetic field tapering variants to the baseline configuration. In addition an alternative shielding layout was proposed. The optimised capture and tapering sections increases the capture efficiency by using a simple three solenoid magnet configuration and a rapidly tapered magnetic field. The Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment (MICE) is an on-going proof of principle experiment. The MICE cooling channel {{is designed}} according to a feasibility study which assumes an incoming muon beam with symmetric momentum distribution. The MICE beam line delivers a muon beam with a skewed momentum distribution to the experiment. Therefore the MICE beam line was tuned by varying the magnetic field strength in the first dipole to provide a symmetrical momentum distribution to MICE. Both Monte Carlo simulations and data from MICE were used in the study. In addition the pion contamination levels of the MICE muon beams were studied by using results from Monte Carlo simulations...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} at a {{qualitative}} level that directional antennas {{can be used}} to boost the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks. Lacking is a measure to quantify this advantage and to compare directional antennas of different footprint patterns. This paper introduces the concept of the effective beam width (and the effective null width as its dual counterpart) as a measure which quantitatively captures the capacity-boosting capability of directional antennas. Beam width is commonly defined to be the directional angle spread within which the main-lobe beam power is above a certain threshold. In contrast, our effective <b>beam</b> width <b>definition</b> lumps the effects of the (i) antenna pattern, (ii) active-node distribution, and (iii) channel characteristics, on network capacity into a single quantitative measure. We investigate the mathematical properties of the effective beam width and show how the convenience afforded by these properties {{can be used to}} analyze the effectiveness of complex directional antenna patterns in boosting network capacity, with fading and multi-user interference taken into account. In particular, we derive the extent to which network capacity can be scaled with the use of phased array antennas.

The Monte Carlo simulation mimics individual particle transport, in any applicable geometry, by applying first principles of radiation interaction with matter and random choice of collision parameters such as step length, type of interaction, energies and scattering angles. In principle, the accuracy of MC calculations is only limited the radiation <b>beam</b> quality <b>definition</b> and the interaction parameters and can be taken to below 12 %. In practice, {{a very large number of}} particle “histories” have to be simulated to attain sufficient statistical accuracy, and various approximations (e. g. condensed history, variance reduction) have been introduced in the process of adaptation of MC codes to the special needs of treatment planning. Such codes have become known as V(oxel) MC and X(ray) VMC, M(acro) MC, S(uper) MC, MCPAT(ient…). These will be described in detail and performance characteristics as well as treatment planning examples given. While the general-purpose MC codes result in computing times per case of the order of several hours, the special treatment planning codes reduce this time to around an hour or even much less on modern workstations or Pentium-based PCs...|$|R
