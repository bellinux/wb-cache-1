5|$|Paints {{containing}} {{zinc oxide}} powder {{have long been}} utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They are especially effective for galvanized iron. Iron is difficult to protect because its reactivity with organic coatings leads to <b>brittleness</b> and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the <b>brittleness</b> of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce <b>brittleness.</b> In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|The low {{weight and}} high {{rigidity}} of beryllium make it {{useful as a}} material for high-frequency speaker drivers. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than titanium), hard to shape due to its <b>brittleness,</b> and toxic if mishandled, beryllium tweeters are limited to high-end home, pro audio, and public address applications. Some high-fidelity products have been fraudulently claimed {{to be made of}} the material.|$|E
5|$|The {{nonmetallic}} {{character of}} selenium {{is shown by}} its <b>brittleness</b> and the low electrical conductivity (~10−9 to 10−12S•cm−1) of its highly purified form. This is comparable to or {{less than that of}} bromine (7.95S•cm−1), a nonmetal. Selenium has the electronic band structure of a semiconductor and retains its semiconducting properties in liquid form. It has a relatively high electronegativity (2.55 revised Pauling scale). Its reaction chemistry is mainly that of its nonmetallic anionic forms Se2−, SeO and SeO.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of these many allotropes makes machining plutonium very difficult, as it changes state very readily. For example, the α form exists at room temperature in unalloyed plutonium. It has machining characteristics similar to cast iron but changes to the plastic and malleable β (beta) form at slightly higher temperatures. The reasons for the complicated phase diagram are not entirely understood. The α form has a low-symmetry monoclinic structure, hence its <b>brittleness,</b> strength, compressibility, and poor thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its <b>brittleness.</b> Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, major {{advances}} {{were made}} in welding technology, including the introduction of automatic welding in 1920, in which electrode wire was fed continuously. Shielding gas became a subject receiving much attention, as scientists attempted to protect welds {{from the effects of}} oxygen and nitrogen in the atmosphere. Porosity and <b>brittleness</b> were the primary problems, and the solutions that developed included the use of hydrogen, argon, and helium as welding atmospheres. During the following decade, further advances allowed for the welding of reactive metals like aluminum and magnesium. This in conjunction with developments in automatic welding, alternating current, and fluxes fed a major expansion of arc welding during the 1930s and then during World War II. In 1930, the first all-welded merchant vessel, M/S Carolinian, was launched.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its <b>brittleness,</b> but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E
5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to <b>brittleness</b> in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E
25|$|Natural and {{crystalline}} graphites are {{not often}} used in pure form as structural materials, due to their shear-planes, <b>brittleness</b> and inconsistent mechanical properties.|$|E
25|$|Emerald {{is green}} beryl, colored by trace amounts of {{chromium}} and sometimes vanadium. Most emeralds are highly included, so their <b>brittleness</b> (resistance to breakage) {{is classified as}} generally poor.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A is an {{essential}} micro-nutrient for vision, reproduction, cell and tissue differentiation, and immune function. Vitamin D and calcium work together in cases of maintaining homeostasis, creating muscle contraction, transmission of nerve pulses, blood clotting, and membrane structure. A lack of vitamin A, vitamin D, or calcium can cause dryness and <b>brittleness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Layers of {{intermetallics}} {{can form}} between the solder and the soldered material. These layers may cause mechanical reliability weakening and <b>brittleness,</b> increased electrical resistance, or electromigration and formation of voids. The gold-tin intermetallics layer {{is responsible for}} poor mechanical reliability of tin-soldered gold-plated surfaces where the gold plating did not completely dissolve in the solder.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{quality is}} judged by smoothness, friction, hardness, and <b>brittleness.</b> Factors {{affecting}} ice quality include temperature, water quality, and usage, with toe picks causing more deterioration. For figure skating, an ice temperature of 24°F (-4°C) is generally preferred. Typically after every two warm-up groups, an ice resurfacer cleans and smooths {{the surface of}} the ice sheet. Inadequate ice quality may affect skaters' performances.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of chemicals, both metal and non-metal, that can be added to steel {{to make it easier to}} cut. These {{additives}} may work by lubricating the tool-chip interface, decreasing the shear strength of the material, or increasing the <b>brittleness</b> of the chip. Historically, sulphur and lead have been the most common additives, but bismuth and tin are increasingly popular for environmental reasons.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} rarity fancy-colored {{diamonds}} are also imitated, and zircon can serve this purpose too. Applying heat treatment to brown zircon can create several bright colors: these are most commonly sky-blue, golden yellow, and red. Blue zircon is very popular, {{but it is}} not necessarily color stable; prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light (including the UV component in sunlight) tends to bleach the stone. Heat treatment also imparts greater <b>brittleness</b> to zircon and characteristic inclusions.|$|E
25|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of milled coal depends partly on the rank of the coal, which determines its <b>brittleness,</b> and on the handling, crushing and milling it has undergone. Generally coal is utilised in furnaces and coking ovens at a certain size, so the crushability of the coal must be determined and its behaviour quantified. It is necessary to know these data before coal is mined, so that suitable crushing machinery can be designed to optimise the {{particle size}} for transport and use.|$|E
25|$|The {{large amount}} of mineral in enamel {{accounts}} {{not only for its}} strength but also for its <b>brittleness.</b> Tooth enamel ranks 5 on Mohs hardness scale and has a Young's modulus of 83 GPa. Dentin, less mineralized and less brittle, 3–4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. On radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the tooth and surrounding periodontium can be noted; enamel appears lighter than dentin or pulp since it is denser than both and more radiopaque.|$|E
25|$|Their strength, stiffness, {{and high}} melting points are {{consequences}} of the strength and stiffness of the covalent bonds that hold them together. They are also characteristically brittle because the directional nature of covalent bonds strongly resists the shearing motions associated with plastic flow, and are, in effect, broken when shear occurs. This property results in <b>brittleness</b> for reasons studied {{in the field of}} fracture mechanics. Network covalent solids vary from insulating to semiconducting in their behavior, depending on the band gap of the material.|$|E
25|$|Very high {{rotational}} speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this {{translates to}} a reasonably fast linear {{speed of the}} cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the <b>brittleness</b> of the material, make the bits very subject to breaking, particularly if {{the angle of the}} bit to the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practicable, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.|$|E
25|$|Nail growth record {{can show}} the history of recent health and {{physiological}} imbalances, and {{has been used as}} a diagnostic tool since ancient times. Deep transverse grooves known as Beau's lines may form across the nails (not along the nail from cuticle to tip) and are usually a natural consequence of aging, though they may result from disease. Discoloration, thinning, thickening, <b>brittleness,</b> splitting, grooves, Mees' lines, small white spots, receded lunula, clubbing (convex), flatness, and spooning (concave) can indicate illness in other areas of the body, nutrient deficiencies, drug reaction or poisoning, or merely local injury.|$|E
25|$|YAG {{hardness}} (8.25) {{and lack}} of <b>brittleness</b> were great improvements over strontium titanate, and although its RI (1.83) and dispersion (0.028) were fairly low, they were enough to give brilliant-cut YAGs perceptible fire and good brilliance (although still much lower than diamond). A number of different colors were also produced {{with the addition of}} dopants, including yellow, red, and a vivid green, which was used to imitate emerald. Major producers included Shelby Gem Factory of Michigan, Litton Systems, Allied Chemical, Raytheon, and Union Carbide; annual global production peaked at 40 million carats (8000nbsp&kg) in 1972, but fell sharply thereafter. Commercial names for YAG included Diamonair, Diamonique, Gemonair, Replique, and Triamond.|$|E
25|$|Wood from mature giant sequoias {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to decay, {{but due to}} being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company {{was the last to}} harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924. Due to their weight and <b>brittleness,</b> trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.|$|E
25|$|Most ceramic {{materials}} are almost entirely immune to corrosion. The strong chemical bonds that hold them together leave very little free chemical {{energy in the}} structure; they {{can be thought of}} as already corroded. When corrosion does occur, it is almost always a simple dissolution of the material or chemical reaction, rather than an electrochemical process. A common example of corrosion protection in ceramics is the lime added to soda-lime glass to reduce its solubility in water; though it is not nearly as soluble as pure sodium silicate, normal glass does form sub-microscopic flaws when exposed to moisture. Due to its <b>brittleness,</b> such flaws cause a dramatic reduction in the strength of a glass object during its first few hours at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|Seismic {{retrofitting}} is the {{modification of}} existing structures {{to make them}} more resistant to seismic activity, ground motion, or soil failure due to earthquakes. With better understanding of seismic demand on structures and with our recent experiences with large earthquakes near urban centers, the need of seismic retrofitting is well acknowledged. Prior to the introduction of modern seismic codes in the late 1960s for developed countries (US, Japan etc.) and late 1970s for many {{other parts of the world}} (Turkey, China etc.), many structures were designed without adequate detailing and reinforcement for seismic protection. In view of the imminent problem, various research work has been carried out. State-of-the-art technical guidelines for seismic assessment, retrofit and rehabilitation have been published around the world – such as the ASCE-SEI 41 and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering (NZSEE)'s guidelines. These codes must be regularly updated; the 1994 Northridge earthquake brought to light the <b>brittleness</b> of welded steel frames, for example.|$|E
25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing <b>brittleness.</b> Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. These recent works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.|$|E

The {{efficiency}} {{is dependent on}} the welding process used, with shielded metal arc welding having a value of 0.75, gas metal arc welding and submerged arc welding, 0.9, and gas tungsten arc welding, 0.8. Methods of alleviating the stresses and <b>brittleness</b> created in the HAZ include stress relieving and tempering.|$|E
500|$|A {{member of}} the {{platinum}} group metals, iridium is white, resembling platinum, but with a slight yellowish cast. Because of its hardness, <b>brittleness,</b> and very high melting point, solid iridium is difficult to machine, form, or work; thus powder metallurgy is commonly employed instead. It is the only metal to maintain good mechanical properties in air at temperatures above [...] It has the 10th highest boiling point among all elements and becomes a superconductor at temperatures below 0.14K.|$|E

500|$|The {{paper and}} {{pigments}} in ukiyo-e paintings {{are sensitive to}} light and seasonal changes in humidity. [...] Mounts must be flexible, as the sheets can tear under sharp changes in humidity. [...] In the Edo era, the sheets were mounted on long-fibred paper and preserved scrolled up in plain paulownia boxes placed in another lacquer wooden box. [...] In museum settings display times must be limited to prevent deterioration from exposure to light and environmental pollution. [...] Scrolling causes concavities in the paper, and the unrolling and rerolling of the scrolls causes creasing. [...] Ideal relative humidity for scrolls should be kept between 50% and 60%; <b>brittleness</b> results from too dry a level.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} century, {{molybdenum}} had no industrial use. [...] It was relatively scarce, the pure metal {{was difficult to}} extract, and the necessary techniques of metallurgy were immature. Early molybdenum steel alloys showed great promise of increased hardness, but efforts to manufacture the alloys {{on a large scale}} were hampered with inconsistent results, a tendency toward <b>brittleness,</b> and recrystallization. In 1906, William D. Coolidge filed a patent for rendering molybdenum ductile, leading to applications as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas. In 1913, Frank E. Elmore developed a froth flotation process to recover molybdenite from ores; flotation remains the primary isolation process.|$|E
500|$|Several {{hundred years}} later, {{the climate of}} Minnesota warmed significantly. As large animals such as mammoths became extinct, native people changed their diet. [...] They {{gathered}} nuts, berries, and vegetables, and they hunted smaller animals such as deer, bison, and birds. [...] The stone tools found from this era became smaller and more specialized to use these new food sources. They also devised new techniques for catching fish, such as fish hooks, nets, and harpoons. Around 5000 BC, people {{on the shores of}} Lake Superior (in Minnesota and portions of what is now Michigan, Wisconsin, and Canada) were the first on the continent to begin making metal tools. Pieces of ore with high concentrations of copper were initially pounded into a rough shape, heated to reduce <b>brittleness,</b> pounded again to refine the shape, and reheated. [...] Edges could be made sharp enough to be useful as knives or spear points.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more common}} and related problem is [...] "swelling", where small {{molecules}} infiltrate the structure, reducing strength and stiffness and causing a volume change. Conversely, many polymers (notably flexible vinyl) are intentionally swelled with plasticizers, {{which can be}} leached out of the structure, causing <b>brittleness</b> or other undesirable changes.|$|E
2500|$|Chromium with {{improved}} ductility. Uses of chromium {{as a high}} temperature material are limited by its <b>brittleness.</b> [...] Starting with electro-deposited flakes of high purity chromium, investigators at Fulmer used argon-arc melting to form electrodes for ingot production in a consumable electrode furnace. Ingots were then heated in an inert or hydrogen atmosphere and extruded to give a fine grained structure. [...] Critical warm working, below the recrystallization temperature, then gave improved room-temperature ductility.|$|E
