5|$|VAT {{delivered}} {{its first}} mid-engined bus chassis to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with air suspension and dual-circuit air brakes. VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a <b>bus</b> <b>with</b> a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E

5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army <b>bus</b> <b>with</b> a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching the end of the line, summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E
5|$|As the 1930s progressed and {{the economy}} improved, the Greyhound Corporation began to prosper again. In 1934, {{intercity}} bus lines (of which Greyhound was the largest) carried approximately 400,000,000 passengers—nearly as many passengers as the Class I railroads. The film It Happened One Night (1934) centered on an heiress (Claudette Colbert) traveling by Greyhound <b>bus</b> <b>with</b> a reporter (Clark Gable). The movie is credited by the company for spurring bus travel nationwide. In 1935, national intercity bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the Class I railroads for the first time. In 1935 Wickman was able to announce record profits of $8 million. In 1936, already the largest bus carrier in the United States, Greyhound began taking delivery of 306 new buses.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by <b>bus</b> <b>with</b> his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was a difficult one so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E
