5|$|Diamond's high thermal {{conductivity}} {{is used by}} jewelers and gemologists who may employ an electronic thermal probe to distinguish diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist {{of a pair of}} battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. However, older probes will <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> <b>by</b> moissanite, a crystalline mineral form of silicon carbide introduced in 1998 as an alternative to diamonds, which has a similar {{thermal conductivity}}.|$|E
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> <b>by</b> his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though appearing to be slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
25|$|Melamine is {{sometimes}} illegally added to food products {{in order to}} increase the apparent protein content. Standard tests, such as the Kjeldahl and Dumas tests, estimate protein levels by measuring the nitrogen content, so they can be misled by adding nitrogen-rich compounds such as melamine. An instrument (SPRINT) developed by the company CEM Corp allows the determination of protein content directly in some applications; the instrument cannot <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> <b>by</b> adding melamine in the sample.|$|E

But the prince turns her away solely for her appearance. The old woman warns him not to <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> <b>by</b> appearances, as true beauty lies within, only to be rejected again. She then transforms into a beautiful enchantress and turns the prince into a hideous Beast and his servants into various household objects. She gives him the rose to use as an hour-glass.

25|$|Diamond is an {{extremely}} effective thermal conductor and usually an electrical insulator. The former property is widely exploited {{in the use of}} an electronic thermal probe to separate diamonds from their imitations. These probes consist of a pair of battery-powered thermistors mounted in a fine copper tip. One thermistor functions as a heating device while the other measures the temperature of the copper tip: if the stone being tested is a diamond, it will conduct the tip's thermal energy rapidly enough to produce a measurable temperature drop. As most simulants are thermal insulators, the thermistor's heat will not be conducted. This test takes about 2–3 seconds. The only possible exception is moissanite, which has a thermal conductivity similar to diamond: older probes can <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> <b>by</b> moissanite, but newer Thermal and Electrical Conductivity testers are sophisticated enough to differentiate the two materials.|$|E

[...] Despite this, the BNP had a Jewish councillor, Patricia Richardson, and spokesman Phil Edwards has stated that the party also has Jewish members. The BNP has stated that it does not deny the Holocaust, and that [...] "Dredging up quotes from 10, 15, 20 years ago is really pathetic and, in a sense, rather fascist."

Aguilera sings the lyrics [...] "I look at my reflection and embrace the woman I've become/ The unbreakable lotus in me, I now set free" [...] over electronic [...] "bleeps and beeps". Some of the opening lyrics, including [...] "Rise up/ This is the beginning" [...] and [...] "Leave the past behind", serve as a mission statement {{for the rest of the}} album. Despite claiming to [...] "submerge from hurt, pain, broken pieces" [...] and [...] "leave the past behind/ say goodbye to the scared child inside," [...] Andrew Hampp for Billboard felt that the singer [...] "still has a few scores to settle." [...] According to Robert Copsey for Digital Spy, the singer explains how the a Lotus Flower is [...] "the unbreakable flower" [...] in the lyrics [...] "To the sky I rise/ Spread my wings and fly". He further wrote that the listener could <b>be</b> <b>fooled</b> <b>by</b> the title [...] "Lotus Intro", as it is a full length song and not a short introduction.

Network monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) {{can be used to}} alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection.
