5|$|After {{the star}} has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses {{producing}} a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described red giant phase, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo {{a brief period}} of carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the main}} bailey walls lies the stable block, now ruined <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> visible cobble floor. The stables {{and the north}} and west sides of the castle were {{protected}} by another, smaller curtain wall, but this is now largely ruined. Accounts suggest that the original stables could hold around 60horses, although by the 17th century they had been expanded to accommodate more.|$|E

5|$|David Jenkins, who was {{a student}} and {{assistant}} to Parry at Aberystwyth, described him as impulsive and unable to criticise his own works, too erratic {{to be a good}} conductor and too impatient for all but advanced students, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> boyish enthusiasm, especially for music. Sir Alexander Mackenzie, who also worked with Parry, also noted his great enthusiasm and described him as a man of great musical ability.|$|E
5|$|Garamond {{worked as}} an {{engraver}} of punches, the masters used to stamp matrices, the moulds used to cast metal type. His designs followed the model of an influential design cut for Venetian printer Aldus Manutius by his punchcutter Francesco Griffo in 1495, and helped to establish {{what is now called}} the old-style serif letter design, letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slightly more structured and upright design.|$|E

5|$|Helvellyn may be {{included}} in a traverse of the full length of the Helvellyn range in either direction, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greater sense of climax when starting from the north. Most of the ridge track is a bridleway and so the route can be completed by mountain bike in a challenging six-hour circular route of 16 miles off-road and 10 miles on-road riding. This may begin (and finish) at Mill Bridge near Grasmere.|$|E

Route X44, which differed from the regular route by additionally serving Edenfield, was also withdrawn from service.|$|E

5|$|In late 2013, the Obama Administration {{announced}} a transitional relief {{program that would}} let states and carriers allow non-compliant individual and small group policies to renew {{at the end of}} 2013.

5|$|In the 2010 general election, the Moderate Party {{increased}} {{its share of}} the vote to 30.06%. The Alliance got a majority of votes cast, but with 173 seats no absolute majority in parliament. With the opposition divided mainly by the Sweden Democrats, Reinfeldt could remain in government, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> greater need to seek consensus on matters of substance with the opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials {{have been}} found on Arran, {{although}} not Bute and place name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. On the mainland coast there is cluster of Norse place names around Largs and an ornate silver brooch was found on a hillside near Hunterston that is of likely 7th-century Irish origin <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10th-century runic inscription. Five Hogback monuments found in Govan hint at Scandinavian enclaves inland.|$|E

5|$|Makemake was {{expected}} to have an atmosphere {{similar to that of}} Pluto <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lower surface pressure. However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake passed in front of an 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light. The results showed that Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4â€“12 nanobar on the pressure at its surface.|$|E
