50|$|On {{the other}} hand, very thin bits (such as the twisted <b>wire</b> <b>bits)</b> have a marked {{severity}} over thicker <b>bits.</b> Some <b>wire</b> <b>bits</b> {{may come in}} a thickness as low as 1/16 inch, making them extremely severe {{to the point where}} it is easy for any rider to cut and ruin the horse's mouth, especially the lips. Many horsemen, even the most skilled riders, will not put such a harsh bit in their horse's mouths. Many equestrian organizations do not allow a bit to be 1/4 inch or thinner in diameter.|$|R

5000|$|Contrary to {{ordinary}} coincident-current magnetic-core memory, {{which was used}} for RAM at the time, the ferrite cores in a core rope are just used as transformers. The signal from a word line wire passing through a given core is coupled to the <b>bit</b> line <b>wire</b> and interpreted as a binary [...] "one", while a word line wire that bypasses the core is not coupled to the <b>bit</b> line <b>wire</b> and is read as a [...] "zero". In the AGC, up to 64 wires could be passed through a single core.|$|R

5000|$|Multiply (that is - AND) each bit {{of one of}} the arguments, by each bit of the other, {{yielding}} [...] results.

50|$|After the war, he {{returned}} to Wisconsin and by 1874 had developed a successful wire grain binder.

5000|$|Considered {{by many to}} be Rosenfelds {{most unusual}} creations, his [...] "wire-paintings" [...] {{required}} hours of tedious work.

In this exploration work Wireless LAN innovation running in Ibrahim Group gathering of commercial enterprises Faisalabad has been investigated in term of their equipment, Wireless signal quality, data transmission, auto channel moving, and security in WLAN system. This examination work required physical proving ground, some WLAN system analyzer (TamoSof throughput) software, hardware point of interest, security testing programming.

5000|$|However, since 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.4 (Token Bus) {{send the}} <b>bits</b> over the <b>wire</b> with least {{significant}} bit first, while 802.5 (Token Ring) and 802.6 (FDDI) send the <b>bits</b> over the <b>wire</b> with most significant bit first, confusion may arise where an OUI in the latter scenario is represented with bits reversed from the canonical representation. So for instance, an OUI whose canonical form is [...] could be seen written as [...] if translation is done improperly or inconsistently. The latter form (Bit-Reversed or Noncanonical representation), may also be {{referred to in the}} literature as [...] "MSB format", [...] "IBM format", or [...] "Token Ring format" [...] for this reason.

5000|$|Rosenfeld derived his {{inspiration}} from the common sights he witnessed every day in New York City and worldwide events. In the 1980s, he experimented with different media, for example Rosenfeld was inspired by loose <b>bits</b> of <b>wire</b> he found on the street. He took these loose bits and tacked them to canvas stretchers with carpet tacks. He would then render these wires and tacks into works that would later be known as [...] "wire-pieces" [...] and he explored many shapes, colors, and themes.

50|$|Some early {{computers}} used ordinary relays {{as a kind}} of latch—they store <b>bits</b> {{in ordinary}} <b>wire</b> spring relays or reed relays by feeding an output wire back as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit.
