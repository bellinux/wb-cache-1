2500|$|Precancer Features of EIN (Table I). The {{cells of}} an EIN lesion are genetically {{different}} than normal and malignant tissues, {{and have a}} distinctive appearance under the light microscope. [...] EIN cells are already neoplastic, demonstrating a monoclonal growth pattern and clonally distributed mutations. [...] Progression of EIN to carcinoma, effectively a conversion from a <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasm</b> to a malignant neoplasm, is accomplished through acquisition of additional mutations and accompanied by a change in behavior characterized by the ability to invade local tissues and metastasize to regional and distant sites.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of moles appear {{during the first}} two decades of a person's life, with about one in every 100 babies being born with moles. Acquired moles are a form of <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasm,</b> while congenital moles, or congenital nevi, are considered a minor malformation or hamartoma and may be at a higher risk for melanoma. A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the skin, formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte. The high concentration of the body's pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color. Moles are {{a member of the family}} of skin lesions known as nevi and can occur in all mammalian species especially humans, dogs, and horses.|$|E

We report three cases of intraoral lipoma, two in buccal mucosa and one in labial mucosa.

50|$|Trichoblastomas are a {{cutaneous}} condition {{characterized by}} <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasms</b> of follicular germinative cells.

40|$|Sclerosing hemangiomas of {{the lung}} are <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasms</b> of {{uncertain}} histogenesis. We analysed two cases of sclerosing hemangiomas of the lung with histochemistry and electron microscopy.

Characteristic uniform round cells, unique to this tumor, were found within the stroma in all lesions. In the electron microscopic examination, we found Weibel-Palade bodies like small bodies in the tumor cells. We suspect hypothesis originating in the endothelial cell can not be completely excluded yet. Sclerosing hemangioma is a distinct clinicopathologic entity and should be distinguished from other <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasms</b> or inflammatory lesions of the lung...|$|R

40|$|Mitotic index, nuclear diameter, {{number of}} {{nucleolar}} organizing regions, and Ki- 67 expression, in hair follicle tumors of 82 dogs were evaluated. Tissue specimens {{were used to}} prepare sections for histological staining for number of nucleolar organizing region and immunohistochemical staining for Ki- 67. Tumors were classified as trichoblastoma (n= 32), benign trichoepithelioma (n= 30), pilomatricoma (n= 7), malignant trichoepithelioma (n= 6), infundibular keratinizing acanthoma (n= 5), and tricholemmoma (n= 2). Head, dorsum, and limbs were the most affected sites. Malignant trichoepithelioma presented significantly higher mitotic index, number of nucleolar organizing regions and Ki- 67 expression. Regarding <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasms,</b> trichoblastoma presented significantly higher mitotic index and number of nucleolar organizing regions. Ki- 67 expression did not differ among hair follicle <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasms.</b> Recurrence was only observed in two cases, with one benign trichoepithelioma and one malignant trichoepithelioma. In the two cases, nodules have not been removed with clean surgical margin. It was concluded that in <b>benign</b> <b>neoplasms</b> of hair follicles, the number of nucleolar organizing regions and Ki- 67 expression were significantly smaller than in malignant neoplasm. Clean surgical margins are suggested to be more responsible to tumor recurrences {{than the number of}} nucleolar organizing regions, expression of Ki- 67, and the mitotic index...|$|R
