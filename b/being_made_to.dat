5|$|An Ideal World was {{licensed}} {{for release}} in Mainland China by TriWorks and Zhiyin Magazine and in South Korea by the South Korean branch of Cambridge University Press. Shenjie published the series in Taiwan.

5|$|As {{with many}} English gardens, {{this one is}} at its best in May and June, when the magnolias are in bloom and luxurious plants, such as peonies and alliums, are flowering. An ongoing {{initiative}} is <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> put in plants which provide interest throughout the season or are at their best in the late summer. There are now many species and colours of lavender and plenty of agapanthus, crinum, nerines and day lilies, together with such rarities as a Heptacodium and an Arbutus menziesii.|$|E
5|$|Biko {{endorsed}} {{the unification of}} South Africa's black liberationist groups—among them the BCM, PAC, and African National Congress (ANC)—in order to concentrate their anti-apartheid efforts. To this end, {{he reached out to}} leading members of the ANC, PAC, and Unity Movement. His communications with the ANC were largely via Griffiths Mxenge, and plans were <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> smuggle him out of the country to meet Oliver Tambo, a leading ANC figure. Biko's negotiations with the PAC were primarily through intermediaries who exchanged messages between him and Sobukwe; those with the Unity Movement were largely via Fikile Bam.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{seems to}} have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare. In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his {{successor}} Pepi II, records rich offerings <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC).|$|E

Three sites are {{regularly}} sampled for water quality while devices such as sondes continuously record temperature, conductivity, and pH. Benthic macroinvertebrates are frequently counted and fecal coliform counts are also run.|$|E
5|$|Improvements are <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> Union Station, {{which is}} the busiest {{passenger}} transportation facility in Canada, {{and is expected to}} have its current passenger traffic double in the next 10 to 15 years. Improvements currently underway include a new roof and glass atrium covering the platforms and railway tracks, new passenger concourses, additional staircases and vertical access points and general visual improvements to the station. Other longer term options such as a second downtown station and/or connections to a future Relief Subway Line are also being studied to meet future demand.|$|E
5|$|It was as yet {{too early}} to assume 'night {{cruising}} order.' The enemy could have compelled us to fight before dark, he could have prevented our exercising our initiative, and finally he could have cut off our return to the German Bight. There {{was only one way}} of avoiding this: to inflict a second blow on the enemy with another advance carried through regardless of cost...It also offered the possibility of a last attempt <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> bring help to the hard-pressed , or at least of rescuing her ship's company.|$|E

5|$|Kennan {{opposed the}} {{building}} of the hydrogen bomb and the rearmament of Germany, which were policies encouraged by the assumptions of NSC-68. During the Korean War (which began when North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950), when rumors started circulating in the State Department that plans were <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea, an act that Kennan considered dangerous, he engaged in intense arguments with Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East Dean Rusk, who apparently endorsed Acheson's goal to forcibly unite the Koreas.|$|E
5|$|Leon is {{voiced by}} Paul Haddad in Resident Evil 2, by Paul Mercier in Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil: Degeneration and Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles, and by Matthew Mercer in Resident Evil 6 and Resident Evil: Damnation.

In an interview, he also detailed his interpretation of Leon and talked about the changes <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> the character. In the Resident Evil 2 commercial directed by George A. Romero, Leon was portrayed by Brad Renfro.|$|E
5|$|SBASE, {{along with}} the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, have adopted a zero {{tolerance}} policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400–6000 and up to 30 days community service, the culprits often <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> clean the cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of vandalism by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.|$|E

5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. Warnings about coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities {{that will enable}} {{the remainder of the}} project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed when they have sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are <b>being</b> <b>made</b> <b>to</b> standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E
