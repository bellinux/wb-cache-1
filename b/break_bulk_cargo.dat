5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. <b>Break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers loaded on purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
25|$|While most {{consumer}} goods are transported in containers, other commodities such as petroleum and scrap metal are handled at facilities for marine transfer operations, bulk cargo, and <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> throughout the port, many along its straits and canals.

Diversification of the port facilities during the late-1980s and since, has seen the port to include general and <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargoes,</b> containers and motor vehicle imports, and bulk grain exports.|$|R
5000|$|Tramp-tanker business: {{generally}} this {{is private}} business arranged between the shipper and receiver and {{facilitated by the}} vessel owners or operators, who offer their vessels for hire to carry bulk (dry or liquid) or <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> (<b>cargoes</b> with individually handled pieces) to any suitable port(s) in the world, according to a specifically drawn contract, called a charter party.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, {{there were}} about 20.5million {{intermodal}} containers {{in the world of}} varying types to suit different cargoes. Containers have largely supplanted the traditional <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo</b> – in 2010 containers accounted for 60% of the world's seaborne trade. The predominant alternative methods of transport carry bulk cargo – whether gaseous, liquid or solid – e.g. by bulk carrier or tank ship, tank car or truck. For air freight, the more light-weight IATA-defined unit load device is used.|$|E
25|$|Before containerization, {{goods were}} usually handled {{manually}} as <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo.</b> Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle {{from the factory}} and taken to a port warehouse {{where they would be}} offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved {{to the side of the}} ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and packed by dock workers. The ship might call at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time consuming and unreliable.|$|E
500|$|The {{standard}} ocean-going {{cargo ship}} was the Liberty ship. They were not ideal for logistical purposes. With a maximum speed of , they were slow, {{but this was}} considered less important than their ability to be turned out cheaply and in large numbers. They were deliberately built small, which reduced the loss when one was sunk, but limited the cargo capacity to [...] Critically, their draft was [...] when fully laden. They had five small holds, {{each with its own}} hatch. Their curved sides made them wider at the top than the bottom, and wider amidships than fore and aft. Containerisation of shipping did not begin until a decade after war, so most wartime military shipments were <b>break</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>cargo,</b> with goods in bags, boxes, crates, barrels and drums. This was very efficient in terms of shipping space, but loading and unloading was consequently slow and manpower intensive. It also meant that ships could be unloaded with their own tackle, without special port facilities. Loading a ship was something of an art form. The ideal was to make best use of irregular spaces. Goods had to be stowed so as to wedge everything together tightly, as items that shifted at sea could break open and cause damage to their contents and other items. A load that shifted could even cause the ship to capsize.|$|E

Based on Pareto analysis, Conventional & Logistics Services has the highest number of accidents with 75 % of total number of accidents in year 2014. In this company, the trend analysis of accident keep increasing month by month. In this study using DMAIC approach, the objectives of this study is to improve safety performance by decreasing the number of accident focused on Conventional & Logistics Division by using six sigma approach. Six sigma is a quality tools for process improvement. It involved five phases which using many quality tools to identify problem and improves the process. The data being analysed by using statistical method and graph. As conclusion, the average number of accident decrease from 7. 33 to 7. 25 and the trend analysis shows decline graph compared to before. Based on the hypothesis testing, using the p-value, it was found the shift pattern, safety culture (unsafe act unsafe condition report submission), accidents location, type of activity and contractors have significance impact to number of accident. Meanwhile, number of tonnage handled (productivity) and number of man-hour does not have significance impact to the number of accident. It was also found that there is no significance between numbers of accident happen at night shift, morning shift or afternoon shift. It can be concluded that, the six sigma approach are suitable method to analyse accident and can be a significance approach in determining the root cause of accident in the company...|$|R
