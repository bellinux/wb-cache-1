5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him to do it for free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Slant Magazines William McBee found The Blueprint 3 [...] "predictable", [...] "complacent", and [...] "a hip-hop feast, for sure, {{filled to}} the brim with elite {{production}} and elite rapping, but it lacks the hungriness, the spirit, and the craziness that marks a classic album". Rolling Stones Jody Rosen called it [...] "a catchy, pop-friendly record", but viewed that it lacks the [...] "electric charge" [...] of Jay-Z's previous albums and that he is [...] "stuck for a subject [...] <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> well". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that it [...] "peters out in a mass of indistinct tracks" [...] following its first four songs. The Sunday Times criticized the music's [...] "insistent straining for a crossover, pop-coloured sheen", writing that it [...] "mires much of the album in insipidness, coating stale braggadocio (without, mostly, any compensating humour)." [...] Pitchforks Ian Cohen commented that it is [...] "so certainly Jay-Z's weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if Kingdom Come was somehow underrated". Greg Kot of the Los Angeles Times gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars and viewed Jay-Z's celebrity and older age as somewhat of a flaw, stating: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Upon my word then, I {{never saw}} a fellow so changed in my life. He and I were like brothers, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> would hardly speak to me. Perhaps I ought to have written to him. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it's</b> not settled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don Ippolito {{repaired}} {{the fountain}} for the landlord, {{and he agreed}} to pay for filling the tank that feeds it," [...] said Florida. [...] "He seems to think it a hard bargain, for he only lets it play {{about half an hour}} a day. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it's</b> very ingeniously mended. He didn't believe it could be done. It is pretty.|$|R
6000|$|It did {{not matter}} what the play {{was to have been}} after that; it all turned upon the accident. Juno came on, and began to reproach Jupiter for his carelessness. [...] "I've sent Mercury upstairs for the aynica; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it's</b> no use: that boy won't be able to pass ball for a week. How often have I told you not to sit with your feet out that way! I knew you'd hurt somebody." ...|$|R

5000|$|Mr. Bill {{appeared}} in a Burger King commercial where Mr. Hands tells Mr. Bill that Burger King changed their Whopper. Mr. Bill was upset {{about the loss of}} his favorite burger, but Mr. Hands tells him that the new Whopper was bigger than McDonald's Big Mac or Wendy's Single. Mr. Hands sends Mr. Bill into the restaurant and gives him one. Mr Bill loves the Whopper and asks for another one. Mr. Hands agrees <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it's</b> on him and drops the Whopper box onto Mr. Bill, crushing him.|$|R

6000|$|Choate here--he hasn't got {{anything}} to say, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> just the same, {{and he can}} do it so felicitously, too. I said long ago he was the handsomest man America ever produced. May the progress of civilization always rest on such distinguished men as it has in the past! ...|$|E

'And {{it was for}} {{the sake}} of such a set,' {{proceeded}} Violet; 'there is a bad Chartist spirit among those colliers, and they oppose him in every way; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is his own fault for having neglected them so long, and goes on doing everything for them, though they are as surly and sullen as possible.|$|E
6000|$|Happy Jack {{thought for}} a moment. [...] "Three," [...] <b>he</b> replied, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> didn't <b>say</b> <b>it</b> in a very {{positive}} way. Peter chuckled to himself, for he knew that already doubt was beginning to grow in Happy Jack's mind.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2010, {{regarding}} President Obama, Rockefeller said, [...] "He says 'I'm {{for clean}} coal,' and then <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> in his speeches, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> doesn't <b>say</b> <b>it</b> in here .....

60|$|And Averil {{crept up}} to the little bed: 'Yes, Minna; he is well! He hopes you are bright and happy, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is best you should forget him.' The brow was cold and clammy, the little frame chill and trembling, the arms clasped her neck convulsively. She lifted the child into her own bed, pressed tight to her own bosom, and though no other word passed between the sisters, that contact seemed to soothe away the worst bitterness; and Averil slept from the stillness {{enforced}} on her by the heed of not disturbing Minna's sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Copperfield,' said Traddles, 'I {{have already}} done so, because I begin to feel that I have not only been inconsiderate, but that I have been {{positively}} unjust to Sophy. My word being passed to myself, {{there is no longer}} any apprehension; but I pledge it to you, too, with the greatest readiness. That first unlucky obligation, I have paid. I have no doubt Mr. Micawber would have paid it if he could, but he could not. One thing I ought to mention, which I like very much in Mr. Micawber, Copperfield. It refers to the second obligation, which is not yet due. He don't tell me that it is provided for, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> WILL BE. Now, I think there is something very fair and honest about that!' ...|$|E
50|$|After a fight, {{the press}} {{show up and}} Moral Man takes off to protect his identity, but the press got a full facial {{photograph}} of Ethan as Moral Man. On the roof, Peter Parker tells Ethan they have got a picture of him, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it's</b> okay because his glasses will hide his identity. They go inside and, {{as the two of}} them step out of the elevator, the press surrounds Ethan and want to talk to him. Reed calls Peter to explain that Ethan is a Skrull, whose father created the Super-Skrull, and that Ethan was sent to Earth to conquer it {{in the aftermath of the}} Skrull homeworld's destruction at the hands of Galactus.|$|R
5000|$|In Damon Runyon's short story, [...] "The Lily of St Pierre", {{when the}} narrator criticizes {{the quality of}} the hostesses in Good Time Charley Bernstein's speakeasies, Charley [...] "admits that I may be right, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>it</b> is very {{difficult}} to get any Peggy Joyces for twenty-five bobs per week".|$|R

He can give no opinion, yet, till he discovers what course <b>it</b> has taken; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>it</b> is a {{favourable}} symptom that the pulse is so strong and regular.

6000|$|This is {{the entire}} {{quotation}} brought forward {{to prove that}} somebody previous to three years ago had said the negro {{was not included in}} the term [...] "all men" [...] in the Declaration. How does it do so? In what way has it a tendency to prove that? Mr. Clay says it is true as an abstract principle that all men are created equal, but that we cannot practically apply it in all eases. He illustrates this by bringing forward the cases of females, minors, and insane persons, with whom it cannot be enforced; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is true as an abstract principle in the organization of society as well as in organized society and it should be kept in view as a fundamental principle.

60|$|I cannot {{let this}} story end without {{mentioning}} what the chance saying was which {{caused it to}} be told at the farmhouse the other night. Our friend the young sailor, among his other quaint objections to sleeping on shore, declared that he particularly hated four-post beds, because he never slept in one without doubting whether the top might not come down {{in the night and}} suffocate him. I thought this chance reference to the distinguishing feature of William's narrative curious enough, and my husband agreed with me. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is scarcely worth while to mention such a trifle in anything so important as a book. I cannot venture, after this, to do more than slip these lines in modestly {{at the end of the}} story. If the printer should notice my few last words, perhaps he may not mind the trouble of putting them into some out-of-the-way corner.|$|E
6000|$|... [Footnote 24: The reader {{remembers how}} Wolmar, the atheistic husband of Julie in Rousseau's New Heloïsa, is distressed by the chagrin which his unbelief inflicts on the piety of his wife. 'He {{told me that}} he had been {{frequently}} tempted to make a feint of yielding to her arguments, and to pretend, for the sake of calming her sentiments that he did not really hold. But such baseness of soul is too far from him. Without for a moment imposing on Julie, such dissimulation would only have been a new torment to her. The good faith, the frankness, the union of heart, that console for so many troubles, would have been eclipsed between them. Was it by lessening his wife's esteem for him that he could reassure her? Instead of using any disguise, he tells her sincerely what he thinks, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> in so simple a tone, etc.--V. v. 126.] ...|$|E

40|$|The Victorian Premier, John Brumby, {{has spoken}} about {{introducing}} a US style system for selecting election candidates, giving more choice to Labor voters. Mr Brumby admits that it's a complex proposal <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>it</b> would help encourage participation in democracy.

5000|$|Addressing {{an opinion}} that he {{expected}} amongst his contemporaries about happiness, Aristotle <b>says</b> that <b>it</b> [...] "seems too unfeeling and contrary to people's opinions" [...] to claim that [...] "the fortunes of one's descendants and all one's friends have no influence at all". <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>it</b> seems that if anything at all gets through to the deceased, whether good or the reverse, {{it would be something}} faint and small".|$|R
6000|$|April 1st. I {{went to the}} Temple to my Cozen Roger Pepys, to see {{and talk}} with him a little: who tells me that, with much ado, the Parliament do agree to throw down Popery; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> is with so much spite and passion, and an {{endeavor}} of bringing all Nonconformists into the same condition, that he is afeard matters will not go so well as he could wish.... To my office all the afternoon; Lord! how Sir J. Minnes, like a mad coxcomb, did swear and stamp, swearing that Commissioner Pett hath still the old heart against the King that ever he had, ... and all the damnable reproaches in the world, at which I was ashamed, but said little; but, upon the whole, I find him still a foole, led by the nose with stories told by Sir W. Batten, whether with or without reason. So, vexed in my mind to see things ordered so unlike gentlemen, or men of reason, I went home and to bed.|$|E
6000|$|The {{class of}} men {{represented}} by Vernon Whitford in The Egoist,[47] says, indeed, the true thing, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> stockishly. Vernon is a noble fellow, and makes, by the way, a noble and instructive contrast to Daniel Deronda; his conduct is {{the conduct of}} a man of honour; but we agree with him, against our consciences, when he remorsefully considers [...] "its astonishing dryness." [...] He {{is the best of}} men, but the best of women manage to combine all that and something more. Their very faults assist them; they are helped even by the falseness of their position in life. They can retire into the fortified camp of the proprieties. They can touch a subject and suppress it. The most adroit employ a somewhat elaborate reserve as a means to be frank, much as they wear gloves when they shake hands. But a man has the full responsibility of his freedom, cannot evade a question, can scarce be silent without rudeness, must answer for his words upon the moment, and is not seldom left {{face to face with a}} damning choice, between the more or less dishonourable wriggling of Deronda and the downright woodenness of Vernon Whitford.|$|E
6000|$|Here is the {{peculiar}} perfection of tone and {{truth in the}} nursery tales. The man of science says, [...] "Cut the stalk, and the apple will fall"; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>it</b> calmly, as if the one idea really {{led up to the}} other. The witch in the fairy tale says, [...] "Blow the horn, and the ogre's castle will fall"; but she does not say {{it as if it were}} something in which the effect obviously arose out of the cause. Doubtless she has given the advice to many champions, and has seen many castles fall, but she does not lose either her wonder or her reason. She does not muddle her head until it imagines a necessary mental connection between a horn and a falling tower. But the scientific men do muddle their heads, until they imagine a necessary mental connection between an apple leaving the tree and an apple reaching the ground. They do really talk as if they had found not only a set of marvellous facts, but a truth connecting those facts. They do talk as if the connection of two strange things physically connected them philosophically. They feel that because one incomprehensible thing constantly follows another incomprehensible thing the two together somehow make up a comprehensible thing. Two black riddles make a white answer.|$|E

She would be the best concession they could make to human weakness; she would strike at least this note of showing that it was not going to be quite all--well, all you. Now Ray draws the line at Minnie; he won't stoop to Minnie; he declines to touch, to look at Minnie. When Mr. Bousefield--rather imperiously, I believe--made Minnie a sine quâ non of his retention of his post he said something rather violent, told him to go to some unmentionable place and take Minnie with him. That of course put the fat on the fire. They had really a considerable scene." ...|$|R
