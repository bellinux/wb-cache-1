500|$|The {{character}} had a {{one-night stand}} with George O'Malley, in the second season. Series writer Stacy McKee, said of the sexual encounter: [...] "There’s no turning back. There’s nothing George and Meredith can do. The damage is done – things {{will never be the}} same. They’ve just changed something important in their lives FOREVER and…they are freaking out." [...] Grey's character development has also been known as an influence on the creation of her half-sister, Lexie Grey. Particularly, it has been made clear that they both share the same motives. McKee offered her thoughts: [...] "Meredith and Lexie <b>both</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> succeed. They want to be strong. They want to feel normal. They want, so much, to be whole. But it’s a struggle – a genuine struggle for them. Being hardcore doesn’t come naturally. Sometimes, they have to fake it." [...] Grey's personality has been compared with that of Alex Karev's.

2500|$|Jackson [...] "Jack" [...] Rourke is a fearless street racer and a mechanic, {{who owns}} a garage in San Francisco. He is indebted to the mob as {{he is unable to}} repay them the money for {{starting}} his business. He attempts to hide, but they manage to locate and kidnap him. After escaping an attempt on his life in a car crusher (his first car, a Porsche 911 Carrera 4S), Jack, in desperation, goes to his former girlfriend and his current business partner Sam Harper at a restaurant in Chinatown. She recommends a way out: a massive illegitimate street racing event named [...] "The Run", which is a 3000-mile (4828km) journey across the continental USA, starting in San Francisco and ending in New York City. Sam manages Jack's $250,000 entrance fee for the race and promises him a 10% cut of the $25 million jackpot, but he has to defeat 210 other racers to win. To complicate things, he is in debt to both the police and the criminal organization, and <b>both</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make sure that he never finishes the race.|$|E
2500|$|The {{physical}} {{aspects of}} Lena and Bianca's romance were heavily downplayed by the series. When {{asked if she}} thought she and Riegel had succeeded in living up to the [...] "couple's groundbreaking and progressive" [...] reputation, Sosnovska responded, [...] "Yes, we succeeded to a certain extent. We succeeded in making this couple acceptable." [...] After a pause, Sosnovska continued, [...] "Not acceptable in a realistic sense, since our relationship hasn’t been portrayed truly realistically, {{which would have been}} nice." [...] She described Bianca and Lena's physical relationship as [...] "kind of ostentatiously reserved" [...] compared to what gets shown between heterosexual couples, [...] "although I’m quite shocked by what does get shown between the heterosexual couples." [...] Even though the couple had recently started [...] "dating" [...] again, as the writers also scripted a love triangle including Maggie, there was an apparent double-standard regarding intimacy between the same sex lovers; in the entire year of Lena and Bianca's on-again, off-again relationship, the two women had only kissed twice onscreen. The final obstacles given to the couple's onscreen intimacy were Bianca's rape by Michael and pregnancy with his child, which were controversial and seen by viewers as desperate attempts by the network to avoid lesbian love scenes. AfterEllen.com editor Sarah Warn stated that {{it was a way to}} assure Bianca's continued asexuality. Warn added that [...] "the pregnant-lesbian storyline" [...] is a favorite refuge for television writers who <b>both</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> avoid dealing with the sexual aspects of lesbian relationships and who want to [...] "normalize" [...] the lesbian characters — [...] "to show viewers that, at their core, lesbians are just like heterosexual women — who of course, all want to be mothers". In 2004, though Lena and Bianca were allowed to kiss for a third time onscreen, it came at the end of their romance, as Lena went back to Poland to tend to her ailing mother and the couple was later written to have broken up over the phone.|$|E
