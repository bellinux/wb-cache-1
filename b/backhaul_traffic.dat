Backhauling emerges into an important question since advanced interference mitigation techniques are used to improve the performance {{at the cost of}} higher <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic.</b> In this paper, we provide an efficient method for estimating the <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic</b> when using joint transmission (JT) coordinated multi-point (CoMP). With this technique, a cluster of base stations (BSs) performs joint signal processing to cancel the mutual interference between adjacent cells. The information exchange between the BSs depends on the cluster size that can be very dynamic depending on the actual interference situation at the mobile terminal. We observe that, on average, 2 / 3 of the exchange requires inter-site links. This simplifies the analysis and we can refer to the cluster size distribution to compute the <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic.</b> Results depend on a threshold in the mobility management and on the antenna down-tilt. During busy hours, operators can serve up to 1. 3 Gb/s per cell in 50 MHz bandwidth. <b>Backhaul</b> <b>traffic</b> for JT CoMP can reach 5 and 20 Gb/s per triple-sector site for up- and downstream, respectively...|$|E

30|$|In general, the {{proposed}} method reaches the global optima efficiently, which means lower computational complexity and less <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic,</b> {{compared with the}} centralized solution, and always outperforms the greedy solution and, consequently, the random choice approach. Additionally, the use of different modes of message-passing scheduling does not impact on the solution in terms of sum rate but affects convergence speed and convergence rate. Simultaneous scheduling leads to faster-but-less-often convergence as all the nodes exchange messages. Random scheduling makes the algorithms to converge more frequently and demand more iterations to converge, but less nodes participate in the message-passing procedure. Therefore, {{the choice of the}} message-passing scheduling might depend on the network constraints, such as low latency and limited <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

The realistic 19 -cell hexagonal cellular model relying on unity FR is considered, where both the BSs and the mobile stations (MSs) are equipped with multiple antennas. Local-cooperation-based message passing is used, instead of a global message passing chain for the sake of reducing the <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic.</b> The PDA algorithm is employed as a low-complexity solution for producing soft information, which facilitates the employment of SC at the individual BSs to generate the final soft decision metric. Our simulations and analysis demonstrate that, despite its low additional complexity and <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic,</b> the proposed distributed PDA-aided SC (DPDA-SC) reception scheme significantly outperforms the conventional noncooperative benchmarkers. Furthermore, since only the index of the possible discrete value of the quantized converged soft information has to be exchanged for SC in practice, the proposed DPDA-SC scheme is relatively robust to the quantization errors of the soft information exchanged.

3000|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{multiuser}} detection through base station cooperation in an uplink, interference-limited, high frequency reuse scenario. Distributed iterative detection (DID) is an interference mitigation technique {{in which the}} base stations at different geographical locations exchange detected data iteratively while performing separate detection and decoding of their received data streams. This paper explores possible DID receive strategies and proposes to exchange between base stations only the processed information for their associated mobile terminals. The resulting <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic</b> is considerably {{lower than that of}} existing cooperative multiuser detection strategies. Single-antenna interference cancellation techniques are employed to generate local estimates of the dominant interferers at each base station, which are then combined with their independent received copies from other base stations, resulting in more effective interference suppression. Since hard information bits or quantized log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) are transferred, we investigate the effect of quantization of the LLR values with the objective of further reducing the <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic.</b> Our findings show that schemes based on nonuniform quantization of the [...] "soft bits" [...] allow for reducing the backhaul to 1 – 2 exchanged bits/coded bit.|$|E

Intercell scheduling, which grants a resource exclusively to the ratemaximizing cell within a cluster is a simple and powerful base station cooperation technique that balances non-cooperation and full cooperation.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{multiuser}} detection through base station cooperation in uplink interference limited scenarios. At high frequency reuse, each base station not only receives {{signals from the}} desired user {{but also from the}} co-channel interferers in the neighboring cells.

The detected information bits or their reliability information is passed on from one base station to another, enabling better detection of the received data streams there. Since hard bits or quantized reliability information is transferred the <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic</b> required for cooperation between the base stations is reduced, and is always less than joint detection for a few base stations in cooperation. The proposed strategies are to be used together with joint detection in a cellular network to minimize total <b>backhaul</b> <b>traffic.</b> Different sequential cooperation strategies have been investigated giving better or comparable performance to that of an isolated single user depending upon the amount of backhaul invested...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As the {{increase}} of data traffic {{is expected to grow}} faster than wireless capacity, dealing with congestion is unavoidable in the future. The capacity imbalance between wired and wireless links leaves a bottleneck on the wireless link while traffic keeps coming in through the bigger pipe. In current systems, the dynamics of a wireless channel and the variations in the higher priority real time traffic both make full link utilization impossible. Either the buffers are full, giving a full link but resulting in packet losses in the queues or the link is underutilized. Closed loop credit based flow control can solve this problem by avoiding any buffer overflow completely and providing enough packets in the buffers to ramp up immediately when the channel has remaining capacity. In this paper a model using generalized stochastic Petri nets (SPN) is introduced. By structural analysis the boundedness of memory is proven while a Markov state analysis of the SPN provides numeric performance results. The studied scenario includes two wireless relayed hops, a wired <b>backhaul</b> and <b>traffic</b> class separation.
