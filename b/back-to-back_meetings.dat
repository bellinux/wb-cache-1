50|$|After days of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>meetings</b> {{and intense}} {{negotiations}} into the night, {{four of the}} seven Blue Dog Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Ross, said they resolved their differences with Chairman Henry Waxman of California {{and were able to}} force House leadership to agree on several provisions, namely that the full House would not vote on the legislation until at least September so lawmakers would have time to read the bill and listen to constituents.|$|E

40|$|In many organizations, {{people are}} faced with the task of {{scheduling}} meetings subject to conflicting time constraints and preferences. We are working towards multi-agent scheduling systems in which each person has an agent that negotiates with other agents to schedule meetings. Such agents need to model the scheduling preferences of their users in order to make e#ective scheduling decisions. We consider that a user's preferences over meeting times are of two kinds: static time-of-day preferences, e. g., morning versus afternoon times; and dynamic preferences which change as meetings are added to a calendar, e. g., preferences to schedule <b>meetings</b> <b>back-to-back</b> (i. e. in succession). The dynamic nature of preferences has been understudied in previous work. In this paper, we present an algorithm that e#ectively learns static time-of-day preferences, as well as two important classes of dynamic preferences: back-to-back preferences and spread-out preferences (i. e. preferences for having gaps between meetings) ...|$|R
50|$|In December 2011, the European Council {{stressed}} that the Digital Single Market was an area of growth potential for the European Union. Vice-President Neelie Kroes, the Commissioner for the Digital Agenda, then asked the European Commission to take up this challenge by appointing a national Digital Champion, who could help get every European digital.On 14 February 2012 the European Commission President José Manuel Barroso wrote to Member States {{and asked them to}} take further dedicated action to make the Digital Single Market a reality. One way to do this was to appoint a national Digital Champion.The first meeting of the Digital Champions and Vice-President Kroes was held in Brussels in June 2012. Further meetings were held in Sofia in September 2012 and in Brussels 2013. The Digital Champions convened for the fourth time in Dublin back-to-back with the Digital Agenda Assembly. The Champions fifth and sixth meetings were held in Brussels and their seventh <b>meeting</b> <b>back-to-back</b> to the Digital Action Day on 29 September 2014. The Digital Champions met with European Vice-President Andrus Ansip and European Commissioner Günther Oettinger in February 2015. Their ninth <b>meeting</b> took place <b>back-to-back</b> with the Digital Assembly in Riga in June 2015 and since then they met several times either in Brussels or at subsequent Digital Assemblies.|$|R

50|$|Playing a 20-game {{regular season}} {{schedule}} in 1974 - six games {{longer than the}} NFL's then 14-game slate - the WFL staged no exhibition games (although their teams did participate in preseason scrimmages). The season was to begin on Wednesday, July 10 and end on Wednesday, November 13. This was a 20-game season in 19 weeks --- a schedule accomplished by having double games (primarily Monday and Friday) on Labor Day weekend. Some complained that the schedule was poorly drafted; although most teams played on Wednesday nights with a national TV game slated for Thursday nights, the Hawaiians played their home games on Sunday afternoons. This meant that when the Hawaiians had a home game, they played an opponent who flew to Honolulu after having played just four days earlier. In addition, <b>back-to-back</b> <b>meetings</b> between two teams were common.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{returning}} to Division I-A status for football in 1996, Idaho has rekindled its rivalry with Washington State, eight miles (13 km) {{to the west}} in Pullman. The annual game, usually played at Martin Stadium in Pullman, was renewed in 1998 after just two meetings in two decades, and {{is referred to as}} the [...] "Battle of the Palouse." [...] The Cougars hold an immense advantage in the series (71-16-3, [...] ), but the Vandals did win <b>back-to-back</b> <b>meetings</b> in 1999 and 2000, following 14 straight Cougar victories from 1966-98. The last game played on the Idaho side of the border in this series was in 1966, a mudbath won by WSU late in the fourth quarter. This game followed consecutive Idaho victories in 1964 and 1965, which had been preceded by nine straight Cougar wins. Two of the recent games played in Pullman (1999 and 2001) were designated as Idaho [...] "home games" [...] to help reach existing NCAA minimum attendance requirements. The 2004 game was a designated Idaho home game for revenue purposes. [...] The 2003 game was played in Seattle at Seahawks Stadium. The contests from 2005 on were all WSU home games.|$|E
40|$|The 42 th {{meeting of}} the ICES Working Group on Introductions and Transfers of Marine Organisms (WGITMO) was held in Olbia, Italy, 16 – 18 March 2016, with Anna Occhipinti-Ambrogi as host and Henn Ojaveer as chairperson. Representatives from 19 {{countries}} participated in the meeting. Attendants were from Belgium, Canada, Dennark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States. Sweden contributed by cor-respondence. The objectives of the meeting were to update information and discuss several aspects related to the introductions and transfers of non-indigenous aquatic species. Data and information management {{were two of the}} discussion topics of the meeting, with special focus on the better exploitation of the ‘Information system on aquatic non-indigenous and cryptogenic species’ (AquaNIS). The WGITMO also dedicated time for addressing the MSFD D 2 issues: indicator on new non-indigenous species introduced by human activities, and opportunities and problems related to cross-regional comparison of non-indigenous species indicators. Preparation of the manuscript of the alert report on sea squirt Didemnum vexillum, which is to be published in ICES CRR series, was discussed and the steps to be taken to finalise the report were agreed. As usual, adequate time was devoted to discuss national reports, to exchange of information on the management of NIS and to review ongoing and planned research activities. The approach taken during the meeting facilitated presentations and discussions on the issues of relevance related to the Terms of References as well as on a few generic and strategically-important issues of general relevance to bioinvasions. The meeting began with a full-day joint meeting with the Working Group on Ballast and Other Ship Vectors (WGBOSV), which provided an opportunity to discuss and address issues of common interest, such as shipping and biofouling as introduction vectors. The proposed ICES demonstration advice on ‘Risk management of non-indigenous species associated with shipping in the Arctic’ was discussed, and edits were suggested for both the orientation of the demonstration advice {{as well as for the}} exact questions to be asked. Both working groups agreed that the practice of conducting <b>back-to-back</b> <b>meetings</b> with one joint day is useful and will continue in 2017. All Terms of References to be addressed for 2016 were discussed. For some Terms of Ref-erence, more detailed presentations were given, and a short overview of the information and subsequent discussion is provided herein at the end of each section. This report is structured so that each Term of Reference is dealt with in sequential order. The main body of the report contains summaries of the presentations and discussions with the more detailed documents being contained in the Annexes. WGITMO progressed each of the Terms of Reference by either completing the task or clearly identifying and agreeing on the inter-sessional activities required to still finalise the work in 2016. From 2017, WGITMO will be shifted to multi-annual management...|$|E
