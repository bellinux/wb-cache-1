5|$|Historically the Barnard Run was a seven-mile course {{which began}} at Towler Hill Farm, ran to Cotherstone {{suspension}} bridge, with an undetermined route {{back to the}} school. In 1898 a 4-mile junior Barnard Run was created for 11- to 14-year-olds. In 1904 {{it was decided that}} it would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> training purposes if the run began at the school, and a new course was developed.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes.

He also thought it would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E

5|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the track on 22 February 2010 after {{bobsleigh}} four-man teams from Latvia and Croatia rolled over in supplementary practice. Following a meeting with 11 team captains, practice runs were postponed by the FIBT until later that day to adjust the shape of turn 11 so it would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> sleds to get {{through the rest of the}} track without crashing. FIBT spokesman Don Krone also stated that it was common that turn profiles were changed when it was being used by other sliding disciplines such as luge and skeleton.|$|E
5|$|Barber {{finished}} hubs for {{the four}} coins in September 1883, and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent A. Loudon Snowden had two sets struck and sent to Preston in Washington. Snowden praised {{the beauty of the}} coins, and was happy that Barber had required less relief than needed on US coins of like value, since this meant the coins would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the Mint to strike. Preston sent the coins to Spreckels in San Francisco, and authorized Philadelphia to make additional sets, both for its coin cabinet and for the director's office in Washington. Barber was instructed to make five sets of coining dies for each denomination, to be sent to the San Francisco Mint, with instructions that no coins were to be struck pending a final contract with Spreckels, and that the dies were to remain Hawaiian government property, to be turned over on request.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was straightened and the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E

5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E
5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing {{insufficient}} pre-paid postage had the postage due collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will <b>be</b> <b>easier.</b> <b>For</b> example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, she volunteered for the Union Army as a civilian. The U.S. Army had no female surgeons, and at first she was allowed to practice only as a nurse. During this period, she served at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), July 21, 1861, and at the Patent Office Hospital in Washington, D.C. She worked as an unpaid field surgeon near the Union front lines, including at the Battle of Fredericksburg and in Chattanooga after the Battle of Chickamauga. As a suffragist, she was happy to see women serving as soldiers, and alerted the press to the case of Frances Hook, in Ward 2 of the Chattanooga hospital, a woman who served in the Union forces disguised as a man. Walker was the first female surgeon of the Union army. She wore men's clothing during her work, claiming it to <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> high demands of her work.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E
