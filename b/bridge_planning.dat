5000|$|Design {{considerations}} {{extended to}} the smallest details of the bridge. Slightly larger-than-life statues representing peaceful pursuits were planned for {{the top of each}} pier of the bridge. Sculptor Thomas Hudson Jones was commissioned early in the <b>bridge</b> <b>planning</b> process to design them. The AMBC and CFA agreed that on the side of each pier a 12 ft wide bas-relief disc should be carved featuring an eagle. The border of the disc should be waves, and fasces of equal height should frame the disc to the right and left. Similarly, the keystone of each arch {{on each side of the}} bridge should be inscribed with a bas-relief bison head 6 ft across. The design for the eagles proved controversial. The draft design for the sculptures showed some of the eagles facing right, and some facing left. This was publicly criticized by Lieutenant Colonel Thomas J. Dickson, a retired United States Army chaplain, who argued that left-looking eagles are [...] "Mexican eagles". His public attack on the design led to a public rebuttal from the Army Corps of Engineers, who argued the eagles were ornamental and not heraldic.|$|E
40|$|The {{progress}} on a bridge construction project is inevitably dictated by construction sequence, resource availability and structural adequacy. Most construction planning exercises consider only time, sequence and resource factors. However, in practice, the structural adequacy of a partially formed permanent bridge along with critical temporary facilities is heavily weighted by site engineers, as different construction strategies not only affect the sequencing {{of activities and}} allocation of resources, but also result in changes in requirements for temporary structural supports and in loading performances of permanent structures. An integrated <b>bridge</b> <b>planning</b> approach examines different construction strategies through both the operations management perspective and the structural integrity perspective. To demonstrate the necessity and feasibility of such an integrated analysis method, planning of the Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong was investigated as a case study. The integrated analysis method {{was applied to the}} typical bridge segment erection cycle and the results and findings are reported in the paper. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} on simple log bridge construction practices {{was carried out}} in five forest concession areas scattering in West, Central and South Kalimantan from 1987 to 1989. The purpose is to find current practices, the amount of log/ wood used and problems faced in constructing simple log bridges. It is obvious in the field that government guidance in planning, construction and maintenance of log bridges is still far from satisfaction. It is common to see that (I) the variation in bridge construction is large; (2) bridges are built to the strength far higher than required; (3) too many logs are used in bridge construction; (4) problems Of soil erosion around and under bridges are quite serious; (5) bridges are loaded with unnecessary heavy dirt and/ or gravel which may reduce the effective supporting capacity of stringers; and (6) quite often the bridge was washed out due to low construction. Effective guidance from the government in forest <b>bridge</b> <b>planning,</b> construction and maintenance is strongly needed in order to reduce excessive use of natural resources (logs), to maintain proper bridge function for longer period, and to minimize environmental disturbances. For this purpose, the invo!vement of civil engineers in handling various forest engineering problems and pacing of research activities are urgently needed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Urban {{expansion}} {{has been}} a hot topic {{not only in the}} management of sustainable development but also in the fields of remote sensing and GIS. Urban development is a complicated dynamic process involving in various actors with different patterns of behavior. Modeling an urban development pattern is the prerequisite to understand the process. This paper presents a preliminary spatial framework for such modeling and uses it for the analysis of a rapidly developing city. This framework starts with a multi-scale conceptual model, which aims to theoretically link planning hierarchy, multi-extent analysis and multi-resolution data. The multi-extent data analysis is the focus of this paper, which is divided into three scales: change probability (macro), change density (meso) and change intensity (micro). Multi-extent data analysis aims to seek distinguishing spatial determinants on three scales, which is able to <b>bridge</b> <b>planning</b> system and data scale. The data analysis is based on the integration of change patterns detection method and spatial logistic regression method. The former is utilized for univariate analysis and then hypothesis formation. The latter is employed for systematic modelling of multi-variables. The combination of both is proven to have strong capacity of interpretation. This framework is tested by a case study of Wuhan City, P. R. China. The multi-scale property discovered is helpful for understanding complicated process of urban development.

40|$|The 1935 Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge {{is being}} {{documented}} {{at this time}} to fulfill the requirements of the Memorandum of Agreement regarding the removal of the Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge and the Iowana Farms Milk Company Building for the proposed improvements to Interstate 7 4 in Bettendorf, Iowa, and Moline, Illinois. 1 The 1959 twin suspension bridge will be removed as well, but it was determined to be ineligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Discussion {{of the history of the}} 1959 twin span is included, however, in the current report as part of the overall history of the Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge. Fieldwork for the documentation occurred in November 2009 and October 2010 (Fig. 1). Limitations on photography included limited shoreline access on the Illinois side, making good views of the bridge from the south somewhat challenging. Also, photographs on the bridge deck were not possible because of interstate traffic and prohibitions on pedestrian traffic.

Initial planning, the alternative pathway using a type 2 / 2 UD. In normal conditions, the distribution of traffic flow 70 % for Comal Bridge and 30 % for Juwet Bridge produce a degree of saturation (DS) under 0. 75 {{over the life of the}} plan. In the incidental conditions, the distribution of traffic flow 60 % for Comal Bridge and 40 % for Juwet Bridge, DS value is 0. 81. Assuming then use 2 / 2 type UD with 8 meters wide still used.

40|$|Rural {{accessibility}} is {{a pressing}} issue {{in many parts}} of the world. Improved geographical accessibility to basic social service facilities for rural populations is a goal of most governments in developing countries. Development of a trail-based transport system is a key way to improve rural accessibility in mountainous and rugged terrain where trails criss-cross with numerous rivers. The present study focuses on Nepal, a developing country with rural accessibility challenges and a very challenging physical environment. This thesis reviews the existing accessibility patterns in rural areas of Nepal and proposes various approaches for identifying poorly served geographical areas and optimizing of location of additional new trail bridges to provide “best” links to social services. The methodology in this study is based on the concept of the gravity-based spatial interaction and accessibility models. GIS applications are used in different ways, such as in creating, acquiring, integrating spatial and attribute datasets, and spatial analysis and visualization of the output results. Amongst the different types of social services, health care and education centers are considered the most pressing services and hence are the objects of analysis. The main difference between health care service centers and educational facilities is that schools are usually very widespread across the district and serve for the school age population. Health service centers are sparsely and inequitably distributed, however, they serve the whole population at large. The results of the analysis show a fairly clear indication of problems relating to rural transport and access to social service centers in rural Nepal. This is attributed, in part, due to insufficient provision of social service centers and the lack of trail bridges over river crossing locations. The estimated numbers of trips over potential new bridges based on spatial integration modeling provides a basis for prioritization of river crossing locations for allocation of new trail bridges. The poorly served areas across the study district are identified on the basis of the results of the potential accessibility modeling. The trail network nodes with relatively low accessibility values are of prime concern and the subject of contemplation in the trail <b>bridge</b> <b>planning</b> decision-making process...|$|E
