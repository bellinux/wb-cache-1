5|$|By 1930, {{the college}} 1st VIII had reached its highest {{position}} on the river for thirty years. In 1947, the college chaplain Leslie Cross presented {{a new set of}} oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its highest position in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has been back in the second division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic speed bumps {{differ from}} {{conventional}} speed <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> {{that they only}} activate if a vehicle is traveling above a certain speed. Vehicles traveling below this speed will not experience the discomfort of a conventional speed bump. Dynamic speed bumps may allow the passage of emergency vehicles at higher speeds.|$|E

This implies that square wheels can roll {{perfectly}} smoothly on a road made {{of a series of}} <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> the shape of an inverted catenary curve. The wheels can be any regular polygon except a triangle, but the catenary must have parameters corresponding to the shape and dimensions of the wheels.|$|E
50|$|The elbow bump as a {{greeting}} is also attributed to be a derivative {{of the more}} well known fist <b>bump,</b> beginning <b>in</b> the 1980s. The earliest written record of the elbow bump by David Grimes supports this hypothesis. More recently, Shaquille O'Neal demonstrated the derivative nature of the elbow <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> relation to the fist <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> 2004, when he dismissed Kobe Bryant's greeting with a half-hearted elbow bump.|$|R

25|$|Speed <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> {{some areas}} have been removed after protests by local residents. Such protests cite {{the lack of any}} {{consultation}} as one factor. For example, complaints from Derby residents, prompted the removal of 146 speed bumps from streets at a cost of £460,000. Similar incidents have been reported elsewhere in the UK. UK news sources reported a cyclist being killed in a crash while attempting to avoid a speed bump.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{where the}} quality of the road permitted, the range might be {{extended}} by the use of charrettes (carts). When designed for this trade, with a minimum of weight put into their construction and provision for harnessing the four horses, these vehicles took the name of chasse-marée. As speed was essential, they were normally hauled by two pairs of horses. The vehicle took the form of two wheels, of a diameter large enough to minimize the slowing effect of <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> the road. On their axle was mounted an open rectangular frame within which were slung the baskets holding the fish, packed in seaweed. More baskets were stacked above. The teams of usually fairly small horses were worked hard and changed at posting stations {{in the same way as}} those of mail coaches.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of March12, 1994, a large section of the roof in the {{southern}} end of the Retsof Salt Mine collapsed. The collapsed portion of the mine was located near the hamlet of Cuylerville, located on US20A just south of the mine. One day before the collapse, warning signs were erected at the bridge carrying US20A over nearby Beards Creek due to the presence of <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> the pavement along the bridge approaches. Over the next few weeks, two large sinkholes opened on the surface above the mine, one of them located just south of the US20A bridge over Beards Creek. This sinkhole led to the collapse of a small area of US20A east of the creek and the closure and, ultimately, collapse of the bridge over the creek. As a result, a detour was installed between Leicester and Geneseo. No construction was done on the area for a number of years while a court battle was fought over whether Retsof should reimburse the New York State Department of Transportation to fix the road. The road and new bridge were fixed and reopened in the late 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Medieval: Total War {{received}} very favourable reviews, {{despite a}} few criticisms, gaining high distinction from the industry. GameSpot summarised {{by saying that}} while the game [...] "isn't well suited for the casual gamer", most strategy gamers will [...] "find a lot to like in it, {{for a very long}} time." [...] Although GameSpy described Medieval: Total War as [...] "hit a few <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> the road", they mentioned the game has enough to keep players interested for many months.

[...] This sentiment was re-iterated by executive producer Brad Falchuk, after the characters kissed for the first time. He revealed that their relationship would not run smoothly, and observed that once couples start dating, [...] "Everything goes to hell." [...] Colfer suggested that Kurt returning to McKinley may cause difficulties in their relationship, but noted [...] "Distance makes the heart grow fonder, right? That’s what they tell me. So {{even if they do}} go through some <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> the road, it would be very realistic." [...] In a Q with Billboard on the day [...] "Born This Way" [...] ran with Kurt's McKinley return, Criss stated that Blaine and Kurt were [...] "in the honeymoon stages" [...] of their relationship, and would still be [...] "at the end of the [...] season".|$|E
500|$|The top six {{finishers}} in the Interzonal {{would qualify}} for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, [...] "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen [...] in the tournament I reckon to beat." [...] Despite some <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> the road and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed {{himself to be a}} full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess. Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: [...] "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well". Fischer became the youngest person ever to {{qualify for the}} Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day. [...] "By then everyone knew we had a genius on our hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|His Theology in the Flesh: How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God is {{the first}} book to apply the field of {{cognitive}} linguistics to theology. According to cognitive linguistics, the specific types of bodies humans have shape how we interact with and understand our world. We have concepts such as up/down and in/out because we have bodies that can experience these sorts of things. Embodied experience also gives rise much of our metaphorical thinking. For instance, {{we know what it}} is like to go on a journey in which we experience getting to a destination together and perhaps overcoming obstacles on the way. Many, but not all, languages use the experience physical journeys as the framework in which to understand the experience of love. We say, [...] "Our relationship has come a long way together" [...] and [...] "We have overcome many <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> the road." [...] We reason about our love relationship in terms of a journey. Yet, in English, we also conceive of love in terms of strong physical forces ("He's blown away by love"), magnetism ("She is attracted to him"), and even insanity ("He is crazy about her"). That means that metaphors can be cognitive and not merely rhetorical. We actually think with metaphors.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson often {{discusses}} {{high speed}} driving on public roads, criticising road safety campaigns involving cameras and speed <b>bumps.</b> <b>In</b> 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC director general Greg Dyke {{to complain about}} Clarkson's comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a high speed test track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were [...] "nonsense". Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire. As of 2004 Clarkson was reported as having a clean licence. In a November 2005 Times article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, [...] "On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted {{to reach the top}} speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240 mph," [...] and [...] "From the wheel of a Veyron, France {{is the size of a}} small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn't believe me." [...] In 2007, solicitor Nick Freeman represented Clarkson against a charge of driving at 86mph in a 50mph zone on the A40 road in London, defeating it on the basis that the driver of the car loaned to Clarkson from Alfa Romeo could not be ascertained. In 2008, Clarkson claimed in a talk at the Hay Festival to have been given a speeding ticket for driving at 186mph on the A1203 Limehouse Link road in London.|$|E
