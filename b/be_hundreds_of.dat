5|$|Hospice is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, there may <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of {{regional and national}} corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of hospice agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in hospice facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of hospice providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E

Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, often leading to overdoses. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses. Estonia has {{the highest rate of}} 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.|$|E
25|$|A common {{distinction}} between dams and weirs is that water flows {{over the top}} (crest) of a weir or underneath it {{for at least some}} of its length. Accordingly, the crest of an overflow spillway on a large dam may therefore be referred to as a weir. Weirs can vary in size both horizontally and vertically, with the smallest being only a few inches in height whilst the largest may <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> metres long and many metres tall. Some common weir purposes are outlined below.|$|E

25|$|These {{cetaceans}} {{are highly}} sociable and they regularly form small groups, or pods, that may contain {{between two and}} 25 individuals, {{with an average of}} 10 members. Pods tend to be unstable, meaning individuals tend to move from pod to pod. Radio tracking has even shown belugas can start out in one pod and within a few days <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> miles away from that pod. These pods contain animals of both sexes, and are led by a dominant male. Many hundreds and even thousands of individuals can be present when the pods join together in river estuaries during the summer. This can represent a significant proportion of the total population and is when they are most vulnerable to being hunted.|$|E
25|$|Thomas et al. found {{evidence}} of an accelerated contribution to sea level rise from West Antarctica. The data showed that the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet was discharging 250 cubic kilometres of ice every year, which was 60% more than precipitation accumulation in the catchment areas. This alone was sufficient to raise sea level at 0.24mm/yr. Further, thinning rates for the glaciers studied in 2002–03 had increased over the values measured in the early 1990s. The bedrock underlying the glaciers was found to <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> metres deeper than previously known, indicating exit routes for ice from further inland in the Byrd Subpolar Basin. Thus the West Antarctic ice sheet {{may not be as}} stable as has been supposed.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{can also}} be an {{effective}} way to confine light in structures equal to or smaller than the optical wavelength. This effect is emergent from the confined surface plasmon resonance induced by the resonating light, which, when confined to the surface of a nanostructure such as a gold channel or nanorod, induces electromagnetic resonance. Surface plasmon effects are strong in the visible range because the permittivity of a metal is very large and negative at visible frequencies. At frequencies higher than the visible range, the permittivity of a metal is closer to zero, and the metal stops being useful for focussing electric and magnetic fields. This effect was originally observed in radio and microwave engineering, where metal antennas and waveguides may <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> times smaller than the free-space wavelength. In the same way, visible light can be constricted to the nano level with metal structures which form channels, tips, gaps, etc. Gold is also a convenient choice for nanofabrication because of its unreactivity and ease of use with chemical vapour deposition.|$|E

500|$|Like other calderas, Silverthrone {{formed as}} a result of {{emptying}} the magma chamber beneath the volcano. If enough magma is erupted, the emptied chamber {{will not be able to}} support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it. A roughly circular fracture—a [...] "ring fault"—develops around the edge of the chamber. These ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions that are also known as ring dikes. Secondary volcanic vents may form above the ring fracture. As the magma chamber empties, the center of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse. The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption, or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions. The total area that collapses may <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> thousands of square kilometers.|$|E

The deepest parts of the ocean mix very slowly with the surface waters, and the mixing is uneven. The main mechanism that brings deep water to the surface is upwelling, which is more common in regions closer to the equator. Upwelling is also influenced by factors such as the topography of the local ocean bottom and coastlines, the climate, and wind patterns. Overall, the mixing of deep and surface waters takes far longer than the mixing of atmospheric [...] with the surface waters, and as a result water from some deep ocean areas has an apparent radiocarbon age of several thousand years. Upwelling mixes this [...] "old" [...] water with the surface water, giving the surface water an apparent age of about several hundred years (after correcting for fractionation). This effect is not uniform– the average effect is about 440 years, but there are local deviations of several hundred years for areas that are geographically close to each other. The effect also applies to marine organisms such as shells, and marine mammals such as whales and seals, which have radiocarbon ages that appear to <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> years old.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Sussex beat Somerset at the ground, in a {{match that}} once again drew a crowd of around 5,000. The Yorkshire Evening Post {{described}} the wicket as [...] "crumbling" [...] {{towards the end of}} the match, favouring the bowlers. In 1938 Hampshire visited, and the report in the Western Daily Press lamented the state of the wicket, which meant that the game, like the three first-class matches at the ground before it, was completed in two days, rather than the scheduled three. That winter, a new pavilion costing £550 was erected on the ground for the shared use of the cricket club and the rugby club. The final first-class match on the ground was played in July 1939 against Lancashire, but torrential rain limited the match to only three hours of play. The takings for the full three days of the match were only £87, and the Taunton Courier estimated that the losses for the match could <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> pounds. Despite the weather, almost 2,000 people attended the match, and the Taunton Courier report praised the alterations that had been made to the ground; the removal of a hedge made the ground lighter, while the ground itself had been well looked after, and drained quickly. The Second World War suspended the County Championship from 1940 to 1945, and during that time, Westland Aircraft took over the ground to expand their factory, and informed Yeovil Cricket Club that it was no longer available, forcing them to search for a new ground in 1946. They eventually relocated to the newly opened Johnson Park in 1948. The rugby club also moved to Johnson Park, amalgamating itself into Yeovil Sports Club. After a short break, Somerset County Cricket Club returned to Yeovil, playing fourteen fixtures at Johnson Park between 1951 and 1970, and eight matches at Westlands Sports Ground from 1971 to 1978.|$|E
500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit told me that there must <b>be</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society we are still in denial about that hard truth".|$|E
