25|$|When {{physically}} sorting objects, such as alphabetizing papers (such as {{tests or}} books), people intuitively generally use insertion sorts for small sets. For larger sets, people often first bucket, such as by initial letter, and multiple <b>bucketing</b> allows practical sorting of very large sets. Often space is relatively cheap, such as by spreading objects {{out on the}} floor or over a large area, but operations are expensive, particularly moving an object a large distance – locality of reference is important. Merge sorts are also practical for physical objects, particularly as two hands can be used, one for each list to merge, while other algorithms, such as heap sort or quick sort, are poorly suited for human use. Other algorithms, such as library sort, a variant of insertion sort that leaves spaces, are also practical for physical use.|$|E
60|$|A direct {{hammering}} was {{all that}} the Brigadier had dared to hope for, considering {{the size of the}} force at his disposal; but men who stand or fall by the errors of their opponents may be forgiven for turning Chance into Design. The <b>bucketing</b> went forward merrily. The Afghan forces were upon the run - the run of wearied wolves who snarl and bite over their shoulders. The red lances dipped by twos and threes, and, with a shriek, uprose the lance- butt, like a spar on a stormy sea, as the trooper cantering forward cleared his point. The Lancers kept between their prey and the steep hills, for all who could were trying to escape from the valley of death. The Highlanders gave the fugitives two hundred yards' law, and then brought them down, gasping and choking ere they could reach the protection of the boulders above. The Goorkhas followed suit; but the Fore and Aft were killing on their own account, for they had penned a mass of men between their bayonets and a wall of rock, and the flash of the rifles was lighting the wadded coats.|$|E

After Silkworth and seven others were indicted in late May 1924 for {{connection}} with the bankruptcy of Raynor, Nicholas & Truesdell, Silkworth pleaded not guilty on May 29, 1924 while held on $8,500 on bail. Trial was set for August. On November 29, 1924, Silkworth was convicted of the fraudulent use of mails in <b>bucketing</b> operations, as well as five others also found guilty of <b>bucketing.</b> In particular, Silkworth was convicted of mail fraud relating to his brokerage and the brokerage house of Raynor, Nicholas and Truesdell in 1922. During the appeal process, McCoy gave testimony before the Circuit Court of Appeals that Raynor, Nicholas & Truesdell had engaged in extensive <b>bucketing</b> operations since its founding late 1920. McCoy further testified that Silkworth had provided the firm's <b>bucketing</b> operations with the protection of Consolidated. The Judge ruled against the motion raised by defendants, which was that <b>bucketing</b> {{did not have a}} Federal statute against it at the time, and ruled in favor of McCoy on February 1, 1926 with the November conviction upheld. Silkworth served three months of a year sentence in 1926, with other brokers also serving time.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the term bucket shop {{has nothing to do}} with {{financial}} markets, as the term originated from England in the 1820s. During the 1820s, street urchins drained beer kegs which were discarded from public houses. The street urchins would take the dregs to an abandoned shop and drink them. This practice became known as <b>bucketing,</b> and the location at which they drained the kegs became known as a bucket shop. The idea was transferred to illegal brokers because they too sought to profit from sources too small or too unreliable for legitimate brokers to handle. The term bucket shop came to apply to low-class pseudo stock brokerages that did not execute trades.|$|E
