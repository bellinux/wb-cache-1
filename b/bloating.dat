5|$|Up to 85% {{of people}} {{infected}} with H. pylori never experience symptoms or complications. Acute infection may appear as an acute gastritis with abdominal pain (stomach ache) or nausea. Where this develops into chronic gastritis, the symptoms, if present, are often those of non-ulcer dyspepsia: stomach pains, nausea, <b>bloating,</b> belching, and sometimes vomiting or black stool.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, <b>bloating,</b> gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E

40|$|In large {{flexible}} software systems, <b>bloat</b> {{occurs in}} many forms, causing excess resource utilization and resource bottlenecks. This results in lost throughput and wasted joules. However, mitigating <b>bloat</b> is not easy; efforts are best applied where savings would be substantial. To aid this we develop an analytical model establishing {{the relation between}} bottleneck in resources, <b>bloat,</b> performance and power. Analyses with the model places into perspective results from the first experimental study of the powerperformance implications of <b>bloat.</b> In the experiments we find that while <b>bloat</b> reduction can provide as much as 40 % energy savings, the degree of impact depends on hardware and software characteristics. We confirm predictions from our model with selected results from our experimental study. Our findings show that a software-only view is inadequate when assessing the effects of <b>bloat.</b> The impact of <b>bloat</b> on physical resource usage and power should be understood for a full systems perspective to properly deploy <b>bloat</b> reduction solutions and reap their power-performance benefits. 1...|$|R
40|$|Framework based {{software}} {{tends to}} get <b>bloated</b> by accumulating optional features (or concerns) just-in-case they are needed. The {{good news is that}} such feature <b>bloat</b> need not always cause runtime execution <b>bloat.</b> The bad news is that often enough, only a few statements from an optional concern may cause execution <b>bloat</b> that may result in as much as 50 % runtime overhead. We present a novel technique to analyze the connection between optional concerns and the potential sources of execution <b>bloat</b> induced by them. Our analysis automatically answers questions such as (1) whether a given set of optional concerns could lead to execution <b>bloat</b> and (2) which particular statements are the likely sources of <b>bloat</b> when those concerns are not required. The technique combines coarse grain concern input from an external source with a fine-grained static analysis. Our experimental evaluation highlights the effectiveness of such concern augmented program analysis in execution <b>bloat</b> assessment of ten programs...|$|R
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, <b>bloating,</b> feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E
5|$|Endoparasites {{known to}} infect wolves include {{protozoan}}s and helminths (flukes, tapeworms, roundworms and thorny-headed worms). Of 30,000 protozoan species, {{only a few}} have been recorded to infect wolves: Isospora, Toxoplasma, Sarcocystis, Babesia, and Giardia. Wolves may carry Neospora caninum, which is of particular concern to farmers, as the disease can be spread to livestock, with infected animals being 3–13 {{times more likely to}} miscarry than those not infected. Among flukes, the most common in North American wolves is Alaria, which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves. Upon reaching maturity, Alaria migrates to the wolf's intestine, but harms it little. Metorchis conjunctus, which enters wolves through eating fish, infects the wolf's liver or gall bladder, causing liver disease, inflammation of the pancreas, and emaciation. Most other fluke species reside in the wolf's intestine, though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs. Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves, as their primary hosts are ungulates, small mammals, and fish, which wolves feed upon. Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves, though this depends on the number and size of the parasites, and the sensitivity of the host. Symptoms often include constipation, toxic and allergic reactions, irritation of the intestinal mucosa, and malnutrition. Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities, as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas. Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species, though most roundworm infections appear benign, depending on the number of worms and the age of the host. Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host's blood, and can cause hyperchromic anemia, emaciation, diarrhea, and possibly death. Toxocara canis, a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero, can cause intestinal irritation, <b>bloating,</b> vomiting, and diarrhea. Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks, which infects the kidneys, and can grow to lengths of 100cm. D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney's functional tissue, and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected. Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects, though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy. Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates. Although T. spiralis isn't known to produce clinical signs in wolves, it can cause emaciation, salivation, and crippling muscle pains in dogs. Thorny-headed worms rarely infect wolves, though three species have been identified in Russian wolves: Nicolla skrjabini, Macrocantorhynchus catulinus, and Moniliformis moniliformis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bloat</b> {{is a form}} of {{indigestion}} {{marked by}} an excessive accumulation of gas in the rumen. Immediately after cattle consume a meal, the digestive process creates gases in the rumen. Most of the gases are eliminated by eructation (belching).

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{empirical}} modeling using Genetic Programming (GP), {{it is important to}} evolve solution with good generalization ability. Generalization ability of GP solutions get affected by two important issues: <b>bloat</b> and over-fitting. <b>Bloat</b> is uncontrolled growth of code without any gain in fitness and important issue in GP. We surveyed and classified existing literature related to different techniques used by GP research community {{to deal with the issue}} of <b>bloat.</b> Moreover, the classifications of different <b>bloat</b> control approaches and measures for <b>bloat</b> are discussed. Next, we tested four <b>bloat</b> control methods: Tarpeian, double tournament, lexicographic parsimony pressure with direct bucketing and ratio bucketing on six different problems and identified where each <b>bloat</b> control method performs well on per problem basis. Based on the analysis of each method, we combined two methods: double tournament (selection method) and Tarpeian method (works before evaluation) to avoid <b>bloated</b> solutions and compared with the results obtained from individual performance of double tournament method. It was found that the results were improved with this combination of two methods. Comment: 15 page...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of software <b>bloat</b> in large flexible software systems can hurt energy efficiency. However, identifying and mitigating <b>bloat</b> is fairly effort intensive. To enable such efforts {{to be directed}} {{where there is a}} substantial potential for energy savings, we investigate the impact of <b>bloat</b> on power consumption under different situations. We conduct the first systematic experimental study of the joint power performance implications of <b>bloat</b> across a range of hardware and software configurations on modern server platforms. The study employs controlled experiments to expose different effects of a common type of Java runtime <b>bloat,</b> excess temporary objects, {{in the context of the}} SPECPower ssj 2008 workload. We introduce the notion of equi-performance power reduction to characterize the impact, in addition to peak power comparisons. The results show a wide variation in energy savings from <b>bloat</b> reduction across these configurations. Energy efficiency benefits at peak performance tend to be most pronounced when <b>bloat</b> affects a performance bottleneck and non-bloated resources have low energy-proportionality. Equiperformance power savings are highest when <b>bloated</b> resources have a high degree of energy proportionality. We develop an analytical model that establishes a general relation between resource pressure caused by <b>bloat</b> and its energy efficiency impact under different conditions of resource bottlenecks and energy proportionality. Applying the model to different “what-if ” scenarios, we predict the impact of <b>bloat</b> reduction and corroborate these predictions with empirical observations. Our work shows that the prevalent software-only view of <b>bloat</b> is inadequate for assessing its power-performance impact and instead provides a full systems approach for reasoning about its implications...|$|R

25|$|Patients who {{complain}} of <b>bloating</b> frequently {{can be shown}} to have objective increases in abdominal girth, often increased throughout the day and then resolving during sleep. The increase in girth combined {{with the fact that}} the total volume of flatus is not increased led to studies aiming to image the distribution of intestinal gas in patients with <b>bloating.</b> They found that gas was not distributed normally in these patients: there was segmental gas pooling and focal distension. In conclusion, abdominal distension, pain and <b>bloating</b> symptoms are the result of abnormal intestinal gas dynamics rather than increased flatus production.|$|E

40|$|Twelve ruminally {{cannulated}} Holstein steers {{were used}} to determine the effect of monensin (0, 20, 30, and 40 g/ton) on grain <b>bloat.</b> Steers were fed a bloat-provocative, high-grain diet at 1 % of body weight twice daily. Monensin premix was added directly to individual steers diets at the time of feeding. The severity of <b>bloat</b> was scored daily on a scale of 0 (no <b>bloat)</b> to 5 (severe <b>bloat).</b> The scoring was based on the degree of frothiness and abdominal distention. <b>Bloat</b> scores (mean of wk 2, 3, and 4) were lower (P<. 0 l) for monensin-fed steers than for the controls. The mean <b>bloat</b> scores were 1. 43, 1. 18, 1. 00, and. 93 for 0, 20, 30 and 40 g/ton monensin, respectively. Total gas production during in vitro ruminal fermentation tended to be higher (P=. 12) for control than for monensin-fed steers.

40|$|Most {{earnings}} restatements are {{blamed on}} error, or misunderstanding of GAAP, but suspicion persists {{that many of}} these restatements are instead due to intentional earnings management. We analyze balance sheet <b>bloat,</b> or unusually high levels of working capital account balances, for evidence of sustained, income-increasing earnings management "prior" to initial non-GAAP financial reports. We establish a pattern of systematically increasing balance sheet <b>bloat</b> for firms later issuing clearly fraudulent financial reports. Next, we compare <b>bloat</b> for apparently non-fraud restatements to fraud and control samples. We find non-fraud restatement companies' <b>bloat</b> is higher than control companies for two years preceding the initial misstated financial report. But, these firms accumulate less balance sheet <b>bloat</b> than companies with restatements clearly involving fraud. This suggests meaningful, but not pervasive, earnings management underlying even apparently non-fraudulent restatements. We extend our analysis to discretionary accruals and real activity earnings management. Copyright (c) 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R
