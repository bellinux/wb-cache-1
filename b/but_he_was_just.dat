25|$|He {{moved across}} to {{the first and third}} balls he {{received}} from McGrath and flicked them over his shoulder to fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> unable to complete the job, and his team lost by one run. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes did win him respect, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.|$|E
500|$|When he {{graduated}} from high school in 1997, Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6' 1". He was recruited by two Division I schools: Butler University and his ultimate choice, the University of Cincinnati (UC)—an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis' longtime idol, Sandy Koufax, and had just finished a 12–46 season. UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp. [...] "I looked at him and said, Well, we need somebody", said Cleary. [...] "I'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> better than what we had." ...|$|E
500|$|Keenor's {{abilities}} {{were described}} as scant. A 'terrible' shot and unable to reliably run with the ball, his strength lay in {{his commitment to the}} cause and in his uncompromising tackling. Fred Stewart, who coached Keenor for over 15 years at Cardiff City stated [...] "I honestly do not believe the word [...] "beaten" [...] is in his vocabulary." [...] Former team mate, Ernie Curtis said of him: [...] "He was one of the hardest tacklers in the game, some said he was dirty <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> hard. Nobody took liberties with old Fred... could run all night, he couldn't run with the ball mind you, but he could run all day." [...] Charlie Buchan, captain of the opposing Arsenal side in the 1927 FA Cup final, described Keenor as having [...] "a store of energy (that) seemed inexhaustible in defending his goal". His hard tackling style made him a target for opposition fans, even being assaulted after a match for Crewe Alexandra during the later years of his career after a physical performance against an opposition side angered some of their fans.|$|E
50|$|Brizell plays as a full-back, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as {{comfortable}} attacking as <b>he</b> <b>is</b> defending.|$|R

50|$|Mr. Pendanski: In Group D at Camp Green Lake Mr. Pendanski is in charge. Mr. Pendanski {{may seem}} friendly, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as mean as the Warden and Mr. Sir. He never stops {{making fun of}} Zero.|$|R
2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{the same}} in England and even his {{long-term}} friend Lord Harris agreed that [...] "his gamesmanship added to the fund of stories about him". The point was that Grace [...] "approached cricket {{as if he were}} fighting a small war" [...] and he was [...] "out to win at all costs". The Australians understood this twenty years later when Joe Darling, touring England {{for the first time in}} 1896, said: [...] "We were all told not to trust the Old Man as he was out to win every time and was a great bluffer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{shot was}} {{developed}} by Zimbabwean batsman Dougie Marillier. In a triangular tournament in Australia with Zimbabwe, Australia and West Indies, Zimbabwe played their final match with Australia and Marillier got a chance in the team. He could hardly have had a more testing experience, as a fine Zimbabwe batting performance after Australia scored 303 meant that he came in at number seven needing to score 15 to win the match in the final over, {{which was to be}} bowled by Glenn McGrath. [...] Marillier moved across to the first and third balls he received from McGrath and flicked them over his shoulder to fine leg for boundaries, reviving hopes of an incredible Zimbabwe victory. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> unable to complete the job, and his team lost by two runs. His two courageous and unorthodox boundary strokes made him famous, with the shot becoming known as the Marillier shot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{works of}} Niccolò Machiavelli, such as The Prince, were {{considered}} a guideline for {{the behavior of}} a king in Frederick's age. In 1739, Frederick finished his Anti-Machiavel, an idealistic refutation of Machiavelli. It was written in French and published anonymously in 1740, but Voltaire distributed it in Amsterdam to great popularity. Frederick's years dedicated to the arts instead of politics ended upon the 1740 death of Frederick William and his inheritance of the Kingdom of Prussia. [...] Frederick and his father were more or less reconciled at the latter's death, and Frederick later admitted, despite their constant conflict, that Frederick William had been an effective ruler: [...] "What a terrible man he was. [...] <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just,</b> intelligent, and skilled in the management of affairs... it was through his efforts, through his tireless labor, that I have been able to accomplish everything that I have done since." ...|$|E
50|$|Izumo wears {{glasses and}} has black hair, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> more polite than his {{counterpart}} <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as dangerous, with his mastery of bombs. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> also {{more of a}} devout fan of Loria than his counterpart is.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never lie to him, and {{he ought}} to know that. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the man to be harder to his own son than to {{anybody else in the}} world. What does he want me to do now?" ...|$|R
50|$|When wealthy Lucille Ainsworth {{is found}} strangled on Hampstead Heath, Detective Inspector Marshall {{is put on}} the case. Lucille's husband Robert {{suspected}} her of being unfaithful, and had <b>been</b> following her. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> one of many suspects with a motive for murder.|$|R
2500|$|... "playing {{with him}} was just frightening. It's a bit like an amateur guitar player from a back street who has just bought a Spanish guitar, working with Segovia. He didn't make you feel small, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> so perfect in what he did.... I still {{remember}} watching him singing, but he would accompany himself on the alto, and you were convinced he was playing the alto while he was singing.... the breath hadn't gone from his last word before he was playing his alto {{and it seemed to}} be simultaneous.... He got a very raw deal from history... In the Chick Webb band there were two regular singers – Ella [...] and Louis Jordan. And yet really history has consigned him to just being a comedy vocal thing with a bit of rock and roll, and the first alto... but he was such a consumately good singer that it's sad that he wasn't known more for it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Hum!' murmured the curate; {{there was}} really nothing {{questionable}} in that, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> slightly prejudiced against a man who made such a quotation; it sounded a little priggish.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said the}} diplomatist, [...] "there's nothing like knowing just when to produce your dignity. There are some {{officials}} who know too little,-- like those guards; {{and there are}} some who know too much,--like the commissary's superiors. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> in that golden mean of ignorance where he supposes a consul is a person of importance." ...|$|R
50|$|She {{likes her}} subordinate, Assistant Inspector Junichiro Izumida, and often shows it through her actions such as taking him {{along with her}} {{wherever}} she goes, finding ways {{to spend time with}} him even during his day off and sometimes asking him to spend the night at her place. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> too dense, or too aggravated, to notice it.|$|R
60|$|Mel. How charming is the French air! {{and what}} an etourdi bête {{is one of}} our untravelled islanders! When he would make his court to me, let me die <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> Æsop's ass, that would imitate the courtly French in his addresses; but, instead of those, comes pawing upon me, and doing all things so mal a droitly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dropped into}} the seat {{opposite}} and stared at him. If any other lad had said it I should have known it was only foolishness, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the sort to mean it.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{felt his}} plight and recent panic were hardly patrician," [...] replied the priest, [...] "so {{he tried to}} keep the name back at first. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> going to tell it you, when"--and Father Brown looked down at his boots--"when a woman found another name for him." ...|$|E
60|$|His lordship followed, bonelessly. Molly {{watched them}} go, and {{wondered}} more than ever. There was something behind this. It {{was not merely}} the breaking-off of the engagement that had roused Sir Thomas. He was not a just man, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{enough to be able}} to see that the blame was not Lord Dreever's. There had been something more. She was puzzled.|$|E

50|$|Masanori is Kōichirō's best male friend, and is {{a fellow}} first-year student at Aikyō. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> a skinhead and has a strong build. Due to this, he appears as though he would {{fit in with the}} Japanese Yakuza, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> {{impulsive}} by nature. He has a younger sister named Koyori that he dots on constantly due to his sister complex and lolicon behavior.|$|R
50|$|A huge {{welcome home}} {{ceremony}} {{is held in}} Bedrock {{for the return of}} Fred, now considered a hero, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> grateful to <b>be</b> back home with his family (after the restaurant mishap is cleared), who head on a secret getaway. Unfortunately, Roberta and Mario secretly moved into Bedrock, and they chased Fred all over town, much to the confusion of Wilma, Betty, and Barney.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{thought the}} general idea {{was a good}} one; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a trifle {{uncertain}} {{as to how the}} blind horse would get along on such uneven ground. However, he said nothing, lest his companions should think he was afraid to make the attempt; and when Ben and Bob proceeded to mark out a ring, he advised them as to its size.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope Geraldine's {{going to}} be sensible," [...] he said. [...] "I've always {{maintained}} that Thomson was a fine fellow, only Geraldine seemed rather carried away by that young Granet. Poor fellow! One can't say anything about him now, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the ordinary type of showy young soldier, not fit to hold a candle to a man like Thomson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Back out of {{this and}} drive to Dover Street," [...] he directed. The man obeyed him. People raced {{to look through the}} window at him. The other commotion had died away,--the man in the road had got up and walked off. A {{policeman}} came hurrying along <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> too late. Very soon {{they were on their way}} down Holborn. Once more Laverick had escaped.|$|E
40|$|Appended {{memorandum}} gives correct {{picture of}} German situation; after Munich, radical Nazi leaders {{decided to go}} ahead with their program instead of consolidating their position; more conservative German element has been banking on [Hermann] Goering gaining control of Party; Goering more reasonable than other leaders, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> as much committed to social and political objectives of the regime as the most radical...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> {{outside the}} wall. He has ridden up to Jerusalem on an ass, with a {{multitude}} before and behind; and some, poor dupes, have hailed {{him as he}} passed as King of Israel. That finally is the pretext with which Hanan will compel Pilate. Truly, though not yet taken, the sentence is already written. This fisherman is a dead man." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, of course, he doesn't. He has a {{very high}} ideal of women; <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> running on, in the usual way.

The only thing is that so few of them have the strength. That's what he meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy {{had laughed}} at Peter Rabbit {{for being so}} anxious for Summer to arrive, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as glad as Peter that she had come, {{although}} he wouldn't have said so for the world.

As he walked he talked, quite to himself of course, because there was nobody near to hear, {{and this is what}} he was saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to every kind of mischief, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as unselfish and kind as he could be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour, and I never {{to see him again}} in this world, never, never, never, poor abused boy!" [...] And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would break.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Four-and-twenty <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the {{age that}} young-looking girls like to boast of.
