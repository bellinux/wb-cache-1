At that time, Major Dan Nash and Lieutenant Colonel Tim Duffy had air defense alert duty for the 102d. At 8:40am Colonel Bob Marr, a Massachusetts Air National Guardsman serving as NORAD's Northeast Air Defense Sector commander, learned from the FAA that American Airlines Flight 11 might have been hijacked. The two pilots immediately suited up and headed for their F-15s. Marr ordered Nash and Duffy into the air; their F-15s were airborne within six minutes and as directed, headed for New York City, 153 miles away. Unknown to the pilots, American Airlines Flight 11 had crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City just as Colonel Marr was delivering his order. Meanwhile, at 8:43am, the FAA {{reported a}}nother possible hijacking to the Northeast Air Defense Sector. That was Boston to Los Angeles United Airlines Flight 175. At 9:02am, with the F-15s still 71 miles away, that plane crashed into the World Trade Center's South Tower.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{types of}} BJT {{function}} by letting a small current input to the <b>base</b> <b>control</b> an amplified output from the collector. The {{result is that}} the transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the NPN transistor in what is called active mode, the base–emitter voltage [...] and collector–base voltage [...] are positive, forward biasing the emitter–base junction and reverse-biasing the collector–base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector–base junction. For a figure describing forward and reverse bias, see semiconductor diodes.|$|E

The actions of the motor system are organized by information about the environment and information about {{the current state of}} the agent. Information <b>based</b> <b>control</b> strategies often treat the environment and the organism as a single system, with action proceeding as a natural consequence of the interactions of this system. A core assumption of information <b>based</b> <b>control</b> strategies is that perceptions of the environment are rich in information and veridical for the purposes of producing actions.

It is designed to provide efficient spooling, scheduling, and management facilities for the MVS operating system. By separating job processing into a number of tasks, MVS operates more efficiently. At any point in time, the computer system resources are busy processing the tasks for individual jobs, while other tasks are waiting for those resources to become available. In its most simple view, MVS divides the management of jobs and resources between the JES and the <b>base</b> <b>control</b> program of MVS. In this manner, the JES manages jobs before (i.e., during the reading and scheduling phases) and after the completion of running the program (i.e., the printing, punching and purging phases); the <b>base</b> <b>control</b> program manages them during processing, usually without any specific knowledge of JES.|$|E

IAF used Mysteres flying at slow speed as bait to lure Sabres to attack where the waiting Gnats will take them on. Two sabres were scrambled but one had to turn back without entering the fight when the pilot couldn't jettison the fuel tanks. The other one flown by Flt Lt Yusaf Ali Khan, spotted the IAF planes and tried positioning himself behind them before attacking. Just as he got his cross-hairs on them he felt thuds on his own jet, as he was surrounded {{in a cloud of}} Gnats repeatedly being attacked. A Lockheed F-104 Starfighter lurking in the area was pointed to the dog fight by <b>base</b> <b>control</b> along with scrambling another one from base. The first Starfighter crossed through the dog fight at super sonic speed. The Gnats after scoring a kill started egressing. IAF's Squadron Leader Trevor J. Keelor of No. 23 Squadron claimed to have shot down the F-86 Sabre on that day (September 3), claiming the first air combat victory for the IAF of the war and subsequently received the Vir Chakra and the title of 'Sabre Slayer'. However the sabre he 'shot down' was flown in badly damaged condition and somehow rough landed back at the base. The Sabre pilot, Flt Lt Yusaf Ali Khan, was given Sitara-e-Jurat for surviving dog fight with six Gnats (while his wingman was ordered to leave since he couldn't jettison his fuel tanks) and bringing the damaged Sabre back home. In the same incident, an IAF Gnat pilot was overheard warning others of the incoming Starfighter. [...] Also, a Gnat piloted by Squadron Leader Brij Pal Singh Sikand, mistakingly landed at an abandoned airstrip in Pasrur, when he thought he had safely crossed the border. His takeoff attempt was aborted due to presence of a Pakistan army jeep on the runway. He was taken POW and later handed over to PAF. A Lockheed F-104 Starfighter flown by Flt Lt Hakimullah Khan chasing in at super sonic speed was also credited with forcing the Gnat down. This Gnat is displayed as a war trophy in the Pakistan Air Force Museum, Karachi. after it was flown from Pasrur by Sqn Ldr Saad Hatmi who flew the captured aircraft back to Sargodha, and later tested and evaluated its flight performance, was of the personal view that Gnat was no 'Sabre Slayer' when it came to dog fighting.|$|E

It is critical to develop general methods for data dimension reduction, effective monitoring algorithms for {{intrusion detection}}, and means for their performance improvement. This dissertation is motivated by the timely need to develop statistics-based machine learning methods for effective detection of computer network anomalies. Three fundamental research issues related to data dimension reduction, control charts design and performance improvement have been addressed accordingly. The major research activities and corresponding contributions are summarized as follows:(1) Filter and Wrapper models are integrated to extract a small number of the informative attributes for computer network intrusion detection. A two-phase analyses method is proposed for the integration of Filter and Wrapper models. The proposed method has successfully reduced the original 41 attributes to 12 informative attributes while increasing the accuracy of the model. The comparison of the results in each phase shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. (2) Supervised kernel <b>based</b> <b>control</b> charts for anomaly intrusion detection. We propose to construct control charts in a feature space. The first contribution is the use of multi-objective Genetic Algorithm in the parameter pre-selection for SVM <b>based</b> <b>control</b> charts. The second contribution is the performance evaluation of supervised kernel <b>based</b> <b>control</b> charts. (3) Unsupervised kernel <b>based</b> <b>control</b> charts for anomaly intrusion detection.
