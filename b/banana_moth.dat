40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>banana</b> <b>moth</b> Opogona sacchari (Bojer) (Lepidoptera: Tineidae) is a {{polyphagous}} pest {{that can cause}} serious damage, especially to banana crops in southern Brazil. It attacks the fruit, lowering its quality and making bananas unsuitable for export. Current control measures are limited {{and the use of}} Trichogramma (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) for Applied Biological Control may be an alternative for the management of this pest. In this study, we investigated the potential parasitism effectiveness of eggs of O. sacchari by T. pretiosum, T. atopovirilia and T. galloi, three species of parasitoids commonly used in Applied Biological Control programs in Brazil. Eggs of O. sacchari were parasitized by all three Trichogramma species, and T. atopovirilia and T. galloi were the most aggressive, showing greater potential for control of this pest in the banana culture...|$|E

40|$|Extractive {{components}} {{obtained from}} milling residues of white cypress were studied for chemical identity and bioactivity {{with a view}} to developing a commercial use for these components, thus increasing the value of the residues and improving the economics of cypress sawn wood production. Extracts obtained by solvent or steam extraction techniques from cypress sawdust were each fractionated by a range of techniques into groups of similar compounds. Crude extracts and fractions were screened against a range of agricultural pests and diseases, including two fungi, subterranean termites, fruit spotting bugs, two-spotted mites, thrips, heliothis, <b>banana</b> scab <b>moths,</b> silverleaf whiteflies, cattle tick adults and larvae, and ruminant gastrointestinal nematodes. Additional screening was undertaken where encouraging results were achieved, for two-spotted mites, thrips, silverleaf whiteflies, cattle tick adults and ruminant gastrointestinal nematodes. After considering degrees of efficacy against, and economic importance of, the agricultural pests, and likely production costs of extracts and fractions, the crude extract (oil) produced by steam distillation was chosen for further study against silverleaf whitefly. A useful degree of control was achievable when this oil was applied to tomato or eggplant at 0. 1...|$|R
40|$|Larvae of the {{butterfly}} Erionota thrax, the banana skipper, destroy {{the leaves of}} bananas by eating them and forming massive protective rolls of leaf tissue. They were first observed in north-western Papua New Guinea in 1983 {{and over the next}} 6 years spread throughout the mainland at the rate of up to 500 km/year. E. thrax has also spread across the ocean to the east, to invade New Britain, Duke of York and New Ireland islands, and possibly Bougainville. As the banana skipper spread, it destroyed an average of some 60 % of banana leaves, leading to both a serious delay in fruit maturation and reduced weight of banana bunches. Previous successful biological control of E. thrax when it invaded Mauritius, Hawaii, Guam and Saipan encouraged Papua New Guinea to launch an approach to ACIAR for funds. This was successful and a project was undertaken from 1988 to 1990. After careful tests to ensure that it was safe to do so, the larval parasite Cotesia erionotae was introduced and established, leading to a reduction in the estimated average leaf damage from about 60 % to 5 %. Using the estimated production value of bananas in Papua New Guinea to the year 2020, the losses due to banana skipper each year were calculated. Using a discount rate of 5 %, the net present value of lost production amounts to approximately A$ 301. 8 million. The value of damage prevented by biological control is estimated at $ 201. 6 million. The reduction of banana skipper abundance by 90 % in southern Papua New Guinea has correspondingly reduced the chance of adults invading not only Australian islands in the Torres Strait but also the Australian mainland. The successful biological control program in Papua New Guinea has therefore provided significant benefits to banana production in Australia. Assuming similar levels of damage in Australia as in Papua New Guinea, we estimate these benefits to be $ 223 million to the year 2020. The present value of total benefits from the ACIAR project equals $ 424. 7 million ($ 201. 6 million to Papua New Guinea and $ 223. 1 million to Australia). This compares with the present value {{of the cost of the}} ACIAR project of $ 0. 70 million, giving a benefit–cost ratio of 607 and an internal rate of return of 190 %.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Nacoleia octasema with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Nacoleia octasema Meyrick, the <b>banana</b> scab <b>moth,</b> (Insecta: Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is primarily a pest of bananas and plantains (Musa spp.). In addition, it has been reported to attack, as minor hosts, Heliconia spp., Nypa fruticans (the Nypa palm), Pandanus spp. and maize. The larvae feed on the skin of the banana fruit creating black scars that may greatly reduce their market value. In some parts of its range, primarily the East Indies, it does not feed on bananas. Since no intraspecific taxonomic characteristics have been identified, it is suggested that this is due to races with different host ranges. Serious economic damage has been recorded in Queensland and Fiji. Its distribution is restricted to Australasia, south-east Asia and the Pacific islands. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). The pest risk assessment is short and based very strongly on the CABI Crop Protection Compendium datasheet (2001) but it does provide sufficient evidence to support the conclusions reached. The Panel agrees with the pest risk assessment which states that entry is very unlikely since the pupa is the only stage that could be transported. Any pupae in the fruit bunches are likely to be washed off and plant debris from the base of infested banana trees is very unlikely to occur with young plants. Even if the current ban on banana imports is lifted, the pest will have a very low probability of surviving the specific conditions of transport and trade with countries where the pest occurs. Imports are very unlikely since these countries are so far from the French overseas departments and home-produced fruit is readily available. Passengers are also very unlikely to carry banana fruit that might contain N. octasema the long distances from countries where the pest occurs into the French overseas departments. The Panel agrees that the potential for establishment is very high due to the similarities in climate between the pest’s current area of distribution and the French overseas departments and the abundance of suitable hosts in the PRA area[4]. The Panel agrees with the high risk rating of impacts for Guadeloupe and Martinique because of the potential loss of export markets. However, the impacts in French Guiana and Réunion, that do not have export markets, are likely to be minor. In summary, therefore, N. octasema poses a risk of high impact to Guadeloupe and Martinique and low impact to French Guiana and Réunion but the probability of the impacts occurring is very low. It is very difficult to come to a firm conclusion in situations of very low probability and high impact but the Panel agreed that, on balance, an analysis of risk management options would be appropriate because it could be used to determine whether the very unlikely risk of entry could be reduced to negligible with simple measures. The Panel therefore concludes that N. octasema does have the characteristics of a quarantine pest[5] for Guadeloupe and Martinique and that the analysis of risk management options is appropriate for these two French overseas departments. Using the terminology in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC, this means that the Panel concludes that this species is a harmful organism for Guadeloupe and Martinique and is therefore potentially eligible for listing in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R
