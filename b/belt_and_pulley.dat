5|$|Franklin's machine used a <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> {{system that}} could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
25|$|In U.S. Army Air Forces use, the Norden bombsight was {{attached}} to its autopilot base, which was in turn connected with the aircraft's autopilot. The Honeywell C-1 autopilot {{could be used as}} an autopilot by the flight crew during the journey to the target area through a control panel in the cockpit, but was more commonly used under direct command of the bombardier. The Norden's box-like autopilot unit sat behind and below the sight and attached to it at a single rotating pivot. After control of the aircraft was passed to the bombardier during the bomb run, he would first rotate the entire Norden so the vertical line in the sight passed through the target. From that point on, the autopilot would attempt to guide the bomber so it followed the course of the bombsight, and pointed the heading to zero out the drift rate, fed to it through a coupling. As the aircraft turned onto the correct angle, a <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> system rotated the sight back to match the changing heading. The autopilot was another reason for the Norden's accuracy, as it ensured the aircraft quickly followed the correct course and kept it on that course much more accurately than the pilots could.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced for the 2005 {{model year}} was the {{optional}} Competition Package. [...] Included in the Competition Package were 17" [...] Gunmetal Painted Alloy Rims, Ladder Tachometer w/ shift lights, a Limited Slip Differential, and Optional Projector-beam Fog Lamps. [...] In mid-2006, GM released two Engine Kit upgrades for both the Ion Red Line [...] and the Cobalt SS. [...] The Stage 1 Kit retailed for around $500 USD, and included higher-flow fuel injectors and a recalibration to the ECU to increase the Horsepower by 31hp to 236hp and 205lb·ft. of torque, up from the stock 205hp and 200lb·ft. [...] The Stage 2 Kit retailed for around $750 and opens up {{the middle of the}} power curve to more power than the Stage 1 Kit alone. [...] In addition to everything that the Stage 1 Kit comes with, the Stage 2 Kit includes a smaller drive <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> for the supercharger, bringing the engine up to 241hp and 218lb·ft. of torque. [...] GM did release a Stage 1 to Stage 2 Upgrade kit that retailed for $400. [...] This Upgrade Kit is for a Red Line [...] with the Stage 1 kit already installed. [...] This Upgrade Kit adds the Stage 2 elements and increases the horsepower from 236hp to 241hp.|$|E

5000|$|Most of {{the extant}} saws are {{original}} including the frame, circular break-down, number one and docking saws. The saw sharpening equipment is also original. All of this equipment {{was designed to}} be steam driven via flat <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulleys.</b> The original transmission system continued to be used when the shed was first electrified: a large electric motor was simply connected to the main transmission shaft. Later, the transmission system was rendered redundant when the single large electric motor was replaced by smaller electric motors mounted directly onto each saw. As part of this upgrade, the original flat <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> wheels on the saws were replaced by [...] "V" [...] <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulleys</b> which transmitted drive directly from the saw mounted motors.|$|R

50|$|A <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> {{system is}} characterised {{by two or}} more pulleys in common to a belt. This allows for {{mechanical}} power, torque, and speed to be transmitted across axles. If the pulleys are of differing diameters, a mechanical advantage is realised.|$|E

5000|$|In automobiles, a {{mechanical}} fan provides engine cooling and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a coolant-filled radiator.

50|$|The hullers were Engelberg hullers {{manufactured}} in Germany. Before {{the use of}} electric motors, the hullers were driven by Corliss 150 hp steam engines powered from Babcock & Wilcox boilers. An extensive network of <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulleys</b> was used to transfer the power from the engines to the hullers. Electric motors were introduced in 1951, replacing the steam engines.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the steam}} engine and {{transmission}} are now removed, {{the plan and}} construction of the mill reveal their former location. The boiler and engine sheds are extant, the latter containing {{the foundations of the}} steam engine.

50|$|When {{the engine}} is cool or even at normal {{operating}} temperature, the fan clutch partially disengages the engine's mechanically driven radiator cooling fan, generally located {{at the front of}} the water pump and driven by a <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> connected to the engine's crankshaft. This saves power, since the engine does not have to fully drive the fan.|$|E
50|$|In {{the centre}} of the courtyard, a tall chimney was constructed, linked by a curving wall to the edge. This removed fumes from the boiler house which {{supplied}} steam power to the entire works. According to English Heritage, power was transmitted by a system of <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulleys</b> on the outside walls. In the 1950s, this was decommissioned and electric power was introduced.|$|R
50|$|By the 1950s, Vermeer {{introduced}} two new products, {{a portable}} PTO-powered hammermill designed to eliminate flat <b>belts</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulleys</b> <b>and</b> a self-propelled irrigation system that distributes water in large circles over crops.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{develops}} a detailed mathematical {{model of a}} casting drum drive in a web production process. The drive uses a at belt to connect the casting drum itself to a drive <b>and</b> a brake <b>pulley.</b> The model includes mechanical effects, such as creep and slip between the <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulleys,</b> <b>and</b> its parameters are obtained {{by a combination of}} calculations and experimental tests. Experimental results from a laboratory-scale model of a commercial casting drum system are used to validate the model under steady-state and transient conditions. A companion paper describes the model’s application in new controller strategies, which signicantly reduce drum speed variations caused by web tension changes...|$|R
50|$|Wool was cliipped {{from the}} sheep's back by hand shears from time immemorial. Wolseley invented and {{developed}} the first satisfactory mechanical method using a power source {{away from the}} shearer's hand. The first power source was a horse gin connected by <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> and a carefully designed driveshaft to a handpiece held by the shearer.|$|E
5000|$|Conditions {{under which}} the belt and pulleys are {{operating}} - The friction between the <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> may decrease substantially if the belt happens to be muddy or wet, as it may act as a lubricant between the surfaces. This also applies to extremely dry or warm conditions which will evaporate any water naturally found in the belt, nominally making friction greater.|$|E
50|$|The mill's {{power plant}} had a 150 hp steam boiler and 100 hp steam engine which ran the shaft, <b>belt</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulley</b> system {{that drove the}} plant's machinery. It had a 20-ton {{traveling}} derrick and three other derricks with capacities ranging from 5 to 25 tons. It was capable of producing spheres up to 6 ft (1.8m) diameter and cylinders up to 3 ft (1.9m) diameter and 22 ft (7m) long.|$|E
