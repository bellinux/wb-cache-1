Dominated by revolutionary zealots, most of whom were youths, the Revolutionary Committees were led by Mohammad Maghgoub and a Central Coordinating Office <b>based</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tripoli,</b> and met with Gaddafi annually. Membership of the Revolutionary Committees was drawn from within the BPCs. According to Bearman, the revolutionary committee system became [...] "a key—if not the main—mechanism through which [...] exercises political control in Libya". Publishing a weekly magazine The Green March (al-Zahf al-Akhdar), in October 1980 they took control of the press. Responsible for perpetuating revolutionary fervour, they performed ideological surveillance, later adopting a significant security role, making arrests and putting people on trial according to the [...] "law of the revolution" [...] (qanun al-thawra). With no legal code or safeguards, the administration of revolutionary justice was largely arbitrary and resulted in widespread abuses and the suppression of civil liberties: the [...] "Green Terror." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday 10 August Maj. Gen. Abdulsalam Al-Obaidi, the Chief of Staff of the Libyan National Army, gave {{evidence}} in a three-hour session before the newly elected House of Representatives in Tobruk. During the session Obaidi claimed he had [...] "no control" [...] over the various government funded rebel groups. Speaking about the Libya Shield Force, Obaidi claimed he {{had no way to}} find out how many soldiers were fighting under the Force, and also claimed to have no way to either reform the group or change its leadership. Mohammed el-Jarh, a Libyan analyst <b>based</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tripoli,</b> claimed that members of the House of Representatives were determined to hold Obaidi accountable after his comments. Benghazi representative Salih al-Shawihidi denied that there were plans to replace Obaidi with Saad al-Qatrani. The following day a letter that had been sent by Obaidi to numerous militias on the 6 August was leaked on the internet. In the letter Obaidi instructed all groups, including the Libya Shield Forces which are officially under his command, and which he had assigned to Tripoli, to stop fighting.

50|$|Some Sunni factions {{received}} {{support from}} Libya and Iraq, {{and a number}} of minor militias existed due to a general reluctance on the part of Sunnis to join military organisations throughout the civil war. The more prominent groups were secular and holding a Nasserist ideology, or otherwise having pan-Arab and Arab nationalist leanings. A few Islamist ones emerged at later stages of the war, such as the Tawhid Movement that took its <b>base</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tripoli,</b> and the Jama'a Islamiyya, which gave a Lebanese expression of the Muslim Brotherhood in terms of political orientations and practice. The main Sunni-led organization was the al-Murabitun, a major west-Beirut based force. Al-Murabitoun, led by Ibrahim Kulaylat, fought with the Palestinians against the Israelis during the invasion of 1982. There is also the Tanzim al-Nassiri in Sidon that was formed through the followers of Maaruf Saad, and who rallied later behind his son Mustafa Saad, and now are led by Usama Saad.

50|$|Another son of Emir Mulhim, Emir Yusuf, {{had backed}} Emir Ahmad in his {{struggle}} {{and had his}} properties in Chouf confiscated by Emir Mansur. Emir Yusuf, who was raised as a Maronite Catholic but publicly presented himself as a Sunni Muslim, gained protection from Sheikh Ali Jumblatt in Moukhtara, and the latter attempted to reconcile Emir Yusuf with his uncle. Emir Mansur declined Sheikh Ali's mediation. Sa'ad al-Khuri, Emir Yusuf's mudabbir (manager), managed to persuade Sheikh Ali to withdraw his backing of Emir Mansur, while Emir Yusuf gained the support of Uthman Pasha al-Kurji, the governor of Damascus. The latter directed his son Mehmed Pasha al-Kurji, governor of Tripoli, to transfer the tax farms of Jubail and Batroun to Emir Yusuf in 1764. With the latter two tax farms, Emir Yusuf formed a power <b>base</b> <b>in</b> <b>Tripoli's</b> hinterland. Under al-Khuri's guidance and with Druze allies from Chouf, Emir Yusuf led a campaign against the Hamade sheikhs {{in support of the}} Maronite clans of Dahdah, Karam and Dahir and Maronite and Sunni Muslim peasants who, since 1759, were all revolting against the Hamade clan. Emir Yusuf defeated the Hamade sheikhs and appropriated their tax farms. This not only empowered Emir Yusuf in his conflict with Emir Mansur, but it also initiated Shihabi patronage over the Maronite bishops and monks who had resented Khazen influence over church affairs and been patronized by the Hamade sheikhs, the Shihab clan's erstwhile allies.|$|R
