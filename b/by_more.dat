5|$|Although English is {{the common}} {{language}} of Westeros, the producers charged linguist David J.

5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell <b>by</b> <b>more</b> than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree of industrialization {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E
