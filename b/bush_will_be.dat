40|$|During {{the early}} 1990 s, George H. W. Bush was being {{inundated}} with criticism since many individuals {{believed he had}} failed to devise an effective plan for bringing the United States out of a serious economic downturn. In the years following his time in the White House, some analysts continued to dwell on Bush’s response to this recession, but there were others who elected to examine his performance in the international arena. Most of the evaluators of his foreign policy were of the opinion that he exercised great caution when he was dealing with developments on the world stage. While George W. Bush was running for president in 2000, it appeared as if he would be guided by this example that had been set by his father since he frequently scrutinized risky endeavors such as nation-building missions. However, once he won that election, a lot of comparisons could not be drawn between him and his father because he proceeded to introduce a rather ambitious agenda on the foreign front. From 2009 to the present, Barack Obama, the sitting U. S. president, has not attempted to accomplish lofty objectives as his predecessor did for eight years. Instead, he has opted to emulate the more circumspect approach of Bush’s father. Inside the following article, this bond between Barack Obama and George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> looked at in a thorough fashion. </p...|$|E

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{external gear}} pumps for automotive applications, which operate at high speed and low pressure and presents a sensitivity analysis {{about the influence of}} design and operational parameters on the pump dynamic behaviour. In previous work, a non-linear lumped-parameter kineto-elastodynamic model was developed, with the aim of including all the important effects, as well as to get a rather simple model. Two main sources of noise and vibration can be considered: pressure variation and gear meshing. The model has been validated by comparison with experimental vibration data, {{in a wide range of}} operational conditions and for different gear designs and several profile errors. This paper is focused on the analysis of the influence of the main design and operational parameters on the pump dynamic behaviour. In particular, the effect of operational pressure and speed, the influence of the clearance in the journal bearing and between tooth tip and pump case, and the effect of the dimension of the relief grooves in the <b>bushes</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> thoroughly discussed in the paper.

40|$|Excerpt] The Former Presidents Act (FPA; 3 U. S. C. § 102 note) {{charges the}} General Services Administration (GSA) with {{providing}} former Presidents a pension, support staff, office support, travel funds, and mailing privileges. The FPA was enacted to “maintain the dignity” of the Office of the President by giving a former President — {{and his or}} her spouse — certain benefits so that he would not have to enter unsuitable occupations after leaving office. Former Presidents currently receive a pension that is equal to pay for the head of an executive department (Executive Level I), which was $ 191, 300 as of January 1, 2008. The FY 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $ 2, 478, 000 for pensions and GSA assistance to former Presidents. The President’s FY 2009 budget requested $ 2, 934, 000 for expenditures for former Presidents. Pending House and Senate appropriations legislation recommends the requested amount. Prior to 1958, former Presidents leaving office received no pension or federal assistance. After leaving office, some former Presidents — including Ulysses S. Grant and Harry S Truman — struggled financially. In 1912, industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie unveiled a plan to pay $ 25, 000 pensions to all future former Presidents and their widows. The pensions were to be funded by the Carnegie Foundation of New York. Some Members of Congress and the public suggested it was inappropriate for a private company to pay pensions to former Presidents. Legislation was introduced that year to grant public pensions to former Presidents, but none of the bills were reported from committee. William Howard Taft, the only former President who was then eligible for Carnegie’s offer, refused the pension. Since 1962, the U. S. Secret Service has provided protection to former Presidents because of their status as “visible national symbol[s]. ” Protection has subsequently been expanded to cover a former President’s wife until death or remarriage. Minor children of former Presidents who are under 16 years of age also receive protection. In 1994, the law was amended to limit U. S. Secret Service coverage to 10 years for any President, and his spouse, who left office after January 1, 1997. President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the first former President affected by this statutory change. In the 110 th Congress, Representative John Conyers introduced a bill (H. R. 5938) that would extend U. S. Secret Service Protection to a Vice President, his or her spouse, and family for up to six months after leaving office. Currently, Secret Service protection for a Vice President {{and his or her}} family is provided on an ad hoc basis. This report describes the benefits Presidents receive upon leaving office, details the history of the FPA, and analyzes some legislative options for the 110 th Congress related to former Presidents...|$|E

S. troops in international peacekeeping missions {{and that a}} major policy shift is on the way. Democratic accountability {{in a variety of}} such international military efforts will be examined by Charlotte Ku, executive vice president {{and executive director of the}} American Society of International Law, in a lecture at the University of Georgia School of Law on Tuesday, February 27. The lecture, sponsored by the Dean Rusk Center [...] International, Comparative and Graduate Legal Studies, will be held at 3 : 30 p. m. in Room K of Dean Rusk Hall. Ku 2 ̆ 7 s speech and the reception which follows are open and free to the public. Ku researched her topic, 2 ̆ 2 Democratic Accountability and International Institutions: Using Military Force, 2 ̆ 2 for a scholarly paper she recently coauthored. The publication considers several recent missions, including NATO 2 ̆ 7 s Operation Allied Force in Kosovo in 1999. 2 ̆ 2 Is authorization by the UN Security Council essential for general acceptance of the legitimacy of the use of military forces?, 2 ̆ 2 Ku wrote. 2 ̆ 2 Can the authorization of a body like the North Atlantic Council be sufficient for those taking part in the operation? How about for non-NATO members? When do national legislative bodies of countries have to take specific action to authorize participation of their country 2 ̆ 7 s military forces in international operations? To whom are military commanders responsible? Practice in these areas has outpaced scholarly analysis and understanding of the issues raised. 2 ̆ 2 The American Society of International Law (ASIL) is one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading associations in international law with a membership of more than 4, 300 professors, practitioners, civil servants and students from over 100 countries. As executive vice president and executive director, Ku oversees all ASIL operations, including project development and fund raising. Prior to joining the staff of ASIL, Ku taught at the University of Virginia and at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center of the School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University. She has also worked on the legislative staff of the U. S. Senate and on the research staff of a foundation consortium in northern California. She is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and past chair of the board of directors of the Academic Council on the United Nations System.

40|$|Presuppositions {{carried by}} complex {{sentences}} need {{not come from}} {{a subset of the}} elementary presuppositions triggered in the complex sentences.

If Jane takes a bath, Bill <b>will</b> <b>be</b> annoyed by {{the fact that there is}} no more hot water. b. If the summit <b>is</b> a deadend, <b>Bush</b> <b>will</b> regret that there is war.

If the summit is a deadend, there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> war. The presuppositions-as-anaphora theory (van der Sandt, 1992; Geurts, 1996, 1999; Krahmer, 1996), which is considered to be the empirically most successful theory on this subject available today (Beaver, 1997, p. 983), wrongly predicts that the most preferred readings (1 a) and (1 b) are the ones where they carry the following unconditional presuppositions: (3) a. There is no more hot water. b. There is war. In Contrast to the presuppositions-as-anaphora theory, the satisfaction theory (Karttunen, 1974; Heim, 1983; van Eijck, 1996; Kadmon, 2001), which is one of the competitors against the presuppositions-as-anaphora the-ory, predicts that the sentences in (1) carry the conditional presuppositions listed in (2). In this respect, the presuppositions-as-anaphora theory is inferior to the satisfaction theory. However, the satisfaction theory fre-quently predicts presuppositions that are too weak (Geurts, 1996; Beaver, 2001). For instance, the satisfaction theory predicts that the sentences in (4) carry the conditional presuppositions in (5). (4) a.
