[...] is the second cantata in this series, composed for the third Sunday after Easter, Jubilate, after , for Palm Sunday and Annunciation, and before , for Pentecost. The prescribed readings for that Sunday were from the First Epistle of Peter, [...] "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man" [...] (...) , and from the Gospel of John, Jesus announcing his second coming in the so-called Farewell Discourse, saying [...] "your sorrow shall be turned into joy" [...] (...) [...] The text, depicting the affliction that Christians have to pass, is assumed to {{have been written by}} Salomon Franck, the Weimar court poet who wrote most texts for Bach cantatas of the Weimar period. It follows details of the Gospel and the idea from the epistle reading: [...] "For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfull." [...] (verse 19). The text of the opening chorus corresponds to , the text of the first recitative is taken from , [...] "we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God". Franck contends that this is true not only for the disciples who were addressed directly, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>every</b> Christian. Movement 4 sees the suffering of Jesus as a consolation for the afflicted Christian, movement 5 voices a decision to follow Jesus even in suffering, movement 6 offers the consolation that it will be only a short time until all sadness is overcome, alluding to (as in movement 4) [...] The cantata is closed by the sixth and final stanza of the hymn [...] "" [...] (1674) by Samuel Rodigast.
