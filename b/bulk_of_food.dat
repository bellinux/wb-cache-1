40|$|Introduction Potato (Solanumtuberosum L.) {{is one of}} {{the unique}} and most {{potential}} crops having high productivity, supplementing major food requirement in the world. Drying is generally carried out for two main reasons, one to reduce the water activity which eventually increases the shelf life of food and second to reduce the weight and <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> for cheaper transport and storage. The quality evaluation of the dried product was carried out on the basis of response variables such as rehydration ratio, shrinkage percentage, color and the overall acceptability. Drying is the most energy intensive process in food industry. Therefore, new drying techniques and dryers must be designed and studied to minimize the energy cost in drying process. Considering the fact that the highest energy consumption in agriculture is associated with drying operations, different drying methods can be evaluated to determine and compare the energy requirements for drying a particular product. Thermal drying operations are found in almost all industrial sectors and are known, according to various estimates, to consume 10 - 25...|$|E

Contribution to capital creation seems limited since Greenfield investment, as a mode of entry, has been far less popular than mergers and acquisitions; moreover, it has been centered almost exclusively in China and Russia.

40|$|Maize, {{wheat and}} rice, the major cereals grown as {{monoculture}} or in sequence, contribute the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and incomes in rural regions of South Asia. The large increases in food production {{are one of}} the greatest achievements of {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, but sustaining these gains is a major challenge. Inappropriate management practices and intensive cropping in the past have led to the twin challenges of resource depletion and decelerating productivity growth of cereal crops. The efficiency and sustainability of a production system depends on system-based management optimization of crop yields, economic benefits, and environmental impacts. The long term sustainability of a cropping system depends on its carbon inputs, outputs and carbon use efficiency which indicate long-term sustainability in terms of yield, environment and ecology. Similarly, efficient utilization of carbon-based resources mitigates the increasing level of CO 2 in the environment. Most of the indices used by researchers in the past to evaluate the sustainability of any cropping systems have been based on economic yield or yield sustainability, without giving due emphasis to environmental issues. In this study, three major cereal systems (rice-wheat, rice-maize and maize-wheat) were evaluated under conservation agriculture practices and compared with conventional tillage in terms of yield, carbon (C) inputs and outputs, and a carbon based sustainability index...|$|E

This study on generational mortality associatedfactors in Anopheles mosquitoes life-table analysis was designed to investigate the fecundity,levels of mortality and mortality associated factors at the aquatic stages of anopheline malaria vectors. Methods: Mortality associated factors were investigated at the eggs, I and II instar larval, III and IVinstar larval and pupal stages of two anopheline species— Anopheles pseudopunctipennis (Theobald) and An. gambiae life-cycles in screen cages. Adult male and female mosquitoes were membrane filterfedand algae in culture medium formed the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> substances for the larval stage. Environmentaltemperature of culture media, pH and some associated physio-chemical factors were also determined. Results: Results showed significant mortality rates at various aquatic stages.

Past efforts have tried to increase the production of countries in more favourable environments, farmers with relatively higher potential for improvement benefited most from these advances. Current and future crop improvement efforts will focus more on marginalenvironments, especially those prone to drought. The objective {{of this research is}} to guide crop improvement efforts by prioritizing areas of high poverty, the key problem of high drought risk and the crops grown and consumed in these areas. Global spatial data on crop production, climate and poverty (as proxied by child stunting) were used to identify geographic areas of high priority for crop improvement. The analysis employed spatial overlay, drought modelling and descriptive statistics to identify where best to target technology generation to achieve its intended human welfare goals. Analysis showed that drought coincides with high levels of poverty in 15 major farming systems, especially in South Asia, the Sahel and eastern and southern Africa, where high diversity in drought frequency characterizes the environments. Thirteen crops make up the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> production in these areas.

40|$|This paper draws {{attention}} to the specific post-civil-war situation in agriculture and the food sector in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). These developments are presented in an association with the overall situation in the country. Due to economic and non-economic reasons, B&H faces a general problem of a lack of international competitiveness. In a current situation, there are rare products to be internationally competitive and the country relies on imports of food and other products. During the post-civil-war emergency and reconstruction stage, the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> and agricultural inputs, were donated or granted by different governments, humanitarian organizations, and donors to mitigate the effects of widespread poverty caused by the war destructions and economic declines. During a development stage, recovery in the agricultural sector is burdened by the considerable lack of international competitiveness in food processing and marketing as well as by several sectors, institutional, and general economic problems. The rate of unemployment in B&H is high, and agricultural households are the important units providing food security for rural populations and relatives living in towns. Nevertheless, around half of agricultural land resources are unutilised, and even more striking is the "illegally occupied" agricultural land, {{which is one of the}} most significant in the structure of land leasing arrangements. poverty, social buffer, land leasing, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Agribusiness, Q 15, Q 18, O 13, O 52,...|$|E
30|$|An {{efficient}} {{technique was}} developed to monitor the emission of hydrogen and carbon dioxide from bacteria cultures by headspace gas chromatography and to investigate the efficacy of chemical antibiotics and of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties. Facultative anaerobes emit hydrogen and carbon dioxide from cultures in the closed headspace vials and obligate anaerobes too, if the air above the cultures in the vials is replaced by nitrogen. Antibiotics added to the sample cultures are apparently effective if the emission of hydrogen and carbon dioxide is suppressed. If not, either they are ineffective or the related bacteria are even resistant. The headspace technique can detect bacterial contamination in various samples, and examples are presented for food purchased from supermarkets and for medical specimens, including recognition of antibiotic resistance. However, the described technique cannot identify the related bacteria at a species or genus level, but is well suited for example for screening the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> in supermarkets for microbe contamination or for the search of natural antibiotics. The samples are incubated with the proper nutrient medium in closed septum vials which remain closed during the whole process. The personnel in the lab never {{come into contact with}} pathogens, and thus, safety regulations are warranted. The described technique can be carried out with all commercially available gas chromatographs, even including simple low-cost instruments, equipped with a standard packed column and a thermal conductivity detector, up to expensive and fully automated instruments, such as used for forensic blood alcohol analysis.|$|E
