The long history of volcanism in the area, coupled with continued subduction off the British Columbia Coast, indicates that volcanism has not yet concluded in the area. Because of this magmatic heat, Mount Cayley has been a target for geothermal exploration. <b>Bottom</b> <b>hole</b> temperatures of 50°C and thermal gradients of less than 100°C have been measured in shallow boreholes on Cayley's southwest flank.|$|E

In {{order to examine}} damage mechanisms in these materials, SiC/SiC coupons were impacted with 1. 59 mm diameter steel spheres at increasing velocities from 115 m/s to 400 m/s. Pulsed thermography, a nondestructive evaluation technique that monitors the thermal response of a sample over time, was utilized to characterize the impact damage.

40|$|Advanced {{composite}} materials are finding increasing application in aerospace, marine {{and many other}} industries due to their performance and structural efficiency. Maintenance inspection of these lightweight structures {{is a relatively new}} and difficult task for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT), which need robust methods to be applicable in industrial environments. In this paper, a new numerical-experimental procedure to detect size and depth of flat <b>bottom</b> <b>holes</b> in metallic and laminated composite structures by digital shearography (DISH) is proposed. The flaw detection capabilities of DISH have been evaluated by measuring the dynamic response of defects to applied stresses. Vibration dynamic loading is used to reveal flat <b>bottom</b> <b>holes</b> made with different sizes and placed at different depths in CFRP laminates. The shearographic methodology is based on the recognition of the (0 1) resonance mode per defect. A simplified model of thin circular plate, idealized above each flaw position, is used to calculate the natural frequency of vibrating defects. Then, the numerical difference between experimental resonance frequencies and those computationally obtained is minimized using an unconstrained optimization algorithm in order to calculate the defect depth. Considering the simplicity and rapidity of this technique, the laser shearography methodology is evaluated reliable as NDT method...|$|R
