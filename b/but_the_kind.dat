[...] "The events that unfolded on Earth is something fans still clamor for after being 'short changed' in Halo 2," [...] Jarrard said. [...] "Fans {{wanted to know what}} happened back on Earth, how humanity was defending it." [...] New Mombasa's urban environments fit the intended feel of the game, as Bungie felt that the change of protagonists required a change in location: [...] "We know the kinds of problems Master Chief solves," [...] Staten explained. [...] "He goes to ancient, alien ring artifacts, fights galaxy-consuming parasitic alien monsters and destroys alien empires [...] The ODST, they maybe take small parts in that larger struggle. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of fights they usually get into are usually the kind of fights they can tackle in a day." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1951, Hawks produced, {{and some}} believe {{essentially}} directed, a science-fiction film, The Thing from Another World. Director John Carpenter stated: [...] "And let's get the record straight. The movie {{was directed by}} Howard Hawks. Verifiably directed by Howard Hawks. He let his editor, Christian Nyby, take credit. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of feeling between the male characters—the camaraderie, the group of men that has to fight off the evil—it's all pure Hawksian." [...] He followed this with the 1952 western film The Big Sky, starring Kirk Douglas. Later in 1952, Hawks work with Cary Grant for the fifth and final time in the screwball comedy Monkey Business, which also starred Marilyn Monroe and Ginger Rogers. Grant plays a scientist (reminiscent of his character in Bringing up Baby) who creates a formula that increases his vitality. Film critic John Belton called the film Hawks's [...] "most organic comedy." [...] Hawks's third film of 1952 was {{a contribution to the}} omnibus film O. Henry's Full House, which includes short stories by the writer O. Henry made by various directors. Hawks's short film The Ransom of Red Chief starred Fred Allen, Oscar Levant and Jeanne Crain.|$|E
500|$|Despite the M2B's lack {{of success}} Herd said of the team, [...] "Everyone was ten times more {{determined}} to do better the following year." [...] On {{the design of the}} car he reflected that, [...] "our emphasis tended to be more on the elegance of the chassis structure rather than on the design of a really quick racing car" [...] and that, [...] "we ... tended to go towards technical ingenuity and bullshit rather than racewinning engineering". Team member and later manager of the organisation Teddy Mayer said, [...] "Our main problems were with the choice of the Ford engine." [...] Bruce McLaren's personal secretary and author Eoin Young concurs. The winners of the 1966 drivers' and constructors' championships, Jack Brabham and his eponymous team, used a Repco-modified and badged Oldsmobile engine. It produced approximately 290bhp – less than the Ford – but its light weight and reliability rendered it effective. Despite having used the Oldsmobile in sports racing cars, the McLaren team discounted it. Afterwards, Mayer said, [...] "We considered it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of modifications which Repco did were well beyond our resources, and I doubt very much if we could have done any more with it than we did with the Indy Ford." ...|$|E
