40|$|Information {{is given}} {{about the results}} of the latest meeting of the Herring Assessment Working Group for the Area South of 62 ° N and the Baltic Fisheries Assessment Working Group, which were {{conducted}} in March and April at ICES headquarters in Copenhagen. The actual stock development and the catch options estimated for different assessment units of herring and sprat are presented. The spawning stock size of North Sea herring reached in 1998 {{for the first time since}} 1991 a level above the Minimum <b>Biological</b> <b>Acceptable</b> <b>Level</b> (MBAL) of 800 000 t. Keeping the fishery at the present level the spawning stock size should reach in 1999 a level of about 1. 2 mio. t. For the Western Baltic Spring spawning herring stock no actual stock estimate was presented. Due to uncertainties in splitting the catches in North Sea autumn and Baltic spring spawners no analytical assessment was accepted...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{conditions}} for commercial harvesting of fish stocks are changing. The traditional fishery management {{was based on}} strategies directed at optimising the yield. The relevant biological reference points were FMAX and F 0. 1. The emphasis {{is now on the}} sustainability of the exploitation, and the biological reference points are Minimum <b>Biological</b> <b>Acceptable</b> <b>Level</b> (MBAL) and FMED. This study investigates the usefulness of these sustainability reference points when the stock productivity measured in recruitment terms changes, e. g. due to environment variability. The paper shows data from the Eastern Baltic Cod stock where the variability in recruitment has been interpreted as periods with average recruitment productivity and periods with high productivity (yearclasses 1975 – 1981). The paper concludes that the sustainability reference points MBAL and FMED which are build on the assumption of a time invariant stock recruitment relation are less useful in these situations...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, two {{applications}} of mechanism-based modeling {{are presented with}} their utility from candidate selection to first-in-human dosage selection. The first example is for a monoclonal antibody against a cytomegalovirus glycoprotein complex, which involves an antibody binding model and a viral load model. The model was used {{as part of a}} feasibility analysis prior to antibody generation, setting the specifications for the affinity needed to achieve a desired level of clinical efficacy. The second example is a pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic model based on a single-dose pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkey using data on pharmacokinetics, receptor occupancy, and the dynamics of target cell depletion and recovery. The model was used to estimate the MABEL, here defined as the minimum <b>acceptable</b> <b>biological</b> effect <b>level</b> against which a dose is selected for a first-in-human study. From these applications, we demonstrate that mechanism-based PK/PD binding models are useful for predicting human response to biologics compounds. Especially, such models have the ability to integrate preclinical and clinical, in vitro and in vivo information and facilitate rational decision making during various stages of drug discovery and translational research...|$|R

40|$|When {{pursuing}} multiple goals over time, {{the amount}} of time (i. e., resources) available affects which goal is pursued: people prioritize (i. e., spend time on) the goal furthest from the aspiration level when there is plenty of time available to attain the aspiration level on the multiple goals but switch to prioritize the goal closest to the aspiration level when the time available starts to run out (e. g., Schmidt, Dolis, 2 ̆ 6 Tolli, 2009). Although the aspiration level is the most commonly examined goal level, other goal levels possessing different psychological meanings (e. g., minimally acceptable or status quo goal levels) also exist. I examined the effect of multiple goal levels (i. e., the minimally <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> and the aspiration level) on goal prioritization decisions. I hypothesized that when people were provided with both the minimally <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> and the aspiration level, they would prioritize attaining the minimally <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> over the aspiration level. Participants (N= 316) engaged in a fully within-persons decision-making task where they repeatedly decided which of two goals to allocate their time to. The amount of time available for allocation was systematically varied. Results indicated that people first strived for the minimally <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> on one goal. When they attained the minimally <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> on that goal, they switched to striving for the minimally <b>acceptable</b> <b>level</b> on the second goal. Only when people attained the minimally <b>acceptable</b> <b>levels</b> for both goals did they strive for the aspiration level (on one of the goals). The only exception is when they had insufficient time to attain both minimally acceptable goal levels; in that case, they focused only on one goal and strived for the aspiration level on that goal. Results imply that when choosing which goal to prioritize, people consider multiple goal levels. Implications of multiple goal levels for goal pursuit, goal revision, and theories of motivation are discussed...|$|R
