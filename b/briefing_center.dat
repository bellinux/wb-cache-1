40|$|We have {{developed}} a fully parallel C++/MPI based simulation code for variable-density particle-laden turbulent flows. The fluid is represented through a uniform Eulerian staggered grid, while particles are modeled using a Lagrangian point-particle framework. Spatial discretization is second-order accurate, and time integration has a fourth-order accuracy. Two-way coupling of the particles with the background flow is considered in both momentum and energy equations. The code is fully modular and abstracted, and easily can be extended or modified. We have considered two different boundary conditions. We have also developed a novel parallel linear solver for the variable density Poisson equation that arises in the calculation.

Fluids 17, 095106 (2005) ] validated a physical space forcing method termed “linear forcing. ” Linear forcing has the advantages of being less memory intensive, less computationally expensive, and more easily extended to variable density simulations. However, this forcing method generates turbulent statistics that are highly oscillatory, requiring extended simulation run times to attain time-invariant properties. A slight modification of the forcing term is proposed, and it is shown to reduce this oscillatory nature without altering the turbulent physics...|$|R

The report is designed to support the software development activities. It is the framework for the project built on the webMethods system,a SoftwareAG’sin house product, which has also given the opportunity for the employees to work in the software development environment. There are no templates, and everything is customizable. Hence, this makes the project very complicated even though the result looks simple. The Prototyping method has been chosen as the requirements are <b>brief</b> (<b>Centers</b> for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2005). In this case, the development team used the Composite Application Framework (CAF) technology to build up the basic look and feel for the user interface, and also mock hardcoded data to present them to the stakeholders. When the so called prototypes are approved, the real development begins. The output for this project is tested in usability and functionality, in house before rolling it into production. Other than having the Training Feedback System (TFS) product, three documents such as Software Requirement Specification (SRS), Software Development Plan (SDP) and Software Design Document (SDD) are created for the project. The system will help the Global Support team to automate their feedback system, and create the survey bank which will help to the trainer to reuse the past surveys...|$|R
