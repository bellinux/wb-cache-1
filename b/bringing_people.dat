5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} of communication and energy development in civilizations with psychological and economic development in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase of communication and energy regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as <b>bringing</b> <b>people</b> together on the nation-state level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E

25|$|A {{railway station}} was opened in 1903 {{a few hundred}} yards west of its current {{position}} and railway companies often ran excursions to the town, <b>bringing</b> <b>people</b> to marvel at the social experiment and sometimes to mock it: Letchworth's founding citizens, attracted by the promise of a better life, were often caricatured by outsiders as idealistic and otherworldly.

25|$|Early social {{networking}} on the World Wide Web {{began in the}} form of generalized online communities such as Theglobe.com (1995), Geocities (1994) and Tripod.com (1995). Many of these early communities focused on <b>bringing</b> <b>people</b> together to interact with each other through chat rooms, and encouraged users to share personal information and ideas via personal webpages by providing easy-to-use publishing tools and free or inexpensive webspace. Some communities – such as Classmates.com – took a different approach by simply having people link to each other via email addresses. PlanetAll started in 1996.|$|E

Once the year had passed, Zeus brought Apollo back to Mount Olympus and revived the Cyclopes that made his thunderbolts.

25|$|Thanks {{in part to}} {{escalating}} oil prices, {{the economy}} in Calgary and Alberta was booming {{until the end of}} 2009, and the region of nearly 1.1million people was home to the fastest growing economy in the country.

25|$|Many Lakes (Sinixt) {{feel that}} to live {{ethically}} one must follow a moral code which maintains a reciprocal relationship between humans, the land, and {{the realm of}} spirits in which the ancestors dwell. (Ancestor) Eva Orr called this 'keeping the Lakes' way.' The ideal of keeping the Lakes' way requires that people not take for their own gain but instead give back by following a cultural ethic of egalitarianism, reciprocity and peaceful living. Orr was acknowledged as spiritual leader – a klakwilt. Marilyn James states that Orr got her authority as a klakwilt by being culturally whole, linguistically connected to Sinixt culture, and <b>bringing</b> <b>people</b> to spirit. The Sinixt connection to their traditional territory is underscored by the wbuplak'n, the highest territorial and cultural legal doctrine of the Sinixt, which sets out their territorial responsibility to all land, water, plant, animal and cultural resources within the Sinixt territory.|$|E

[...] "For me, the tour is more about just <b>bringing</b> <b>people</b> together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." [...] She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans.

500|$|In 1913 he {{spearhead}} {{the founding}} of The Ozark Trails Association (OTA) to promote the building and education of quality highway design, but not actually building or funding them. At first, he was only interested in <b>bringing</b> <b>people</b> to Monte Ne, he stated: [...] "My Personal interest in the Ozark Trails is that they all lead to Monte Ne" [...] However, {{he seems to have}} taken on a more egalitarian opinion of the Ozark Trails as time went on because he later said: [...] "My inclination runs toward doing something of a progressive nature that will promote the collective good, and I have now concentrated all that inclination on carrying out a system of roads known as the Ozark Trails." [...] The Ozark Trails Association became Harvey's most successful endeavor. Interest in the project spread, and membership swelled to 7,000 delegates from states as far away as New Mexico. The group built large obelisks, listing the names of the benefactors, along the routes and trails that it sponsored. He even ran for Congress on a platform of building a national highway system, but lost to John W. Tillman who had strong support in Washington County.|$|E
