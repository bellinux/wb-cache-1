5|$|In 1990, {{the founders}} of Codemasters, David and Richard Darling, were at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, and were {{impressed}} with {{the popularity of the}} Nintendo Entertainment System in the USA. They wanted to develop games for the system, but did not have a licence from Nintendo. In October 1989, programmer Andrew Graham developed a prototype, California <b>Buggy</b> Boys, which was showcased with multiple consoles networked. The prototype featured buggies similar to those in Power Drift, and the intention was to develop something that would be popular in the United States. Codemasters then obtained a licensing deal with Galoob, who wanted them to develop a game based on their Micro Machines toys. California <b>Buggy</b> Boys was used as a base, and Galoob sent toys to Codemasters, who wanted a good selection for the game.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous <b>buggy</b> rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by his need to regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E

5|$|Blast Corps is a single-player action video game. The player {{controls}} {{vehicles to}} destroy buildings, farms, and other {{structures in the}} path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier.

The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps.

5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published serially in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and <b>buggy</b> for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a shut-in.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Nazis invaded Poland {{and forced}} that nation's second-largest {{community}} of Jews, 270,000 strong, into {{one section of}} the city of Łódź, which they later walled off to form a ghetto. Before the invasion, Syvia and her family lived in Łódź. When her father heard rumors of the impending German invasion, the family traveled by <b>buggy</b> to Warsaw. The family was unable to find work or housing in Warsaw, so they returned to Lodz. When the Germans did invade, they forced Syvia's family to relocate, along with other Łódź-area Jews, into a segregated section of the city: a ghetto. The book relates Syvia's explanations of what life in the ghetto is like: her friends, people around the ghetto, jobs, and her schedule.
