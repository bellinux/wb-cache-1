50|$|Aside {{from the}} {{technical}} differences of the New Haven Line (electrification via overhead catenary instead of third rail), {{the cars are}} similar to the sister M1A order and, in times of equipment shortages or severe weather, the M2s have run on the Hudson and Harlem lines. Most of the other differences are in the interior and exterior appearance of the cars, such as red striping on the exterior rather than blue, the interior wallpaper having both the New York and Connecticut state seals and the obvious pantograph and mechanical apparatus on the roof. Both the MTA and ConnDOT purchased <b>bar</b> <b>cars,</b> but complaints from riders from stations in New York, coupled with arrival of new equipment on the Hudson and Harlem lines, led to the conversion of the ten MTA-owned <b>bar</b> <b>cars</b> to standard coaches.
