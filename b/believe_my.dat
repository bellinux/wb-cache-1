500|$|... "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] {{was written}} by {{composer}} Alan Menken and lyricist David Zippel. Menken originally composed a [...] "soaring" [...] ballad entitled [...] "I Can't <b>Believe</b> <b>My</b> Heart" [...] for Meg to sing in the film, which he had intended {{to serve as a}} solo that conveys the heroine falling in love with Hercules. However, Meg's supervising animator Ken Duncan disagreed with Menken's song because he believed the character was [...] "too tough" [...] and [...] "hardened by life" [...] to perform such a soft ballad. The writers agreed that Meg [...] "wasn’t a ballad kind of girl." [...] Therefore, Menken was prompted to write [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", the style of which he based on some of the girl group songs he had written for his stage musical Little Shop of Horrors (1982), with which [...] "I Can't <b>Believe</b> <b>My</b> Heart" [...] was ultimately replaced. Although she enjoyed the first song, actress and singer Susan Egan, who voices Meg, agreed that the slower [...] "I Can't <b>Believe</b> <b>My</b> Heart" [...] was not suitable for her character because she felt that it was [...] "too straightforward and literal", whereas [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] expresses a similar meaning, albeit [...] "the way Meg would—without admitting any of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The pessimism {{expressed}} by Phillips and Mecklin surprised Frederick Nolting, who preceded Lodge as the US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account [...] "surprised {{the hell out}} of me. I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> ears." [...] Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable to being brainwashed because he had recently split with his wife. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan of The New York Times and UPI respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won Pulitzer Prizes and were strident critics of Diệm.|$|E
500|$|... bout {{five minutes}} later, a most {{incredible}} scene took place. Into the hall sauntered {{about a dozen}} policemen. They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park. They {{did not seem to}} be at all excited or concerned about the circumstances.I could hardly <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out! As a matter of absolute fact, some of them even had their hands in their pockets.|$|E

500|$|In 1991, Townshend {{broke his}} wrist in a cycling {{accident}} {{and could not}} play guitar. Looking for alternative work while recuperating, he responded to a request from the PACE Theatrical Group {{for the rights to}} a Broadway musical adaptation of Tommy. The group introduced him to La Jolla Playhouse director Des McAnuff, and the pair began to develop the musical together. It opened at La Jolla in summer 1992, and was an immediate commercial success. Townshend wrote a new song, [...] "I <b>Believe</b> <b>My</b> Own Eyes", to explain the relationship between Tommy's parents, but otherwise tried to be faithful to the music on the original album.|$|E
500|$|... "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is a mid-tempo R and doo-wop ballad {{reminiscent}} of the 1950s music that incorporates Motown and teen pop influences. Similar in style to songs recorded by American girl groups The Ronettes and The Supremes, its lyrics about denying having romantic feelings for someone parody those of traditional love songs. In its accompanying musical sequence, Meg realizes that she has reluctantly begun {{to fall in love}} with Hercules but constantly refuses to admit this. Meanwhile, the Muses insist that she stop denying her feelings for him and embrace them instead. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] was written to replace a slower, more emotional ballad Menken had originally intended for Meg, entitled [...] "I Can't <b>Believe</b> <b>My</b> Heart"; the song was discarded because Meg's animator Ken Duncan felt that it did not compliment her strong personality. Menken based [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] on songs he had written for his musical Little Shop of Horrors (1982).|$|E
500|$|With Feliciano again up, Secretariat {{returned}} to the track on July 15 as the 6–5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts, but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2–5 favorite {{caught the attention of}} veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, [...] "You carry an ideal around in your head, and boy, I thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way. And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it. The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude. It was just incredible. I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> eyes, frankly." ...|$|E

500|$|After Beyoncé {{finished}} her {{concert at the}} Trent FM Arena in Nottingham, England on November 20, 2009, she announced to the crowd that a new album would be released the next year. I Am... World Tour features performances from Beyoncé's tour. She explained {{that the idea of}} filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely, stating [...] "there was one moment I was in China and I was in this huge suite and I {{looked out the window and}} there were just thousands of people walking and I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> life... I guess I was a bit lonely and I wanted to talk to someone so I opened up my computer and I just talked." [...] Additionally, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side. The album's track listing was confirmed on November 12, 2010. Both Jay-Z and Kanye West make guest appearances on the DVD. In November 2010, there was a sweepstakes to win tickets to an exclusive screening of the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{was giving}} up {{hope of finding}} Judy when she arrived in his new camp. [...] "I couldn’t <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> eyes. As I entered the camp, a scraggy dog hit me square between the {{shoulders}} and knocked me over! I’d never been {{so glad to see}} the old girl. And I think she felt the same!" [...] After four weeks at the new camp, they were moved back to Sumatra by paddle steamer. They had been told that it was a [...] "special mission" [...] to pick fruit. Instead they spent a year in Sumatra, with the Japanese using the men to cut through the jungle to lay railway track. Rations were a handful of maggot-ridden tapioca a day, which Frank continued to share with Judy. She also proved useful in conducting trades with the locals, as she would indicate when someone was hiding near to the track. Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the synagogue}} had {{undertaken}} innovations {{in some areas}} of Jewish law, it still insisted on strict adherence in others. In 1878 Tinter was dismissed for officiating at the marriage of a Jewish woman and Christian man, and Baith Israel was, for a time, the only congregation in Brooklyn that celebrated Jewish holidays for the traditional two days. In 1889 Baith Israel asserted it was [...] "the only orthodox congregation in the city", and that year the board forced the resignation of a Mr. J. Folkart, for transgressing the laws of Yom Kippur. In 1892, when Hyman Rosenberg was expelled as rabbi of Brooklyn's Beth Jacob synagogue for eating ham, the Brooklyn Eagle canvassed local rabbis for their views on the matter. While George Taubenhaus, rabbi of Beth Elohim stated, [...] "I do not <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> congregation would expel me if I ate ham", Baith Israel's rabbi Friedlander responded, [...] "While there are some differences between the reform and orthodox Jews, I do not think it is the place for any Jewish minister to eat ham. The reformers do not so strictly observe the old Mosaic law, but {{it does not seem to}} me a good example for a rabbi to set to his congregation." ...|$|E

500|$|Bob Boilen of NPR wrote, [...] "I simply couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> {{eyes and}} ears. Seeing Jackie Evancho sing {{for the first}} time is nearly beyond belief." [...] He called her voice [...] "beyond-beautiful" [...] when she {{performed}} [...] "for a stunned audience at the NPR Music offices. She clearly is a very happy girl with an amazing musical gift." [...] A review of her 2011 Sun Valley concert stated that [...] "Evancho transported [...] with pure, joyous, unaffected notes". Marcia Adair of the Los Angeles Times commented in reviewing Dream With Me that [...] "her voice has matured quite a lot over the past 10 months. ... hat makes us feel like she will survive the journey from child star to adult performer is her magnificent sense of pitch, her natural ability to shape phrases and the ease with which she performs." [...] Jon Caramanica, in The New York Times, reviewed her Avery Fisher Hall concert: [...] "In {{the first half of the}} show Ms. Evancho often receded, but toward the end of the night she found purpose, delivering 'A Time for Us' with punch, and closing out Sarah McLachlan’s 'Angel' with what felt like real yearning". The Wall Street Journal called Evancho's 2011 performance of the song [...] "Angel" [...] on the Tonight Show [...] "moving".|$|E
500|$|... "In the {{following}} days," [...] he predicted, [...] "further {{deterioration of the}} entire security and political situation is expected. There is a threat that interethnic conflicts in Posavina and Semberija might spread {{to other parts of}} the zone of responsibility... Direct armed provocations by SDA, HDZ , and SDS paramilitary units against commands and units are also possible, as well as attacks by them on military warehouses and isolated facilities." [...] On the same day, Bosnian Defense Minister Ejup Ganić and Croat members of the coalition government urged Izetbegović to mobilize the TORBiH due to the inability of the JNA to stop the violence. Izetbegović described the images coming out of Bijeljina as [...] "unbelievable". [...] "I thought it was a photomontage," [...] he explained. [...] "I couldn't <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> eyes. I couldn't believe it was possible." [...] He described the takeover as [...] "criminal", and said he considered the JNA responsible for Bijeljina's fall because it [...] "passively stood by and watched what was happening". Izetbegović mobilized the Territorial Defense later that day so as to [...] "enable people to defend themselves... from future Bijeljinas". The Serb members of the Bosnian Presidency, Plavšić and Nikola Koljević, denounced the mobilization as illegal and resigned. On 8 April, Izetbegović announced a [...] "state of imminent war danger". The JNA rejected requests from the Bosnian Presidency to return the TORBiH's weapons that they had confiscated in 1990. Karadžić and the Bosnian Serb leadership used Izetbegović's mobilization order as a pretext to independence and mobilized their Municipal Crisis Headquarters, reserve police units, and TO forces.|$|E

2500|$|Wooden had {{immediate}} success, fashioning {{the mark}} of the rarest of coaches, an [...] "instant turnaround" [...] for an undistinguished, faltering program. Part of this success was due to his unique offensive system, the same system that countless coaches use today. John Wooden stated, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>my</b> system is perfectly suited to counter all the modern defenses I have seen, and that includes run-and-jump, 1–3–1 trapping, box-and-one, triangle-and-two, and switching man-to-man." ...|$|E
