Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference {{was a factor in}} his being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that are products of the <b>biosocial.</b>|$|E

DBT is based on a <b>biosocial</b> theory of personality functioning in which the core problem is seen as the breakdown of the patient's cognitive, behavioral and emotional regulation systems when experiencing intense emotions.

25|$|According to Cloninger’s model, {{the early}} life onset of neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} lead to personality disorders, with individuals having low RD scores. Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) is characterized in behavioral terms by childhood or adolescent onset of recurrent antisocial behavior. Cloninger had predicted from his <b>biosocial</b> theory that individuals {{most at risk}} of aggressive, antisocial behavior, will be those with lower RD scores and these individuals are equated with the primary psychopaths who show aloofness and social detachment. Particular research conducted on childhood behavior has tested this theory and researchers have shown that children with lower RD scores have more of an anti-social profile as defined in the DSM, and are at highest risk for early onset of frequent delinquent behavior.|$|E

50|$|Weiss {{wanted to}} {{understand}} human behavior through a materialist and monist perspective. Specifically, {{he thought that}} human behavior and achievement could be combined to create one physical element. One of the ways he did this was by conducting biophysical and <b>biosocial</b> experiments {{to determine if there}} were physical changes in the body when a person had a <b>biosocial</b> response to external stimuli. He explained that <b>biosocial</b> responses were different from biophysical because it referred to one’s social (as opposed to physical) response to a stimulus. He further analyzed the results of his studies on an atomic level to further support his monist theories.|$|E

50|$|There {{have been}} cases where <b>biosocial</b> {{justification}} {{has been used}} without context to define a behavior {{in terms of being}} innate or uncontrollable. The use of the term and concept in this form can cause a great many problems and even crimes towards groups or people the term is set against. <b>Biosocial</b> behavior is often applied in contexts of biological sex and culture as these are common and significant factors on behavior that play important roles in behavior analysis. While it is not incorrect that <b>biosocial</b> can describe behavior related to these variables it can also be used incorrectly in that very same context. Studies that make assumptions or conclusions using <b>biosocial</b> factors as a basis should be taken with a grain of salt. Every human being is an individual, an identified and significant <b>biosocial</b> behavior is the result a statistical analysis of sampling from a large group of people and by its nature does not give results that can or should be applied on an individual basis under any circumstance abiding scientific moral and/or ethical conduct. This is clearly displayed in anthropology ethnographies which often pair individual interviews and personal narratives with any assumptions or observations by the author so that their basis and validity are present along with whatever claim the author wants to support.|$|E

5000|$|More specifically, the RSI model {{holds that}} human beings have two types of needs: <b>biosocial</b> and symbolic. <b>Biosocial</b> needs are innate needs, {{necessary}} for growth and survival, which are expressed in communication (e.g., when a person says, [...] "I need water" [...] to fulfill a biological need for water). Symbolic needs are those constituted by communication (e.g., when a person says, [...] "I need Brand X water" [...] because advertisers have persuaded the person to interpret Brand X as better meeting the need for health than tap water). In both cases, human beings create interdependencies with others to fulfill <b>biosocial</b> and symbolic needs. They learn from language tutors the social system's assumptions about what needs are important and how needs should be communicated and satisfied.|$|E

5000|$|It {{could be}} said that <b>Biosocial</b> {{behavior}} {{is the focus of}} sociobiology, but the definition of sociobiology put forth by E. O. Wilson; “The extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization" [...] it is more grounded in biology than anthropology where the term <b>biosocial</b> can often be found. The description of something that is <b>biosocial</b> in anthropological context is applied to humans, and as such it tends to lose its general relatedness to animals. The study of family structure has become increasingly popular, and as such our understanding of the multitude of individual social factors in conjunction with biological factors has expanded in this field. There exists serious risk of biological reductionism if solely biological factors are given consideration in behavioral analysis. It is vital to note that biological factors do not include race or ethnicity as a person's genetics have no bearing on these factors, nor can these factors be determined from genetic analysis.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} Matthew C. Gutmann, the Stanley J. Bernstein Assistant Professor of the Social Sciences-International Affairs in the Department of Anthropology at Brown University, {{has written}} about multiple books based on ethnography studies like; Changing Men and Masculinities in Latin America, The Meanings of Macho: Being a Man in Mexico City and Mainstreaming Men into Gender and Development, and Fixing Men; Sex, Birth Control, and AIDS in Mexico. All of his works have of highlights how <b>Biosocial</b> concepts like the gender role, personality, behaviors, self-control, and masculinity can become wrapped up in authoritative knowledge and medicine. Much of Gutmann's analysis come back to machismo, which has many contradicting definitions depending heavily on culture and context but {{most if not all}} of which assume heavily pronounced characteristics of sexuality and sexual activity along with dominance over partners or common pursuit of many partners. Latin American culture has a history of medicalization of male behaviors and sexuality leading to many norms and assumptions that are treated much like <b>biosocial</b> behavior concepts but without extensive scientific founding or support. This displays a different perspective of <b>biosocial</b> behavior, one that stems from and is supported by culture and that is applied based on a person's sex. The cause of <b>biosocial</b> behavior does not alter if the definition is correct but rather shows how crucial context is to understanding what the word is meant to convey.|$|E
