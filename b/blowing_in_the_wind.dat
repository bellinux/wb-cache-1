The figure holds their right hand to the window, signaling with three fingers, then one, and finally two.|$|E
5|$|Koji Sugimoto, main {{programmer}} for characters, {{said that}} {{the complexities of the}} PlayStation 2 hardware made mastering it difficult, but more rewarding because the details on Yuna's sleeves to the depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically. Final Fantasy X was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. Final Fantasy Xs spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression; with a player's progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry. Chiharu Minekawa, the supervising sound editor, commented that the transition in sound from one environment to the next was done seamlessly in order to mimic the natural surroundings of these environments as the player moved through them.|$|E

Natural circles would have been observed, such as the Moon, Sun, and a short plant stalk <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> on sand, which forms a circle shape in the sand. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus.|$|E

Despite {{constant}} phone calls to studio representatives begging for work, he is repeatedly confronted by [...] "No Casting Today" [...] signs. He cannot afford to buy food, and bills that {{he is unable to}} pay are constantly slipped under his door. A series of images symbolizing his mental anguish are shown, including twisted trees <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and a man laying on the stairway leading to [...] "SUCCESS", still unable to reach the top. He falls to the ground, starving, exhausted, and in a state of despair over his failures. Finally, he dies, and after images are shown of the other actors laughing at him, his tombstone is revealed to read [...] "Here Lies No. 9413, a Hollywood Extra", next to the words [...] "No Casting Today".|$|E
500|$|Orbison did not {{authorize the}} use of the song or know {{it was going to be}} used, but {{the use of}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] proved {{beneficial}} to his career, which had stalled in the 1970s. BAM magazine called the song [...] "the emotional epicenter of the film". Orbison biographer Ellis Amburn called [...] "In Dreams" [...] deceptively simple and that it is used to significant effect in Blue Velvet because it suggests dreaming is preferable to waking, and power and control are the real themes of the song, instead of love, longing, and loss. The film made the song a cult favorite, and after seeing it a few times, Orbison reconsidered his stance on its use. Footage of the film is featured in the 1987 music video of [...] "In Dreams", and interspersed with live action shots of Orbison's image projected over a filmy linen cloth <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind.</b>|$|E

500|$|Ball {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by two encounters {{he had in}} the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for 10 minutes, saying later that it provoked an [...] "unexpected emotional response". In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he [...] "felt like there was a real story underneath [...] more fascinating and way more tragic" [...] than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was [...] "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.|$|E
500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Love On Top" [...] {{after having}} {{said on the}} black carpet about an hour previous to going on stage {{that she would be}} making an announcement. Before beginning her live performance, she said to the audience: [...] "Tonight I want you to stand up on your feet, I want you to feel the love that's growing inside of me", giving a hint about the news that she had alluded to on the black carpet. She took the stage in [...] "a purple spangly tuxedo jacket, black pants and white tuxedo shirt, still rocking her fierce six-inch heels of old, pregnant or not", as stated by Gil Kaufman of MTV News. As she performed, her blond hair <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and backed by six dancers wearing similar shimmering tuxes, Beyoncé gave new meaning to the lyrics: [...] "Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear." [...] She kept her dancing to a minimum for most of the song as she held onto the microphone stand while singing [...] "Love On Top". Eventually making her way to the extended lip in front of the stage and throwing down, she encouraged the audience to put their hands together. Beyoncé ended the performance by dropping the microphone, opening her jacket, rubbing her belly, and thus announcing her pregnancy to the world.|$|E
2500|$|The Society for Growing Australian Plants (now Australian Native Plants Society (Australia)) Eremophila Study Group {{has focused}} {{attention}} on propagating eremophila species {{with varying degrees of}} success. This eremophile has been seen as a highly desirable garden plant because of its density of flowers. [...] "It resembles a bridal veil <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> when in flower". Propagation from cuttings is very difficult for this species and Grafting onto Myoporum rootstock is preferred for this species in domestic gardens to avoid the problems of suckering. Its frost tolerance, and hardiness in drought, makes it a species that is noted for inclusion in difficult gardens, however it can cause skin irritation in some people.|$|E

The camera pans past a newspaper <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> stating [...] "The Dead Walk!", a direct homage to George Romero's work on Day of the Dead. Another homage is one episode of Stroker & Hoop featured the characters battling zombies using guns made by Double-Wide. They turn out to fire only sunlight, which he claims is because of zombies' vulnerability to sunlight, hinted at by the film being called Night of the Dead and not Day of the Dead.

2500|$|Van Gogh, who [...] "particularly admired a poem {{written by}} Walt Whitman about the beauty in {{a blade of}} grass", began {{painting}} waving stalks of wheat in Paris. [...] In 1887 he made Wheat Field with a Lark where Impressionist influences are reflected in his use of color and management of light and shadow. Brush strokes are made to reflect the objects, like the stalks of wheat. [...] The work reflects {{the motion of the}} wheat <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> the lark flying and the clouds streaking from the currents in the sky. [...] The cycles of life are reflected in the land left by harvested wheat and the growing wheat subject to the forces of the wind, as we are subject to the pressures in our lives. [...] The cycle of life depicted here is both tragic and comforting. [...] The stubble of the harvested wheat reflect the inevitable cycle of death, while the stalks of wheat, flying bird and windswept clouds reflect continual change. [...] Edge of a Wheat Field with Poppies, shown below in black and white, was also painted in 1887.|$|E
