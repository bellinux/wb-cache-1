40|$|As humans, {{we tend to}} {{perceive}} minds in both living and non-living entities, such as robots. From a questionnaire developed in a previous mind perception study, authors found that perceived minds could be located on two dimensions experience and agency. This questionnaire allowed the assessment of how we perceive minds of various entities from a multi-dimensional point of view. In this questionnaire, subjects had to evaluate explicit mental capacities of target characters (e. g. capacity to feel hunger). However, we sometimes perceive minds in non-living entities, even though we cannot attribute these evidently <b>biological</b> <b>capacities</b> to the entity. In this study, we performed a large-scale web survey to assess mind perception by using the semantic differential scale method. We revealed that two mind dimensions emotion and intelligence respectively corresponded to the two mind dimensions (experience and agency) proposed in a previous mind perception study. We did this without having to ask about specific mental capacities. We believe that the semantic differential scale is a useful method to assess the dimensions of mind perception especially for non-living entities {{that are hard to}} be attributed to <b>biological</b> <b>capacities...</b>|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} has {{an important}} role in photosynthesis, magnetoreception, and evolution. There were many attempts in an effort to explain the structure of genetic code and transfer of information from DNA to protein by using the concepts of quantum mechanics. The existing biological quantum channel models are not sufficiently general to incorporate all relevant contributions responsible for imperfect protein synthesis. Moreover, the problem of determination of quantum <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity</b> is still an open problem. To solve these problems, we construct the operator-sum representation of biological channel based on codon basekets (basis vectors), and determine the quantum channel model suitable for study of the quantum <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity</b> and beyond. The transcription process, DNA point mutations, insertions, deletions, and translation are interpreted as the quantum noise processes. The various types of quantum errors are classified into several broad categories: (i) storage errors that occur in DNA itself as it represents an imperfect storage of genetic information, (ii) replication errors introduced during DNA replication process, (iii) transcription errors introduced during DNA to mRNA transcription, and (iv) translation errors introduced during the translation process. By using this model, we determine the <b>biological</b> quantum channel <b>capacity</b> and compare it against corresponding classical <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity.</b> We demonstrate that the quantum <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity</b> is higher than the classical one, for a coherent quantum channel model, suggesting that quantum effects have {{an important role in}} biological systems.

40|$|Notions like ‘biolinguistics’ have {{a trivial}} and a non-trivial interpretation. According to the trivial version, a {{cultural}} phenomenon like language is only {{based on our}} innate <b>biological</b> <b>capacities.</b> Language, in this view, {{is not a matter}} of biology per se but of applied biology, i. e. a form of technology. Under this interpretation, ‘biolinguistics’ is uncontroversial and trivial because all our cultural activities are grounded in our biology. According to the non-trivial interpretation, the concept of language can be sufficiently narrowly construed so that we can define a core capacity that is comparable to a biological organ (like the heart or the liver). Recently, it has become common to see this ‘faculty of language in the narrow sense’ (FLN) as some abstract form of syntax characterized by recursive Merge. According to this article, only the trivial interpretation of ‘biolinguistics’ is correct. It does not make sense to define language in such a way that it excludes words. Words are human inventions and the necessary tools to give linguistic functionality to whatever <b>biological</b> <b>capacities</b> for recursive syntax we may have. Ultimately, this means that only ‘lexicalist’ versions of generative grammar can be correct. The agentive function assignment involved in the invention of words distinguishes language from bodily organs, which do not derive their functionality from human agency. More generally, cultural transparency of biological structures is rejected as an ideological form of Panglossian determinism and a denial of the “ceaseless creativity” and freedom coming with human agency...|$|R

50|$|E. robusta {{have very}} {{adaptable}} (plastic) behavior {{compared to other}} bee species. They have no morphological castes and females {{have the option of}} nesting alone or in groups. However, in larger colonies they do show behavioral differentiation in which colony members will specialize as guards, nurses, or foragers. It {{is important to note that}} these differences are behavioral, not morphological, meaning that every colony member has the <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> to perform any role. The social structure of E. robusta is polyphenic, meaning different behavioral phenotypes can arise from the same genotype based upon environmental conditions. Depending on habitat, these bees can exhibit solitary, semisocial, quasisocial, or eusocial colony structure. The type of sociality found in this species of bee largely depends upon the number of broods produced per season. In most cases, only one brood is produced per season, leading to a quasisocial organization. However, some heathland populations have been shown to produce two broods per season, allowing for the incidence of sibling rearing and therefore the presence of eusociality. Essentially, social polyphenism allows E. robusta to respond to changing environments by keeping their behavior plastic.|$|E
50|$|To many, such {{cultural}} associations appear persuasive {{in view of}} {{the fact}} that in humans, the menstrual cycle quite closely approximates the moon’s 29.5-day synodic cycle, unlike in chimpanzees (~36 days) or bonobos (~40 days). Statistical information from hunter gatherers is lacking, but where large-scale western studies focus on women’s peak reproductive years - removing outlier values - the cycle length gravitates around 29.1-29.5 days, while the figure for women in their thirties shortens toward 28 days. In no extant human population has statistically significant lunar phase-locking been demonstrated. Turning to the evolutionary past, however, a possible adaptive basis for the <b>biological</b> <b>capacity</b> would be reproductive levelling: among primates, synchronising to any natural clock makes it difficult for an alpha male to monopolise fertile sex with multiple females. This would be consistent with the striking gender egalitarianism of extant non-storage hunter-gatherer societies. A further deep-time evolutionary pressure may have been lions’ habit of eating people on moonless nights. When early Pleistocene hominids in Africa were attempting to survive by robbing big cats of their kills, according to some evolutionary scientists, it may have been adaptive to restrict overnight journeys - including sexual liaisons - to times when there was a moon in the sky.|$|E

This paper examines the relationship between Searle’s conception of the Background and his commitment to biological naturalism. It is first observed that the arguments Searle ventures in support of the Background’s existence do not entail a naturalistic interpretation.

To solve for these problems, we propose novel quantum mechanical models to accurately describe the process of creation spontaneous, induced, and adaptive mutations and their propagation in time. Different biological channel models with memory, proposed in this paper, include: (i) Markovian classical model, (ii) Markovian-like quantum model, and (iii) hybrid quantum-classical model. We then apply these models in a study of aging and evolution of quantum <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity</b> through generations.

These models are quite general and applicable to many open problems in biology, not only <b>biological</b> channel <b>capacity,</b> which is the main focus of the paper. We will show that the famous quantum Master equation approach, commonly used to describe different biological processes, is just the first-order approximation of the proposed quantum Markov chain-like model, when the observation interval tends to zero. One of the important implications of this model is that the aging phenotype becomes determined by different underlying transition probabilities in both programmed and random (damage) Markov chain-like models of aging, which are mutually coupled...|$|R
