50|$|The {{drudgery}} and inhospitable {{living conditions}} of the nuns in a nunnery are explained vividly by Kim Gutschow thus: The nuns serve as the worker bees in the monastic hive, which is over seen by monks engaged in their ritual ministrations. Nuns work from dawn to dusk processing the monastery’s vast wealth of grain, apples, apricots and wool. While the monastery sores skyward, {{at the end of}} a secluded valley, far above the distractions of human livelihood, the squat and ramshackle nunnery sits amid the monastic fields and orchards. The nuns’ quarters are bursting with odd heaps of <b>barley,</b> <b>drying</b> apricots, woollen homespun waiting to be dyed, abandoned looms, and plowshares in various states of disrepair. Nuns spun most of their waking hours working or cooking for the monastic estate, while living in rooms bereft of religious images.|$|E

25|$|The {{model for}} Japanese whiskies {{is the single}} malt Scotch, {{although}} there are also examples of Japanese blended whiskies. The base is a mash of malted <b>barley,</b> <b>dried</b> in kilns fired with a little peat (although considerably less than in Scotland), and distilled using the pot still method. Before 2000, Japanese whisky was primarily for the domestic market and exports were limited. Japanese whiskies such as Suntory and Nikka won many prestigious international awards between 2007 and 2014. Japanese whisky has earned a reputation for quality.|$|R

5000|$|The {{oldest and}} most {{predominant}} ingredient in brewing is barley, which {{has been used in}} beer-making for thousands of years. Modern brewing predominantly uses malted barley for its enzymatic power, but ancient Babylonian recipes indicate that, without the ability to malt grain in a controlled fashion, baked bread was simply soaked in water [...]Malted <b>barley</b> <b>dried</b> at a sufficiently low temperature contains enzymes such as amylase, which convert starch into sugar. Therefore, sugars can be extracted from the barley's own starches simply by soaking the grain in water at a controlled temperature; this is mashing.|$|R

40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} the feeding value of grain sorghum relative to corn and various grain processing methods for grain sorghum. It {{has been widely}} recognized that grain sorghum (milo) must be processed to be efficiently used by finishing cattle. Grain sorghum shows more improved utilization from processing than corn, wheat and <b>barley.</b> <b>Dry</b> ground or rolled grain sorghum has a relative feeding value of 85 % to 95 % (avg 90 %) of dry rolled corn. Processing grain sorghum by more sophisticated methods (early harvesting, steam-flaking, etc.) greatly enhances its feeding value. Chemical composition suggests {{that there should be}} less difference in the feeding value of grain sorghum compared with corn than what actually exists. Starch, which represents 70 % of the dry matter, and protein appear to be less digestible in grain sorghum than in other grains. The rate that starch is digested in the rumen of cattle is also much slower for grain sorghum than for other grains. Thus, processing grain sorghum increases rate and extent of starch digestion resulting in large improvements in its feeding value...|$|R

This {{study was conducted}} over 17. 833 hectares of irrigated wheat fields and 15. 500 hectares of dry land wheat in Saveh city, Iran, in the harvest year of 2003 - 2004. The data was collected from three different sources: questionnaire, literature reviewand field measurement. Total energy consumption for wheat in irrigated farming systems and dry land farming systems was estimated 51, 587 and 12, 543 MJ/ha. The average operational energy consumption for cultivation of irrigated farming system and dry land farming system was 36107 and 6067 MJ/ha, respectively. The maximum energy consumed in operational wheat production was about 28, 301 MJ/ha for irrigated farming systems, including irrigation and It was 3, 582 MJ/ha for dry land farming, including tillage,. Energy consumption {{in the production of}} one-kilogram of wheat, in irrigated farming and dry land farming systems, on average, was 13. 5 MJ/kg and 10. 4 MJ/kg, respectively.

Results indicated that hens show preference for moist, non-ensiled materials, but ensiled materials are not rejected. Further investigations took place focusing on physical characteristics as experiment two results suggested a preference for unfermented products. Experiment three examined the provision of a forage-able substrate which was edible (wet or <b>dry</b> <b>barley)</b> or not (plastic lace), and found that edible materials increase the time spent at the feeder. Experiment four tested the preference for particle size of various edible materials (oats, silage and alfalfa) and found hens spend more time with smaller particles sizes of silage and oat materials. The final experiment (Experiment five) used a supplement with all preferred characteristics (wet pea fibre) to determine its impact on feather pecking in birds housed in conventional and enriched cages. Birds given supplemental material did not increase time spent at the feeder, and feathers showed no more or less wear than would be expected from the housing system. Vent scores (areas typically affected by pecking) tended to improve under the presence of pea fibre. Feather pecking decreased when hens were offered pea fibre when housed in large group and enriched cages. Decreased body weight, heavier gizzards, and improved feed efficiency (balanced feed per dozen eggs) point towards improved digestive efficiencies with consumed fibre, even though elongation of the ileum and jejunum seem to contradict this hypothesis. While highly preferred, moist, non-ensiled, low nutrient pea fibre did not impact hen welfare to the degree seen in previous studies with silage. However, similar feedstuffs are still a possible means of enrichment to reduce feather pecking and increase welfare in laying hens, and future research should continue with different bird strains and materials for enrichment, as well as examining hen digestive efficiencies and effects on production costs...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate whether established methods of analysis of protein content in barley (Kjeldahl, Dumas, or NIT (short for Near Infrared Transmittance)) gives different results for wet and <b>dried</b> <b>barley.</b> This was carried out because there are concerns regarding the well-worn NIT prediction model giving different results for these conditions and that such an error causes significant price fluctuations on the market. By performing analyses of samples, {{both before and after}} drying, of the three different barley varieties Tipple, Prestige, and Quench, with all the techniques, data was obtained that could be analyzed statistically. The study showed that the NIT prediction model gives results for wet barley that is about 0. 29 percentage points higher compared to <b>dried</b> <b>barley.</b> This difference was also statistically significant when a t-test was performed. The same difference was substantially smaller for Kjeldahl and Dumas and furthermore not statistically significant. When the difference between the different barley varieties is studied a deviation of 0. 34 percentage points was obtained for Tipple, 0. 18 percentage points for Prestige, and 0. 30 percentage points for Quench. NIT, thereby, gave results with greatest deviation when wet Tipple was analyzed. When t-tests were performed for each barley variety, it was found that results for all varieties differ significantly between wet and <b>dry</b> <b>barley.</b> A study of the difference between the crude protein content determination by Kjeldahl and Dumas was also performed by calculating the mean differences between the various methods of determination.
