Æthelwold probably tutored Edgar as a boy, and was very close to him; it is likely that Æthelwold was influential in persuading the king to carry through his reforms and support <b>Benedictine</b> monasticism. Monks became dominant on the bishops' bench during his reign.|$|E

5|$|In seventh- and eighth-century England, most monasteries were <b>Benedictine,</b> but in {{the ninth}} century {{learning}} and monasticism declined severely. Alfred the Great (871–899) deplored the decline and started to reverse it. The court of Æthelstan (924–939), the first king of the whole of England, was cosmopolitan, and future reformers such as Dunstan and Æthelwold learned from Continental exponents of <b>Benedictine</b> monasticism. The English movement became dominant under King Edgar (959–975), who supported the expulsion of secular clergy from monasteries and cathedral chapters, and their replacement by monks. The reformers had close relations with the crown, furthering its interests and depending on its support. The movement was confined {{to the south and}} midlands, as the crown was not strong enough in the north to confiscate property from local elites to establish <b>Benedictine</b> foundations in the area. The movement declined after the deaths of its leading exponents {{at the end of the}} tenth century.|$|E
