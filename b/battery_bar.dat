5000|$|The Extra Stage, {{originally}} {{introduced in}} 1st Mix and reintroduced in DDRMAX (and appears in subsequent arcade versions), rewards a player for receiving a grade of [...] "AA" [...] or higher on either Expert or Challenge difficulties {{on the final}} stage. The player receives {{the opportunity to play}} a free extra song, which often defaults to a very difficult song with forced modifiers (such as 1.5x speed and Reverse) and a life bar identical to the <b>battery</b> <b>bar</b> similar to Challenge mode with 1-4 lives depending on their score in the final stage (or a non-regaining life bar before Supernova 2). Beginning on SuperNova 2, players may be able to access the modifier menu and the forced modifiers (save for the <b>battery</b> <b>bar)</b> are no longer used. However, the Replicant-D Action event in DDR X2 did not allow players to select modifiers for its Encore Extra Stage.|$|E
5000|$|Lacking {{sufficient}} cannon {{of their}} own, the Guardsmen were badly outgunned by the enemy. As described by Segur: [...] "Russian battalions and <b>batteries</b> <b>barred</b> the horizon {{on all three}} sidesâ€”in front, on our right, and behind us" ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2012, several U.S. owners {{reported}} seeing only 11 of 12 <b>battery</b> capacity <b>bars</b> on the in-car display which {{led them to}} believe they had lost some battery capacity. As time went on, more people {{reported seeing}} the issue, and some had lost two, three, and even in rare cases, four <b>battery</b> capacity <b>bars.</b> The <b>battery</b> capacity loss problem seems to be concentrated in regions with hot climate, and Phoenix, Arizona {{and the state of}} Texas in particular. In July 2012, Nissan responded by saying they were investigating the issue, and a carmaker spokesman also said that [...] "the problem is isolated to maybe 0.3 percent of the 13,000 Leafs on U.S. roads, and the company reportedly has loaned cars to some Leaf owners in Arizona as it researches the issue." [...] This is equivalent to around 40 vehicles have experienced a loss of any <b>battery</b> capacity <b>bars.</b>|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{hybrid power}} {{dispatching}} problem, the PV unit (blue bars) provides 34.5 % total power, the <b>battery</b> (green <b>bars)</b> is 12.4 % and the EFC (red bars) is about 53.1 %. Notably, the {{battery is charged}} from the EFC is about 56.1 % and 43.9 % from the PV. It implies that the PV power is used to save 39.9 % fuel consumption.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} other titles in the Sims Stories series, Pet Stories is {{designed}} around the bare bones of the base Sims 2 game engine, making it more optimized for Laptops and low end computers. By default, the title plays in Windowed mode, but can be changed to play in regular full screen. It also features a <b>battery</b> <b>bar</b> to show how much battery you have left, if playing on a laptop.|$|E
5000|$|On week 6, the housemates {{were given}} a Big Tablet, which {{contains}} [...] "apps" [...] they can use. The Big Tablet is available for a week, and it has ten battery bars. One <b>battery</b> <b>bar</b> is deducted for every app they use. Below are the [...] "apps", and their corresponding definitions. They can use these apps at any time, and they can use it multiple times. Their first app, Games, was given as a [...] "free trial", therefore no battery bars were deducted.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s the Mid-Ulster Brigade became {{somewhat}} less prominent as Belfast became {{the centre of}} UVF activity. The brigade remained active and continued to launch attacks. One such attack occurred in Coagh on 29 November 1989, when {{a unit of the}} Mid-Ulster Brigade entered the <b>Battery</b> <b>Bar</b> and opened fire. Two men were killed in the attack, Michael Devlin, a civilian and Liam Ryan, an important figure in the Provisional IRA East Tyrone Brigade. A series of tit-for-tat shootings began between the Mid-Ulster Brigade and the Provisional IRA, with Catholic civilian Martin Byrne and ex-IRA man Sam Marshall killed in two separate attacks in Lurgan in early 1990. Three more killings followed, including one Protestant shot in a case of mistaken identity, before 19-year-old Denis Carville was killed in Portadown on 6 October. In each case the IRA responded by killing members of the security forces or people working for them, as the killings on both sides spiralled.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} to develop {{instrumentation}} and measurement of temperature and heat flux with unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution by placing micro thermocouple and heat flux sensor arrays at the very vicinity of the weld spot in battery tab joining. The sensor arrays will be direct fabricated {{on the surface of}} the <b>battery</b> interconnect bus <b>bar</b> materials, particularly at the interconnect surface. It will also develop instrumentation by embedding the micro thermocouple and heat flux sensor arrays at the anvil for characterization of weld quality...|$|R
5000|$|In {{designing}} the LSSM MTA, full use {{was made of}} all earlier small-rover studies, and commercially available components were incorporated wherever possible. The selection of wheels was of great importance, and almost nothing was known at that time about the lunar surface. The MSFC Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) was responsible for predicting surface properties. BECO was also the prime support contractor for the SSL {{and set up a}} test area to examine a wide variety of wheel-surface conditions. To simulate Pavlics' [...] "resilient wheel," [...] a four-foot-diameter inner tube wrapped with nylon ski rope was used. On the MTA, each wheel had a small electric motor, with overall power provided by standard truck <b>batteries.</b> A roll <b>bar</b> gave protection from overturn accidents.|$|R
50|$|Deus Ex: Mankind Divided {{is played}} through a first-person perspective, with a third-person cover system, and {{combines}} {{elements of a}} first-person shooter, with a role-playing upgrade system and dialogue trees. The game allows the player to tackle situations using combat, hacking, stealth, and social interactions. Features include gun customization, remote hacking, the Icarus dash (short-range silent teleportation), TESLA arcs (up to four non-lethal projectiles), the Titan shield (invincible shell), a radar with map layouts, and a changed energy system (energy {{is no longer a}} series of <b>batteries</b> but one <b>bar</b> that slowly refills). Similar to the Director's Cut of Human Revolution, killing {{is not the only way}} to win a boss battle, making it possible to complete the game without killing anyone. The XP system has been changed so that the stealth approach doesn't have an XP advantage.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} to examine the economic viability and performance analysis of a microcontroller based solar powered battery operated autorickshaw (m-SBAR), for the developing countries, which is compared with different types of rickshaws such as pedal rickshaw (PR), <b>battery</b> operated autorickshaw (<b>BAR),</b> and solar-powered <b>battery</b> operated autorickshaw (SBAR), available in Bangladesh. The BAR consists of a rickshaw structure, a battery bank, a battery charge controller, a DC motor driver, and a DC motor whereas the proposed m-SBAR contains additional components like solar panel and microcontroller based DC motor driver. The complete design considered the local radiation data and load profile of the proposed m-SBAR. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) analysis, Net Present Worth, payback periods, and Benefit-to-Cost Ratio methods {{have been used to}} evaluate the financial feasibility and sensitivity analysis of m-SBAR, grid-powered BAR, and PR. The numerical analysis reveals that LCOE and Benefit-to-Cost Ratio of the proposed m-SBAR are lower compared to the grid-powered BAR. It has also been found that microcontroller based DC motor control circuit reduces battery discharge rate, improves battery life, and controls motor speed efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Li-ion cells {{provide an}} energy dense {{solution}} for systems that require rechargeable electrical power. However, these cells can undergo thermal runaway, {{the point at}} which the cell becomes thermally unstable and results in hot gas, flame, electrolyte leakage, and in some cases explosion. The heat and fire associated with this type of event is generally violent and can subsequently cause damage to the surrounding system or present a dangerous risk to the personnel nearby. The space flight environment is especially sensitive to risks particularly when it involves potential for fire within the habitable volume of the International Space Station (ISS). In larger battery packs such as Robonaut 2 (R 2), numerous Li-ion cells are placed in parallel-series configurations to obtain the required stack voltage and desired run-time or to meet specific power requirements. This raises a second and less obvious concern for batteries that undergo certification for space flight use: the joining quality at the resistance spot weld of battery cells to component wires/leads and <b>battery</b> tabs, bus <b>bars</b> or other electronic components and assemblies. Resistance spot welds undergo materials evaluation, visual inspection, conductivity (resistivity) testing, destructive peel testing, and metallurgical examination in accordance with applicable NASA Process Specifications. Welded components are cross-sectioned to ensure they are free of cracks or voids open to any exterior surface. Pore and voids contained within the weld zone but not open to an exterior surface, and are not determined to have sharp notch like characteristics, shall be acceptable. Depending on requirements, some battery cells are constructed of aluminum canisters while others are constructed of steel. Process specific weld schedules must be developed and certified for each possible joining combination. The aluminum canisters' positive terminals were particularly difficult to weld due to a bi-metal strip that comes ultrasonically pre-welded by the manufacturer. This was further complicated as the maximum electrode force was limited to low-electrode force to prevent deflection of the aluminum can during welding. Other Li-ion cells are comprised of smaller diameter cylindrical steel canisters which are inherently capable of handling greater force from the electrodes. Allowing higher-electrode forces aids greatly in insuring a consistent resistance network for the weld. Overall lessons learned: developing good jigs is critical to insure the parts and electrodes are planer to one another and the location of the weld sites remains accurate and repeatable; maintaining strict control over materials is critical [...] materials must be of a specific hardness and chemical composition to insure that a weld schedule is repeatable; accuracy of the die used to stamp the projections is critical and worth the investment; and proper seasoning of the electrodes is critical to producing consistent welds [...] once the electrodes have been properly seasoned, cleaning/dressing should be avoided until it is absolutely necessary...|$|R
