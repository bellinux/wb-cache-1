40|$|The {{effect of}} {{transverse}} {{stress on the}} critical current density, J{sub c}, {{has been shown to}} be significant in <b>bronze</b> <b>process</b> Nb{sub 3 }Sn, with the onset of significant degradation at about 50 Mpa. In an applied field of 10 T, the magnitude of the effect is about seven times larger for transverse stress than for axial tensile stress. In a subsequent study, similar results were observed in another <b>bronze</b> <b>process</b> Nb{sub 3 }Sn conductor made by a different manufacturer. The mechanism accounting for the transverse stress effect and its large magnitude compared with the axial tensile effect is still the subject of speculation. In an attempt to better understand the nature of the effect, The authors have undertaken a series of experiments to determine whether the transverse stress effect depends on the grain morphology of the Nb{sub 3 }Sn reaction layer in the superconductor. To do this, the authors have measured the effect in an internal tin conductor with excess tin, which yields a more equiaxed Nb{sub 3 }Sn grain morphology than for <b>bronze</b> <b>process</b> Nb{sub 3 }Sn, where the grains are more columnar.

Ti-addition during growth of V 3 Ga superconductor by coupling V and Cu(Ga) -solid solution by <b>bronze</b> <b>process</b> increases the critical current density (J(c)) significantly. In this manuscript, the exact role of Ti-addition is studied based on systematic and quantitative diffusion-couple experiments that mimic the bronze-method. Metallurgical aspects like microstructural features and growth mechanism are assessed critically. Results are compared when Ti is added either to V or Cu(Ga) and to both for a fixed Ga content. Ti-addition to Cu(Ga) compared to V increases growth kinetics of V 3 Ga more significantly. Quantitative EPMA-analysis indicates that a mixture of Ti-free and Ti-containing V 3 Ga phase grows when Ti is added to V. Small precipitates grow along with Ti-containing V 3 Ga when Ti is added only to Cu(Ga). TEM-study indicates that these precipitates are rich in V and Ti. Much finer grains found in the precipitate-containing region lead to higher growth kinetics due to grain-boundary diffusion. EBSD-analysis shows equiaxed grains and relatively random in orientation because of alloying. This study indicates that Ti addition to Cu(Ga) is most effective considering metallurgical aspects that influence J(c). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} Ta on the superconducting properties of Ti doped <b>bronze</b> <b>processed</b> (Nb, Ta, Ti) 3 Sn multifilamentary wires. The study was carried out on wires with identical configuration, consisting of 14, 641 filaments with 4. 5 mum diameter embedded in a Ti bearing Osprey bronze and externally stabilized by copper. Several wires were made using either Nb 7. 5 Ta or pure Nb as a filament material, some of them containing a core of NbTi as a supplementary Ti source. All wires were manufactured by three hot extrusion steps, cold drawing and several intermediate anneals. Wire samples with round and rectangular cross sections have been prepared and reacted with various heat treatments between 550 and 730 degC. The residual Sn content in the Cu-Sn-Ti bronze after reaction {{and the degree of}} reaction of the filaments were determined by means of EDS and SEM analysis, respectively.

40|$|The ITER {{toroidal}} field (TF) strand procurement {{initiated the}} largest Nb 3 Sn superconducting strand production hitherto. The industrial-scale production started in Japan in 2008 and finished in summer 2015. Six ITER partners (so-called Domestic Agencies, or DAs) {{are in charge}} of the procurement and involved eight different strand suppliers all over the world, of which four are using the <b>bronze</b> route (BR) <b>process</b> and four the internal-tin (IT) process. In total more than 500 tons have been produced including excess material covering losses during the conductor manufacturing process, in particular the cabling. The procurement is based on a functional specification where the main strand requirements like critical current, hysteresis losses, Cu ratio and residual resistance ratio are specified but not the strand production process or layout. This paper presents the analysis on the data acquired during the quality control (QC) process that was carried out to ensure the same conductor performance requirements are met by the different strand suppliers regardless of strand design. The strand QC is based on 100 % billet testing and on applying statistical process control (SPC) limits. Throughout the production, samples adjacent to the strand pieces tested by the suppliers are cross-checked ('verified') by their respective DAs reference labs. The level of verification was lowered from 100 % {{at the beginning of the}} procurement progressively to approximately 25 % during the final phase of production. Based on the complete dataset of the TF strand production, an analysis of the SPC limits of the critical strand parameters is made and the related process capability indices are calculated. In view of the large-scale production and costs, key manufacturing parameters such as billet yield, number of breakages and piece-length distribution are also discussed. The results are compared among all the strand suppliers, focusing on the difference between BR and IT processes. Following the completion of the largest Nb 3 Sn strand production, our experience gained from monitoring the execution of the QC activities and from auditing the results from the measurements is summarised for future superconducting strand material procurement activities...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a disintegrating core-body for use in an art bronze foundry, which employs the ceramic shell investment process, begins with an investigation of four principal materials that will constitute the core formula. The specifications for {{the disintegration of the}} designed core-body formula fall within the parameters that are normally set and used in the ceramic shell art <b>bronze</b> casting <b>process.</b> The raison d’ être for the disintegrating formula is {{based on the premise that}} cement breaks down (spalling) after being subjected to heat above a certain temperature. It was shown that pure cement in the form of naked test bars 100 mm x 20 mm x 20 mm does indeed break down into separate pieces when fired to and above 9000 C; where 9000 C is the lowest recommended temperature required for sintering the ceramic shell investment mould. The addition of calcium carbonate to pure cement in the form of naked test bars, produced a more unified formula that did not break into separate pieces when fired to 9450 C. However this combination of cement and calcium carbonate had a slow setting time of 12 hours and a shrinkage value of 2, 3 %, which were both above the parameters being sought for a quick-setting formula with a shrinkage value of below 1 %. The combination of cement, plaster of paris and silica produced formulae that set within six hours and had shrinkage values of less than 1 % but did not disintegrate within 72 hours. It was only after the addition of calcium carbonate to the these mixes that formulae resulted that set within six hours, had relatively low shrinkage values and showed signs of breaking up after 60 hours. It was further shown that by altering the ratios of cement, plaster of paris, calcium carbonate and silica, that the parameters for quick-setting formulae with shrinkage values of 1 % and below, that also disintegrated within 55 hours, could be achieved. xvi It was also proved by subjecting these formulae to higher relative humidity conditions that the disintegrating times could be reduced and brought to below 48 hours. Selected formulae were then subjected to temperatures of between 9000 C and 10000 C. It was found that as the temperatures were increased so the disintegration times were reduced and were even further reduced under higher relative humidity conditions. It was found from the above experiments that the selected formula determined to be suitable in all respects as a disintegrating core-body was too difficult to remove from the hollow bronze cast when subjected to an actual bronze pour. Further experimentation using increased proportions of silica in the formula resulted in a final core-body that could be quickly and easily removed from its bronze cast as soon as the core-body had cooled to room temperature. The selected core-body formula (F 21 D) that was used in the final set of bronze casting procedures was found to function optimally when fired to a temperature of 9000 C and could be quickly and easily removed from the bronze casts leaving a clean inner bronze surface, free from any remnants of the fired core. The document concludes by recording the delimitations and advantages of the final core-body formula F 21 D, as well as making recommendations based on these parameters for further study relating to disintegrating core-body formulations...|$|R
