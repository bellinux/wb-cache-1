40|$|In {{different}} scientific disciplines, {{decision making}} is studied by examining how options are perceived or generated in isolated situations. In this chapter we explore the benefits of an interdisciplinary approach to understanding option perception within human behavior. As {{a consequence of the}} contributions from different disciplines, we present a framework that describes the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>links</b> between decision making, perception, and action. We will argue that, given their interdependency, the study of decision making profits greatly from a more integrated view of the situations it studies. The framework also illustrates how constraints may influence these <b>bidirectional</b> <b>links.</b> Finally, we use this framework to convey new ideas for experimental paradigms, data interpretation, and applications. © 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Detection and {{isolation}} of link failures under the Laplacian consensus dynamics {{have been the}} focus of our previous study. Our results relate the failure of links in the network to jump discontinuities in the derivatives of the output responses of the nodes and exploit that relation to propose failure detection {{and isolation}} (FDI) techniques, accordingly. In this work, we extend the results to general linear networked dynamics. In particular, we show that with additional niceties of the integrator networks and the enhanced proofs, we are able to incorporate both unidirectional and <b>bidirectional</b> <b>link</b> failures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{bidirectional}} shufflenet topology, which is {{obtained from the}} well-known (unidirectional) shufflenet by considering <b>bidirectional</b> <b>links.</b> More specifically, we define a shortest path routing algorithm, and derive the diameter and the average distance of the topology. The bidirectional shufflenet is then compared, in terms of average distance, with other variations of the perfect shuffle. <b>Bidirectional</b> <b>links</b> are very common in real networks. Possible applications of bidirectional shufflenets are wormhole routing electronic networks with backpressure flow control, and wavelength routing optical networks.

For those identified with literacy difficulties as children, deficits in the skills related to sublexical level decoding skills can persist into adulthood. Decoding deficits, current or remediated, would implicate the sublexical interaction of orthography and phonology. In addition, the heterogeneous reading profiles of adults {{with language}} impairment provide an opportunity to examine whether the deficits in this <b>bidirectional</b> <b>link</b> between orthography and phonology are related to reading deficit specifically or language impairment globally. Sixty adults, 30 with language impairment and 30 with typical language, participated in this study. Nonword stimuli, orthogonally varied based on orthographic and phonological neighborhood density, were presented in two sublexical tasks, nonword repetition and nonword spelling. The experiment revealed a pattern of similar responses for adults with and without language impairment. However, adults with impaired language had significantly poorer performance on both the nonword repetition task and the nonword spelling task. Additional analyses indicated that both language and literacy measures predicted the overall performance on the orthogonally varied nonword repetition and nonword spelling tasks. This study highlights the existence of a bidirectional influence between phonological and orthographic processing.

40|$|As a {{recently}} explored property of light, {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) has potential in enabling multiplexing of multiple data-carrying beams, to increase the transmission capacity and spectral efficiency of a communication system. For the use of OAM multiplexing in free-space optical (FSO) communications, atmospheric turbulence presents a critical challenge. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate simultaneous pre- and post-turbulence compensation of multiple OAM beams, in a bidirectional free- space optical communications link, using a single adaptive optics (AO) system. Each beam carries a 100 Gbit/s signal, and propagates through an emulated atmospheric turbulence. A specifically designed AO system, which utilizes a Gaussian beam for wavefront sensing and correction, is built {{at one end of}} the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>link.</b> We show that this AO system can be used to not only post-compensate the received OAM beams, but also pre-compensate the outgoing OAM beams emitted from the same link end. Experimental results show that this compensation technique helps reduce the crosstalk onto adjacent modes by more than 12 dB, achieving bit error rates below the forward error correction limit of 1 × 10 − 3, for both directions of the link. The results of work might be helpful to future implementation of OAM multi- plexing, in a high-capacity FSO <b>bidirectional</b> <b>link</b> affected by atmospheric turbulence...|$|E

The majority of the validated links are unidirectional but a certain fraction of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>links,</b> i.e. of credit relationships that are statistically validated both for the bank and for the firm, are also observed. Their number is shown in the column Pair BL of Table  1 where we report the number of distinct pairs of bank-firm with <b>bidirectional</b> validated <b>links.</b> Some of these <b>bidirectional</b> validated <b>links</b> are long living, i.e. observed for as long as 21 years.
