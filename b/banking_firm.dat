40|$|Japanese <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> {{have been}} in a {{turbulent}} period from the last decade due to deregulations and bad loans from collapse of a bubble economy. As a result, there have been many bankruptcies and merger & acquisitions (M&As) among Japanese <b>banking</b> <b>firms.</b> On the other hand, U. S. <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> have already met with similar experiences from the 1970 s to 1980 s. After these turbulent eras, U. S. banks revived by restructuring and focusing on their core competence. They are strong from the viewpoint of profitability, size and stability. In this sense, it is generally said that U. S. <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> are 10 years ahead from Japanese <b>banking</b> <b>firms.</b> Therefore, I think it is useful for Japanese banks to research and learn how U. S. banks corresponded to turbulence situations and how they revived. In this thesis, I focus on knowledge management in <b>banking</b> <b>firms,</b> because human resource and both internal and external knowledge {{is one of the most}} important assets for banks. Even though <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> have many business fields for which knowledge is useful, I pick up and examine following aspects by using comparative analysis between Japanese and U. S. <b>banking</b> <b>firms.</b> 1. Employment System and Organizational Structures: The employment systems and organizational structures of <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> are key to how they manage their knowledge because knowledge belongs to the employees and organizations. 2. Customer Relationship Management: How to make the best use of customers' knowledge is important for banks, and banks need to focus not only on internal knowledge but a!so external knowledge. 3. Outsourcing: Acquiring knowledge and skills from outside sources is becoming more and more important for banks because of innovations in information technology and severe competition among many rivals. by Kazunori Yamagata.

The main aim is to identify the fundamental changes of the underlying economics of banking through the analysis of banks’ balance sheets.

5|$|The {{company that}} would become FBO began as the U.S.-based movie {{subsidiary}} of the British importer, exporter, and film distributor Robertson-Cole. This organization was similar in structure to the French Pathé Exchange company, {{a subsidiary of the}} French Pathé Frères company. From its U.S. headquarters in New York City, R-C Pictures, as it was sometimes known, first entered the American film distribution market. In 1919, the company forged an alliance with Exhibitors Mutual Distributing, a corporate descendant of the Mutual Film studio. The first of R-C's own feature productions to be released was The Wonder Man, directed by John G. Adolfi and starring Georges Carpentier, which debuted May 29, 1920. With its move into production, Robertson-Cole established a 13.5-acre (5.5-hectare) studio in Los Angeles's fortuitously named Colegrove district, then adjacent to but soon to be subsumed by Hollywood. In January 1921, Robertson-Cole absorbed Hallmark Pictures, which had acquired the Exhibitors Mutual interests the previous year. The first official Robertson-Cole production shot at the new studio was a February 1921 release, The Mistress of Shenstone, directed by Henry King and starring beautiful Pauline Frederick, a former Paramount and Goldwyn star. That year, the British owners of the studio entered into a working relationship with Joseph P. Kennedy, father of future U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was then a broker at the New York <b>banking</b> <b>firm</b> of Hayden, Stone, as well as the owner of Maine–New Hampshire Theatres, a small chain of movie houses. Though he failed to arrange the sale R-C's general partners were looking for, Kennedy's involvement with the studio was far from over.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a microeconomic and financial-markets analysis of innovations in liability instruments by U. S. <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> in the 1960 - 1985 period. At the microeconomic level, innovations are conceptualized as arising from either situation of opportunity or adversity {{on the part}} of <b>banking</b> <b>firms.</b> There is particular attention to the problem of banking-firm adversity, which occurs when <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> with illiquid balance-sheets due to maturity-transformation confront unanticipatedly high interest-rate outcomes in segmented borrowing markets. Econometric evidence is produced which supports the notion of banking-firm adversity as an element of banks 2 ̆ 7 loan-market behavior. An asset-substitution model of financial markets is developed which explicitly incorporates bank illiquidity and market segmentation; this model is capable of producing the interest rate 2 ̆ 2 spikes 2 ̆ 2 which have often spurred bank innovation in the past 25 years. ...|$|R

40|$|Doubts {{about the}} {{accuracy}} with which outside investors can assess a <b>banking</b> <b>firm’s</b> value motivate many government interventions {{in the banking}} market. The recent financial crisis has reinforced concerns {{about the possibility that}} banks are unusually opaque. Yet the empirical evidence, thus far, is mixed. This paper examines the trading characteristics of bank shares over the period from January 1990 through September 2009. We find that bank share trading exhibits sharply different features before vs. during the crisis. Until mid- 2007, large (NYSE-traded) <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> appear to be no more opaque than a set of control firms, and smaller (NASD-traded) banks are, at most, slightly more opaque. During the crisis, however, both large and small <b>banking</b> <b>firms</b> exhibit a sharp increase in opacity, consistent with the policy interventions implemented at the time. Although portfolio composition is significantly related to market microstructure variables, no specific asset category(s) stand out as particularly important in determining bank opacity.
