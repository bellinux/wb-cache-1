25|$|Nicrophorus americanus, {{also known}} as the American <b>burying</b> <b>beetle</b> or giant carrion beetle, is a {{critically}} endangered species of beetle endemic to North America. It belongs to the order Coleoptera and the family Silphidae. The carrion beetle in North America is carnivorous, feeds on carrion and requires carrion to breed. It {{is also one of the}} few species of beetle to exhibit parental care. The decline of the American <b>burying</b> <b>beetle</b> has been attributed to habitat loss, alteration, and degradation, and they now occur over less than 10% of their historic range.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} {{of studies on}} social immunity are carried out on eusocial insects, e.g. Sylvia Cremer's work uses ants as a model system whilst Rebeca Rosengaus (Northeastern University) works with termites.

40|$|<b>Burying</b> <b>beetles</b> play an {{important}} role in ecosystems by removal of cadavers of small vertebrates. By competing other necrophagous insects and micro-organisms, they may contribute to reducing health risks. They are also interesting for their complex parental care of offspring. This paper describes the role of the juvenile hormone in the life history of <b>burying</b> <b>beetles,</b> breeding and parental care in particular...|$|R
40|$|<b>Burying</b> <b>beetles</b> (Nicrophorus vespilloides) breed {{on small}} {{vertebrate}} carcasses, which they shave and smear with antimicrobial exudates. Producing antimicrobials imposes a fitness cost on <b>burying</b> <b>beetles,</b> which rises with {{the potency of}} the antimicrobial defence. <b>Burying</b> <b>beetles</b> also carry phoretic mites (Poecilochirus carabi complex), which breed alongside them on the carcass. Here we test the novel hypothesis that P. carabi mites assist <b>burying</b> <b>beetles</b> in clearing the carcass of bacteria as a side-effect of grazing on the carrion. We manipulated the bacterial environment on carcasses and measured {{the effect on the}} beetle in the presence and absence of mites. With next-generation sequencing, we investigated how mites influence the bacterial communities on the carcass. We show that mites: 1) cause beetles to reduce the antibacterial activity of their exudates but 2) there are no consistent fitness benefits of breeding alongside mites. We also find that mites increase bacterial diversity and richness on the carcass, but do not reduce bacterial abundance. The current evidence does not support a cleaning mutualism between <b>burying</b> <b>beetles</b> and P. carabi mites, but more work is needed to understand the functional significance and fitness consequences for the beetle of mite-associated changes to the bacterial community on the carcass...|$|R

25|$|Historical records {{offer little}} {{insight into what}} type of habitat was {{preferred}} by the American <b>burying</b> <b>beetle.</b> Current information suggests that this species is a habitat generalist, or one that lives in many types of habitat, with a slight preference for grasslands and open understory oak hickory forests. However, the beetles are carrion specialists in that they need carrion {{the size of a}} dove or a chipmunk in order to reproduce. Carrion availability may be the greatest factor determining where the species can survive.|$|E

50|$|<b>Burying</b> <b>beetles</b> or sexton beetles (genus Nicrophorus) are {{the best-known}} {{members of the}} family Silphidae (carrion beetles).

50|$|One of {{the only}} {{well-known}} examples of progressive provisioning outside of the Hymenoptera are the <b>burying</b> <b>beetles,</b> which care for their larvae and supply them with a mass of carrion, which the adults chew and regurgitate to the developing larvae.|$|R
40|$|The {{decomposition}} is {{an important}} component of nutrient cycling in ecosystems. It is likely that carrion-breeding insects contribute to this essential ecosystem service through their manipulations of carrion resources. The purpose of this project is to determine the effect of <b>burying</b> <b>beetles</b> on soil nitrogen levels and plant growth. <b>Burying</b> <b>beetles</b> are a type of <b>beetle</b> that <b>bury</b> small dead animals, to rear their young on the carcass. This decomposes the carcass underground, thereby adding more nitrogen to the soil compared to when the dead animal decomposes on the surface. In this study, we measured how these different soil nitrogen levels affect plant growth. We grew wheat in soil samples: (1) where a mouse decomposed on the surface, (2) where <b>burying</b> <b>beetles</b> decomposed the mouse underground, (3) soil alone, and (4) potting soil. The different soil treatments and the data on the soil nitrogen levels were conducted in a different experiment by Sarah Herzog, Gretchen Lohse, and Amber Gonzales. Over a period of several weeks, we measured the growth of wheat (height). After ten weeks, the plants were harvested and dried in preparation for isotope sampling to measure the nitrogen levels in plants grown in the 4 soil treatments...|$|R

50|$|Maternal {{infanticide}} {{occurs when}} newborn offspring {{are killed by}} their mother. This is sometimes seen in pigs, a behavior known as savaging, which affects up to 5% of gilts. Similar behavior has been observed in various animals such as rabbits and <b>burying</b> <b>beetles.</b>|$|R
40|$|The cost of {{reproduction}} theory posits {{that there are}} trade-offs between current and future reproduction because resources that are allocated to current offspring cannot be used for future reproductive opportunities. Two adaptive reproductive strategies have been hypothesized to offset the costs {{of reproduction}} and maximize lifetime fitness. The terminal investment hypothesis predicts that as individuals age they will allocate more resources to current reproduction {{as a response to}} decreasing residual reproductive value. The reproductive restraint hypotheses predicts that as individuals age they will allocate fewer resources to current reproduction to increase the chance of surviving for an additional reproductive opportunity. In this study, we test for adaptive responses to advancing age in male <b>burying</b> <b>beetles,</b> Nicrophorus orbicollis. <b>Burying</b> <b>beetles</b> use facultative biparental care, but the male typically abandons the brood before the female. Previous work in male <b>burying</b> <b>beetles</b> has suggested several factors to explain variation in male residency time, but no study has observed male behavior throughout their entire reproductive lifetimes to determine whether males change residency time in an adaptive way with age. We compared residency time of males that reproduced biparentally, uniparentally, and on different-sized carcasses to determine if they used an adaptive reproductive strategy. Males did not increase residency time as they aged when reproducing biparentally, but decreased residency time with age when reproducing uniparentally. A decrease in parental care with age is consistent with a reproductive restraint strategy. When female age increased over time, males did not increase their residency time to compensate for deteriorating female condition. To our knowledge, this is the first test of adaptive reproductive allocation strategies in male <b>burying</b> <b>beetles...</b>|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>burying</b> <b>beetles</b> they <b>bury</b> the {{carcasses}} of small vertebrates such as birds and mice {{as a food}} source for their larvae. Larval development takes place during the summer, and the fully formed individuals can be found mainly in May-June and in August.|$|R
