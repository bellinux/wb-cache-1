50|$|A detangler {{is usually}} only {{used for the}} rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable.</b> The front <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> can be routed through the stem, via a hollow stem bolt known as a Pott's mod bolt, and fork steer tube to avoid the {{tangling}} problem.|$|R
50|$|Jawa {{motorcycles}} orientated for sidecar use, {{as opposed}} to solo motorcycle use, feature smaller 15 or 16 tooth gearbox sprockets (18 teeth on solo bikes), an attachment on the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> pivot arm for the sidecar's own <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> to attach, a left footrest with an attachment for the sidecar <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> to fit into and modified wiring loom {{at the rear of}} the bike with electrical power coupling for the sidecar's lighting and accessories.|$|R

5000|$|He also {{displayed}} innovation as {{the inventor}} of the Posi-Stop <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> guide. The Posi-Stop was a combination seat clamp and caliper <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> guide that was supposed to improve the performance of such brakes. It was later manufactured and sold by Oddessey under the [...] "Pozi-Stop" [...] (note adjusted spelling) name.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, in bicycles, shifter cables are {{anchored}} on the shifter {{with a small}} cylindrical nipple, concentric {{with the}} <b>cable.</b> Bicycle <b>brake</b> nipples however, vary between mountain bikes (MTB), with straight handlebars, and road bikes, with drop-handlebars. MTB bikes use a barrel-shaped (cylindrical) nipple to anchor the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> at the <b>brake</b> lever, while road bikes have a pear-shaped nipple. Some replacement <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> for bicycles come with both styles, one on each end. The unneeded end is cut off and discarded upon installation.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{flatland}} bicycle {{is similar}} to most other BMX bicycles, flatland is often performed with specially designed frames with geometry (head tube angle, top tube length, etc.) suited {{to the needs of}} flatlanders. Front and rear bolt-on pegs, a hollow compression bolt on the forks for the front <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> and a rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> detangler or Gyro to allow the bars to rotate endlessly without tangling the <b>brake</b> <b>cables.</b> Also invented specifically for flatland riding is the rear hub mechanism known as a freecoaster, which allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub and making the cranks rotate backwards as they would on a normal freewheel or cassette style hub. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include zero offset forks, narrow handlebars, very high pressure tires (100psi and higher), and a very small front sprocket (18-28 teeth).|$|R
5000|$|In {{cars with}} rear drum brakes, the parking <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> usually actuates these drums {{mechanically}} with much less force than {{is available through}} the hydraulic system.|$|R
50|$|Some stems have a {{hole through}} the {{horizontal}} part to <b>support</b> the front <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on bikes with cantilever brakes such as cyclo-cross bicycles and older mountain bikes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Servo Wave" [...] - This is {{a system}} Shimano {{introduced}} to brake levers which allowed them to pull more <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> {{at the start of}} the lever stroke than at the end, giving improved separation between the brake blocks and the rim to allow for mud and lack of trueness in the wheels while still delivering the same braking power as systems which have a constant ratio between lever movement and cable pull and therefore less pad clearance. This was introduced during the mid-1990s. This was implemented initially by mounting the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on a roller that moves towards the lever pivot in a slot in the lever blade as the lever is pulled. A second design pulled the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> downwards towards a cam near to the brake lever pivot instead. Servo wave has appeared for the first time on a hydraulic disk brake lever on the 2008 Shimano XT groupset.|$|R
50|$|The orutu {{consists}} of a hollow wooden box that has monitor lizard skin stretched over one side. The string used to be sisal fibers but are now bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>cables</b> {{operated}} by Hispano Suiza type servo mechanism driven from the gearbox main shaft (removed after the Grand Prix), running over pulleys, adjustable by ratchets below the riding mechanic.|$|R
50|$|Some {{bicycles}} use a {{cable guide}} {{on one side}} of the seat cluster for a rear cantilever <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> rather than use a short length of housing between two housing stops.|$|R
50|$|The tikit was {{introduced}} in 2007. Early versions of the tikit employed a pair of <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> in the hyperfold mechanism. This mechanism permitted excessive flex in the handlebar stem when ridden.|$|R
50|$|The detangler, Gyro or rotor is an {{invention}} for the freestyle BMX bicycle, allowing the handlebars {{to turn a}} complete 360° rotation without the <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> getting tangled up. SST oryg is another common manufacturer of detangler systems.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>cables,</b> {{running over}} {{phosphor}} bronze pulleys, adjustable by ratchets below a sideways hinged 6"x8" [...] trap {{door in the}} floor in front of the riding mechanic. Cast steel ribbed brake drums; cast alloy brake shoes; cast iron segments lining.|$|R
5000|$|The vehicle has no chain, pedals, gear box, {{mechanical}} <b>brake,</b> <b>cables</b> or levers. These {{functions are}} provided by a [...] electric motor and controller. The YikeBike has regenerative electronic anti-skid brakes. There are also built-in lights, indicators and horn for safety.|$|R
50|$|Defending pole {{position}} and race winner Billy Arnold {{was having trouble}} finding speed {{over the past couple}} of days, but scrambled to make an attempt late in the day on Saturday. He wheeled to the line at 7:08 p.m., past the deadline for the track to close. Officials decided to allow the run, and his four-lap average of 113.848 mph tentatively took the {{pole position}}. After the run, some drivers protested, and during a post-qualifying inspection, it was found that Arnold's <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> were not connected. During the rush to get the car on the track, the crew had neglected to connect the <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> and technical committee chairman Louis H. Schwitzer disallowed the run.|$|R
50|$|The valiha {{generally}} has 21-24 strings. Historically these were formed of strips of the bamboo body, prised up and raised by small bridges, {{but in the}} modern day the strings are often made of unwound bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cable,</b> though serious players may use standard guitar or piano strings.|$|R
5000|$|The Mondia [...] "Super" [...] racing {{frame was}} {{somewhat}} tighter and stiffer, {{and with a}} straighter front fork. Mondia Super frames used the less elaborate Prugnat chrome lugs with distinctive center cut-outs. Brazed-on guides for <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> on this model were centered {{along the top of}} the top tube.|$|R
50|$|In a {{development}} program costing $400 million, engineers initially used an Erector Set {{to visualize the}} complex interaction of the design and redesigned under-floor components. The system included the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking <b>brake</b> <b>cables,</b> rear climate control lines, and rear suspension but precluded all-wheel drive (AWD).|$|R
50|$|SLR ("Shimano Linear Response") - Integration of {{a return}} spring into the brake lever, pushing the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> back when the lever is released. The idea behind this was that the return spring in the actual brake could be {{designed}} to be weaker, thus giving an overall feeling of easier operation.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are also}} remembered for their sculpture-like [...] "hand job" [...] cable hanger, which resembled a fist {{reaching}} up and grabbing the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable.</b> The Hand Job took an overlooked {{part of every}} other bike {{and made it a}} focal point for an Ibis, and as such symbolized the company.|$|R
50|$|Gordon Huntley (1930 - 7 March 1988) was a {{musician}} and steel guitar player. His early playing career {{was with the}} Hawaiian Serenaders in 1959, for whom he played a triple neck Fender lap steel guitar. He converted this to a pedal steel by adding an accelerator pedal from a tractor connected with bicycle <b>brake</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In July 2008, Pino Maniaci's car, {{parked outside}} his home, was [...] "doused with gasoline" [...] and set on fire. This episode {{is part of}} what Maniaci claims is a {{constant}} process of threats, which manifests itself in [...] "countless attacks", such as slashed tyres or severed <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> in the cars he uses and even windscreens shattered by gunshots.|$|R
50|$|In 2008 a {{new version}} of the tikit {{replaced}} the pair of <b>brake</b> <b>cables</b> with a single, and much thicker, cable, plus other improvements to the handlebar stem and to the rear seat pin assembly. The resulting bike is much stiffer. Bike Friday provides an upgrade path for 2007 tikits which provides some of the 2008 features, notably the new cable assembly.|$|R

5000|$|Dirt jumping, {{urban and}} street {{mountain}} bikes lie {{somewhere in between}} a BMX bike and a freeride bike. They are either arranged as rigid or hardtail bikes, with 3 to 4.5 in of front suspension, and rigid, durable frames with low bottom brackets and short chainstays to improve maneuverability. Dirt Jump bikes often overlap in design with Four-Cross bikes, though that discipline has largely fallen out of favor, with many frames including removable derailleur hangers and/or integrated chain tensioners to allow for single speed and multi-speed arrangements (Four-Cross bikes mostly use derailleurs while Dirt Jumpers usually use single speed setups). Tires on these bikes are usually 24 or 26" [...] diameter, fast-rolling slicks or semi-slicks, with narrow casings (approx. 1.8-2.2"). Dirt jumpers usually have low seatposts and oversized handlebars, {{to make room for}} tricks. Most dirt jumpers have an extended rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> installed and have no front brake, which allows the rider to spin the handle bars multiple times without tangling the <b>brake</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R

500|$|Klein held {{a patent}} (...) for an {{improved}} {{method of routing}} cables through the frame of a bicycle, that reduced aerodynamic drag and stress on the frame. The front and rear derailleur cables were routed through the down tube, and the rear <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> through the top tube, although some models changed in 2002 to top tube cable routing for greater harmonisation with Shimano components.|$|R
5000|$|As Richie, Rik Mayall {{once again}} {{mentions}} his quad bike accident {{he had in}} 1998 and he makes out it was Eddie who caused it. [...] "It's just like the last time, except this time Eddie isn't standing there with a <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> {{in one hand and}} some scissors in the other." [...] To which Eddie grins and mimes holding something and cutting across it.|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} options is {{commonly}} found on flatland bikes. The most unifying feature of flatland bikes {{is the use}} of four pegs, one on the end of each wheel axle. Flatlanders will choose to run a front brake (or a dual front brake; one front brake with two brake levers using one <b>brake</b> <b>cable),</b> front and rear brakes, or no brakes at all, depending on stylistic preference.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{variations}} are available: In the more-traditional [...] "cable-pulling" [...] type, {{an electric}} motor simply pulls the emergency <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> on the push or pull of a button rather than a mechanical handle in the cabin. A more complex unit [...] (first seen on the 2003 Audi A8) uses a computer-controlled motor attached {{to each of the}} two rear brake calipers referred to as the Motor on Caliper(MoC) system.|$|R
50|$|The 1979 'N' series {{machines}} {{introduced a}} slotted section {{at the rear}} of the swing-arm, to allow the wheel, with axle, to be withdrawn. There were two bolts behind the axle to undo and remove, then take the <b>brake</b> <b>cable</b> nut and slip off the chain. The rear wheel then slipped out to the rear. The snail-cam adjusters made the re-installation and tensioning of the chain a far faster task than on the earlier models.|$|R
