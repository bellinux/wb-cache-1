40|$|Design and {{analytical}} modeling considerations associated with recirculating flow in piping systems with tee and Y connections are presented. Flow recirculation, in many process piping networks, can produce nonsteady flow and associated thermal conditions. In the flow recirculation discussion, experimental data is presented for a 90 degree <b>branch</b> <b>piping</b> (tee connection) using four different branch pipe sizes {{over a wide}} velocity range [Coffield and Kolar (1990) ]. The discussion also includes recent test data for a 45 degree, Y connected, <b>branch</b> <b>piping</b> design. Designers can use this information by directly applying the limiting conditions that are presented at the design stage, or in evaluating the performance of existing systems. For example, although flow recirculation may result in complicated flow patterns, it often can have the beneficial effect of mixing low velocity branch line fluid with the primary system fluid as it approaches the intersection. In branch pipe systems where flows are at different temperatures this recirculation helps attenuate the potential for large thermal stresses. The recirculation flow patterns are strongly affected by the branch angle and thus they are presented {{as a function of}} the branch angle...|$|E
30|$|As was {{described}} in Chapter 4, the proposed pressurizing pattern and prototypes enable successful path selection in <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> systems. Moreover, the proposed pressurizing pattern, which was presented in “Strategy to select a branch” section, enables precisely regulated movement of the six braided-tube device, as shown in Fig.  13. Thus, the proposed pressurizing pattern implemented in the device with the proposed design of the steering hook enables successful path selection in <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> systems.|$|R
30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{developed}} in-pipe locomotive devices to inspect pipes. However, {{it is difficult}} to achieve selective locomotion in a <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> system. In this study, a novel steerable in-pipe locomotive device is proposed based on “a six-braided-tubes locomotive device,” which is an in-pipe locomotive device that is actuated by only six pneumatic inflatable tubes. It is one of the simplest in-pipe locomotive devices that is capable of forward and backward motion and can rotate in clockwise and counterclockwise directions along a pipe, can select the desired pathway in the branched pipe. In this paper, we discuss the background of pipe inspection, classify previously developed in-pipe locomotive devices, and clarify the aim of this study. Additionally, we also describe and extend the locomotive principles of six-braided-tubes locomotive devices. Moreover, we propose a novel attachment, termed steering hook, to enable steering in various types of branched systems. Finally, we experimentally confirm that the novel proposed principle allows the device to correct path selection in an in-pipe <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> system.|$|R
30|$|This study aims {{to employ}} this novel six braided-tube {{locomotion}} strategy for propulsion, rotation, and steering in piping systems. The {{ability of the}} proposed device to control its position and orientation will enable it to perform path selection in <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> systems without the need of a complicated attachment or additional actuators, thereby {{making it one of}} the simplest in-pipe locomotive devices able to achieve path selection. In this chapter, we introduced and described previous studies and the aim of this study. In Chapter 2, we will introduce the fundamental principles of six-braided tube locomotion. Based on the fundamental principles, we propose a novel locomotive method and an accompanying strategy for path selection. We also propose a simple and tiny attachment referred to as a steering hook, which is required for the device to select the correct path in <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> systems. Chapter 3 describes the characteristics of prototypes and the experimental equipment. Then, the experimental results, which are presented in Chapter 4, confirm the ability of a six-braided tube device to perform path selection. Finally, the conclusions of this study are outlined in Chapter 5.|$|R

Their smart tunic was made in a higher quality olive-green wool, incorporating the internal scalloped pockets and standing collar of the Austrian army, but with <b>branch</b> <b>pipings</b> and Russian-style rank boards. The headgear was a khaki kepi with leather peak, gold-metal pipings (silver for Cavalry and Engineers) and a bullion-cockade, and the pants were piped riding breeches, usually worn with high boots or ankle boots and puttees. The equipment was brown leather, with a French-style pistol holster and a binocular case. During this period, all officers took their sabres on campaign.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{hydrodynamic}} properties, i. e. the consumption of mechanical energy expressed by pressure drops within a helium loop intended for the testing of decay heat removal (DHR) from the model of a gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR). The system is characterised by the natural circulation of helium, as a coolant, and assume steady operating conditions of circulation. The helium loop consists of four main components: model of gas-cooled fast reactor, model of the heat exchanger for decay heat removal, hot <b>piping</b> <b>branch</b> and cold <b>piping</b> <b>branch.</b> Using the process hydrodynamic calculations, the pressure drops of circulating helium within {{the main components of}} the helium loop were determined.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{test loop}} system was designed, developed, and constructed {{to study the}} two-phase flow field. Horizontally oriented inlet and <b>branches</b> <b>piping</b> system, with sharp edge T-junction, at a system pressure of 1 bar was investigated. Measurements of air and water mass flow rates and temperatures in slug flow regime with variable inlet mass fluxes, extraction rates, and qualities are presented. Single-phase loss coefficients were determined, correlated and compared with different proposed correlations. The statistical mean predictive accuracy of the measured pressure difference values are compared with the separated flow model and Riemann and Seeger model {{in the way of}} parity plot. Riemann and Seeger model showed better predictions with the present data. It is also concluded that the pressure difference depends on the inlet mass fluxes, inlet qualities and extraction rates, and there is a strong interdependence between the separation phenomena and the pressure distribution...|$|R

30|$|Some piping {{systems have}} a {{branched}} part. Therefore, in-pipe locomotive devices {{must be able}} to travel forward and backward, and turn to proceed into a branched pipe. Because of this requirement, many researchers have focused on the realization of a steerable in-pipe device. For example, locomotive devices purposed for travelling through 200 -mm-diameter pipes have been equipped with separate motors for locomotion, rotation, and steering [10, 13, 17]. To simplify the design and reduce the number of motors, Nishimura et al. [11] proposed a differential mechanism that allows locomotion, rotation, and steering to be realized with only two motors. Debenest et al. [12] designed a spring mechanism to eliminate the need of a separate motor to control steering. Additionally, a steering mechanism has been included in certain inchworm devices to enable path selection in <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> systems. This type of steering component has three or four degrees of freedom (DoFs), and is typically attached {{at the tip of the}} device [23, 24].|$|R

5000|$|Clean-outs are {{fittings}} with removable elements, allowing {{access to}} drains without {{the removal of}} plumbing fixtures. They are used to allow an auger (or plumber's snake) to clean out a plugged drain. Since clean-out augers are limited in length, clean-outs should be placed in accessible locations at regular intervals throughout a drainage system (including outside the building). Minimum requirements are typically {{at the end of}} each <b>branch</b> in <b>piping,</b> just ahead of each water closet, at the base of each vertical stack and inside and outside the building in the main drain or sewer. Clean-outs usually have screw-on caps or screw-in plugs. They are also known as [...] "rodding eyes", because of the eye-shaped cover plates often used on external versions.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Limit {{load test}} results from {{fourteen}} forged <b>piping</b> <b>branch</b> junctions are reported. Eight were uncracked. Three had outside, non-through wall cracks running {{parallel to the}} run pipe centerline at the flank and the others had crotch corner cracks among the selected specimens. The collapse behaviors such as bulging deformation at the side flanks of junctions with and without crack were depicted. Based on the experimental data, the relationships of limit load with structural dimension and crack size were then summarized and the existing solutions were evaluated in use of the test results...|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{above-mentioned}} devices are equipped separately {{with a basic}} travel mechanism and a steering mechanism to enable path selection in <b>branched</b> <b>piping</b> systems. However, the added steering mechanism increases device complexity, and prevents the device from being small and affordable. Thus, in this paper, we propose {{the use of a}} bundled-tube device {{for the development of a}} simple and affordable steerable in-pipe robotic device. A bundled-tube device is a novel in-pipe robot with inflatable tubes, which we have described in a previous study [29]; unlike other similarly purposed devices, our bundled-tube device utilizes snake-like motion to travel. This snake-like motion, which is based on bending motion, has previously been utilized by rigid multi-DoF snake robots [30]. Although our device only comprises inflatable braided tubes and has a simple structure, it can use snake-like motion to travel through pipes. More specifically, forward movement through a pipe is driven by periodic inflation and deflation of each of the tubes, whereas backward movement is achieved by applying an opposing pressurization pattern to the device. Additionally, the entire body of this bundled-tube device is quite soft and generates a propulsion force; hence, it can travel along curved sections and sections with dynamically changing diameter and shapes. The soft body allows the device to conform to the shape of a pipe by exploiting the reaction force from the pipe; furthermore, a propulsion force, which is generated by the inserted entire body, can easily overcome the force of friction, which is generated by travelling through curved sections and increased by an increment of the insertion length. Moreover, the simple structure of the bundled-tube device allows the cable that follows the pipe inspection module, such as an electric wire and an optical fiber, to become a locomotive device when attached to bundled tubes around the cable. Therefore, more stable and robust locomotion can be achieved by surrounding all of the cables with a bundled-tube locomotive device. Previously, we have developed several types of such bundled-tube devices, including a helical-type device [31], a three-braided tube device [32], and six braided-tube device [33].|$|R

5000|$|The various {{volunteer}} militia {{units in}} existence until 1910 wore {{a variety of}} scarlet, dark blue or rifle-green dress uniforms, generally closely following contemporary British Army patterns. Some units, recruited in coastal areas, favored Royal Navy style dress. Since 1902 a khaki serge service uniform had been general issue. The regional regiments of the new Territorial Army, which replaced the militia, wore the universal [...] "1912 Uniform" [...] of khaki in a greenish/brown shade, worn with a slouch hat. Officers frequently wore the peaked cap of the British Army. Units were distinguished by regimental badges attached to the turned up brim of the hat; and <b>branches</b> by colored <b>piping</b> on tunic shoulder straps and trouser seams.

5000|$|When air at {{atmospheric}} pressure is compressed, it contains much more water vapor than the high-pressure air can hold. Relative humidity {{is governed by}} the properties of water and is not affected by air pressure. Management of the excessive moisture is a requirement of a compressed air distribution system. System designers must ensure that piping maintains a slope, to prevent accumulation of moisture in low parts of the piping system. Drain valves may be installed at multiple points of a large system to allow trapped water to be blown out. Taps from piping headers may be arranged at the tops of pipes, so that moisture is not carried over into <b>piping</b> <b>branches</b> feeding equipment. [...] Piping sizes are selected to avoid excessive energy loss in the piping system due to excess velocity in straight pipes at times of peak demand, or due to turbulence at pipe fittings.|$|R
40|$|Tee pipe {{junctions}} are piping components {{widely used in}} industrial and pipeline applications. Their performance under severe loading conditions may be critical for the structural integrity of an industrial facility. When these components are subjected to repeated loading associated with cyclic plasticity, failure is possible. The present work is a combined experimental and numerical effort which examines the behavior of <b>piping</b> <b>branch</b> T-junctions subjected to strong cyclic out-of-plane bending. The {{first part of this}} paper describes the experimental investigation of the junction performance. Tests are conducted in a constant and varying amplitude displacement-controlled mode resulting to failure in the low-cycle fatigue range. The overall behavior of each specimen in terms of fatigue life, as well as the evolution and concentration of local strains are monitored throughout the testing procedure. The experimental investigation is supported by finite element modeling, developed to simulate the experiments. Advanced cyclic plasticity material models are employed and emphasis is given on the local strains developed at the critical part of the T-junctions where first cracking occurs.

40|$|The 45 -degree {{laterals}} {{are widely}} used in pressure vessel nozzles and <b>piping</b> <b>branch</b> connections. Though the pressure design is always important for the 45 -degree laterals, {{it is not a}} simple work because it has severe stress concentrations, it is difficult to weld and inspect, and there are some discrepancy between a conventional design and design by linear and nonlinear finite element analysis. In previous papers, authors studied the characteristics of both 90 degree tee and 45 degree laterals using an inelastic finite element analysis based on simplified shell element models and proposed Collapse Strength Reduction Factor (CSRF) based on an inelastic analysis were compared. In this paper, results of the burst test of 45 -degree lateral and 90 degree intersection were shown. The fracture surface of 45 -degree lateral was different from that of 90 -degree intersection. These experimental results are compared with the inelastic finite element analysis results focusing on the local stress and strain behaviors. It was found that the magnitude of the local strain affected the burst pressure. Consideration should be given on the local failure due to excessive plastic strain under high stress triaxiality for the design of the 45 -degree lateral by inelastic analysis. 1...|$|R
