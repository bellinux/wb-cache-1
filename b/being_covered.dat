5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main longerons {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short longerons from frames 20 to 23, before <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> in 22 gauge plating.|$|E
5|$|Private Stock {{promoted}} Michael Zager Band's eponymous LP due to {{the success}} of the song. It became a contributing factor the success of the LP. It also remains an influential dance track which has been heavily used on TV and in movies, as well as <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> or remixed by numerous artists or interpolated or sampled in other songs.|$|E
5|$|Whalebone was foaled in 1807 out of {{the mare}} Penelope, who was a {{daughter}} of Prunella. He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810. He later sired two Derby winners, Lap-dog and Spaniel and Caroline, winner of the Oaks. He {{might have been the}} sire of Derby winner Moses, but Moses' parentage is uncertain due to his dam <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> by two stallions.|$|E
50|$|The album {{contains}} six {{songs by}} each band, with each band's songs <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of songs originally {{performed by the}} other band.|$|R
50|$|Many Bahraini {{heavy metal}} bands {{came under fire}} in late April 2004 when local {{publication}} the Gulf Daily News began writing {{a series of articles}} that accused local rock concerts of <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> for satanic rituals.|$|R
50|$|The album {{features}} Kalnoky covering five songs {{written by}} Potthast (four <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of Potthast's solo work, and one originally by MU330), and Potthast covering five Streetlight Manifesto songs, all written by Kalnoky. Some songs are radically reworked from their original versions, both lyrically and musically.|$|R
5|$|When {{it first}} {{appeared}} and gained popular support, Operation Rainfall drew considerable media attention, <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> by Kotaku, IGN, Eurogamer, GamesRadar, Joystiq, Game Informer, Destructoid, and Japanese gaming sites Inside Games and ITMedia. In addition to popular and press support, it received favorable responses from Soraya Saga, the writer for Xenogears and Xenosaga, and Mistwalker.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 {{identified the}} site as a chambered long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have {{been defined as}} having long earthen mounds with wooden internal structures, whereas chambered tombs, while also <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> by a long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows with wooden internal structures {{have been identified in}} southeast Wales, perhaps because long barrows were usually built where there was no suitable stone.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. The region {{was raised in a}} north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks.|$|E
50|$|In March 2013, Marvel {{released}} a teaser titled Superior Spider-Week {{which consisted of}} five joined images. Next week saw the release of more information as three new titles were announced with rest of two images <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of Superior Spider-Man #9 and #14 reflecting major status quo change.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1990, they {{published}} their eponymous debut {{under the}} Orfeo label which {{was composed of}} 13 songs, 4 tracks <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> from other bands. And the next year they published another album, called [...] "La Bruja" [...] which had mostly original material, except for a Johnny Thunder's cover.|$|R
50|$|Italian rock {{is a form}} of {{rock music}} {{produced}} primarily in Italy. The music genre has roots in the country as it spread in the early 1960s from the United States with the earliest versions of rock and roll during this period <b>being</b> <b>cover</b> versions or interpretative covers of already existing songs.|$|R
5|$|Laces, straps, or rivets {{were used}} to affix the crest to the helm, with the join <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> by a circlet of twisted cloth known as a torse or wreath, or by a coronet {{in the case of}} {{high-ranking}} nobles. Torses did not come into regular use in Britain until the 15th century, and are still uncommon on the Continent, where crests are usually depicted as continuing into the mantling. Crests were also sometimes mounted on a furred cap known as a chapeau, as in the royal crest of England.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 2001, Tillingbourne {{abruptly}} ceased {{operations and}} {{was placed in}} the hands of receivers Begbies Traynor. This followed two years in which the company had lost around £450,000. The receivers blamed the losses on increasing costs, low subsidies from local councils and falling passenger numbers. The closure left 140 staff unemployed and caused large numbers of passengers to be stranded. Replacement services were organised by Surrey County Council and four bus operators, with the majority of routes <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> within days by temporary contracted services. Some schoolchildren were forced to find other means of transport, although workings on routes 62 and 63 were covered by Aventa Transport.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, President George W. Bush {{declared}} 18 south Texas counties as {{a federal}} disaster area. Within 2months of the storm, over 15,000citizens registered for assistance. The government approved $34.8million (2003 USD, $ USD) in aid, of which nearly half went to basic house repairs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided 75% of the $1.35million (2003 USD, $ USD) debris removal cost, with the other 25% <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> through local agencies. FEMA also provided $1.26million (2003 USD, $ USD) to repair geo-tubes on the Bolivar Peninsula in Galveston County. The geo-tubes, which protect buildings along coastal areas, were severely damaged by the hurricane.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007 two further singles were {{released}}, <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of Milli Vanilli's [...] "Girl You Know It's True" [...] and Richard Marx' ballad [...] "Right Here Waiting". Both {{made the}} German Top 30. With the latter, the band released their debut and only album One containing the 4 singles {{and many other}} cover versions.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 the Russian Federal Security Service accused Merlin {{and other}} foreign NGOs of <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> for foreign {{intelligence}} gathering operations. However, this is reflective an overall trend of suspicion by the Russian government of NGOs, as in 2012 they passed a law requiring all politically active foreign NGOs to register as 'foreign agents' and to file quarterly reports on their finances.|$|R
50|$|Rewind is {{the third}} album {{released}} by Swedish boy band E.M.D.. The album was released in on December 3, 2010. As of December 5, 2010 the album had spawned the three hit singles Save Tonight (original by Eagle-Eye Cherry), What Is Love? (original by Haddaway) and There's a Place for Us (original by Carrie Underwood), all of them <b>being</b> <b>cover</b> songs.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{challenges}} to government repression came in 1953. An organization named ONE, Inc. published a magazine called ONE. The U.S. Postal Service refused to mail its August issue, which concerned homosexuals in heterosexual marriages, {{on the grounds that}} the material was obscene despite it <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> in brown paper wrapping. The case eventually went to the Supreme Court, which in 1958 ruled that ONE, Inc. could mail its materials through the Postal Service.|$|E
5|$|The {{expanded}} surface coverage {{provided by}} Cassini has {{allowed for the}} identification of additional regions of smooth plains, particularly on Enceladus's leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as it orbits Saturn). Rather than <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> in low-relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region. This area is {{on the opposite side}} of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar Planitiae, suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn's tides on Enceladus.|$|E
5|$|The feature {{extraction}} using speeded up robust features (SURF) is {{also able to}} perform the inspection of certain elements having two possible states, such as pitot probes or static ports <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> or not covered. A pairing is performed between images of the element to be inspected in different states and that present on the scene. For these simple items to be inspected, an analysis during navigation is possible and preferable due to its time saving.|$|E

50|$|On November 20, 2007, MercyMe {{released}} All That Is Within Me. Millard, the band's lead singer, {{had believed}} that All That is Within Me {{was going to}} be a worship album with half of the songs <b>being</b> <b>cover</b> songs and the other half original songs; however, when the band got in studio, they ended up having written all the songs found in this album.|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} considered using {{a similar}} procurement solution {{to that in}} Denmark, where the spectrum was licensed to private enterprise, and the agencies purchase services from private telecommunications companies, based on conventional GSM technology. However, in Denmark this had not led to the desired results, with only Metropolitan Copenhagen <b>being</b> <b>covered.</b> Instead, the Norwegian Government chose to establish a government agency to build and operate the network. Use of the GSM and NMT450 network was insufficient {{because of lack of}} capacity in the conventional network in case of larger amounts of communication, lack of ability of group conversations, lack of priority systems and long dial-up times.|$|E
5|$|The {{powerful}} {{winds of}} Typhoon Ioke caused extensive {{damage to the}} island's power grid, leaving most power lines to buildings and backup generators damaged. The combination of the winds and storm surge flooding damaged 70% of the buildings in the territory, many of which with moderate roof damage. All low-lying areas were described as <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> with sea water or sand, and the territory was left without running water. Communications were downed on the island, with satellite dishes and cables destroyed. Damage to the infrastructure was extensive, though repairable and less than expected. Damage on the island was estimated at $88million (2006USD).|$|E
5|$|The steel casket {{containing}} the gold is traced {{by the police}} allowing them to track down Diabolik's hideout. They close in on Diabolik, who is melting the gold and turning it into ingots. Because the police are shooting at him, Diabolik is unable to control the heating of the gold, and the whole cavern ends up <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> in molten gold. Again, Diabolik {{is believed to be}} dead, with his heat-proof suit now covered in solidified gold. The police seal off the cavern intending to recover the gold later. Eva is allowed to pay her respects to Diabolik, who winks at her.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2015, {{the band}} self-released their {{comeback}} album entitled Nova zora (New Dawn). The album featured eleven songs, {{two of them}} recorded live on their 2011 performance at Akademija, and two of them, [...] "Tamo na mostu" [...] ("There on the Bridge") and [...] "Nahranite hlade" [...] ("Feed the Cold Ones"), <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of songs by the 1980s new wave band Robna Kuća.|$|R
5000|$|The track listing {{features}} 13 tracks, {{two of them}} <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> ("Master of Puppets" [...] by Metallica and [...] "Rebellion" [...] by Grave Digger), {{and three}} of them featuring guest artists: Victor Smolski (from Rage) guest appears in [...] "One To Ten", Tony Kakko (from Sonata Arctica) guest appears on [...] "Hearted" [...] and Chris Boltendahl (from Grave Digger) guest appears in [...] "Rebellion".|$|R
50|$|Double Brutal is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by As I Lay Dying vocalist Tim Lambesis' parody project Austrian Death Machine. Unlike the previous album, Total Brutal, Double Brutal is a two disc effort; the first disc composed of original songs inspired by Arnold Schwarzenegger movies, and the second disc <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of songs that can relate to Schwarzenegger movies. Upon release, the album debuted at No. 105 on the Billboard 200.|$|R
5|$|After {{exceeding}} the original departure time limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous {{had resulted in}} clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura <b>being</b> <b>covered,</b> obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By {{the time of the}} third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Second Lieutenant Jacob Beser, who was monitoring Japanese communications, reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E
5|$|Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was {{established}} in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 percent each by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater. A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK6 million, while the sales price of the lot was estimated at NOK30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam rented the venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit {{for the first four}} years <b>being</b> <b>covered</b> by the municipality. Of the NOK20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation to build a new athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed, and NOK5 million was debt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} Roth's third Top-40 hit, {{the first two}} <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of [...] "California Girls" [...] and [...] "Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody". It also appears as a radio tune on the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City on the rock station V-Rock. A cover of the song is the title song for the video game Rumble Roses and Rumble Roses XX {{performed}} by Teresa James.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{the first}} release of the band to feature {{predominantly}} original material (the only <b>covers</b> <b>being</b> the <b>cover</b> of Shai's [...] "If I Ever Fall in Love" [...] and the bonus tracks on the deluxe version of the album). Pentatonix also {{marks the first time}} band members receive individual songwriting credits {{for the majority of the}} tracks.|$|R
2500|$|Most of the album's {{fourteen}} {{songs are}} originals; the exceptions <b>being</b> <b>covers</b> of [...] "Running Out of Fools", previously a hit for Aretha Franklin, and [...] "Look for Me (I'll Be Around)" [...] previously performed by Sarah Vaughan. Blacklisted finds Case even deeper in a [...] "country noir" [...] mood, and {{was described by}} critics as lush, bleak, and atmospheric. Case cited filmmaker David Lynch, composer Angelo Badalamenti, and Neil Young's soundtrack to the film Dead Man as influences.|$|R
