50|$|The {{telemetry}} package {{included a}} transmitter (operating on 403 MHz), blocking oscillator, pressure switch and battery. A multivibrator switched {{the temperature and}} humidity sensors into the circuit, while a <b>baroswitch</b> over-rode the multivibrator to transmit pressure readings.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{consisted of}} a temperature, humidity and pressure sensors. The temperature sensor was a (at the time) standard ML-419 element, while the humidity sensor was a standard ML-476 carbon element. An aneroid-type <b>baroswitch</b> served as the pressure sensor. The temperature and humidity sensors were mounted in a vented housing attached to the parachute, which was exposed to the atmosphere when the parachute was ejected after apogee. Data sampling of temperature and humidity occurred approximately every 30 feet during decent, while pressure readings were taken about every 500 feet (152 meters).|$|E
50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude <b>baroswitch,</b> which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} balloon-borne radiosonde {{employed for}} synoptic meteorology provides vertical profiles of temperature, pressure, and humidity {{as a function}} of elapsed time. These parameters are used in the hypsometric equation to calculate the geopotential altitude at each sampling point during the balloon's flight. It is important that the vertical location information be accurate. The present investigation was conducted with the objective to evaluate the altitude determination accuracy of the standard radiosonde throughout the entire balloon profile. The tests included two other commercially available pressure sensors {{to see if they could}} provide improved accuracy in the stratosphere. The pressure-measuring performance of standard <b>baroswitches,</b> premium <b>baroswitches,</b> and hypsometers in balloon-borne sondes was correlated with tracking radars. It was found that the standard and premium <b>baroswitches</b> perform well up to about 25 km altitude, while hypsometers provide more reliable data above 25 km...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRadiosonde information is extensively {{used in the}} analysis and forecast of meteorological phenomena and the accuracy of both analyses and forecasts is dependent primarily upon {{the accuracy of the}} meteorological parameters determined from radiosonde flights. To evaluate the accuracy obtainable, 50 radiosonde flights were launched from the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. Thirty-five flights carried aloft the AN/AMT- 4 B model transmitter alongside the prototype AN/AMT- 11 DX transmitter and 15 flights carried the AN/AMT- 11 C model along with the AN/AMT- 4 B. All data obtained were reduced by the Geophysics Division, Pacific Missile Range, Point Mugu, California, on a CDC- 3100 computer and graphically by the experimenter on the WBAN- 31 series adiabatic charts. Values of temperature, relative humidity, and pressure as determined by each instrument were compared at each 3 -minute interval of each flight and values of temperature, pressure altitude, relative humidity and dewpoint were compared at standard pressure levels. The results obtained afforded a realistic evaluation of the various sensing elements under field conditions and indicate an urgent requirement {{for the development of a}} more accurate water vapor sensing device and replacement of the radiosonde <b>baroswitching</b> circuit by a hypsometer for precise determination of pressure values.

40|$|The {{results and}} outcome of thermal tests {{conducted}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of the protective coat of paint on the solid rocket booster (SRB) thermal protection system are discussed. A problem was uncovered during a series of tests on the SRB instrumentation islands in AEDC Tunnel C on 13 January 1979. The white protective paint or the Turco coating on the thermal protection system panels began to flow soon after the panels were exposed to the flow. This presented a serious problem especially since the critical pressure sensing, parachute opening <b>baroswitches</b> located on the frustum of the SRB were most likely to be contaminated by the paint flowing down the sides of the SRB nose cone. Because the first two flight articles were already completed, it was necessary to find a solution to the existing paint problem. It was found that all the coatings tested, except the Hypalon, had similar undesirable flow characteristics. Also even the Hypalon, which did not flow, would bubble up and disintegrate when it was applied on top of the new Turco. Recently, the Turco coating was removed from an MSA-: 11 panel by dissolving the paint with a certain agent. This was done in two ways, by dissolving and removing almost all of the paint {{on one side of the}} panel and dissolving and removing about 50 % of the paint on the other. The panel was then coated with Hypalon and tested as before in the Hot Gas Facility. No evidence of any paint flow nor any adverse performance of MSA was observed...|$|R
50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude <b>baroswitch</b> at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second reefing line cutters), the main chute reefing lines are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used â€” both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} sensors on balloon-borne sondes relate the sonde measurements to height above the Earth's surface through the hypsometric equation. It {{is crucial that}} sondes used to explore the vertical structure of the atmosphere do not contribute significant height errors to their measurements of atmospheric constituent concentrations and properties. A series of radiosonde flights was conducted. In most cases, each flight consisted of two sondes attached to a single balloon and each flight was tracked by a highly accurate C-band radar. For the first 19 radiosonde flights, the standard aneroid cell <b>baroswitch</b> assembly used was the pressure sensor. The last 26 radiosondes were equipped with a premium grade aneroid cell <b>baroswitch</b> assembly sensor and with a hypsometer. It is shown that both aneroid cell <b>baroswitch</b> sensors become increasingly inaccurate with altitude. The hypsometer radar differences are not strongly dependent upon altitude and {{it is found that}} the standard deviation of the differences at 35 km is 0. 179 km...|$|E

40|$|An {{overview}} of the reconstruction analyses performed for the Stardust capsule entry is described. The {{results indicate that the}} actual entry was very close to the pre-entry predictions. The capsule landed 8. 1 km north-northwest of the desired target at Utah Test and Training Range. Analyses of infrared video footage and radar range data (obtained from tracking stations) during the descent show that drogue parachute deployment was 4. 8 s later than the pre-entry prediction, while main parachute deployment was 19. 3 s earlier than the pre-set timer indicating that main deployment was actually triggered by the backup <b>baroswitch.</b> Reconstruction of a best estimated trajectory revealed that the aerodynamic drag experienced by the capsule during hypersonic flight was within 1 % of pre-entry predications. Observations of the heatshield support the pre-entry estimates of small hypersonic angles of attack, since there was very little, if any, charring of the shoulder region or the aftbody. Through this investigation, an overall assertion can be made that all the data gathered from the Stardust capsule entry were consistent with flight performance close to nominal pre-entry predictions. Consequently, the design principles and methodologies utilized for the flight dynamics, aerodynamics, and aerothermodynamics analyses have been corroborated...|$|E
40|$|The RS 2 - 91 {{rawinsonde}} system {{replaced the}} RS 2 - 80 rawinsonde system on January 1, 1995 for upper-air observations at Syowa Station, Antarctica. In {{order to determine}} the properties of RS 2 - 91 and RS 2 - 80,a total of 45 flights were carried out with the two types of link radiosondes at Syowa Station, from December 1994 to September 1995. The RS 2 - 80 rawinsonde consists of a rod thermistor painted in white, a carbon hygristor and a <b>baroswitch</b> aneroid capsule for measuring temperature, humidity and pressure, respectively. The RS 2 - 91 rawinsonde consists of a rod thermistor coated with vacuum-evaporated aluminum, a thin capacitor film and a capacitive aneroid capsule, respectively. The solar radiation correction is applied for air temperature measurements with both the RS 2 - 91 and RS 2 - 80. The differences of temperatures measured at standard pressure levels were within approximately Â± 1. 5 â„ƒ in the stratosphere during this period. The characteristic tendencies are as follows. In the stratosphere in the daytime, the temperatures measured by RS 2 - 91 were lower than those measured by RS 2 - 80 in the winter, under low temperature conditions (below - 80 â„ƒ). In the fall (approximately - 50 â„ƒ), however, those measured by RS 2 - 91 were higher than those measured by RS 2 - 80...|$|E
