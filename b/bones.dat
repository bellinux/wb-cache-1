5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular <b>bones</b> or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs.

Some modern salamanders have similar tongue <b>bones,</b> and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E

30|$|<b>Bone</b> {{quality is}} a generic {{term for the}} {{characterization}} of <b>bone</b> tissue in three dimensions: the structural quality, related {{to the amount of}} the cortical <b>bone</b> and to the trabecular <b>bone</b> pattern; the <b>bone</b> density, related to the amount of <b>bone</b> mineralization and/or the amount of <b>bone</b> by its volume; and the amount of <b>bone,</b> related to the volume of <b>bone</b> available [3]. <b>Bone</b> quality varies intra- and inter-subject depending on the thickness of cortical <b>bone,</b> the amount of trabecular <b>bone,</b> and the amount of <b>bone</b> tissue mineralization in the region of interest for implant placement [4]. Some classifications of <b>bone</b> quality have considered cortical <b>bone</b> thickness and trabecular <b>bone</b> structure based on preoperative panoramic radiographs and tactile perception during exploratory drilling of the implant site; <b>bone</b> density based on the tactile sensation and Hounsfield units of computed tomography (CT) images; radiographic pattern of trabecular bone; and intra-surgical <b>bone</b> density and biopsy with histomorphometric evaluation [5 – 8].

40|$|UNLABELLED: This {{study shows}} that change to cancellous <b>bone</b> {{structure}} is <b>bone</b> volume-dependent in a nonlinear manner. At low <b>bone</b> volume (< 15 %), trabecular thickness and trabecular separation change at a much greater rate than at higher <b>bone</b> volume. This suggests that the structural integrity of the cancellous <b>bone</b> may become rapidly compromised when <b>bone</b> volume falls below a critical value. INTRODUCTION: While <b>bone</b> mass is the major determinant of <b>bone</b> strength, this mass-based paradigm does not fully account for {{the contribution of the}} <b>bone</b> microstructure to mechanical efficiency. Geometric models of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure have been formulated based on stylized representations of the trabecular elements, where the relationships between <b>bone</b> volume and <b>bone</b> surface of cancellous <b>bone</b> are complex and reflect the modulating effect on the cancellous <b>bone</b> structure of <b>bone</b> remodeling at the trabecular surfaces. Using the plate model of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure, the interrelationships between parameters of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure have been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty histological sections of human cancellous <b>bone</b> from eight skeletal sites were analyzed. The structural parameters of cancellous <b>bone</b> (BV/TV, BS/TV, BS/BV, Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, Tb. N, and TBPf) were obtained. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This {{study shows that}} change to cancellous <b>bone</b> structure is <b>bone</b> volume-dependent in a nonlinear manner. At low <b>bone</b> volume (< 15 %), structural parameters of cancellous <b>bone,</b> such as trabecular thickness and trabecular separation, change at a much greater rate than at higher <b>bone</b> volume. This suggests that the structural integrity of the cancellous <b>bone</b> may become rapidly compromised when <b>bone</b> volume falls below a critical value. These data describe the complex relationships between <b>bone</b> mass and structure in cancellous <b>bone</b> that are often overlooked in the mass-based paradigm of <b>bone</b> strength. Histomorphometric descriptors of cancellous <b>bone</b> structure highlight the potential for accelerated deterioration of the structure with low <b>bone</b> volume, which leads to increased risk of fracture. From a clinical viewpoint, estimation of an individual's fracture risk is constrained to noninvasive techniques, which only provide <b>bone</b> mineral density or <b>bone</b> mineral content. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} better correlate measurement of <b>bone</b> mass with measurements of structural parameters...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract <b>Bone</b> remodeling, the fundamental process for <b>bone</b> renewal, is targeted by treatments of osteoporosis {{to correct the}} imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation and {{reduce the risk of}} fractures and associated clinical consequences. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of <b>bone</b> resorption) or increase (parathyroid hormone [PTH] peptides) <b>bone</b> remodeling. Studies of patients with rare <b>bone</b> diseases and genetically modified animal models demonstrated that <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation may not necessarily be coupled, leading to identification of molecular targets in <b>bone</b> cells for the development of novel agents for the treatment of osteoporosis. Application of such agents to the treatment of women with low <b>bone</b> mass confirmed that <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation can be modulated in different directions and so far two new classes of thera-peutics for osteoporosis have been defined with distinct mechanisms of action. Such treatments, if combined with a favorable safety profile, will offer new therapeutic options and will improve the management of patients with osteoporosis. Key Points In osteoporosis, there is an imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation leading to <b>bone</b> loss and structural decay of the skeleton. Currently available therapeutics affect <b>bone</b> resorption and <b>bone</b> formation in the same direction and either decrease (inhibitors of <b>bone</b> resorption) or increase (PTH peptides) <b>bone</b> remodeling. New classes of therapeutics for osteoporosis with different mechanisms of action are in clinical development. Inhibitors of Cathepsin K reduce <b>bone</b> resorption while preserving <b>bone</b> formation and increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip continuously for at least 5 years of treatment. Inhibitors of sclerostin increase <b>bone</b> formation while reducing <b>bone</b> resorption and impressively increase <b>bone</b> mineral density at the spine and the hip. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bone</b> {{tissue is}} {{continuously}} remodeled through the concerted actions of <b>bone</b> cells, which include <b>bone</b> resorption by osteoclasts and <b>bone</b> formation by osteoblasts, whereas osteocytes act as mechanosensors and orchestrators of the <b>bone</b> remodeling process. This process {{is under the}} control of local (e. g., growth factors and cytokines) and systemic (e. g., calcitonin and estrogens) factors that all together contribute for <b>bone</b> homeostasis. An imbalance between <b>bone</b> resorption and formation can result in <b>bone</b> diseases including osteoporosis. Recently, it has been recognized that, during <b>bone</b> remodeling, there are an intricate communication among <b>bone</b> cells. For instance, the coupling from <b>bone</b> resorption to <b>bone</b> formation is achieved by interaction between osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Moreover, osteocytes produce factors that influence osteoblast and osteoclast activities, whereas osteocyte apoptosis is followed by osteoclastic <b>bone</b> resorption. The increasing knowledge about the structure and functions of <b>bone</b> cells contributed {{to a better understanding of}} <b>bone</b> biology. It has been suggested that there is a complex communication between <b>bone</b> cells and other organs, indicating the dynamic nature of <b>bone</b> tissue.

40|$|The <b>bone</b> {{disease of}} preterm birth has {{traditionally}} been explained by a decrease in <b>bone</b> formation from insufficient availability of calcium and phosphorus. However, there is emerging evidence that there is increased <b>bone</b> resorption in the <b>bone</b> disease of preterm birth, an observation that indicates some other explanation for this condition. The biomechanical model of postnatal <b>bone</b> formation states that, through a regulatory feedback system in the <b>bone</b> called the mechanostat, <b>bone</b> is {{able to respond to}} increased <b>bone</b> loading by increasing <b>bone</b> strength and to decreased <b>bone</b> loading by decreasing <b>bone</b> strength. It is suggested that this increased <b>bone</b> resorption in the markedly preterm infant compared with the term infant is secondary to decreased <b>bone</b> loading. Application of this model to the fetus and preterm infant suggests that intrauterine <b>bone</b> loading of the fetus from movement and kicking against the uterus is critical for normal fetal <b>bone</b> formation. The associated muscle growth from this activity also contributes to <b>bone</b> loading. The markedly preterm infant is deprived of much of this critical time period of intrauterine <b>bone</b> accretion, and <b>bone</b> formation occurs in the less favorable extrauterine environment, where there is significantly less <b>bone</b> loading...|$|R
