Thus, {{a small number of}} discrete categories (e. g., happiness and sadness) may not reflect the subtlety and complexity of the affective states conveyed by such rich sources of information. Therefore, affective and behavioural computing researchers have recently invested increased effort in exploring how to best model, analyse, interpret and respond to the subtlety, complexity and continuity (represented along a continuum e. g., from- 1 to + 1) of affective behaviour in terms of latent dimensions (e. g., arousal, power and valence) and appraisals.

40|$|Integrative {{analysis}} of disparate data blocks {{measured on a}} common set of experimental subjects is a major challenge in modern data analysis. This data structure naturally motivates the simultaneous exploration of the joint <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> within each data block resulting in new insights. For instance, there is a strong desire to integrate the multiple genomic data sets in The Cancer Genome Atlas to characterize the common and also the unique aspects of cancer genetics and cell biology for each source. In this paper we introduce Angle-Based Joint <b>and</b> <b>Individual</b> <b>Variation</b> Explained capturing both joint <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> within each data block. This is a major improvement over earlier approaches to this challenge in terms of a new conceptual understanding, much better adaption to data heterogeneity and a fast linear algebra computation. Important mathematical contributions are the use of score subspaces as the principal descriptors of variation structure and the use of perturbation theory as the guide for variation segmentation. This leads to an exploratory data analysis method which is insensitive to the heterogeneity among data blocks and does not require separate normalization. An application to cancer data reveals different behaviors of each type of signal in characterizing tumor subtypes. An application to a mortality data set reveals interesting historical lessons.

40|$|Camouflage is {{widespread}} throughout {{the natural world}} and conceals animals from predators in a vast range of habitats. Because successful camouflage usually involves matching aspects of the background environment, species and populations should evolve appearances tuned to their local habitat, termed phenotype-environment associations. However, although this has been studied in various species, little work has objectively quantified the appearances of camouflaged animals from different habitats, or related this to factors such as ontogeny <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> <b>variation.</b> Here, we tested for phenotype-environment associations in the common shore crab (Carcinus maenas), a species highly variable in appearance and found {{in a wide range}} of habitats. We used field surveys and digital image analysis of the colors and patterns of crabs found in four locations around Cornwall in the UK to quantify how individuals vary with habitat (predominantly rockpool, mussel bed, and mudflat). We find that individuals from sites comprising different backgrounds show substantial differences in several aspects of color and pattern, and that this is also dependent on life stage (adult or juvenile). Furthermore, the level of <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> is dependent on site and life stage, with juvenile crabs often more variable than adults, <b>and</b> <b>individuals</b> from more homogenous habitats less diverse. Ours is the most comprehensive study to date exploring phenotype-environment associations for camouflage <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in a species, and we discuss the implications of our results in terms of the mechanisms and selection pressures that may drive this...|$|R

Fixed-effects modeling {{was used to remove}} dye and gel variability. Mixed-effects modeling was then used to quantitate the sources of proteomic variation. The subject-to-subject variation represented the largest variance component, while the time-within-subject variation was comparable to the experimental variation found in a previous technical variability study where one human plasma sample was processed eight times in parallel and each was then analyzed by 2 -D DIGE in triplicate. Here, 21 protein spots had larger than 50 % CV, suggesting that these proteins may not be appropriate as biomarkers and should be carefully scrutinized in future studies. Seventy-eight protein spots showing differential protein levels between different individuals or individual collections were identified by mass spectrometry and further characterized using hierarchical clustering. The results present a first step toward understanding the complexity of longitudinal <b>and</b> <b>individual</b> <b>variation</b> in the human plasma proteome, and provide a baseline for improved biomarker discovery...|$|R
