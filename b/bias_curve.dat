40|$|The {{estimation}} of evapotranspiration of blue water (ETb) from farmlands, due to irrigation, {{is crucial to}} improve water management, especially in regions where water resources are scarce. Large scale ETb was previously obtained, based on the differences between remote sensing derived actual ET and values simulated from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS). In this paper, we improve on the previous approach by enhancing the classification scheme employed so that it represents regions with common hydrometeorological conditions. Bias between the two data sets for reference areas (non-irrigated croplands) were identified per class, and used to adjust the remote sensing products. Different classifiers were compared and evaluated based on the generated <b>bias</b> <b>curves</b> per class and their variability. The results in Europe show that the k-means classifier was better suited to identify the <b>bias</b> <b>curves</b> per class, capturing the dynamic range of these curves and minimizing their variability within each corresponding class.

An important advantage of the LTM is that it is not geared towards symmetric error distributions, which makes it more generally applicable. We will see that the LTM has the same breakdown point as the LMS and the LTS, but that its gaussian efficiency is higher.

40|$|A new {{robust and}} {{statistically}} efficient estimator for ARMA models called the bounded influence propagation (BIP) τ-estimator is proposed. The estimator incorporates an auxiliary model, which prevents {{the propagation of}} outliers. Strong consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator for ARMA models that are driven by independently and identically distributed (iid) innovations with symmetric distributions are established. To analyze the infinitesimal effect of outliers on the estimator, the influence function is derived and computed explicitly for an AR(1) model with additive outliers. To obtain estimates for the AR(p) model, a robust Durbin-Levinson type and a forward-backward algorithm are proposed. An iterative algorithm to robustly obtain ARMA(p,q) parameter estimates is also presented. The problem of finding a robust initialization is addressed, which for orders p+q> 2 is a non-trivial matter. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator to existing robust methodologies for different types of outliers {{both in terms of}} average and of worst-case performance, as measured by the maximum <b>bias</b> <b>curve.</b> To illustrate the practical applicability of the proposed estimator, a real-data example of outlier cleaning for R-R interval plots derived from electrocardiographic (ECG) data is considered.

For general depth functions, {{we find out}} that these affine equivariant scatter estimators are Fisher consistent and unbiased {{for a wide range of}} multivariate distributions, and show that the sample scatter estimators are strong and -consistent and asymptotically normal, and the influence functions of the estimators exist and are bounded in general. We then concentrate on a specific case of the general depth weighted scatter estimators, the projection depth weighted scatter estimators, which include as a special case the well-known Stahel-Donoho scatter estimator whose limiting distribution has long been open until this paper. Large sample behavior, including consistency and asymptotic normality, and efficiency and finite sample behavior, including breakdown point and relative efficiency of the sample projection depth weighted scatter estimators, are thoroughly investigated. The influence function and the maximum bias of the projection depth weighted scatter estimators are derived and examined. Unlike typical high-breakdown competitors, the projection depth weighted scatter estimators can integrate high breakdown point and high efficiency while enjoying a bounded-influence function and a moderate maximum <b>bias</b> <b>curve.</b> Comparisons with leading estimators on asymptotic relative efficiency and gross error sensitivity reveal that the projection depth weighted scatter estimators behave very well overall and, consequently, represent very favorable choices of affine equivariant multivariate scatter estimators.

40|$|In this thesis, {{advanced}} robust estimation methodologies for {{signal processing}} are developed and analyzed. The developed methodologies solve problems concerning multi-sensor data, robust model selection {{as well as}} robustness for dependent data. The work {{has been applied to}} solve practical signal processing problems in different areas of biomedical and array signal processing. In particular, for univariate independent data, a robust criterion is presented to select the model order with an application to corneal-height data modeling. The proposed criterion overcomes some limitations of existing robust criteria. For real-world data, it selects the radial model order of the Zernike polynomial of the corneal topography map in accordance with clinical expectations, even if the measurement conditions for the videokeratoscopy, which is the state-of-the-art method to collect corneal-height data, are poor. For multi-sensor data, robust model order selection selection criteria are proposed and applied to the problem of estimating the number of sources impinging onto a sensor array. The developed criteria are based on a robust and efficient estimator of the covariance of the r-mode unfoldings of a complex valued data tensor. Both in the case of Gaussian noise and for a brief sensor failure, the proposed robust multi-dimensional schemes outperform their matrix computation based counterparts. In the context of robustness for multi-sensor data, we next investigate the problem of estimating the complex-valued amplitude of sinusoidal signals in a completely unknown heavy-tailed symmetric spatially and temporally independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) sensor noise environment. A selection of non-robust and robust estimators are compared to a proposed semi-parametric robust estimator. A third research focus in the area of multi-sensor data is that of analyzing the robustness of spatial time-frequency distribution (STFD) estimators. We provide a robustness analysis framework that is based on the influence function. The influence function is a robustness measure that describes the bias impact of an infinitesimal contamination at an arbitrary point on the estimator, standardized by the fraction of contamination. In addition to the asymptotic analysis, we also give a definition of the finite sample counterpart of the influence function. Simulation results for the finite sample influence function confirm the analytical results and show the insensitivity to small departures in the distributional assumptions for some recently proposed robust STFD estimators. A large part of this thesis concerns the topic of obtaining and analyzing robust estimators in the dependent data setup. First, some practical issues concerning the detection, and robust estimation in presence of patient motion induced artifacts in biomedical measurements are addressed. In particular, we provide an artifact-cleaning algorithm for data collected with an electrocardiogram (ECG). This is especially important for the monitoring of patients with portable ECG recording devices, since these devices suffer severely from patient motion induced artifacts. A second real-world problem addressed in this doctoral project is that of forecasting the intracranial pressure (ICP) levels for patients who suffered a traumatic brain injury. This enables active and early interventions for more effective control of ICP levels. We propose a methodology which uses combined artifact detection and robust estimation after a data transformation into the empirical mode domain. Motivated by plethora of practical applications, we then focus on deriving and analyzing sophisticated robust estimation and model selection techniques for autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models. A fast algorithm as well as a detailed statistical and robustness analysis of a novel robust and efficient estimator is given. For the proposed estimator, which is termed the bounded influence propagation (BIP) τ-estimator, we compute a complete statistical robustness analysis, which includes conditions for the consistency, as well as a proof of qualitative and quantitative robustness. The robustness is measured by means of the influence function, the maximum <b>bias</b> <b>curve</b> and the breakdown point. The fast algorithm of the proposed estimator is based on first computing a robust initial estimate of an autoregressive (AR) approximation from which the ARMA model parameters are derived. In this way, the ARMA model parameters are derived from the long AR approximation without further use of the outlier-contaminated observations. The estimator is very suitable and attractive for ARMA model selection purposes, since the computational cost of estimating all the candidate ARMA models approximately reduces to that of computing one long AR model. In the area of model selection for ARMA models, we propose and compare different robust model order selection criteria that are based on the BIP τ-estimator...|$|E
40|$|Heading {{direction}} is determined from visual and vestibular cues. Both sensory modalities {{have been shown}} to have better direction discrimination for headings near straight ahead. Previous studies of visual heading estimation have not used the full range of stimuli, and vestibular heading estimation has not previously been reported. The current experiments measure human heading estimation in the horizontal plane to vestibular, visual, and spoken stimuli. The vestibular and visual tasks involved 16 cm of platform or visual motion. The spoken stimulus was a voice command speaking a heading angle. All conditions demonstrated direction dependent biases in perceived headings such that biases increased with headings further from the fore-aft axis. The bias was larger with the visual stimulus when compared with the vestibular stimulus in all 10 subjects. For the visual and vestibular tasks precision was best for headings near fore-aft. The spoken headings had the least bias, and the variation in precision was less dependent on direction. In a separate experiment when headings were limited to ± 45 °, the biases were much less, demonstrating the range of headings influences perception. There was a strong and highly significant correlation between the <b>bias</b> <b>curves</b> for visual and spoken stimuli in every subject. The correlation between visual-vestibular and vestibular-spoken biases were weaker but remained significant.

40|$|The robust {{approach}} to data analysis uses models {{that do not}} completely specify {{the distribution of the}} data, but rather assume that this distribution belongs to a certain neighborhood of a parametric model. Consequently, robust inference should be valid under all the distributions in these neighborhoods. Regarding robust inference, there are two important sources of uncertainty: (i) sampling variability and (ii) bias caused by outlier and other contamination of the data. The estimates of the sampling variabil-ity provided by standard asymptotic theory generally require assumptions of symmetric error distribution or alternatively known scale. None of these assumptions are met in most practical problems where robust methods are needed. One alternative approach for estimating the sampling variability is to bootstrap a robust estimate. However, the classical bootstrap has two shortcomings in robust applications. First, it is compu-tationally very expensive (in some cases unfeasible). Second, the bootstrap quantiles are not robust. An alternative bootstrap procedure overcoming these problems is pre-sented. The bias uncertainty is usually ignored even by robust inference procedures. The consequence of ignoring the bias can result in true probability coverage for confidence intervals much lower that the nominal ones. Correspondingly, the true significance levels of tests may be much higher than the nominal ones. We will show how the bias uncertainty can be dealt with by using maximum <b>bias</b> <b>curves,</b> obtaining confidence in-terval and test valid for the entire neighborhood. Applications of these ideas to location and regression models will be given...|$|R

40|$|The {{perceived}} {{motion direction}} of a dynamic random dot stimulus is systematically biased when preceded by a motion discrimination task (Jazayeri and Movshon, 2007). The biases were originally thought to occur because subjects mistakenly reuse the neural read-out optimized for the discrimination task when forming the percept (Fig. 1 a, Task-dependent model). In a series of experiments, we demonstrated that this explanation is incorrect and that the biases actually result from the conditioning of the percept on the preceding discrimination judgment (Fig 1. b, Choice-dependent model). Experiment 1 was aimed at replicating the biases for an orientation stimulus. Subjects first indicated whether the stimulus orientation was clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) of a randomly chosen reference orientation. Subsequently they had to reproduce the stimulus orientation (Fig 1. c). Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 1 except that the total range of the stimulus were shown {{at the beginning of}} each trial. Experiment 3 was identical to Experiment 2 except that subjects were given the correct answer of the discrimination judgment (CW/CCW) and they instead performed an irrelevant decision task. Subjects’ estimates were systematically biased away from the decision boundary in Exp. 1 (Fig. 1 c). Similar biases occurred in Exp. 2 and 3. Because the task-dependent model is insensitive to the stimulus range and is contingent on subjects performing a discrimination, it cannot capture the shift of <b>bias</b> <b>curves</b> in Exp. 2 and in Exp. 3.

The native oxide layer with dierent thicknesses on chemically cleaned on Si surface were obtained by exposing the surfaces to clean room air before evaporating metal. The native oxide thicknesses of samples D 2, D 3, D 4 and D 5 are in the form D 2 < D 3 < D 4 D 5, depending on the exposing time. It has been seen that the values of barrier height b of samples D 2 (0. 64 eV), D 3 (0. 66 eV), D 4 (0. 69 eV) and D 5 (0. 69 eV) with the interfacial layer increased with increasing the exposure time and tended {{to that of the}} initial sample D 1 (nonoxidezed sample, 0. 74 eV), and thus also their I-V and C-V curves.

In particular, reverse <b>bias</b> <b>curves</b> of samples D 2, D 3, D 4 and D 5 have shown excellent saturation which may be attributed to the passivation of the semiconductor surface states by the native oxide layer which reduces the penetration of the wave functions of electron in the metal into the semiconductor.

Nanoporous silicon (NPSi) layers have been prepared by anodically etching the unpolished p-type Si[100] wafer with surface resistivity of 4 – 8 Ω cm- 1 in hydrofluoric solution at 1 : 1 ratio of ethanol. Aluminum (Al) was doped on NPSi using cathodic electrodeposition composed of aluminum chloride (AlCl 3) and ethanol electrolyte. A diode structure has been fabricated comprising a semi-transparent Au/NPSi:Al/p-Si/Al ohmic contact electrode showing rectification on a forward <b>bias</b> I–V <b>curve.</b> EL from NPSi and NPSi:Al/p-Si has also been observed using the diode structure. The NPSi:Al/p-Si device shows increasing EL quantum efficiency at about 30 %, and blue-shift EL spectra are observed. Possible reasons for the enhancement will be discussed.

40|$|It is {{important}} to improve the frequency tracking between the RF drive and the cavity field {{for the purpose of}} reducing longitudinal phase oscillations and increasing the effective accelerating voltage. And this is especially beneficial for Booster running at higher intensity with smaller beam emittance. Optimizing the <b>bias</b> supply current <b>curve</b> for the ferrite tuners can reduce the phase error between the RF drive and the cavity field, and also improve the HLRF-to-LLRF frequency tracking efficiency.
