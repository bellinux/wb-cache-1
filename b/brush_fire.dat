5|$|A {{wildfire}} or {{wildland fire}} is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation that occurs in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a <b>brush</b> <b>fire,</b> bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfireâ€™s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E

25|$|Universal Studios Hollywood's back lot {{has been}} damaged by fire nine times {{throughout}} its history. The first was in 1932 when embers from a nearby <b>brush</b> <b>fire</b> were blown toward the back lot causing four movie sets to be destroyed and resulting in over $100,000 damage. Seventeen years later, in 1949, another <b>brush</b> <b>fire</b> caused the complete destruction of one building and damage to two others. In 1957, the New York street film studio set was destroyed by an arson fire causing {{half a million dollars}} in damage. Ten years later, in 1967, twice as much damage was done when the Little Europe area and part of Spartacus Square was destroyed. It also destroyed the European, Denver and Laramie street sets. In 1987, the remaining portion of Spartacus Square was destroyed along with street sets and other buildings. As with the 1957 fire, this was suspected {{to be the result of}} an arsonist. Just three years later, another deliberate fire was started in the back lot. The New York Street set, the Ben Hur set and the majority of Courthouse Square were destroyed. In 1997, the seventh fire occurred at the back lot. A portion of the Courthouse Square was again destroyed, though most survived.|$|E

It boasted a 16-inch (406.4mm) reflective telescope from which many astronomical finds were made. It was blown down in a gale in 1928. The railway fell in stages to the Echo Mountain House fire, a kitchen fire on February 4, 1900; a wind-aided <b>brush</b> <b>fire</b> on Echo Mountain in 1905, which wiped out everything except the observatory and the astronomer's cabin; a Rubio Canyon flash flood in 1909 that destroyed the Pavilion; and an electrical fire that razed the Tavern in 1936.

He also stated that his superior weaponry {{was the only thing that}} prevented his party from being overrun.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed without {{multiple}} sets, out-of-studio locations, {{or a large}} amount of extras. In addition, the budget for the episode was kept to a minimum.
