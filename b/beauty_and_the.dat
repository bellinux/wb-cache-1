5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E

5|$|Decades later, {{during the}} {{production}} of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1987, the Disney studio resurrected <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast as a project for the satellite animation studio it had set up in London, England to work on Roger Rabbit. Richard Williams, who had directed the animated portions of Roger Rabbit, was approached to direct but declined in favor of continuing work on his long-gestating project The Thief and the Cobbler. In his place, Williams recommended his colleague, English animation director Richard Purdum, and work began under producer Don Hahn on a non-musical version of <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast set in 19th century France. At the behest of Disney CEO Michael Eisner, <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast became the first Disney animated film to use a screenwriter. This was an unusual production move for an animated film, which is traditionally developed on storyboards rather than in scripted form. Linda Woolverton wrote the original draft of the story before storyboarding began, and worked with the story team to retool and develop the film.|$|E

5|$|<b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast is a 1991 American {{animated}} musical romantic fantasy film {{produced by}} Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The 30th Disney animated feature film {{and the third}} released during the Disney Renaissance period, {{it is based on}} the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (who was also credited in the English version as well as in the French version), and ideas from the 1946 French film of the same name directed by Jean Cocteau. <b>Beauty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Beast focuses on the relationship between the Beast (voice of Robby Benson), a prince who is magically transformed into a monster and his servants into household objects as punishment for his arrogance, and Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara), a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle.
