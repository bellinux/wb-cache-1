500|$|In 1976, Robert Christgau {{wrote an}} article titled [...] "Yes, There Is a Rock-Critic Establishment (<b>But</b> <b>Is</b> <b>That</b> Bad for Rock?)". Noting {{that there is a}} {{difference}} between [...] "rock critics" [...] and the [...] "rock press", he lists the [...] "establishment" [...] members as himself, Jon Landau, Dave Marsh, Paul Nelson, and John Rockwell. Christgau also concedes that [...] "Because we are all self-taught (of necessity, since our academy is as yet informal), even the best of our work has the faults of autodidacticism: eccentricity, incompleteness, self-indulgence. The worst of our work, meanwhile, has the faults of drivel. ... Yet I read on, as much from inclination as from duty, and find that a fair portion of what is bad, like some strains of 'bad' rock and roll, has the sloppy appeal of all open, democratic phenomena." [...] Christgau later accused Rolling Stone of promoting a [...] "boring rock-as-idealism myth" [...] and [...] "claiming suzerainty over the music ever since" [...] the magazine was founded in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard’s {{discourse}} {{has to do}} {{with the}} difference between wishing and willing in the development of a particular expectancy. [...] "As thought becomes more absorbed in the future, it loses its way in its restless attempt to force or entice an explanation from the riddle." [...] Expectancy always looks to the future and can hope, but regret, which is what Goethe did in his book The Sorrows of Young Werther, closes the door of hope and love becomes unhappy. Kierkegaard points to [...] "faith as the highest" [...] expectancy because faith is something that everyone has, or can have. He says: [...] "The person who wishes it for another person wishes it for himself; the person who wishes it for himself wishes it for every other human being, because that by which another person has faith is not that by which he is different from him <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> by which he is like him; that by which he possesses it is not that by which he is different from others but that by which he is altogether like all." ...|$|E

500|$|Claire Zulkey of The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "In {{some ways the}} episode almost felt too comfortable, with the {{familiar}} story lines and even the obligatory fantasy featuring Baldwin as a former president. The show, thus far post-strike, hasn't seemed like it has distinguished itself too much from Season 1. [...] <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> really so bad?" [...] Ann Oldenburg of USA Today said that [...] "As always, [...] 30 Rock was filled with fast one-liners." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Even for the always politically astute 30 Rock, last night's episode was unusually so." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] episode of 30 Rock had more jokes and one-liners - the kind where you actually smile and laugh out loud" [...] and that [...] "There's no other comedy that's running on all cylinders like 30 Rock is right now." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] was filled not with just great laughs, but also some heart. Damn the roller coaster that is the crazy Dennis-and-Liz on-again/off-again thing!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film's premiere, Trier {{published}} a [...] "director's statement", where {{he wrote that}} he had started to regret having made such a polished film, but that he hoped it would contain some flaws {{which would make it}} interesting. The director wrote: [...] "I desired to dive headlong into the abyss of German romanticism.... <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> not just another way of expressing defeat? Defeat to the lowest of cinematic common denominators? Romance is abused in all sorts of endlessly dull ways in mainstream products." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, Kevin P. Sullivan of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} episode a C rating, stating [...] "there was the unshakable sense that {{something}} was off — like we’re in an invasion movie and are starting to suspect that our friend has been body-snatched. It looks like Fargo, {{and it sounds like}} Fargo. <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> really Fargo in there? [...] All of the pieces are here for a season of Fargo, but there’s no heart. The show still looks like our friend, but there’s no life in its eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blake's 7 {{received}} {{both positive}} and negative reviews. [...] The fourth episode Time Squad review by Stanley Reynolds of The Times stated, [...] "...nice to hear the youngsters holding their breath in anticipation of a little terror." [...] Reynolds elaborated, [...] "Television science fiction has got too self-consciously jokey lately. [...] It is also nice to have each episode complete within itself, while still carrying on the saga of Blake's struggle against the 1984-ish Federation. <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> dark-haired telepathic alien girl, the latest addition to Blake's outer-space merry men, going to spell love trouble for blonde Jenna? [...] Maid Marian never had that trouble in Sherwood Forest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Many times an {{individual}} has a physical sickness {{and goes to the}} physician for help. <b>But</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the only kind of sickness there is? Kierkegaard was interested in spiritual sickness called sin and the expectancy of forgiveness which are both Christian categories. We [...] "must want to understand the forgiveness of sins-and then despair of understanding it." [...] Later, in The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard writes of the sin of despairing over one's sin and the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins. Robert L. Perkins from Mercer University published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to fear and wonder within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.|$|E
