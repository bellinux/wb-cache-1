6000|$|... "Rise, and cease from flatteries," [...] said Ithobal shortly; [...] "I may {{be greater}} than the other kings, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> do not think it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She did {{not think}} so. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> cannot say the same of mine. I can hardly imagine {{anything}} more strange, more utterly inexplicable, than {{the situation in which}} I find myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, take it {{from the}} start. It lies between few people, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three. <b>You</b> want one person for suicide; two people for murder; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three people for blackmail" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For shame, Honor, as if {{you ought}} not to respect Hiltonbury too much to tack it to my petticoat! <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> thank <b>you,</b> for if you could once think of {{committing}} Hiltonbury to him, you must like it for me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{cannot be}} dogmatic about it, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> without what <b>you</b> have ventured to call monstrous conceit we can surely {{say that we}} are the highest thing in nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you?" [...] said Frank. [...] "If {{you think}} that I fancy myself a better man than the Yankee, you mistake me: <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> will confess that I am not working for money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Do {{as so many}} of {{the rest}} are doing, Mr. Warrington. Et tu, Brute, as the play says. Well, well, Harry! I did not think it of you; <b>but,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>you</b> are in the fashion.' ...|$|E
60|$|BROADBENT. Surely {{the text}} refers to our {{right and left}} hands. I am {{somewhat}} surprised to hear a member of your Church quote so essentially Protestant a document as the Bible; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> might quote it accurately.|$|E
6000|$|Said Juan--"Whatsoever {{is to be}} [...] Done, I'll not {{quit her}} till she seems secure [...] Of present life {{a good deal more}} than we."-- [...] Quoth Johnson--"Neither will I quite insure; [...] <b>But</b> <b>at</b> the <b>least</b> <b>you</b> may die gloriously."-- [...] Juan replied--" [...] <b>At</b> <b>least</b> I will endure [...] Whate'er is to be borne--but not resign [...] This child, who is parentless, and {{therefore}} mine." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>you</b> see, <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>you</b> {{had done}} nothing to offend me; and I dare say you will {{let me have a}} note from time to time, until we shall have another chance to meet.--Yours sincerely, ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.|$|R
6000|$|Said Juan: 'Whatsoever {{is to be}} [...] Done, I 'll not {{quit her}} till she seems secure [...] Of present life {{a good deal more}} than we.' [...] Quoth Johnson: 'Neither will I quite ensure; [...] <b>But</b> <b>at</b> the <b>least</b> <b>you</b> may die gloriously.' [...] Juan replied: 'At least I will endure [...] Whate'er is to be borne--but not resign [...] This child, who is parentless, and {{therefore}} mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] Wrayson answered, [...] "and my {{question}} is this. I cannot ask you why you and she parted, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> can {{tell me if you}} know of any reason why I should not ask her to be my wife." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{brings us}} to an {{afternoon}} when the Gardens were white with snow, and there was ice on the Round Pond, not thick enough to skate on <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> could spoil it for to-morrow by flinging stones, and many bright little boys and girls were doing that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! but I {{know you}} don't approve it. You are not lay woman {{enough to be}} impartial, and you belong to the age that was trying the {{experiment}} of the hierarchy modified: I to that which has found it will not do. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> understand my view; I have made out my case." ...|$|E
5000|$|Aaron also {{explained}} that the series will not tie into the ongoing events of the Marvel Universe, such as Dark Reign, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>at</b> first: “You'll see plenty of references to the big events of the Marvel U in these pages, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> initially, <b>you</b> won't see us doing any crossovers or tie-ins...Again, I {{want this to be}} a series that anybody can step right into and enjoy, regardless of how many Wolverine comics they've read before.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Black Heart, {{you seem}} to have won the day, <b>but</b> me <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> lose and--the sun is not yet set. After sunset comes the night, Black Heart, and in that night I pray that you may wander eternally, and be given to drink of my blood and the blood of Umgona my father, and the blood of Nahoon my husband, who saved your life, and whom you have murdered. Perchance, Black Heart, we may yet meet yonder--in the House of the Dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My people," [...] he said, [...] "listen. Many of {{you have}} heard of the war which the English have been {{carrying}} on in Egypt. You have heard perhaps of a Captain Erlito, who, with a dozen men, held a Nile fort for two days against a thousand dervishes, and for this and other acts of valour has won the Iron Cross. <b>But</b> this <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> do not know. Captain Erlito is the assumed name of Ughtred of Tyrnaus, Prince of Theos." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's one of {{the uses}} of coming here to Herr Schurz's,' Ernest {{answered}} quickly. 'You {{may not agree with}} all you hear, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> learn to see others as they see themselves; whereas if you mix always in English society, and read only English papers, you will see them only as we English see them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see you esteem {{it a great}} liberty,' said poor Mr. Calthorp; 'but {{you must}} forgive my impulse to see whether I could be of any {{assistance}} to you. I will do as you desire, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> will let me leave Stefano with you; he is a fellow full of resources, who would make you comfortable here, and me easy about you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know you, {{and others}} shall know you, too. You shameless creature! You knew how I stood. And yet you used your vile power {{to bring me}} to your side. You may, perhaps, do so again, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> will {{remember}} that you have heard me say that I love Miss Marden {{from the bottom of}} my soul, and that I loathe you, abhor you! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not palatial, as you see, but {{comfortable}} and, I flatter myself, typically French. Don't {{you love}} the red plush and the gilt mirror? Of course, one doesn't sit upon the chairs or look into the mirror, <b>but</b> they <b>at</b> <b>least</b> remind <b>you</b> of the country you're in." ...|$|R
5000|$|GamesRadar {{said the}} game was [...] "probably too lightweight, too easy and unsophisticated for most {{adventure}} gamers... but don't hold that against it." [...] PC Zone said that the game [...] "creates a warm feeling that doesn't provide belly-laughs, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> fixes <b>you</b> up with a permanent half-grin." [...] However, PopMatters gave it four stars out of 10 and stated that the game [...] "isn’t all that dissimilar from older PC adventure games: {{for the most part}} it’s a one-click interface; one clicks on objects and characters to interact with them. There are also several minigame-style segments: a pair of chase sequences, a logic puzzle, a hide-and-seek sequence. The unfortunate thing is that none of this is particularly fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|Martha shrugged her shoulders. [...] "Then the {{treasure}} {{will be lost}} also, that is if I am gone. It is as God wills; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> in name <b>you</b> are the heiress, and you should {{know where to find}} its secret, which may serve you or your country in good stead in time to come. I give you no paper, I tell you only where to seek a paper, and now I must be gone to reach the borders of the Mere by daybreak. Have you any message for your love, lady?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He seemed {{somewhat}} struck aback at my manner, but he presently laughed lightly. [...] "You {{take the}} matter with most admirable coolness," [...] said he; [...] "far more than I would do were I in your place. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> will now perceive why I chose rather {{to come to you}} of myself than to send a messenger to you where a matter of such delicacy was concerned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good morning, Lisle! I {{am going}} out with the hounds, tomorrow. They meet near here. As you are not great riders, I won't press you {{to go with me}} <b>but,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>you</b> will ride with me to the meet. It is sure to be a good gathering, and you will {{probably}} meet some nice girls; who will, no doubt, have much greater attractions, for young fellows like you, than a gallop round the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will say}} no more," [...] she declared, {{with a sudden}} note of dignity in her tone. [...] "I can see that I am judged already in your mind. After all, it does not really matter. No one likes to be thought worse of than they deserve, and women are all--a little foolish. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> must answer me one question. I {{have the right to}} ask it. You must tell me where he is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you might}} reproach me, and reasonably, as your guardian, for my neglect," [...] said the cardinal. [...] "But my power was very limited, and, when my duties commenced, you must {{remember}} that I was myself estranged from the Church, I was myself a Parliamentary Christian, till despondency and study and ceaseless thought and prayer, and the Divine will, brought me to light and rest. <b>But</b> I <b>at</b> <b>least</b> saved <b>you</b> from a Presbyterian university; I <b>at</b> <b>least</b> secured Oxford for you; and I can assure you, of my many struggles, {{that was not the}} least." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] he said, [...] "I'm {{going to}} do it. I'm {{going to do}} what I can. I'm going to be as you wish me to be, to help you, to serve you.... If you can't come to meet me, I'll meet you. I can't help but love you, I can't do without you. Never in my life have I subscribed willingly to the idea of {{renunciation}}. I've hated renunciation. But if there is no other course but renunciation, renunciation let it be. I'm bitter about this, bitter to the bottom of my soul, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> I'll have <b>you</b> know I love you. Anyhow...." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{the radio}} series has one trainee, the TV version has several young {{professionals}} {{working at the}} agency. Most notable are Jamie Front (James Lance) and Alison Jackman (Zoe Telford). While Jamie is a brilliant liar and naturally devious, Alison is very intelligent but too honest and somewhat literal-minded. Charles Prentiss said of her, [...] "Most {{of the young people}} here at Prentiss McCabe don't know their arse from their elbow, <b>but</b> with Alison, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> know she'll join the Royal Arse Society and get a book about elbows from the library". Also in the firm are Cat Durnford (Sally Bretton), the young party girl, and Nick Mayer (Nick Burns), Charles's personal assistant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why you? You are too vexing, Bertie. Have you no sort {{of feeling}} for the family? You are too lazy {{to try to be}} a credit to {{yourself}}, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> can exert yourself to prevent Gussie's disgracing us. You are going to America because you are Gussie's cousin, because you have always been his closest friend, because you are {{the only one of the}} family who has absolutely nothing to occupy his time except golf and night clubs.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The cottage loaf and the pennyworth of milk {{had been}} set forth {{on a sheet of}} paper on the window-seat. The cherubic pocket-knife, with the first bit of the loaf still on its point, lay beside them where it had been hastily thrown down. Bella took the bit off, and put it in her mouth. 'My dear child,' said her father, 'the idea of your partaking of such lowly fare! <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> must have your own loaf and your own penn'orth. One moment, my dear. The Dairy is just over the way and round the corner.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in suspense," [...] Prince Shan admitted, [...] "and perhaps," [...] he went on, {{with one}} of his rare smiles, [...] "it {{occurred}} to me that it would be in one sense a relief to speak to a fellow man of the hopes and fears that are in my heart. You are the one person to whom I could speak, Lord Dorminster. You have not wished my suit well, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>you</b> have been clear-sighted. I think it has never occurred to you that a prince of China might venture to compete with a peer of England." ...|$|E
5000|$|Christianity Todays Joel Oliphint said [...] "The Wreckings first album, A New Abolition, was {{all over}} the map stylistically, {{incorporating}} worship songs, hip-hop, and even a cover of Peter Gabriels In Your Eyes. It didnt always work, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> it kept <b>you</b> guessing. So Much for Love, on the other hand, is 14 tracks of consistently normal, predictable pop rock, with verses that only exist to forecast fist-pumping choruses. The slick sound recently scored the band a spot on Showtime series The Big C, and the formula will likely serve The Wrecking well on the radio. But it makes for a humdrum listen." [...] Christianity Today said the top song was [...] "View from the Top".|$|R
40|$|In {{these days}} of research-assessment {{exercises}} and cost-cutting measures, {{if you have not}} arranged beforehand for the proceedings of your conference to be published, you can expect fewer proposals for papers from experts {{at the cutting edge of}} their subject. Many departments will not normally fund attendance at conferences, especially those held abroad, unless there is a concrete outcome which can be added to the departmental publications list. This is why, over the last few years, we have seen such an increase in the number of edited conference papers. Unfortunately (and I certainly do not include this current issue of ALT-J in this statement, because the selection procedure has been really quite cruel), many of these proceedings are of low overall quality. The is no doubt partly because once your paper has been accepted for the conference, you want as much of a guarantee of publication as possible before you turn up and give it, and conference organisers are thus under pressure not to give the copper-bottomed guarantee they cannot of course give, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> to keep <b>you,</b> as far as possible, in Promise Land. This situation tends to lead to diluted proceedings...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is Mr. Pendennis {{proceeding}} with his canvass? I try and avoid a certain subject, {{but it will}} come. You know who is canvassing against us here. My poor uncle has met with very considerable success amongst the lower classes. He makes them rambling speeches at which my brother and his friends laugh, but which the people applaud. I saw him only yesterday, {{on the balcony of}} the King's Arms, speaking to a great mob, who were cheering vociferously below. I had met him before. He would not even stop and give his Ethel of old days his hand. I would have given him I don't know what, for one kiss, for one kind word; but he passed on and would not answer me. He thinks me--what the world thinks me, worldly and heartless; what I was. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> dear Laura, <b>you</b> know that I always truly loved him, and do now, although he is our enemy, though he believes and utters the most cruel things against Barnes, though he says that Barnes Newcome, my father's son, my brother, Laura, is not an honest man. Hard, selfish, worldly, I own my poor brother to be, and pray Heaven to amend him; but dishonest! and to be so maligned by the person one loves best in the world! This is a hard trial. I pray a proud heart may be bettered by it.|$|R
