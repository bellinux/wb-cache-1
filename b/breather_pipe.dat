50|$|Another {{issue that}} has been raised as a {{possible}} problem with allowing oil vapor into the intake is the chance of pre-detonation (Knock) caused by the oil vapor exploding during the compression cycle of the engine. This has become more of an issue {{as more and more}} cars have started to run high boost levels and high compression ratios. The higher the compression and boost the more likely the oil is to start to burn (Pre-Detonate)Fitting an oil catch tank (can) in the <b>breather</b> <b>pipe</b> will stop the oil vapors from reaching the combustion chamber. This will reduce the knock effect.|$|E
50|$|In many vehicles, a {{crankcase}} <b>breather</b> <b>pipe</b> feeds {{into the}} air intake to vent the crankcase without releasing raw hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. In a highly worn engine, hot gases, including unburnt fuel can blow past the piston rings and into the crankcase. This creates an excess oil mist, which is then drawn from the crankcase {{into the air}} intake via the breather. A diesel engine will readily burn this oil mist as fuel, since engine oil has similar energy content and combustion properties as diesel fuel. The extra fuel causes the engine revolutions to increase, causing still more oil mist to be {{forced out of the}} crankcase and into the engine, and a positive feedback loop is created. The engine quickly reaches a point where it is generating so much fuel from its own crankcase oil that it can sustain operation even with the normal fuel supply shut off, and it will run faster and faster until it is destroyed.|$|E
40|$|Icing in {{an engine}} {{breather}} system can block the engine <b>breather</b> <b>pipe,</b> cause excessive crankcase pressure and degrade the engine performance. In this project, a numerical study, experimental tests and CFD analysis {{are employed in}} order to understand condensation and the extent of freezing inside a vertical pipe, a horizontal pipe and a T-joint pipe which are exposed to an external convective cooling. The pipe internal flow is assumed to be a vapour/air mixture. This study has led an evaluation of freezing in an engine <b>breather</b> <b>pipe.</b> The finding in this project highlighted the effects of the pipe internal flow condition (vapour mass fraction, relative humidity, mixture gas flow rate, and inlet relative humidity), the pipe external cooling condition (temperature and air velocity) and pipe thermal conductivity on condensation and extents of ice formation in the pipe. In the experimental study, a test rig has been designed and the condensation and freezing in the pipe have been tested at the Cranfield Icing Tunnel. The local pipe temperatures are measured to validate the numerical and the CFD analysis. The numerical study has led to develop a one dimensional code which used heat and mass analogy to model condensation and freezing in a vertical pipe exposed to a cold air flow (- 20 C). This code satisfactory predicts the trend and magnitude of the local temperatures and heat transfer coefficient along the vertical pipe at available test condition within an acceptable uncertainty of 25 %. This study proposes an empirical correlation based on a degradation factor to evaluate heat transfer coefficient inside a vertical pipe. Its results fit with the experimental data within 15 % uncertainty. The CFD methodology developed in this study is capable of predicting condensation rates, local temperatures, heat transfer coefficients and extent of freezing in the pipes with good agreement with the experimental results. The CFD model over predicts the <b>breather</b> <b>pipe</b> ice blockage time due to disparities between an actual engine operating condition and the CFD model. Therefore, an adjustment factor of 1. 7 is proposed in this study to correlate the predicted blockage time. The results of this study can help Jaguar to establish guideline for future design of engines breather pipes...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the suitability of treated secondary sewage effluent for irrigation of horticultural crops in Botswana. Secondary effluent water was sampled every month for one year, from a <b>breather</b> <b>pipe</b> on the pivot irrigation system at the Botswana College of Agriculture, Notwane Farm, Gaborone, using USEPA procedures and guidelines. The results of the study showed that the secondary sewage effluent from the activated sewage treatment plant in Gaborone had the following physico-chemical properties: Electrical Conductivity (EC) of 0. 51 dS m - 1, pH 9. 08, total dissolved solids of 358 mg L - 1, total alkalinity of 234 mg L - 1 as CaCO 3, Cl - 70 mg L - 1, NaCl 115 mg L - 1, Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) of 2. 26, NO 3 - 5. 56 mg L - 1, NH 4 + 0. 3 mg L - 1, NO 2 - 0. 0184 mg L - 1, total Fe 0. 623 mg L - 1 and faecal coliforms of 5 / 100 mL. The current results suggest that the Gaborone secondary sewage effluent is suitable for unrestricted irrigation of horticultural crops based on the EC, SAR, Cl -, NaCl, faecal coliforms, available plant nutrients and the low concentration of heavy metals (Pb, Cr, Cu, Co, Cd, As and Se all present in parts per billion) ...|$|E
