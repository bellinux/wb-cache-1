50|$|Line 4 was {{the first}} line to connect the Right and Left Banks of Paris via an {{underwater}} tunnel, built between 1905 and 1907. Line 4 long ran the oldest cars in service on the system, the MP 59, which used rubber tyres to dissipate the <b>braking</b> power <b>through</b> <b>resistance.</b> Those trains were withdrawn from service {{during the course of}} 2011 and 2012 after 45 years (with some being in service for 50 years). They were replaced by the MP 89 CC stock from Line 1. (From :fr:Ligne 4 du métro de Paris).|$|R

50|$|The parking (or emergency) {{brake system}} {{controls}} the <b>brakes</b> <b>through</b> {{a series of}} steel cables that are connected to either a hand lever or a foot pedal. The {{idea is that the}} system is fully mechanical and completely bypasses the hydraulic system so that the vehicle can be brought to a stop even if there is a total brake failure. Here the cable pulls on a lever mounted in the brake and is directly connected to the brake shoes. This has the effect of bypassing the wheel cylinder and controlling the brakes directly.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1980s his team equipped a Mercedes-Benz van with cameras and other sensors. The 5-ton van was re-engineered such {{that it was possible to}} control steering wheel, throttle, and <b>brakes</b> <b>through</b> computer commands based on real-time evaluation of image sequences. Software was written that translated the sensory data into appropriate driving commands. For safety reasons, initial experiments in Bavaria took place on streets without traffic. Since 1986 the Robot Car [...] "VaMoRs" [...] managed to drive all by itself, since 1987 at speeds up to 96 km/h, or roughly 60 mph.|$|R
50|$|The Learjet 25 utilize {{wheel brakes}} {{as the primary}} method for {{reducing}} speed after landing. The brake system utilizes hydraulic pressure for power boost. The brake valves are controlled via the rudder pedal toe <b>brakes</b> <b>through</b> mechanical linkages. Two shuttle valves in the pressure lines prevent fluid feedback between the pilot's and copilot's pedals. Four additional shuttle valves connect the pneumatic system to the brake system for emergency braking. An integral anti-skid system in installed to affect maximum braking efficiency. In order to minimize heat build-up in the brakes and reduce brake wear, pilots are advised to deploy the spoilers upon touchdown.|$|R
5000|$|The 2C was {{the next}} car with the {{innovative}} in-car adjustable rear wing. The integrated spoiler-wing was designed to lie flat for low drag on the straights and tip up under <b>braking</b> <b>through</b> the corners. This was a direct benefit of the clutchless semi-automatic transmission which kept the driver's left foot free to operate the wing mechanism. The 2C {{was based on a}} Chevrolet designed aluminum chassis and was a smaller car in every dimension than the 2B. Without the natural non-resonant damping of the fiberglass chassis, Hall nicknamed it the EBJ — [...] "eye ball jiggler".|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} fully self-consistent N-body experiments of barred galaxies {{with massive}} halos. A rotating bar is <b>braked</b> <b>through</b> dynamical friction with the halo, which occurs {{on a short}} time scale when the central density of the halo is high. On the other hand, friction is weak in a model with a central halo density low enough that the disk dominates the rotation curve in the inner parts; this model supports a fast bar for a Hubble time. We conclude that real barred galaxies in which the bar rotates rapidly, which {{is believed to be}} the rule, must have close to maximum disks. 1...|$|R

30|$|The battery charges with {{electricity}} either when plugged in the electricity grid via a charging device or during <b>braking</b> <b>through</b> recuperation. The charger {{is a crucial}} component since its efficiency can vary today between 60 % and 97 %, wasting 3 % to 40 % of the grid energy as heat. The motor controller supplies the electric motor with variable power depending on the load situation. The electric motor converts the electric energy into mechanical energy and, when used within a drivetrain, to torque. In series BEV produced so far, central engines have been used; however, hub wheel electric engines are also possible and would be available for mass production (summarized in [5]).|$|R

5000|$|The B09/60 is an {{evolution}} of the Lola B08/60 LMP1 design used by Aston Martin Racing in 2008.

This V12 is a little heavier, taller and longer than custom-built prototype racing engines. The standard Lola gearbox {{was replaced by a}} more compact Xtrac 6-speed which is operated with paddle-shifting.
