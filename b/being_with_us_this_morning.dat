I hope {{we have an opportunity to}} greet each of you before the evening is over.

This project was completed because of the hard work and efforts taken by many individuals who have helped <b>us</b> materialize <b>this</b> idea. We take this opportunity to express our deep indebtedness to the faculty of “VIVEKANAND EDUCATION SOCIETY‘S INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY”. From the core of our heart we give special thanks to our project guide Prof. Abhay Kshirsagar who has guided us at each and every Stage in our project. We all pay deep gratitude to him for having been a constant source of inspiration and for helping us in our difficulties. We pay special thanks to the Department of Electronics, under Prof. Kavita Tiwari for helping <b>us</b> to make <b>this</b> project a grand success.

40|$|At {{the outset}} let me mention {{that it is}} indeed a great honour for my country, Sri Lanka and me {{personally}} to have been invited by the President and the Secretary General of IFLA to be a plenary speaker at the World Library and Information Congress in Oslo, Norway. I {{take this opportunity to}} thank the President and Executive Committee of IFLA for this rare privilege bestowed upon me. I must also thank the members of this august assembly, leaders and trail blazers in the library and information field for <b>being</b> here <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in <b>this</b> beautiful Nordic city of Oslo when we share our knowledge and experience in the belief that it would lead to greater understanding and co-operation among those engaged in the field of librarianship. First of all I must apologise to the distinguished audience for speaking about a tragedy at the first session of this mega conference, immediately following the magnificent opening ceremony, which was attended by Norway’s royalty. On a more positive note this particular tragedy is now an event of the past and I believe that many lessons can be learnt from it. It is somewhat fortunate that throughout history large-scale library tragedies have been rare and far between, even though library catastrophes have occurred from Alexandria to Iraq, for reasons ranging from earthquakes to floods and from simple arson to aerial bombing.
