Research purpose: The objectives of the study were to determine the relationship between self-esteem (as the Culture Free Self-Esteem Inventory measures it) and employability attributes (as the Employability Attributes Scale measures it); to determine whether people’s biographical details significantly predict their self-esteem and employability attributes; and whether men and women differ significantly in their self-esteem and employability attributes. Motivation for the study: There seems to be a paucity of studies that investigate how people’s self-esteem relates to their employability attributes in South Africa’s multi-cultural context. Research design, approach and method: The researcher conducted a quantitative survey on a convenience sample of 304 employed adults enrolled for an honours degree in business management in a higher education institution. She used correlational statistics, multiple regression analyses, categorical regressions and independent t -tests to analyse the data. Main findings: The researcher found a number of significant relationships between the participants’ self-esteem and employability. The results showed that biographical details significantly predicted participants’ employability attributes. Practical/managerial implications: Career counsellors and human resource practitioners need to recognise how people’s self-esteem and their <b>biographical</b> details <b>influence</b> their employability attributes.

40|$|Borges saw {{narrative}} as {{the bearer of}} universally re-combinable elements. Although these elements seem sequential, their essential formal integrity guarantees their rearrangement to generate new narratives. The ficción lives beyond its author. However, Borges’ ontological anxieties also {{have a life of}} their own that undermines the ficción’s assimilative potential. By developing poetic and linguistic insights Borges creates immortal text through the construction of a symbolic repertoire. Each element of the repertoire has its genesis in the author’s personal development. This history is archaeologised in the early poetry and mediated through a theory of metaphor and the reader’s interaction with the text. Borges sees no need for a Freudian reading theory. Instead he develops an antipsychological poetics. He enlists the reader as a willing participant in the text by a dual strategy of symbolic incorporation. Firstly, readers identify with characters through vicarious emotional prediction. Secondly, he refreshes the reader’s participation by presenting emblematic devices serving as sub-text to enhance symbolic participation. Together these strategies constitute a ‘magic causality’ of negotiated textual interpretation continually operating in his narratives. But the discipline of magic causality also conceals a rhetoric of presence establishing counter-motivational effects to disturb symbolic incorporation at the level of genre. The dissertation extracts key features for scrutiny from Borges’ early literary theory and criticism, elaborating them into a general aesthetic programme. It examines <b>biographical</b> <b>influences</b> in shaping his critical and creative work. It problematises his texts from the point of view of his ideas about linguistics, their identity as contributions to the genre of the ficción, and the centrality of metaphor and analogy as interpretative strategies. I use a number of approaches for this enterprise, including biographical criticism (ontological preoccupations), substitutional analysis (temporal subjectivity), linguistic interpretation (theory of metaphor), literary criticism (readerly reception), structuralism (readerly incorporation), and deconstruction (rhetoric of suppression). The dissertation pragmatically investigates, and contests, Borges’ assimilative poetics of textual presence...|$|R

Nazlı Eray (b. 1945) is {{the author}} of more than twenty works, including short stories, novels, and memoirs. Although Eray has been {{known as one of the}} pioneers of fantasy fiction in Turkish literature, autobiographical elements constitute an important part of her works. In this thesis entitled “Aspects of (Auto) biography in Nazlı Eray’s Works” the author’s twenty three works are analyzed in order to determine the role of biographical and autobiographical elements in the formation of her original literary style. The first chapter of the thesis entitled “Autobiographical Themes in Nazlı Eray’s Works” is based mainly upon the novels Aşkı Giyinen Adam (A Man Wearing Love) and Deniz Kenarında Pazarfes/(Monday on the Seashore), which are used as sources of autobiographical information concerning the writer’s years of childhood and adolescence in Istanbul. In this respect, the other books are used as supplementary texts. As far as the writer’s years in Ankara are concerned, the autobiographical elements in her works are gathered by focusing on the recurring themes in the books. In this chapter, in addition to the writer’s works, her interviews are also used. The second chapter of the thesis entitled “Biographical Themes in Nazlı Eray’s Works” focuses on <b>biographical</b> <b>influences</b> in Eray’s works, especially her relationships with her relatives and certain celebrities. In the chapter entitled “Autofiction in Nazlı Eray’s Works” the author’s works are analyzed in terms of “autofiction”, a literary style that consists of blending fiction and autobiography. Nazlı Eray, who combines several aspects of her real life experiences with elements of fantasy in her works, has been writing “autofiction” from the very beginning. The writer, who has been pushing the limits of biography and autobiography as literary genres, has developed her distinct literary style, thus gaining a wide audience. Çetaku, DritaM. S...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{experience}} of mature students in a Further Education college in Ireland. It looks at {{the development of the}} further education sector and its current role in Irish education. Further education is a major provider of education for adults as more than half the students in further education are now mature students. The system grew largely within the Vocational Education system and, it is suggested, has adopted many of the neo-liberal ideas and practices prevalent in society more generally. The first research element was a survey and focus group, followed by nine qualitative interviews which explored with the students their reasons for returning to education, their experience while in further education and what they consider to be the benefits of participation. Using a constructivist grounded theory approach the data were generated and analysed through a systematic process of coding, categorisation and the development of core concepts grounded in the students’ lived experience. Three significant concepts emerged from the analysis. The first concept of ‘The latent self’ describes the range of social, personal, structural and <b>biographical</b> <b>influences</b> and discusses how they interact and impact on the decision to return to education. The second concept, ‘The Emerging Self’ describes the negotiation of challenges faced by the students in the process of change. The third concept, ‘The Revised Self’, describes the changed self emphatically described by the students as resulting from their participation and characterised by greatly enhanced confidence and agency. The conceptual label ‘Finding a voice’ was used to describe this ‘Revised Self’ as many of the participants spoke in terms of feeling able to speak and having things to say. It encompasses willingness and a sense of entitlement to participate and engage with others and a sense of having something to contribute. The findings demonstrate that further education is a site of significant learning for adults. Although the purpose of the further education sector is to provide students with the skills needed in the workplace and many students came for vocational reasons, the actual learning went beyond the instrumental and resulted in many surprising benefits to the students and to society more generally...|$|R

40|$|Orientation: The {{attitude}} of students toward statistics may influence their enrolment, achievement and motivation {{in the subject}} of research and Industrial Psychology. Research purpose: The aims {{of this study were}} to determine {{the reliability and validity of}} the survey of attitudes toward statistics (SATS- 36) for a South African sample and to determine whether <b>biographical</b> variables <b>influence</b> students' attitudes. Motivation for study: Students could be better prepared for, and guided through, a course in statistics if more is known about their attitudes towards statistics. Research design, approach and method: A cross-sectional survey design was used and the SATS- 36 was administered to a sample of convenience consisting of 235 students enrolled in Industrial and Organisational Psychology at a large tertiary institution in South Africa. Main findings: Results revealed that even though students perceive statistics to be technical, complicated and difficult to master, they are interested in the subject and believe statistics to be of value. The degree to which students perceived themselves to be competent in mathematics was related to the degree to which they felt confident in their own ability to master statistics. Males displayed slightly more positive feelings toward statistics than females. Older students perceived statistics to be less difficult than younger students and also displayed slightly more positive feelings concerning statistics. Practical implications: It seems that in preparing students for statistics, their perception regarding their mathematical competence could be managed as well.

It is essential to interpret Descartes' writings against the background of the development of his ideas. To understand his Discours de la methode, for instance, one has to fall back on the unfinished texts of the Regulae and Le Monde. This article analyses the relevance that the text of the Regulae has for the interpretation of the Discours. It is argued that we cannot even begin to interpret Descartes' 'four rules' or his emphasis on 'mathematics' if we fail to supply the text with its proper context. Yet getting these pieces together is not enough. One has to take biographical details into account as well, {{in order to be able}} to determine dates and sources - and <b>biographical</b> knowledge <b>influences</b> interpretation. Step by step, a more comprehensive view may be developed of what aspects of Descartes' life are crucial for reading his works. This can be done only if one is willing to put oneself in his mental position. An attempt to uncover the questions the author has put to himself is more important than stating and restating his answers. The question of the void is presented in order to illustrate that this is not merely the case in philosophy or belles-lettres, but even within the history of science. In writing history, it is necessary to supply one's principle of charity with what might be called a 'principle of humanity': the recognition that, instead of truths and falsities, historical texts contain the thoughts of individuals. To interpret these, one will have to consider the author's curiosities, concerns and motives. Thus, even the fanciful account of his famous dreams, whether these were fictitious or not, help us read Descartes' more prosaic lines of thought...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} underlying formal principles in four works by the American composer, Leon Kirchner. These compositions, Toccata for Strings, Solo Winds, and Percussion, String Quartet No. 2, Concerto for Violin, Cello, Ten Winds, and Percussion, and Music for Orchestra, were felt to be important works in the composer's output and represented a variety of genres. The first chapter contains a brief summary of Kirchner's compositional style and aesthetic, and a brief <b>biographical</b> sketch. <b>Influenced</b> {{by the work of}} Schoenberg, Berg, Bartok, and Stravinsky, his approach to musical composition is highly individual and he consciously avoids being enslaved by the rigors of writing according to some system. Chapters 2 through 5 present the results of extensive aural and visual analysis of the four works. Each composition is microscopically examined for its basic melodic motives, rhythmic motives, and harmonic materials. Those parameters are then discussed that contribute most significantly to the delineation of form and also those that provide inter- and intra-sectional cohesion and continuity. Durational factors, specifically tempo, meter, and rhythm contributed the most significantly to formal delineation in all four works. By contrast, pitch materials provided the most significant degree of inter- and intra-sectional unity in each work. The results of the findings lead to several conclusions regarding the formal procedures employed in the four selected works of Leon Kirchner. First, although these compositions employ contrasting shapes, they are all unified in their utilization of related basic pitch and durational materials. Second, durational elements are the most useful in formal delineation at all structural levels. Third, although these works do not rely on traditional means to achieve structural unity, other means, such as return of tempos, rhythmic motives, melodic motives, sonorities, and textures, serve the same function as effectively...|$|R
