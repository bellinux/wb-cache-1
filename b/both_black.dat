5|$|According to {{historian}} George H. Haynes, {{during his}} nearly {{thirty years of}} public service Wilson practiced principled politics by championing unpopular causes, sometimes {{at the expense of}} his personal ambition. The causes Wilson supported included abolition of slavery, and the rights of workers, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in <b>both</b> <b>black</b> {{and white}} {{as well as}} Gevacolor, Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958 and garnered positive critical reception. It was a commercial success, grossing 11million in its lifetime, thereby becoming only the second Tamil film to earn 10million after another Ramachandran starrer Madurai Veeran (1956); it became a silver jubilee film. Nadodi Mannan acquired cult status in Tamil cinema. It was dubbed into Telugu as Anaganaga Oka Raju and in Hindi as Hamen Bhi Jeene Do.|$|E
5|$|He {{established}} his practice in Lower Manhattan in general surgery and medicine, treating <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white patients. He started {{a school in}} the evenings, teaching children. He established {{what has been called}} the first black-owned and operated pharmacy in the United States, located at 93 West Broadway (near present-day Foley Square). His friends and activists gathered in the back room of the pharmacy to discuss issues related to their work in abolitionism.|$|E

50|$|Chaos continued; {{the police}} were overworked and tired. Detroit Police {{were found to have}} {{committed}} many acts of abuse against <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites who were in their custody.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 Detroit Riot was {{different}} in that <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites participated in destruction in the city. Violence {{was directed at}} attacking police and the National Guard, and destroying property.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white, from the rural and small town South. These developments dramatically altered {{the demographics of the}} state. Indiana industrial cities were among the destinations of the Great Migration. After World War II, industrial restructuring and the shifts in heavy industry resulted in Indiana's becoming part of the Rust Belt.|$|E
5|$|The text of a Book of the Dead {{was written}} in <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and red ink, {{regardless}} of whether it was in hieroglyphic or hieratic script. Most of the text was in black, with red ink used for the titles of spells, opening and closing sections of spells, the instructions to perform spells correctly in rituals, and also for the names of dangerous creatures such as the demon Apep. The black ink used was based on carbon, and the red ink on ochre, in both cases mixed with water.|$|E

5|$|While in Scotland, Smith {{joined the}} Glasgow Emancipation Society and met {{people in the}} Scottish and English {{abolitionist}} movement. In 1833, Great Britain abolished slavery. When Smith returned to New York, he quickly joined the American Anti-Slavery Society and worked for the cause in the United States. He worked effectively with <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white abolitionists, for instance maintaining a friendship and correspondence with Gerrit Smith that spanned the years from 1846-65.|$|E
5|$|With the {{popularity}} of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises, many wondered if Br√ºtal Legend would take advantage of these games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it. Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by <b>both</b> <b>Black</b> and Kyle Gass.|$|E
5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see <b>both</b> <b>Black</b> Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
40|$|Everyone {{would agree}} that the American flag is red, white and blue. Everyone should also agree that it looks red, white and blue to people with normal color vision in {{appropriate}} circumstances. If a philosophical theory led {{to the conclusion that}} the red stripes cannot look red to both men and women, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites, <b>both</b> young and old, we would be reluctant (to say the least) to accept that philosophical theory. But there is a widespread philosophical view about the nature of conscious experience that, together with some empirical facts, suggests that color experience cannot be veridical for both men and women, <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites, <b>both</b> young and ol...|$|R

In many areas <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and poor whites still faced subjectively applied barriers to voter registration {{that did not}} end until after passage of national civil rights legislation, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|R
5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped crinoline {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E
5|$|The French {{settlers}} brought <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and Indian {{slaves to}} St. Louis; {{although the majority}} were used as domestic servants, others worked as agricultural laborers. In 1769, the Spanish prohibited Indian slavery in Louisiana, but the practice was entrenched among the French Creoles in St. Louis. As a compromise, Spanish governors ended the Indian slave trade but allowed the retention of current slaves and any children born to them. In 1772, a census determined {{the population of the}} village to be 637, including 444 whites (285 males and 159 females) and 193 African slaves, with no Indian slaves reported due to their technical illegality. During the 1770s and 1780s, St. Louis grew slowly and the Spanish commanders were replaced often.|$|E
5|$|ZIPRA leader Joshua Nkomo {{publicly}} {{claimed responsibility}} for shooting down the Hunyani {{in an interview with}} the BBC's Today programme the next day, saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes, but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground. The majority of Rhodesians, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white, saw the attack as an act of terrorism. A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies, with many whites becoming violently resentful and suspicious of blacks in general, even though few black Rhodesians supported attacks of this kind. Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine, but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments, much to the Rhodesian government's indignation.|$|E
50|$|Through the 1880s, the {{community}} at Rehoboth were joined by other Baster families from Grootfontein (South) (whom missionary Heidmann had earlier tried to recruit), Okahandja, and Otjimbingwe. While based on descent within the families, they also accepted <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites who applied to join {{the community}}.|$|R
50|$|<b>Both</b> White and <b>Black's</b> pawn can {{advance and}} promote, and Black captures the bishop first. White recaptures the tokin with a silver. Since White's silver at 2b is defended by their rook and Black {{has no more}} pawns to drop, Black's best move is to defend against White's attack by {{retreating}} to the h rank. Otherwise, White will capture <b>both</b> <b>Black's</b> bishop as well as Black's silver and promote their rook at the same time.|$|R
25|$|Sharecroppers formed {{unions in}} the 1930s, {{beginning}} in Tallapoosa County, Alabama in 1931, and Arkansas in 1934. Membership in the Southern Tenant Farmers Union included <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and poor whites. As leadership strengthened, meetings became more successful, and protest became more vigorous, landlords {{responded with a}} wave of terror.|$|R
5|$|Bears, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and brown, {{are seen}} in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen ‚Äúscraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.‚Äù Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black bears are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown bears are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black bears are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black bears with black dots and brown bears with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting bears in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black bears, while brown bears are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{arrangement}} protected sharecroppers from {{the negative effects}} of a bad crop, many sharecroppers (<b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white) remained quite poor. Arrangements typically left a third of the crop to the sharecropper.|$|E
25|$|Some {{equipment}} only {{fits the}} needs for one particular mission over another. There is however some equipment {{that is used}} for <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and green operations, and these pieces of gear are usually combat vests, flak and armor jackets (or systems), and harnesses for use in hasty extraction measures.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} careful to remain {{away from the}} places most frequented by Skip Jellison, but was forced to change his {{business}} location several times, owing to the trouble which he had with boys who, as Carrots had predicted, were jealous because he <b>both</b> <b>blacked</b> boots and sold newspapers.|$|R
30|$|Now {{suppose that}} <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites, through some {{effective}} social policy, experienced an additive shift such that those now at x= 50, or half {{the poverty line}} income, were now at x= 100, which {{can be viewed as}} effectively rescaling the x variable. While the overall proportions of <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites below the poverty line would both be substantially smaller, the corresponding FR would be much higher, going from 2.29 prior to the additive shift to. 118 /. 044 = 2.68 afterwards. Hence, as Scanlan says ‚Äú‚Ä¶the rarer the outcome, the greater the disparity in experiencing the outcome.‚Äù Similarly, for the other ratio, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the smaller the disparity in avoiding the outcome‚Äù namely the SR ratio associated with those avoiding poverty. The SR disparity is reduced from. 84 to. 92.|$|R
25|$|Immediately upon Inauguration in 1869, Grant bolstered Reconstruction by prodding Congress to readmit Virginia, Mississippi, and Texas {{into the}} Union, while {{ensuring}} their constitutions protected every citizen's voting rights. Grant met with prominent black leaders for consultation, {{and signed a}} bill into law that guaranteed equal rights to <b>both</b> <b>blacks</b> and whites in Washington D.C.|$|R
25|$|Perlinos are bay horses who are {{homozygous}} for {{the dominant}} creme (CCr) allele. <b>Both</b> <b>black</b> and red pigment are diluted to some shade of creme, though the formerly black points {{often have a}} stronger reddish cast.

25|$|In 1888, Langston was {{urged to}} run for {{a seat in the}} U.S. House of Representatives by fellow Republicans, <b>both</b> <b>black</b> and white. Leaders of the biracial Readjuster Party, which had held {{political}} power in Virginia from 1879 to 1883, did not support his candidacy. Langston ran as a Republican and lost to his Democratic opponent. He contested the results of the election because of voter intimidation and fraud.|$|E
