40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> {{relationship between}} <b>age</b> structure and income inequality. As a cohort ages, incomes become more unequally distributed within it. Consequently, as <b>the</b> <b>age</b> structure <b>of</b> a population evolves, {{it may have}} real effects on the aggregate distribution of incomes in that population. Using March CPS data from 1976 to 2007, I decompose inequality change by age and education. Changes in <b>the</b> <b>age</b> structure have had a net negative impact on inequality since 1976. <b>The</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large baby boom cohort has been offset <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relatively small birth dearth cohort and by trends in mean income by age.

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> {{predicted}} <b>ageing</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian {{population is}} one of the highest worldwide and this condition is expected to produce a growing increase in pharmaceutical expenditure. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess whether or not off-patent drugs could counterbalance the economic effects generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian population in the next ten years. Methods: On the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predicted <b>ageing</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Italian population for the period 2008 - 2018, the average annual cumulative increase of pharmaceutical expenditure and potential savings generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> future loss of patent coverage have been considered in order to identify the year of the Breakeven Point. Results: The economic effect induced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> progressive <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> population produces an average of 0. 94 % cumulative increase in local pharmaceutical expenditure per year, corresponding to an incremental pharmaceutical expenditure of about € 116 millions per year. A number of 509 brands (103 active substances) will lose their patent coverage in the next 10 years. Considering both the present legislation and a level of price reduction, after patent expiration, corresponding to 40 %, it is predicted that the Breakeven Point will be achieved at the end of 2011. Conclusions: In this study, a long term balance between the predictable increase of pharmaceutical expenditure induced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>ageing</b> <b>of</b> Italian population and savings produced by future off-patent drugs was not established. In order to assure the future sustainability of pharmaceutical expenditure, this study supports the need for the development of new health policy strategies...|$|R
