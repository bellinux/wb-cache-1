No information is available about the range or the range-rate of the target. It is shown that five observations of either the elevation or the azimuth, and the time of either set of observations, determine the complete set of orbital elements of the target.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to provide a detailed post flight evaluation of <b>ballistic</b> <b>vehicle</b> flight test boundary layer transition data. A total of fifty-five vehicles were selected for analysis. These vehicles were chosen from a data sampling of roughly two hundred flights and the criteria for vehicle selection is delineated herein. The results of the analysis indicate that frustum transition of re-entry vehicles appears to be nose tip dominated. Frustum related parameters and materials apparently have a second order effect on transition. This implies that local viscous parameters on the frustum should not correlate flight test transition data, and in fact they do not. Specific parameters relative to the nose tip have been identified as the apparent dominant factors that characterize the transition phenomena and a correlation of flight test data is presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} of the motion and heating during atmospheric reentry of manned space vehicles has shown the following: 1. Flight-corridor depths which allow reentry in a single pass decrease rapidly as the reentry speed increases if the maximum deceleration is limited to 10 g. 2. Use of aerodynamic lift can result in a three-to five fold increase in corridor depth over that available to a <b>ballistic</b> <b>vehicle</b> for the same deceleration limits. 3. Use of aerodynamic lift to widen these reentry corridors causes a heating penalty which becomes severe for values of the lift-drag ratio greater than unity for constant lift-drag entry. 4. In the region of most intense convective heating the inviscid flow is generally in chemical equilibrium but the boundary-layer flows are out of equilibrium. Heating rates for the nonequilibrium boundary layer are generally lower than for the corresponding equilibrium case. 5. Radiative heating from the hot gas trapped between the shock wave and the body stagnation region may be as severe as the convective heating and unfortunately occurs at approximately the same time in the flight...|$|E

The imprecision or inaccuracy of attempted models and sensors often lead to errors when seemingly simple tasks are left to a machine; a seasoned expert may know from experience how to react under certain conditions for which a robot may not have been trained or may not have sensors to a high enough precision. Fuzzy Logic and Artificial Neural Networks are an attempt to remedy that. If machine algorithms are able to infer solutions from previous knowledge, then new potential can be unlocked in computational applications.

Long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in unpowered flight.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{reports on}} a design study of a novel space transportation concept known as a 'NIMF' (Nuclear rocket using Indigenous Martian Fuel). The NIMF is a <b>ballistic</b> <b>vehicle</b> which obtains its propellant out of the Martian air by compression and liquefaction of atmospheric CO 2. This propellant is subsequently used to generate rocket thrust at a specific impulse of 264 s by being heated to high temperature (2800 K) gas in the NIMFs' nuclear thermal rocket engines. The vehicle {{is designed to provide}} surface to orbit and surface to surface transportation, as well as housing, for a crew of three astronauts. It is capable of refueling itself for a flight to its maximum orbit in less than 50 days. The ballistic NIMF has a mass of 44. 7 tonnes and, with the assumed 2800 K propellant temperature, is capable of attaining highly energetic (250 km by 34, 000 km elliptical) orbits. This allows it to rendezvous with interplanetary transfer vehicles which are only very loosely bound into orbit around Mars. If a propellant temperature of 2000 K is assumed, then low Mars orbit can be attained; while if 3100 K is assumed, then the ballistic NIMF is capable of injecting itself onto a minimum energy transfer orbit to Earth in a direct ascent from the Martian surface...|$|E

VentureStar is a Lifting Body (LB) flight vehicle which will carry our future payloads into orbit, and will do so at a much reduced cost. There were three design contenders for the new Reusable Launch Vehicle: a Winged Vehicle, a Vertical Lander, and the Lifting Body(LB). The LB design won the competition. A LB vehicle has no wings and derives its lift solely from the shape of its body, and has the unique advantages of superior volumetric efficiency, better aerodynamic efficiency at high angles-of-attack and hypersonic speeds, and reduced thermal protection system weight. Classically, in a <b>ballistic</b> <b>vehicle,</b> drag has been employed to control the level of deceleration in reentry. In the LB, lift enables the vehicle to decelerate at higher altitudes for the same velocity and defines the reentry corridor which includes a greater cross range. This paper outlines our LB heritage which was utilized {{in the design of}} the new Reusable Launch Vehicle, VentureStar. NASA and the U. S.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 02 - 04, 1967 / Marriott Motor Hotel, Washington, D. C. Present {{information}} on missile range planning indicates that serious UHF telemetry coverage problems {{are likely to}} occur during reentry of <b>ballistic</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Flight test experience at VHF has demonstrated that receiving stations experience difficulty in tracking re-entry vehicles under conditions of rapid changes of signal strength caused by combinations of vehicle motion, vehicle antenna pattern, and plasma attenuation. Similar but greater variations at UHF coupled with narrow beamwidths and reduced sensitivity of re-entry stations portend greater problems at UHF. Conical scan systems may prove inadequate. Comparisons of similar telemetry systems at VHF and S-band are presented, demonstrating that received signal to noise ratios at re-entry stations will be 3 to 9 db below levels Presently obtained at VHF for reentry stations. The narrow antenna beamwidths (1 ° to 3. 5 °) will also cause problems in acquisition so {{that some form of}} acquisition aid will be required at each station. Omnidirectional antennas currently used in aircraft at VHF will be useless at UHF. Ships and aircraft will require stabilized or compensated antennas.

40|$|Signals {{transmitted}} by global navigation satellite system (GNSS) satellites are {{not confined to}} the surface of the Earth but can likewise be used for navigation in space. Satellites in low Earth orbits, in particular, benefit from a similar signal strength and experience a full-sky visibility. On the other hand, the harsh space environment, long-term reliability requirements and the high dynamics of the host platform pose specific challenges to the design and operation of space-borne GNSS receivers. Despite these constraints, satellite manufacturers and scientists have early on started to exploit the benefits of GNSS technology. From the first flight of a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver on Landsat- 4, GNSS receivers have evolved into indispensable and ubiquitous tools for navigation and control of space vehicles. Following a general introduction, the chapter first describes the specific aspects of GNSS signal tracking in space and highlights the technological challenges of space-borne receiver design. Subsequently, the use of GNSS for spacecraft navigation is discussed taking into account both real-time navigation and precise orbit determination. Relevant algorithms and software tools are discussed and the currently achieved performance is presented based on actual missions and flight results. A dedicated section is devoted to the use of spaceborne GNSS for relative navigation of formation flying satellites.
