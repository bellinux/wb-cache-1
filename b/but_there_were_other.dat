25|$|Hence Halbertsma {{expected}} to be appointed professor of Dutch language and literature, and several times such an appointment seemed almost within his grasp, but each time it slipped away. His sharp pen probably {{played a role in}} this, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> reasons, too. In 1830, he lost out from the surplus of applicants washing over the Netherlands from the universities of Belgium, which at that time had just seceded from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, and after 1840 a different type of scientist was called for, with a more specialised knowledge than Halbertsma commanded. That in 1837 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by the University of Leiden, was scant consolation to him. In part because of these disappointments, Halbertsma balanced {{on the edge of a}} burn-out for a long time, and especially in 1839, when he was passed over yet again, he went through a deep crisis. It was only in the 1860s, when he was in his seventies, that he seems to have achieved a state of mental composure.|$|E

500|$|Within {{the genus}} Inocybe, I.godeyi has been {{classified}} {{in a number}} of ways. In 1986, mycologist Thom Kuyper placed the species in the supersection Marginatae (subgenus Inocybe), along with species including I.abietis, I.calospora and I.praetervisa. Rolf Singer considers Marginatae a section in subgenus Inocybe, but he placed I.godeyi in the section Geophyllinae (in the subgenus Inocibium) along with species including I.agglutinata and I.pudica. A 2002 phylogenetic study found that Singer's Geophyllinae is probably monophyletic (that is, the taxa all come from a common, recent ancestor) and suggested that I.godeyi forms a clade with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica. All species in the clade were [...] "smooth-spored Inocybes with [...] hymenial cystidia", <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> species that fit that description, such as I.lacera, that were shown not {{to be a part of}} the clade.|$|E

Cosa Nostra was behind the murder of De Mauro, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> backgrounds and individuals, allied with the Mafia, such as deviated freemasons and corrupt public officials. [...] "De Mauro was not killed out of revenge, but to prevent harm to the Mafia. The Mafia did not just execute instructions of others, but also because his investigations affected Cosa Nostra itself and other powers associated with it," [...] according to Ingroia. He said the investigations for the trial had unearthed an [...] "institutional cover-up" [...] in the initial probe into De Mauro's disappearance.|$|E
500|$|This was a {{major factor}} in al-Mu'tasim's {{decision}} in 836 to found a new capital at Samarra, some [...] north of Baghdad, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> considerations at play as well. Founding a new capital was a public statement of the establishment of a new regime, and according to Tayeb El-Hibri allowed the court to exist [...] "at a distance from the populace of Baghdad and protected by a new guard of foreign troops, and amid a new royal culture revolving around sprawling palatial grounds, public spectacle and a seemingly ceaseless quest for leisurely indulgence", an arrangement compared by Oleg Grabar to the relationship between Paris and Versailles after Louis XIV. In addition, by creating a new city in a previously uninhabited area, al-Mu'tasim could reward his followers with land and commercial opportunities without cost to himself and free from any constraints, unlike Baghdad with its established interest groups and high property prices. In fact, the sale of land seems to have produced considerable profit for the treasury—in the words of Kennedy, [...] "a sort of gigantic property speculation in which both government and its followers could expect to benefit".|$|E

Since the referendum proposal was for an indirectly elected president, many radicals opposed it.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{references}} {{cited by}} Watson and Crick when they published their model of DNA was to a published article that included Sven Furberg's DNA model that had the bases on the inside. Thus, the Watson and Crick model {{was not the first}} [...] "bases in" [...] model to be proposed. Furberg's results had also provided the correct orientation of the DNA sugars with respect to the bases. During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an antiparallel orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the base pairs in the centre of a double helix. Crick's access to Franklin's progress report of late 1952 is what made Crick confident that DNA was a double helix with antiparallel chains, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> chains of reasoning and sources of information that also led to these conclusions.|$|E

[...] Plutarch records how Theseus and Romulus were both {{born out of}} wedlock and of uncertain parentage {{and at the same time}} had the reputation of being sprung from the gods. [...] He said that Theseus' grandfather Pittheus invented the story that Theseus was the child of Neptune to conceal Theseus' lineage as the son of Pittheus' daughter Aethra and Aegeus ("Lives", Vol. 1, p.2; pp.3 ff.). [...] <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> stories about the birth of Romulus and his brother Remus.

2500|$|Bismarck was {{the most}} memorable figure in Germany down to the 1930s. [...] The {{dominant}} memory was the great hero of the 1860s, who defeated all enemies, especially France, and unified Germany {{to become the most}} powerful military and diplomatic force in the world. [...] Of course, there were no monuments celebrating Bismarck's [...] devotion to the cause of European peace after 1871. [...] <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> German memories. [...] His fellow Junkers were disappointed, as Prussia after 1871 became swallowed up and dominated by the German Empire. [...] Liberal intellectuals, few in number but dominant in the universities and business houses, celebrated his achievement of the national state, a constitutional monarchy, and the rule of law, and forestalling revolution and marginalizing radicalism. [...] Social Democrats and labor leaders had always been his target, and he remained their bête noire. Catholics could not forget the Kulturkampf and remained distrustful. Especially negative were the Poles who hated his Germanization programs.|$|E

[...] After the case was over, some thought that the reason that the provincial government of Zhejiang did not publicize case facts was not to jeopardise the investigation. <b>But,</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> opinions that thought it was essentially censorship.

2500|$|An {{energetic}} and charismatic visionary, Gabriel {{had his own}} ideas of how things should be done, and had little patience {{with the leaders of}} the Chaldean Church. [...] If the new seminary was to succeed it needed its own income, and Gabriel insisted, probably correctly, that {{a large proportion of the}} property then in the hands of the patriarchal family was originally owned by the monastery of Rabban Hormizd and should rightly revert to it. [...] Yohannan Hormizd, understandably, did not agree. [...] This single issue would have been sufficient to poison relations between the two men, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>other</b> causes of friction as well. [...] The new seminary had attracted men who disliked Yohannan Hormizd and wanted more vigorous leadership. [...] The monks rallied around their superior and made no secret of their distaste for the patriarchal administrator. [...] They were joined by the Catholic missionaries, who shared their admiration for Gabriel, and by a number of influential priests, notably Yohannan of Tel Isqof and Yohannan of Alqosh. [...] In 1809 the Vatican seriously considered the possibility of suspending Yohannan Hormizd, and rumours that he had indeed been suspended were circulated by his opponents, eliciting a spirited letter of protest to the Vatican by his supporters on 15 October 1811.|$|E
2500|$|One {{accomplishment}} Gromyko took particular {{pride in}} was {{the signing of}} the Partial Test Ban Treaty on 5 August 1963.

Other achievements he considered his greatest were {{the signing of the}} Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 1 July 1968, the ABM Treaty and SALT I, followed by the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1973. In retrospect Gromyko said, [...] "If we collect the deliberative nature of the documents, including hundreds of Coded Telegrams, information from the embassies, the analysis of the situation around these problems, there are perhaps as high as the mountain of Mont Blanc. Those papers show the difficulties in overcoming congestions to the path to an agreement, requires the present art of diplomacy." [...] Gromyko always believed in the superpower status of the Soviet Union and always promoted an idea that no important international agreement could be reached without its involvement. In 1972 he said [...] "no international problem of significance anywhere can be resolved without Soviet participation".|$|E
