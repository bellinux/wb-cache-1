5|$|Ultimately the Gallipoli {{campaign}} was a disastrous failure. It did not achieve {{any of the}} objectives that had been given as a justification for it, and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops, not only from {{as a result of}} combat, but also due to widespread disease that resulted from poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> casualty clearance and resupply and logistics systems. It has been estimated that {{over the course of the}} campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed. Other Allied casualties—killed and wounded—included: 7,571 New Zealanders, 120,000 British and 27,000 French.|$|E

5|$|Faye and Joseph separate, {{and she and}} Linden begin a relationship.

Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their engagement. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is {{hit in the head}} with a glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{also began}} to merge with a {{low-level}} frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita. The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant. In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further. While continuing to move at a quick pace, the storm began to turn towards the southeast along a baroclinic zone. Early on January26, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone as it lost most of its tropical characteristics. Arthur re-intensified shortly after and the JTWC reissued advisories on the storm around 2100UTC. The brief re-strengthening {{was the result of}} a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> baroclinic zone which allowed convection to redevelop around the center. Around the same time, Arthur left RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility (AoR) and entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Wellington's AoR. The storm completed its extratropical transition around 1200UTC on January27, leading to the final advisory being issued on the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units had been {{identified}} in AO Surfers, including the regular North Vietnamese 7th Division—consisting of the North Vietnamese 141st and 165th Regiments {{under the command of}} Nguyen the Bon, the Vietcong 5th Division—consisting of Viet Cong 274th and 275th Regiments, and the Dong Nai Regiment. These divisions were believed to have participated in the assault on Saigon and allied intelligence considered it likely they would attempt to withdraw through the Australian area of operations in order to regroup. Other forces included North Vietnamese 85th Regiment as well as the 165th, 233rd, 269th, 275th, D280 and 745th Viet Cong Infiltration Groups and various units used for reconnaissance, guiding, logistics, liaison and other tasks. In total, an estimated strength of 3,000 to 4,000 men. Regardless, despite earlier warnings that they may concentrate up to regimental-strength, a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> passage of intelligence led the Australians to believe that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong would remain dispersed in small groups in an attempt to avoid detection. As such the Australians assumed that the communist forces would pose little threat and envisioned patrolling from company harbours to find and ambush them as they withdrew. Meanwhile, due to the risk of heavy ground fire, only a very limited aerial reconnaissance of the new area of operations was undertaken and this later had significant implications.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Collaborative {{information}} seeking {{is integral to}} many professional activities. <b>In</b> hospital work, <b>the</b> medication process encompasses continual seeking for information and collaborative grounding of information. This study investigates <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> collaborative {{information seeking}} through analyses {{of the use of}} the electronic medication record adopted in a Danish healthcare region and of the reports of five years of medication incidents at Danish hospitals. The results show that <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> collaborative information seeking is a major source of medication incidents, that most of these <b>breakdowns</b> are <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> collaborative grounding rather than information seeking, that the medication incidents mainly concern <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of records as opposed to oral communication, that the breakdowns span multiple degrees of separation between clinicians, and that the electronic medication record has introduced risks of new kinds of <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> collaborative information seeking. In working to prevent and recover from <b>breakdowns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seeking and sharing of information a focus on collaborative information seeking will point toward collaborative, organizational, and systemic reasons for breakdown and areas for improvement, rather than toward individual error...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{subsequent}} setbacks {{in their}} relationship, such as Jac briefly deceiving Joseph {{into believing that}} she is pregnant with his child, Faye and Joseph marry. On {{the day of the}} ceremony, Linden confesses to Faye that he is in love with her, and they kiss. She instantly regrets it, however, and tells him that she loves Joseph. When Archie's nurse Lauren later accidentally administers him the wrong drug, he dies. Faye and Joseph grow apart in the aftermath and she develops romantic feelings for Linden. She and Joseph separate, but after she begins a relationship with Linden, she discovers that she is pregnant with Joseph's baby. Increasingly concerned that Faye may be a pathological liar, Linden terminates their relationship. Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is hit {{in the head with a}} glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a <b>breakdown</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> aftermath, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased brother. Despite Joseph's opposition, she insists on returning to the psychiatric unit. Jac's support during this time results in a renewal of their relationship, and when Faye secretly makes plans to leave the country with Harry, Jac helps convince her to leave the baby with Joseph. Joseph struggles as a working father, and accepts a job as a GP in Penrith. Jac declines his offer to accompany him, so he departs with Harry, leaving her in tears.|$|E
