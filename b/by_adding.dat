40|$|The present work {{is part of}} a model study {{aimed at}} {{upgrading}} the technique of creating porosity within a ceramic body via the incorporation of organic particles, used in traditional ceramics, exploring {{at the same time the}} colloidal processing from coagulated slurries. The method described by Lange et al., based on the manipulation of short-range repulsive (lubricating) hydration force and long-range attractive van der Waals force, was used to pack to a high density a bimodal mixture of submicron ceramic particles (matrix) and larger organic particles (inclusions) during consolidation by pressure filtration of dispersed suspensions coagulated <b>by</b> <b>added</b> electrolyte. The results reported show how the rheological behaviour of dispersed ceramic slurries changes through coagulation <b>by</b> <b>added</b> electrolyte, the role played <b>by</b> <b>added</b> organic particles and how they affect the coagulation state, bearing on the conceptual relation between interparticle potential and the observed rheological behaviour.
