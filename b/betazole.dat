50|$|<b>Betazole</b> (also {{known as}} ametazole) is a {{histamine}} H2 receptor agonist. <b>Betazole</b> hydrochloride {{is known as}} gastramine and histalog.|$|E
50|$|H2 : <b>Betazole</b> and Impromidine are {{examples}} of agonists used in diagnostics to increase histamine.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} used as a gastric {{stimulant}} to test for maximal production of gastric secretion activity. The test can be used in diagnosis of diseases such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome where there is excess acid production, in this case driven by over production of gastrin. The volume of acid secretion is measured following administration of <b>betazole,</b> diagnosis being secretion greater than 60% of the maximal acid secretion following <b>betazole</b> stimulation. This procedure can lead to complications and should be avoided in subjects with coronary artery disease. It is also used in diagnosis of gastritis in association with a test for secretin activity.|$|E
50|$|H2 receptors are {{positively}} coupled to adenylate cyclase via Gs. It {{is a potent}} stimulant of cAMP production, which leads to activation of protein kinase A. PKA functions to phosphorylate certain proteins, affecting their activity. The drug <b>betazole</b> {{is an example of}} a histamine H2 receptor agonist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Betazole</b> {{is used as}} a {{stimulant}} in {{preference to}} histamine because of its specificity for the H2 receptor and its advantage of not generating the undesirable side effects that histamine would induce. It therefore does not require concomitant use of antihistaminic compounds to block the actions of histamine at other histamine receptor types.|$|E
40|$|Gastric acid production, unstimulated and {{following}} stimulation with <b>betazole</b> hydrochloride, {{was measured in}} Indian men with cholera or acute vibrio-negative diarrhoea-Measurements were made during acute illness and after different periods of convalescence. Men from the same socioeconomic group and from a higher one served as controls. Stimulated acid production was severely reduced during diarrhoea caused by V. cholerae and related vibrios but not during acute vibrio-negative diarrhoea. Acid production returned to stable convalescent values 1 - 3 days after cessation of diarrhoea. Stimulated acid production was significantly lower in controls from the lower socioeconomic group than in those from the higher socioeconomic group. Achlorhydria that {{did not respond to}} <b>betazole</b> administration occurred in 32 % of the convalescent cholera patients but in none of the controls or convalescent vibrio-negative diarrhoea patients. It is concluded from these results that diarrhoea produced by V. cholerae and related vibrios is accompanied by transient inhibition of gastric acid secretion, that cholera occurs largely in a population with impaired acid secretion, and that preexisting achlorhydria may predispose to infection with V. cholerae...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Basal, {{as well as}} betazole-stimulated {{gastric acid}} {{secretion}} in man is reduced after the intravenous administration of bromazepam. In subjects staying awake, this reduction {{is limited to the}} first two 15 -minute periods. The reduction is highly significant in subjects who fall asleep after receiving the drug. Natural sleep causes the same depression. The low level of acid secretion is maintained until the subjects are awakened when there is a sharp and highly significant rise. Acid secretion in subjects who fall asleep after the simultaneous administration of <b>betazole</b> and brom-azepam is significantly higher than after the administration of bromazepam alone. Sleep causes a much greater depression of basal and betazole-stimulated acid secretion than does the benzodiaze-pine itself. Acid secretion was measured by continuous intragastric titration and a pH-sensitive endoradio-sonde. 'Maximal ' acid output in response to an augmented histamine test, <b>betazole,</b> or pentagastrin is known to be affected by certain drugs and by vagotomy. Very {{little is known about the}} influence of the level of central and autonomic activity. Sleep was reported to cause no significant change from the waking level on unstimulated gastric secretion (Sandweiss...|$|E

40|$|Pyrazole and its {{derivatives}} {{are considered}} a pharmacologically important active scaffold that possesses almost all types of pharmacological activities. The presence of this nucleus in pharmacological agents of diverse therapeutic categories such as celecoxib, a potent anti-inflammatory, the antipsychotic CDPPB, the anti-obesity drug rimonabant, difenamizole, an analgesic, <b>betazole,</b> a H 2 -receptor agonist and the antidepressant agent fezolamide have proved the pharmacological potential of the pyrazole moiety. Owing to this diversity in the biological field, this nucleus has {{attracted the attention of}} many researchers to study its skeleton chemically and biologically.

40|$|Lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter {{pressure has}} been studied in pernicious anaemia patients and controls using an infused open-tipped system. Resting sphincter pressure was significantly (p < 0 · 01) lower in the pernicious anaemia patients. After gastric acidification with 0 · 1 N HCl pressure fell significantly (p < 0 · 01) in both groups. Following subsequent alkalinization, lower oesophageal sphincter pressure for controls rose significantly (p < 0 · 001). For pernicious anaemia patients the pressure after alkali was not greater than resting levels. Graded intravenous doses of pentagastrin in controls resulted in a peak pressure change of 38 · 5 ± 4 · 9 mm Hg after the 0 · 8 μg/kg dose. For patients the peak pressure change was only 13 · 0 ± 5 · 2 mm Hg and occurred after 0 · 4 μg/kg. Cholinergic stimulation with edrophonium (10 mg) produced a peak pressure change of 20 · 6 ± 2 · 6 mm Hg in controls but only 3 · 5 ± 1 · 0 mm Hg in pernicious anaemia patients (p < 0 · 001).

In conclusion, the lower oesophageal sphincter in pernicious anaemia is characterized both by a low resting pressure and a decreased response to endogenous and exogenous stimuli. These results suggest a primary end organ defect and most likely indicate abnormal smooth muscle function in pernicious anaemia. Resting sphincter pressure levels and edrophonium response in age-matched subjects indicate that these changes are not due to aging alone.

40|$|P>Achalasia {{surgical}} treatment alters the esophagogastric junction anatomy (cardiomyotomy plus fundoplication or esophagectomy and gastric pull-up), thus favoring {{a certain degree}} of gastroesophageal reflux. Gastric secretory and hormonal functioning is not completely known in chagasic patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the gastric secretory and hormonal response in patients with end-stage chagasic achalasia compared with normal subjects. Gastric secretion and hormonal response were assessed by estimation of gastric acid secretion (GAS) in basal condition and after pentagastrin stimulation, basal serum gastrin, and serum pepsinogen (SP) in basal condition and after <b>betazole</b> hydrochloride (Histalog (R); Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA) stimulation in 27 patients with chagasic achalasia. The results were then compared with those of 24 normal subjects. In the chagasic group, the mean basal and stimulated GAS were significantly lower than in the control group (basal: 1. 277 vs. 3. 13, P = 0. 002; stimulated: 15. 9 vs. 35. 8, P = 0. 0001). Chagasic patients` SG levels showed a significantly higher basal value than the control group (83. 3 vs. 36. 8, P = 0. 0001). There was a significant increase of SP after stimulation compared with the basal levels in both chagasic and control groups. Although the chagasic patients` SP values were higher than the controls, this difference was not statistically significant, either in basal and stimulated conditions (basal: 122. 0 vs. 108. 9, stimulated 120 min: 177. 1 vs. 158. 9). In patients with chronic Chagas` disease (ChD), although autonomic denervation does not suppress the strength of the gastric mucosal cells` secretory response to stimulation, it reduces GAS (parietal cell) without, however, affecting SP production (chief cells). On the other hand, the gastrin-producing cells have continuously been stimulated by low GAS...|$|E
