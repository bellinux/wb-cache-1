500|$|The spores of C.micaceus are reddish-brown, with {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 4.5–6µm. Generally, they are [...] (shaped like a <b>biconvex</b> <b>lens),</b> but {{viewed from the}} side they appear more almond-shaped or spindle-shaped, while in front view they appear oval or mitriform (roughly {{the shape of a}} miter—a peaked cap). Spores have a germ pore, a flattened area {{in the center of the}} spore surface through which a germ tube may emerge. The spore-bearing cells (the basidia) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10–15 by 4–7µm. Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant, and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. Arthur Buller coined the term [...] to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.|$|E

He also developed the first lens specifically for camera lens called Wollaston's meniscus lens, or just meniscus lens, in 1812. The lens was designed to improve the image projected by the camera obscura. By changing the shape of the lens, Wollaston was able to project a flatter image, eliminating much of the distortion that was a problem with many of that day's <b>biconvex</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R

Optical retardation due to stress birefringence as a function of lens radius is presented in graphical form. Results of the numerical analyses are verified by the photoelastic method. Effects on lenses using typical mounting methods are investigated and compared to the analytic predictions. Experimental results correlate well with the analytical predictions. Results of this research indicate that retainer ring mounts produce localized stress birefringence effects which occur only in the area of contact and that radial mounting produces a stress birefringence field which is evident throughout the entire clear aperture of the lens...|$|R
40|$|Pigment {{epithelial}} {{cells of the}} frog's retina have been examined by methods of electron microscopy with special attention focused on the fine structure of the endoplasmic reticulum and the myeloid bodies. These cells, as reported previously, send apical prolongations into the spaces between the rod outer segments, and within these extensions, pigment migrates in response to light stimulation. The cytoplasm of these cells is filled with a compact lattice of membrane-limited tubules, the surfaces of which are smooth or particle-free. In this respect, the endoplasmic reticulum here resembles that encountered in cells which produce lipid-rich secretions. The myeloid bodies comprise paired membranes arranged in stacks shaped like <b>biconvex</b> <b>lenses.</b> At their margins the membranes are continuous with elements of the ER and in consequence of this the myeloid body {{is referred to as}} a differentiation of the reticulum. The paired membranes resemble in their thickness and spacings those which make up the outer segments; they are therefore regarded as intracellular photoreceptors of possible significance in the activation of pigment migration and other physiologic functions of these cells. The fuscin granules are enclosed in membranes which are also continuous with those of the ER. The granules seem to move independently of the prolongations in which they are contained.

40|$|The optics {{of adult}} winged insects {{typically}} {{consists of three}} single-lens ocelli grouped together on the vertex {{of the head and}} a pair of large lateral compound eyes. The compound eyes, each of which contains several thousand closely packed ommatidia, are well suited for visual tasks, such as object or motion detection, that require or profit from a good spatial resolution. Compared with this typical design, the compound eyes of male Strepsiptera are extremely peculiar (Fig. 1 A). Each of the hemispherical eyes is composed of only a few ommatidia (20 – 50 in most species) with as few as 10 in Tridactylophagus similis and as many as 150 ommatidia in Stylops muelleri (Kinzelbach, 1971). The large circular lenses are well separated from one another by heavily sclerotized and usually pilose cuticula. Their arrangement on the eye surface is irregular, their sizes vary significantly across the eye, and their numbers can differ between {{the left and the right}} eye in an individual animal (Kinzelbach, 1971). In Xenos vesparum, the eyes have, on average, 65 ommatidia, although the numbers in the left and the right eye frequently differ by 10 – 15 (Kinzelbach, 1967). Beneath each of the strongly <b>biconvex</b> <b>lenses,</b> the microvilli of at least 60 retinula cells form an extended reticular and vertically layered (tiered) rhabdom structure (Fig. 1 B–D; Strohm, 1910; Rösch, 1913; Wachmann, 1972). The eyes of male Strepsiptera have been considered to be modified larval compound eyes because of their appearance in early larval stages and the arrangement of photoreceptors, which resembles that found in stemmata, the single-lens eyes of holometabolous larvae (Kinzelbach, 1971; Paulus, 1979).

40|$|Scorpions possess {{two types}} of visual organs, the median and lateral eyes. Both eyes consist of simple ocelli with <b>biconvex</b> <b>lenses</b> that differ in {{structure}} and function. There is little variation {{in the number of}} median ocelli across the order. Except for a few troglomorphic species in which the median ocelli are absent, all scorpions possess a single pair. In contrast, the number of pairs of lateral ocelli varies from zero to five across Scorpiones and may vary within species. No attempt has been made to homologize lateral ocelli across the order, and their utility in scorpion systematics has been questioned, due to the variation in number. A recent study examined the number of lateral ocelli among various Asian Buthidae C. L. Koch, 1837 and proposed a "five-eye model" for the family. This model has not been examined more broadly within Buthidae, however, nor compared with the patterns of variation observed among other scorpion families. An eyespot, referred to as an accessory lateral eye, situated ventral or posteroventral to the lateral ocelli, has also been reported in some scorpions. Analysis of its structure suggests it serves a nonvisual function. We present the first comparative study of variation in the lateral ocelli across the order Scorpiones, based on examination of a broad range of exemplar species, representing all families, 160 genera (78 %), 196 species (9 %), and up to 12 individuals per species. We propose a six-ocellus model for Recent scorpions with four accessory ocelli observed in various taxa, homologize the individual ocelli, and correct erroneous counts in the recent literature. We also investigate the presence of the eyespot across scorpions and discover that it is more widespread than previously recognized. Future work should investigate the genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying the formation of the lateral ocelli to test the hypotheses proposed here...|$|R

50|$|In 1851 John Benjamin Dancer invented microphotographs using a {{collodion}} {{process and}} a microscope {{converted to a}} camera. This resulted in a microphotograph about 3 mm2 in area.

Dagron modified the Stanhope lens by sectioning the normally <b>biconvex</b> Stanhope <b>lens</b> and introducing a planar section so that the plane was located at the focal length of the convex side of the cylindrical lens.

40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} the image quality produced by polypseudophakia used for strongly hypermetropic and nanophthalmic eyes.  METHODS—Primary aberration theory and ray tracing analysis {{were used to}} calculate the optimum lens shapes and power distribution between the two intraocular lenses for two example eyes: one a strongly hypermetropic eye, the other a nanophthalmic eye. Spherical aberration and oblique astigmatism were considered. Modulation transfer function (MTF) curves were computed using commercial optical design software (Sigma 2100, Kidger Optics Ltd) to assess axial image quality, and the sagittal and tangential image surfaces were computed to study image quality across the field.  RESULTS—A significant improvement in the axial MTF was found for the eyes with double implants. However, results indicate that this may be realised as a better contrast sensitivity in the low to mid spatial frequency range rather than as a better Snellen acuity. The optimum lens shapes for minimum spherical aberration (best axial image quality) were approximately convex-plano for both lenses with the convex surface facing the cornea. Conversely, the optimum lens shapes for zero oblique astigmatism were strongly meniscus with the anterior surface concave. Correction of oblique astigmatism was only achieved with a loss in axial performance.  CONCLUSIONS—Optimum estimated visual acuity exceeds 6 / 5 in both the hypermetropic and the nanophthalmic eyes studied (pupil size of 4  mm) with polypseudophakic correction. These results can be attained using convex-plano or <b>biconvex</b> <b>lenses</b> with the most convex surface facing the cornea. If the posterior surface of the posterior intraocular lens is convex, as is commonly used to help prevent migration of lens epithelial cells causing posterior capsular opacification (PCO), then it is still possible to achieve 6 / 4. 5 in the hypermetropic eye and 6 / 5. 3 in the nanophthalmic eye provided the anterior intraocular lens has an approximately convex-plano shape with the convex surface anterior. It was therefore concluded that consideration of optical image quality does not demand that additional intraocular lens shapes need to be manufactured for polypseudophakic correction of extremely short eyes and that implanting the posterior intraocular lens in the conventional orientation to help prevent PCO does not necessarily limit estimated visual acuity. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{integration}} of a <b>biconvex</b> micro optofluidic <b>lens</b> into a flow cytometer. The complex optofluidic and microfluidic channel networks are integrated on a single chip. Flow cytometers are widely applied to environmental monitoring, industrial testing and biochemical studies. Integrating a fow cytometer into microfluidic networks helps to miniaturize the system and make it portable for field use. The integration of optical components, such as lenses, further improves the compactness and thus has been intensively studied recently. However, the current designs suffer from severe light scattering due to the roughness of the solid-based lens interface. In this paper, we propose a micro optofluidic system using an optofuidic liquid lens to focus the light beam. Benefting from the smooth liquid-liquid lens interface and the refractive index matching liquid as cladding streams, a light beam can be well focused without scattering. The variations of the signal peak values are reduced owing to the small beam width at the beam waist. Compared to the macroscale systems and microscale systems with solid lenses, the device presents a more efficient and accurate performance on both counting and sizing of particles.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this thesis}} an {{experimental}} setup {{was to be}} developed in order to quantify the radii of curvature and {{the position of the}} human crystalline lens. There had to be determined the anterior and posterior radii of curvature of the crystalline lens as well as the decentralisation and rotation of the crystalline lens with regard to the corneal axis. The experimental setup had to permit static measurements under constant accommodation on the one hand and, on the other, dynamic measurements with continuous changes of accommodation under natural conditions of vision. Methods: The eye was illuminated by two infrared light sources. In this way reflecting images were produced at the anterior corneal surface and the anterior and posterior lens surface, the so-called Purkinje images I, III, and IV. They were then registered and measured by a camera taking pictures of infrared light. The size of these Purkinje images is linked with the radius of curvature of each of the reflecting surfaces. The position of the Purkinje images in relation to the front part of the eye is dependent on the rotation and decentralisation of each of the surfaces. This thesis is divided into three parts: 1. Because of the completely new demands there had to be developed, in several steps, collimated light sources (because of the infrared light the subjects were not dazzled), a fixation object with variable stimuli of accommodation, a telecentric objective without perspective errors due to different axial positions of the Purkinje images (otherwise refocusing had been necessary, so that the accommodation had to be constant during this time and no dynamic measurements under accommodation changes had been possible) and <b>biconvex</b> plastic <b>lenses</b> for a model eye (for the simulation of the human crystalline lens during the following validation measurements). Afterwards all components were tested carefully. 2. Then, the human eye was simulated by the model eye to verify the accuracy of the experimental setup. There were determined the following measuring errors: Radius of curvature of the anterior lens surface r 3 ± 0, 38 mm, radius of curvature of the posterior lens surface r 4 ± 0, 51 mm, position of the corneal axis Kappa± 0, 56 °, crystalline lens rotation Alpha± 0, 26 ° and crystalline lens decentralisation d ± 0, 02 mm. 3. Finally, the described parameters were determined for 9 emmetropic subjects in a pilot study. In this study, the horizontal components were measured, the vertical components can be determined in the same way. The measurements were done under static conditions (accommodation to 25 cm and cycloplegia) as well as under dynamic conditions (periodic and continuous changes between accommodated and relaxed eye). Results: The static as well as the dynamic measurements with a change of accommodation of nearly 4 D showed that the contribution to the accommodation of the anterior lens surface was 2 / 3 and of the posterior surface 1 / 3. For the orientation of the cornea and the crystalline lens the following values were found: Position of the corneal axis Kappa= 5, 98 ° ± 2, 26 ° in temporal direction, rotation of the crystalline lens Alpha= - 0, 14 ° ± 1, 10 ° to nasal, lens decentralisation d = - 0, 11 mm ± 0, 07 mm to nasal. So we can say that the influence of accommodation on these values can be neglected within the fixation and measuring tolerances. These results can be interpreted that normally the angle Kappa is positive, that the crystalline lens is nearly not inclined and that the lens shows – as well as the centre of the pupil – a small decentralisation to nasal...|$|R
