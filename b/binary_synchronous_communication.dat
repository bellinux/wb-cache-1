50|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Communication</b> (BSC or Bisync) is an IBM character-oriented, {{half-duplex}} link protocol, announced in 1967 after {{the introduction of}} System/360. It replaced the synchronous transmit-receive (STR) protocol used with second generation computers. The intent was that common link management rules could be used with three different character encodings for messages. Six-bit Transcode looked backwards to older systems; USASCII with 128 characters and EBCDIC with 256 characters looked forward. Transcode disappeared very quickly but the EBCDIC and USASCII dialects of Bisync continued in use.|$|E

The {{maximum speed}} of one line was 2400 bit/s but the total aggregate line speed was limited. By 1970 the {{maximum line speed}} had been raised to 4800 bit/s. The 2703 attached to a single multiplexer channel; each communication line occupied a subchannel. It had a four or eight byte buffer per line to reduce data transfer {{to and from the}} host computer. The IBM 2712 Remote Multiplexer allowed up to fourteen slow speed devices to be multiplexed over one high speed line to a 2703.|$|E

40|$|With the {{increased}} affordances of <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> tools, {{more opportunities for}} online learning to resemble face-to-face settings have recently become available. However, <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> does not afford as much time for reflection as asynchronous communication. Therefore, a combination of <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous <b>communication</b> in e-learning would seem desirable to optimally support learner engagement {{and the quality of}} student learning. It is still an open question though, how to best design online learning with a blend of <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous <b>communication</b> opportunities over time. Few studies have investigated the relationship between learners' actual use of <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous <b>communication</b> over time. Therefore, this study addressed that relationship in an online course (N[*]=[*] 110), taking into account student motivation, and employing a dynamic inter-temporal perspective. In line with our assumptions, we found some support for the expected association between autonomous motivation and engagement in asynchronous and <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication,</b> be it restricted primarily to the first course period. Also, positive relations between engagement in <b>synchronous</b> and asynchronous <b>communication</b> were found, with the strongest influence from using asynchronous to <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication.</b> This study adds to the knowledge base needed to develop guidelines on how <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> can be combined with asynchronous learning...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for education since the workforce of today {{is expected to be}} highly educated and continuously learn. Distance education is a powerful response to meet the growing need for education. Online education, here concisely defined as distance education mediated online, is {{the most common type of}} distance education. It mainly relies on asynchronous communication although it is well known that many students regard the lack of <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> as disadvantageous. This thesis aims to achieve a deeper understanding of how, why and when <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication,</b> as a complement to asynchronous communication, affects student participation in online education. In order to study the complex phenomenon of online student participation, various qualitative and quantitative data collection methods for assessing both perceived participation and actual participation were used. The aim was investigated in two offerings of an online undergraduate course and two series of online discussions on master level, and by conducting focus group interviews with experienced practitioners. The findings indicate that <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> has the potential to enhance online student participation. Light was shed on two dimensions of participation, which were labelled personal participation and cognitive participation. The thesis suggests that <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication,</b> as a complement to asynchronous communication, may better support personal participation. This is likely to induce arousal and motivation, and increased convergence on meaning, especially in smaller groups. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> seems particularly beneficial for supporting task and social support relations, and to exchange information with a lower degree of complexity. By drawing on the studies of the thesis and previous research, propositions on when to support <b>synchronous</b> <b>communication</b> in online education were suggested...|$|R
