5000|$|The {{surveying}} {{of western}} Canada {{was divided into}} five <b>basic</b> <b>surveys.</b> Each survey's layout was slightly different from the others. The first survey began in 1871 and ended in 1879 and covers some of southern Manitoba and a little of Saskatchewan. The second and smallest survey, 1880, was used in only small areas of Saskatchewan. This system differs from the first survey because rather than running section lines parallel to the eastern boundary they run true north-south. The largest and {{most important of these}} surveys was the third which covers more land than all the others surveys put together. This survey began in 1881. That method of surveying is still used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba [...] The fourth and fifth surveys were used only in some townships in British Columbia.|$|R

In the following year, WAPET geologists conducted a <b>basic</b> <b>survey</b> of Barrow Island.

The operations continued until December 1957, with 63,000 square nautical miles (216,000 square kilometers) of hydrography accomplished. Upon their termination, Pioneer steamed to San Francisco, where she arrived in January 1958. After an [...] and post-overhaul fitting-out, Pioneer resumed survey work for the Navy on 1 May 1958, this time off the southern coast of California.

50|$|Initially, the Australian Survey Corps {{continued}} its mapping for the defence of Australia, proceeded with <b>basic</b> <b>survey</b> triangulation and provided training cadre for new field and training units. In January 1940, Field Survey Units RAE (Militia) {{were established in}} 1st Military District - Queensland, 2nd Military District - New South Wales and 3rd Military District - Victoria to accelerate the mapping effort. Deputy Assistant Directors - Survey were appointed to Military District Headquarters to advise on survey needs and to liaise with State agencies. In April 1940 the 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE was raised {{as part of the}} 2nd Australian Imperial Force for service overseas and a Survey staff was appointed to the formation (Corps) headquarters. In September 1940 significant expansion of the Australian Survey Corps was approved by Cabinet to include a Survey Directorate on Army Headquarters (AHQ) and higher formation headquarters, an AHQ Survey Company, an AHQ Cartographic Company, regional command field survey companies, a Survey Section 7th Military District (Darwin) and a Corps Survey Mobile Reproduction Section. Four militia Field Survey Companies were established in the regional commands (1 Field Survey Coy - Queensland, 2 Field Survey Coy - New South Wales, 3 Field Survey Coy - Victoria, 4 Field Survey Coy - Western Australia) absorbing the Australian Survey Corps Sections and the Field Survey Units RAE (M) in the Commands.|$|E
50|$|Construction materials, {{including}} construction {{lumber and}} drywall, {{continue to be}} sold in imperial measurements; retrofitting metric-sized (designed for 400 mm centres) wallboard on old 16 in spaced studs is difficult. In English-speaking Canada commercial and residential spaces are mostly (but not exclusively) constructed using imperial units and advertised accordingly, while in French-speaking Quebec commercial and residential spaces are constructed in metres and advertised using both metric and imperial units as equivalents. However, the zoning by-laws and building codes that govern construction are in metric, although most building codes will also contain imperial equivalents. In addition, rural areas in Western Canada (Canadian Prairies) were mapped and segmented using the Dominion Land Survey. This based most rural roads on a mile measurement which when viewed from the air has {{the appearance of a}} checkerboard or grid. Because of this standard now etched into the landscape, it is still common to refer to distance in miles, since counting the number of mile roads is easy. In contrast, in much of southern Ontario the <b>basic</b> <b>survey</b> grid was based on a mile-and-a-quarter (1.25 mi), which corresponds almost exactly to a 2 kilometre grid and which makes miles no more natural than kilometres. It should be noted that 1.25 mi is equal to 100 chains (or 10 furlongs) and it was that sized grid that was used in the original surveys and thus would have been more familiar.|$|E

50|$|After {{paying for}} the passage of an {{individual}} {{to make it to}} the colonies, one needed to obtain a patent for the land. First, the governor or local county court had to provide a certificate that certified the validity of the importation of a person. One would then select the land one desired and have an official survey made. The two <b>basic</b> <b>surveying</b> instruments used to mark plots of land were a chain known as Gunter's chain and a compass. The patent’s claimant would then take the description of this land to the colony’s secretary, who created the patent to be approved by the governor. Once a headright was obtained, it was treated as a commodity and could be bought, sold, or traded. It also could be saved indefinitely and used at a later date.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper we analyze the effects of {{investing}} abroad using firm-level data for Japan for the period 1994 - 2004. We adopt propensity score matching techniques in combination with a difference-in-differences (DID) estimator to evaluate the causal effect of establishing a foreign affiliate {{on a set of}} domestic outcome variables of interest. We focus on firms that switch from being a purely domestic firm to being a multinational firm. Our identification strategy of switching firms, i. e. Japanese firms investing for the first time abroad between 1995 and 2003, relies on the confrontation of information coming from two different data sets: the <b>basic</b> <b>survey</b> on Overseas Business Activities conducted annually by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the <b>basic</b> <b>survey</b> of Japanese Business Structure and Activities (BSBSA). The <b>basic</b> <b>survey</b> on Overseas Business Activities provides yearly data on more than 27, 000 Japanese investments in operation between 1995 - 2004 containing information on the starting date, sector, the country of location and other details of the nature and objective of the investment. The data set also allows the attribution of affiliates to their parent firm via a parent identification code. We use the information on when the operation started to identify affiliates (and their related parent firms) that appear t...|$|E
