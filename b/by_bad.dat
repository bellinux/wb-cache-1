Abrams later brought Bryan Burk, a producer on several of his films, to help with developing the series.|$|E

5|$|The Christ Church {{scriptorium}} {{was particularly}} active under Wulfred. Although the handwriting {{of the documents}} produced during Wulfred's archiepiscopate is quite elegant, the actual contents of the charters is marked <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> grammar and other errors. From this, the historian N. P. Brooks has deduced that the clergy of the cathedral were not very literate in Latin, and would have likely been unable to compose new Latin works.|$|E
5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, behind their lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} in England, de Vere {{returned}} to the Continent in 1342, where he served with Northampton, who had been made lieutenant of Brittany. They both {{took part in the}} Battle of Morlaix that year. The next year the two earls were sent to Scotland to relieve Lochmaben Castle, and in 1345 they were again campaigning in Brittany. Tradition has it that, returning to England, their ships were forced ashore <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> weather, and the party was robbed of their possessions by the locals. In the summer of 1346 de Vere was campaigning with the king in Normandy, and took part in the Battle of Crécy. According to the chronicler Froissart, de Vere was fighting with the Black Prince, and was among the captains who sent a request to Edward III for reinforcements when the king famously answered 'Let the boy win his spurs'. Oxford was also at the Siege of Calais, but reportedly fell ill in 1348, and did not take part in any major campaigning until 1355.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{international}} affairs intervened. Louis XI {{declared war on}} Burgundy, and Duke Charles responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV, in order to reclaim his throne. On 14March Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire, with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland. Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward, {{who were supposed to}} bring reinforcements from France, but were kept on the continent <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> weather. At this point Edward received the support of his brother Clarence, who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians. Clarence's defection weakened Warwick, who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward. On 14April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet. Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion, and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men. In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field, but was struck off his horse and killed.|$|E
5|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to England in June, before departing {{to patrol the}} Western Approaches until September. She entered Portsmouth Dockyard again in October and underwent a refit costing £8,103. She resumed patrol and blockade duty in the Western Approaches in January 1796, at first under Cranstoun, but from April effectively under the acting-captaincy of Lieutenant John Loring. Cranstoun's replacement, Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby, arrived to take command in September. Blockade duty continued until early January 1797, when news reached the fleet that a French expedition had appeared off Ireland. Caught off guard, the Admiralty ordered Bellerophon {{and a number of}} other ships to patrol off Bantry Bay. By then the French expedition had been dispersed <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> weather, and after three weeks on patrol, Bellerophon put into Cork where she rendezvoused with the Irish squadron under Admiral Robert Kingsmill. Shortly after her return to Spithead in early March, Bellerophon was given new orders by the Admiralty. She sailed on 17 March, bound for Cadiz to join Sir John Jervis's Mediterranean Fleet blockading the port.|$|E

5|$|England {{started their}} second innings 337 runs in arrears. Dewes took strike and {{got off the}} mark from Lindwall when he aimed a hook shot and was {{credited}} with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer rose over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Soon after, Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England 20/1. Dewes had often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty. This was because of his habit of leaning his weight onto his back foot as the ball was being bowled, which meant that a forward lean would instinctively result. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the England innings, which reached 54/1 at the close at the second day's play, which was hastened <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> light.|$|E
5|$|Extending the police's {{presence}} {{across the}} region was logistically challenging, requiring {{the creation of a}} network of new posts and the use of steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh existence for the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing for two decades, which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying the police outposts around the bay. The police opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where the police established their divisional headquarters. Patrols pushed up into Baker Lake and along the Coppermine River until, {{by the end of the}} decade, the police presence in Hudson Bay had been reduced to a bare minimum, with the force focusing on reaching out into ever more remote areas.|$|E
5|$|Flying at Benalla was {{hampered}} <b>by</b> <b>bad</b> weather, and {{the runway}} was unusable from September to November 1941, necessitating the detachment of over 250 personnel to Essendon, home of No.3 EFTS, {{to continue their}} training. In October 1941, six airmen of No.11 EFTS were court-martialled for mutiny. Their main grievance was having to undertake guard duty at night and attend parades at 7:15am {{in addition to their}} regular ground support work. One of the men was found guilty of incitement and the other five for failing to report their knowledge of the matter to the commanding officer. The former was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment and the others to between five and six months detention; all were discharged from the Air Force. On 11December 1941, one of the school's Tiger Moths made a crash landing in a field and struck four people on the ground, killing two and injuring the others; the two pilots were uninjured. The outbreak of war in the Pacific saw slit trenches being dug at the base.|$|E
