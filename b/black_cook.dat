25|$|Niki {{grew up in}} {{a strict}} Catholic environment, against which she {{repeatedly}} rebelled. Her mother was temperamental and violent, beating the younger children, and forcing them to eat even if they were not hungry. Both Elizabeth and Richard de Saint Phalle, younger siblings, would later commit suicide as adults. The atmosphere at home was tense; the only place where Niki felt comfortable and warm was in the kitchen, overseen by a <b>black</b> <b>cook.</b> Decades later, Niki would reveal that she had suffered years of sexual abuse from her father, starting at the age of 11.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June 1861, Jefferson Davis {{slipped out}} of Charleston Harbor and easily evaded the {{rudimentary}} blockade that was then in place. She remained at sea for nearly two months, making nine captures: the schooner Enchantress, brig John Welsh, schooner S. J. Waring, brig Mary E. Thompson, ship Mary Goodell, ship John Carver, bark Alvarado, schooner Windward, and brig Santa Clara. Of these, Enchantress was recaptured, Alvarado was chased ashore and destroyed by a blockader, Windward, Mary E. Thompson, and Mary Goodell were released with prisoners, John Carver was burned at sea, and the <b>black</b> <b>cook</b> of S. J. Waring killed three sleeping members of the prize crew and sailed her to New York City, where he was received as a hero. Only John Welsh and Santa Clara were taken into Southern ports for adjudication.|$|E
25|$|Ishmael digresses on {{pictures}} of whales, brit (microscopic sea creatures on which whales feed), squid and— after four boats lowered in vain because Daggoo mistook a giant squid {{for the white}} whale— whale-lines. The next day, in the Indian Ocean, Stubb kills a sperm whale, and that night Fleece, the Pequods <b>black</b> <b>cook,</b> prepares him a rare whale steak. Fleece delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale's carcass, tied to the ship, saying that their nature is to be voracious, but they must overcome it. The whale is prepared, beheaded, and barrels of oil are tried out. Standing {{at the head of}} the whale, Ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea. The Pequod next encounters the Jeroboam, which not only lost its chief mate to Moby Dick, but also is now plagued by an epidemic.|$|E

500|$|One {{thread of}} {{critical}} analysis of this tale focuses on the possibly racist implications of Poe's plot and imagery. One such plot element is the <b>black</b> <b>cook</b> who leads the mutiny on the Grampus and is its most bloodthirsty participant. Dirk Peters, a hybrid of white and Native American ancestry, is described as having a ferocious appearance, with long, protruding teeth, bowed legs, and a bald head like [...] "the head of most negroes." [...] The brilliant whiteness of the final figure in the novel contrasts with the dark-skinned savages and such a contrast may call to mind the escalating racial tensions over the question of slavery in the United States as Poe was writing the novel.|$|E
500|$|In a 1964 interview, Lee {{remarked that}} her {{aspiration}} was [...] "to be... the Jane Austen of South Alabama." [...] Both Austen and Lee challenged the social {{status quo and}} valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their <b>black</b> <b>cook,</b> chastises and punishes her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, {{and later in the}} book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, [...] "in Austenian fashion", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: [...] "affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status".|$|E
2500|$|Set in 1876, Whity {{centers on}} the title character, a mulatto who works as the obsequious servant in the mansion of a {{dysfunctional}} family in the American South. [...] He is the illegitimate son of the family patriarch and the <b>black</b> <b>cook.</b> Whity tries to carry out all their orders, however demeaning, until several {{of the family members}} ask him to kill some of the others. He eventually kills them all and runs away to the desert with a prostitute from the local bar.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1947, Brown {{reported}} to Glenview Naval Air Station in Glenview, Illinois, for Naval Flight Officer training. There, his enlistment ended 15 April and Brown reverted {{to the rank}} of midshipman, becoming the only African American in the program. Although he anticipated antagonism, he found the other cadets were generally friendly and welcoming. He found many of the <b>black</b> <b>cooks</b> and janitors hostile to him, however, possibly due to jealousy. Brown got his first flight time aboard a Stearman N2S trainer aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Colescott's work {{achieved}} {{national attention}} {{through a series}} of works based on iconic paintings from art history. In his George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware: Page From an American History Textbook (1975), Colescott re-imagined Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting of the Revolutionary War hero, putting Carver, a pioneering African American agricultural chemist, at the helm of a boat loaded with <b>black</b> <b>cooks,</b> maids, fishermen and minstrels. [...] With equally transgressive humor and an explosive style, he also created his own versions of Vincent van Gogh's Potato Eaters (1975), Jan van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait (1976), and Édouard Manet's Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (1980).|$|R
500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{completed}} in July at a total cost of £800. It included a building made of iron, containing a main room with counters and shelves and storage above, an attached kitchen, two wooden sleeping huts, outhouses, and an enclosed stable-yard. The building was stocked with provisions shipped from London and Constantinople, {{as well as local}} purchases from the British camp near Kadikoi and the French camp at nearby Kamiesch. Seacole sold anything – [...] "from a needle to an anchor"—to army officers and visiting sightseers. Meals were served at the Hotel, <b>cooked</b> by two <b>black</b> <b>cooks,</b> and the kitchen also provided outside catering.|$|R
2500|$|Matthews {{reports that}} when a member of Company B accidentally dropped his pocketwatch into the latrine pit one morning, he paid a <b>black</b> <b>cook</b> $5.00 to get it out. Men from the {{regiment}} stripped and washed their socks, underwear and shirts in a creek without using soap or boiling water; then they put on dry socks, pants, coats and shoes while waiting for their wet clothes to dry in the sununless they were ordered to move out, in which case they simply put on their sopping clothes and let them dry on their bodies. Men tried to bathe their feet at least once every twenty-four hours, striving to always keep a pair of dry socks to keep their feet from becoming [...] "sore." [...] Half-ripe walnuts and fruit were forbidden for sanitary reasons, and soldiers caught eating them were punished by being forced to dig latrine pits.|$|E
2500|$|A {{month after}} the war ended in 1865, at age 8, George landed at the docks of La Crosse, Wisconsin on board the Hawkeye State, a steam side-paddle wheeler that {{operated}} between St. Paul, Minnesota and St. Louis, Missouri. Taylor remained in La Crosse for two or three years. During those years he was known as George Southall and likely lived with the family of Henry Southall, a <b>Black</b> <b>cook</b> who worked on paddle wheelers. In 1867 or 1868, the Southalls moved from La Crosse, and George, at age 10 or 11, remained in La Crosse. A La Crosse County court judge intervened and fostered him to a Black family, Nathan Smith and his wife Sarah, who provided care for some of the county’s orphaned or abandoned children and who lived near West Salem, Wisconsin, twelve kilometers east of La Crosse. Taylor remained fostered to Smith until he reached the age of 20. During this period, George took the name of George Edward Taylor. He attended a country school near his home.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{events in}} Equiano's life {{led him to}} {{question}} his faith. He was severely distressed in 1774 by the kidnapping of his friend, a <b>black</b> <b>cook</b> named John Annis, who was taken forcibly off the English ship Anglicania on which they were both serving. His friend's kidnapper, a Mr. Kirkpatrick, did not abide by the decision in the Somersett Case (1772), that slaves could not be taken from England without their permission, as common law {{did not support the}} institution. Kirkpatrick had Annis transported to Saint Kitts, where he was punished severely and worked as a plantation labourer until he died. With the aid of Granville Sharp, Equiano tried to get Annis released before he was shipped from England, but was unsuccessful. He heard that Annis was not free from suffering until he died in slavery. Despite his questioning, he affirms his faith in Christianity, as seen in the penultimate sentence of his work that quotes the prophet Micah: [...] "After all, what makes any event important, unless by its observation we become better and wiser, and learn 'to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly before God?'" ...|$|E

60|$|Speaking of negroes, {{recalls the}} looks of {{interest}} with which negro- sailors are regarded when they walk the Liverpool streets. In Liverpool indeed the negro steps with a prouder pace, and lifts {{his head like a}} man; for here, no such exaggerated feeling exists in respect to him, as in America. Three or four times, I encountered our black steward, dressed very handsomely, and walking arm in arm with a good-looking English woman. In New York, such a couple would have been mobbed in three minutes; and the steward would have been lucky to escape with whole limbs. Owing to the friendly reception extended to them, and the unwonted immunities they enjoy in Liverpool, the <b>black</b> <b>cooks</b> and stewards of American ships are very much attached to the place and like to make voyages to it.|$|R
