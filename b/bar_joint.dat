5000|$|A {{common form}} of crevice failure occurs due to stress {{corrosion}} cracking, where a crack or cracks develop {{from the base of}} the crevice where the stress concentration is greatest. This was the root cause of the fall of the Silver Bridge in 1967 in West Virginia, where a single critical crack only about 3 mm long suddenly grew and fractured a tie <b>bar</b> <b>joint.</b> The rest of the bridge fell in less than a minute.The eyebars in the Silver Bridge were not redundant, as links were composed of only two bars each, of high strength steel (more than twice as strong as common mild steel), rather than a thick stack of thinner bars of modest material strength [...] "combed" [...] together as is usual for redundancy. With only two bars, the failure of one could impose excessive loading on the second, causing total failureâ€”unlikely if more bars are used. While a low-redundancy chain can be engineered to the design requirements, the safety is completely dependent upon correct, high quality manufacturing and assembly.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the behaviour of soils {{is a crucial}} problem in geothermal engineering as soils are subjected to the action of temperature variation in many diverse conditions. It is observed in both laboratory experiments and in situ tests that temperature variations can induce interaction between the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical behaviour of soils, which is known as thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupling. In order to simulate the THM coupling, {{it is necessary to}} combine the equations governing heat transfer through the soil mass with the equations governing pore fluid flow through the soil skeleton, and the equations governing the stress-strain behaviour of the soil. Due to the complexities of the governing equations, the finite element (FE) method has been regarded as an appropriate numerical tool to solve THM coupled problems. In this thesis, all of the research has been carried out using the Imperial College Finite Element Program (ICFEP), which has been developed specifically for geotechnical engineering analysis. This thesis develops the governing equations for THM coupled analysis. It then describes the implementation of these equations for fully saturated soils in ICFEP. This theory has been applied to all types of elements in ICFEP, such as solid, beam, <b>bar,</b> <b>joint,</b> membrane and shell elements. Thermal boundary conditions relevant to geotechnical engineering have also been developed and implemented into ICFEP. A series of validation tests on the new facilities has been performed, and the results have been compared to those obtained using analytical and finite difference methods. To avoid numerical oscillations, the time-step constraints in coupled transient FE analyses, as well as an adequate mesh discretisation in highly convective coupled analysis, have been investigated. The findings from the analytical and numerical studies have been applied to a simulation of an open-loop ground source energy system, and the results show an excellent agreement with the available approximate solution.

40|$|In a few months, "We the People" {{will go to}} {{the polls}} and elect the electors who will elect (or, at least, have an {{opportunity}} to elect) the next President of the United States. Short of an act of God or an act of war, it is more likely than not that the next President will be a sitting United States Senator. The expectation is that a Senator/President-elect resigns his or her legislative seat some time prior taking the presidential oath of office. It is widely believed in large and influential academic circles and among the educated public generally that the Constitution requires this result by expressly precluding joint simultaneous Legislative-Executive Branch office holding. I respectfully dissent. I believe the conventional view is mistaken as a matter of the original public meaning of the Constitution. Although the idea of a sitting Senator holding the office of President is somewhat counter-intuitive, this is one example of the dangers of unexamined intuitions. True, the Constitution does preclude joint Legislative Branch-Executive Branch service. But for incompatibility purposes, the President {{is not part of the}} Executive Branch; rather, the (elected) President presides over it, as opposed to (appointed) Executive Branch officers [...] which are under it. Therefore, a sitting Senator can keep his or her seat while serving as President. In short, the Incompatibility Clause bars Representatives and Senators from "holding any office under the United States. " Here, I (further) argue that the phrase "office under the United States" is a term of art referring to statutory or appointed officers, not to the President. In short, the Incompatibility Clause does not <b>bar</b> <b>joint</b> Senate-Presidential office-holding; it bars Senators from working for the President (or being appointed by the President), it does not bar a Senator from being President. Professor Steven G. Calabresi disagrees. He states that my position is "utterly implausible. " This paper is my reply to Professor Calabresi's response to my opening statement. The focus of our exchange relates to the Oaths and Affirmations Clause, the Impeachments Clause, and the Commissions Clause. Professor Calabresi will write a rejoinder ending our 4 -part exchange. In addition to Professor Calabresi's response, which was part of the debate on PENNumbra, I had a similar exchange with Professor Prakash.

50|$|In rail terminology, a fishplate, splice <b>bar</b> or <b>joint</b> <b>bar</b> is a {{metal bar}} that is {{bolted to the}} ends of two rails to join them {{together}} in a track.

In rail transport modelling, a fishplate is often a small copper or nickel silver plate that slips onto both rails to provide the functions of maintaining alignment and electrical continuity.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{lifetime}} of an insulated railroad joint in the field has decreased due to increasing wheel loads. The goal {{of this research is}} to investigate possible changes in insulated rail joint design in order to improve the performance of the insulated joint. The finite element program ABAQUS is used to model the supported butt joint. In this model, the rail, <b>joint</b> <b>bars,</b> epoxy, and ties surrounding the joint are modeled using solid elements. The remaining ties are modeled as an elastic foundation. The rail is subjected to a tensile load, as well as a vertical wheel load that is applied to the rail using Hertz contact theory. Parametric studies are performed by varying the tie width, <b>joint</b> <b>bar</b> length, and <b>joint</b> <b>bar</b> dimensions. Two different wheel load locations are also investigated: centered about the end post, and halfway between the tie under the end post and the tie just {{to the left of the}} end post. The vertical displacement of the rail and insulated joint is one measure used to determine the effect of the parameters on the insulated joint. However, since the most common cause of failure in insulated rail joints is the debonding of the epoxy, this research also focuses on the stresses present in the epoxy when the joint is subjected to a static wheel load. The two out-of-plane shear stresses as well as the normal peel stress are used to compare the various designs of th...|$|R

Moreover, the finite element analyses described in this paper are applied to conduct comparative studies and to assess the relative effect of various factors on the structural response of jointed rail to applied loads. Such factors include: discrete tie support (i. e. supported joint versus suspended joint with varying spans between effective ties), bolt pattern (four versus six bolts), initial bolt tension, and easement.

40|$|The metal {{adjacent}} to a weld is exposed to severe thermal events. As a result, complex changes in metallurgical structure occur in this region. By varying certain welding parameters, the weld joint strength can be optimized. Two conditions necessary for hydrogen (cold) cracking of welds to occur are a susceptible microstructure (i. e. hard), {{and the presence of}} sufficient diffusible hydrogen. Both of these conditions are strongly influenced by how the weld cools. A finite element model was developed, suitable for predicting the thermal history of welds. The model incorporates temperature dependent thermal properties and latent heats. Arc energy is added as a heat flux density over a double ellipsoidal model of the weld pool. The model was used to obtain heat affected zone cooling times, allowing prediction of hydrogen cracking susceptibility. The predictions were verified with previous finite element and experimental studies. A parametric analysis was performed to find the influence of a number of weld conditions on cooling behaviour.
