He gives the following classification: squarers of the circle, trisectors of the angle, duplicators of the cube, constructors of perpetual motion, subverters of gravitation, stagnators of the earth, builders of the universe. You will still find specimens of all these classes in the New World and in the new century. De Morgan gives his personal knowledge of paradoxers.|$|E

He said that after Lady Hastings went off in the car the general asked him to take coffee {{with him in the}} library and look up a point about local antiquities. He himself was beginning to look for Budge's book in one of the revolving <b>bookstands</b> when the general found it in one of the bookshelves on the wall. After looking at some of the plates they went out, it would seem, rather abruptly, on to the links, and walked toward the old well; and while Boyle was looking into it he heard a thud behind him, and turned round to find the general lying as we found him. He himself dropped on his knees to examine the body, and then was paralyzed with a sort of terror and could not come nearer to it or touch it. But I think very little of that; people caught in a real shock of surprise are sometimes found in the queerest postures." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{concept for}} BookWars was {{developed}} after a chance meeting between filmmaker Jason Rosette—who had been selling used {{and out of}} print books at a streetside <b>bookstand</b> to generate cash between film production and editing jobs—and Emmy Award-winning New York-based documentary filmmaker Michel Negroponte, at Mr. Rosette’s sidewalk <b>bookstand</b> in 1995. Mr. Negroponte, who had previously directed numerous documentaries including Jupiter's Wifehttp://www.inbaseline.com/project.aspx?project_id=130310 and Space Coasthttp://www.inbaseline.com/project.aspx?project_id=69918, agreed to be a co-producer on the movie.|$|R
60|$|They found {{themselves}} plunging through the club smoking {{room and the}} library beyond, in complete darkness, mental as well as material. But Horne Fisher, {{in spite of his}} affectation of indifference, was a person of a curious and almost transcendental sensibility to atmospheres, and he already felt the presence of something more than an accident. He collided with a piece of furniture in the library, and almost shuddered with the shock, for the thing moved as he could never have fancied a piece of furniture moving. It seemed to move like a living thing, yielding and yet striking back. The next moment Grayne had turned on the lights, and he saw he had only stumbled against one of the revolving <b>bookstands</b> that had swung round and struck him; but his involuntary recoil had revealed to him his own subconscious sense of something mysterious and monstrous. There were several of these revolving bookcases standing here and there about the library; on one of them stood the two cups of coffee, and on another a large open book. It was Budge's book on Egyptian hieroglyphics, with colored plates of strange birds and gods, and even as he rushed past, he was conscious of something odd about the fact that this, and not any work of military science, should be open in that place at that moment. He was even conscious of the gap in the well-lined bookshelf from which it had been taken, and it seemed almost to gape at him in an ugly fashion, like a gap in the teeth of some sinister face.|$|E

50|$|In November 1937, Penguin inaugurated a {{new series}} of short, polemical books under the rubric of Penguin Specials with the {{publication}} of Edgar Mowrer's Germany Puts the Clock Back. Their purpose was to offer in-depth analysis of current affairs that would counter the perceived bias of the newspapers in addition to being the company's response to the popularity of Gollancz's Left Book Club. Whereas the Left Book Club was avowedly pro-Soviet, Penguin and Lane expressed no political preference as their editorial policy, though the widespread belief was that the series was left-leaning since the editor was the communist John Lehmann and its authors were, with a few exceptions, men of the left. Speed of publication and delivery (a turnaround of weeks rather than months) were essential to the topicality and therefore success of the Specials, Genevieve Tabouis's anti-appeasement tract Blackmail or War sold over 200,000 copies for example. However even this immediacy did not prevent them being overtaken by events: Shiela Grant Duff's Europe and the Czechs only made it onto the <b>bookstands</b> {{on the day of the}} Munich agreement, but nevertheless went on to be a bestseller. Thirty-five Penguin Specials were published before the outbreak of war, including two novels Hašek's Good Soldier Schweik and Bottome's The Mortal Storm; they collectively made a significant contribution to the public debate of the time, with many of the more controversial titles being the subject of leading articles in the press.|$|E

This paper argues that any meaningful conceptualization of youth in North Africa and West Asia going forward should incorporate the notion of precariat and the condition of precariousness...|$|E
40|$|Librarians often keep classic {{books in}} school {{libraries}} because the books have educational merits, {{yet they are}} rarely checked out for recreational reading. Current research on low circulation of classic literature in school libraries is limited to anecdotal evidence from school and young adult librarians suggesting that lack of promotion and especially the inferior condition of old editions contribute to low circulation. This research fills the gap by examining the effect of new editions and display on circulation in a field experimental study at a middle school library in 2011. Set up as 2 X 2 factorial design, the field experiment had four experimental groups: old edition shelved, old edition displayed, new edition shelved, and new edition displayed. Twenty books [...] ten new editions, ten old editions, and all of different titles [...] {{were used for the}} study, with half in each category randomly chosen for displaying on <b>bookstands</b> {{at the end of a}} shelf. Circulation statistics were collected for these books over a period of three months. Although statistical analysis revealed no significant impact, further examination of the experimental data seemed to suggest that new edition and display in combination may increase circulation of classic titles and that books with quality cover art and informative summaries are most likely to circulate...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: (re-) {{emergent}} geographies {{of religion}} Since {{the beginning of}} this century, two collections of essays in important and well-regarded journals of geography gave dedicated attention to the phenomenon of religion. In 2002, Julian Holloway and Oliver Valins led a themed section in Social and Cultural Geography on ‘placing religion and spirituality in geography’, while in 2006, James Proctor (2006) organised a forum in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers on ‘theorizing and studying religion’. The AAG 2 ̆ 7 s study group on Geographies of Religion and Belief Systems has started a new online journal of the same name. A new book on the Geographies of Muslim Women (Falah and Nagel 2005) brings together a range of essays focusing on different parts of the globe, while a new edited collection on Geographies of Muslim Identities has just hit the <b>bookstands</b> (Aitchison et al. 2007). In the mean time, a host of papers examining various aspects of religion and geography has been produced in the last decade, more so than in the preceding 20 to 30 years (just some examples are: Chivallon 2001; Dunn 2001; Dwyer 1999 a, 1999 b; Graham 1998; Graham and Murray 1997; Henkel 2005; Hervieu-Leger 2002; Knippenberg 1998; Kong 2002, 2005 a and b, 2006; Tong and Kong 2000; Livingstone et al. 1998; Nagar 1997; Numrich 1997; Pacione 2005; Prorok 2003; Raivo 1997, 2002; Sidorov 2000 a, 2000 b; Slater 2004; Valins 2003; Vincent and Warf 2002; Zelinsky 2001). © in this edition Edinburgh University Press, 2009...|$|E
