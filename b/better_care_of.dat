As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women.

Instead, the Giants traded McGann to the Boston Doves with Frank Bowerman, George Browne, Bill Dahlen and Cecil Ferguson for Al Bridwell, Tom Needham and Fred Tenney on December 13, 1907. Tenney, also a first baseman, was designated as McGann's replacement at first.

500|$|There is {{widespread}} {{frustration with the}} land title system. [...] Privatising home ownership {{and the creation of}} a market economy with long term leases is seen by some commentators as the best option to move forward on Palm. [...] This proposal is described as giving Indigenous people [...] "skin in the game" [...] and empowerment. [...] In the period 1999 to 2007 35houses were replaced due to damage. [...] Noel Pearson of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership argues that housing degradation in these communities has more to do with overcrowding and poor construction than it does with poor tenancy. [...] However he adds that Aboriginal people naturally take much <b>better</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> property that they have constructed or paid for themselves, than they do that which has been handed to them 'on a plate' and which they have had little personal engagement in. [...] The push for privatisation of title was led by the Australian Government (through Mal Brough, Indigenous Affairs Minister), Noel Pearson, and some families on the island (the community is very divided on this issue). The proposal had partial (or cautious) support from the then Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition.|$|E

The malady was a lesion known as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, or [...] "lymphoepithelioma." [...] His name and fame gave him access to experimental treatments, and he was one of the first cancer patients to receive both drugs and radiation treatment simultaneously.

The new commissioner, Happy Chandler (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, Babe Ruth Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be at Yankee Stadium. A number of teammates and others spoke in honor of Ruth, who briefly addressed the crowd of almost 60,000.|$|E
500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take <b>better</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{show that}} {{patients}} who have whitened their teeth take <b>better</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> them. [...] However, a tooth whitening product with an overall low pH can put enamel at risk for decay or destruction by demineralization. Consequently, care should be taken and risk evaluated when choosing a product which is very acidic. Tooth whiteners in toothpastes work through a mechanical action. They have mild abrasives which aid in the removal of stains on enamel. Although this {{can be an effective}} method, it does not alter the intrinsic color of teeth. Microabrasion techniques employ both methods. An acid is used first to weaken the outer 22ndash&27 micrometers of enamel in order to weaken it enough for the subsequent abrasive force. [...] This allows for removal of superficial stains in the enamel. If the discoloration is deeper or in the dentin, this method of tooth whitening will not be successful.|$|E

Mantle did not {{know at the time}} that most of the men in his family had inhaled lead and zinc dust in the mines, which contribute to Hodgkins' and other cancers. As the years passed, and he outlived all the men in his family by several years, he frequently used a line popularized by football legend Bobby Layne, a Dallas neighbor and friend of Mantle's who also died in part due to alcohol abuse: [...] "If I'd known I was gonna live this long, I'd have taken a lot <b>better</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to note that the negative impact of infidelity on a relationship depends on how involved partners are in their infidelity relationship, and researchers maintain that infidelity itself does not cause divorce but the overall level of relationship satisfaction, motives for infidelity, level of conflict, and attitudes held about infidelity do (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). In fact, Schneider, et al. (1999) reported that even though 60 percent of their participants initially threatened to leave their primary relationship, a threat to leave due to infidelity did not actually predict the eventual outcome (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). [...] Atkins, Eldridge, Baucom, and Christiansen (2005) found that couples who went through therapy as well as openly dealt with the infidelity were able to change at a faster rate than other distressed couples who were just in therapy (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). Some unintended positive outcomes that have been reported for couples experiencing infidelity include closer marital relationships, increased assertiveness, taking <b>better</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> oneself, placing higher value on family, and realizing the importance of marital communication (Blow & Hartnett, 2005).|$|E
