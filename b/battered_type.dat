40|$|Gravity type {{retaining}} walls {{have been widely}} used to retain soil in Sri Lanka. However, it was reported that the performance of gravity type {{retaining walls}} during earthquake is poor. In view of the above, it was attempted in this study to develop a methodology to estimate the possible displacements of commonly found gravity retaining walls in Sri Lanka due to expected earthquakes. In addition, it was attempted to recommend an optimum shape for gravity retaining walls to minimize the possible displacements. This work was backed by Mononobe-Okabe theory and Newmark‟s sliding wedge analysis. Using Mononobe-Okabe analysis, threshold acceleration that would cause a relative displacement between retaining wall and soil, was found for different types of retaining walls. Using Newmark‟s method, an analytical model was developed to predict lateral displacements during seismic loadings. Then different acceleration-time histories of earthquakes, which are similar to those observed near Sri Lanka recently, were fed to the developed analytical model and the lateral displacements were found. Gravity retaining walls with a sloping back is found to give the least displacements, compared to the other types such as vertical and <b>battered</b> <b>type</b> gravity retaining walls for same acceleration-time history and to the same ground slope behind the retaining wall...|$|E

50|$|The {{texture of}} the apam balik can vary {{depending}} on the amount of <b>batter</b> and <b>type</b> of pan used, from one that is akin to a crispier form of crumpets to small thin light pancake shells that break when bitten (the latter is usually called apam balik nipis, 'thin apam balik').|$|R
40|$|Three {{trials of}} 6 {{treatments}} (rice flour, wet batter baked; rice flour, dry batter baked; rice flour, wet batter fried; wheat flour, wet batter baked; wheat flour, dry batter baked; wheat flour, wet batter fried) were utilized {{to test the}} effects of flour <b>type,</b> <b>batter</b> <b>type,</b> and cooking method {{on the characteristics of}} chicken nuggets. Value was added to these chicken nuggets by utilizing rice flour in the production of gluten-free products as well as lipid reduction through baking. Added value is attributed to the production of a product that is highly acceptable to certain consumer clusters and has the potential to reach niche markets (wheat-free or low-fat chicken nuggets) that have not previously been targeted in the mainstream portion of the grocery store. Consumers were clustered into 6 population segments revealing that all 6 treatments were acceptable to some segment of the population. Baking instead of frying reduced fat calories by at least 67 %. This reveals the feasibility of using rice flour in the formulation of low-fat or wheat-free chicken nuggets without diminishing quality and the added value component of usability by people who either require a low-fat diet, have celiac disease, or both...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} and properties of a crust {{during and after}} deep frying are difficult to study. Batter pickup (the amount of batter adhering to a product) and core properties affect crust {{formation and}} properties of the crust in such way {{that it is difficult}} to compare batters of different viscosity or cores with different properties. Moreover, it is often difficult and laborious to separate the crust/batter from the core. Another problem is the poor reproducibility of many fried products. A deep-fried model (DFM) was designed, making it possible to study crust formation and crust properties without the difficulties stated above. Two different <b>batter</b> <b>types</b> and three cores have been used to test the system. Crusts obtained from the DFM were evaluated on several physiochemical properties and compared with crusts found around commercial deep-fried products. Results show that crusts obtained with the DFM system are comparable to crusts of commercial products. The good reproducibility of the DFM crusts resulted in low variance in analytical results compared with commercial crusts. This high reproducibility, the versatility of the system, and the ease with which the system can be used offer clear benefits for many potential applications...|$|R

5000|$|Cooked on a rangetop, one frying method {{involves}} pouring a {{small amount}} of liquid batter made with boiling water and self-rising cornmeal (cornmeal with soda or some other chemical leavener added) into a skillet of hot oil, and allowing the crust to turn golden and crunchy while the center of the batter cooks into a crumbly, mushy bread. These small (3-4" [...] diameter) fried breads are soft and very rich. Sometimes, to ensure the consistency of the bread, {{a small amount}} of wheat flour is added to the <b>batter.</b> This <b>type</b> of cornbread is often known as [...] "hot water" [...] or [...] "scald meal" [...] cornbread and is unique to the American South.|$|R
5000|$|His type of {{pitching}} {{is rarely}} seen in Australia. He maintains great speed throughout {{a game of}} any length—this alone is an achievement, and his curves are definite breaks, not just round house deliveries. Some of his faster deliveries really jump as they reach the <b>batter.</b> This <b>type</b> of ball can get its hop only from exceptional speed. With a fast delivery he can swerve either way, or make the ball dip suddenly. His control is exceptionally good, and his catcher knows that whenever he signals knee-high, shoulder-high, inside or outside, curve or speed ball—Puckett will deliver it unerringly. Therein lies his unusual quality as a pitcher. - Albany Advertiser, 6 December 1937 ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{summary of}} 20 {{well-documented}} geosynthetic wall case histories rep-resenting {{a total of}} 35 analysis conditions is presented. These case histories cover {{a wide variety of}} wall heights, surcharge loading, foundation conditions, facing <b>types</b> and <b>batter,</b> reinforcement <b>types</b> and stiffness, and reinforcement spacing. All of the production walls, including some that have been in service for 25 years, have performed well with low reinforcement strains and minimal deflections. Some of the walls were research structures that, although purposely underdesigned, could not be taken to failure, dem-onstrating that the internal stability design of geosynthetic walls in North America is con-servative. Each of the walls was characterized globally with respect to internal level of safety, or resistance to demand ratio. Even when using nonconservative estimates of soil property values and perfect matching of the reinforcement strength to demand, the Sim-plified Method resulted in approximately 1. 5 to 4 times as much geosynthetic reinforce-ment as that needed to achieve acceptable performance based on actual long-term performance of many of the wall case histories. Based on the analyses presented here, {{there is a need to}} re-evaluate the current North American approach to design of geosyn...|$|R
40|$|IB²MAC - 16 th International Brick and Block Masonry Conference, Padoue, ITALIE, 26 -/ 06 / 2016 - 30 / 06 / 2016 Drystone is an ancient, vernacular {{technique}} of construction consisting in interlocking rough or cut pieces of stones together, without mortar. This technique was extensively {{used in the}} XIXth and early XXth centuries in Europe for agriculture and development of transport networks. Although widespread, drystone structures remain largely unknown, and consequently, there are relatively few new constructions or even reconstructions of ancient structures in drystone. Over the past two decades, research studies in France and in the UK have been dedicated {{to a better understanding}} of the behaviour of drystone retaining walls. These studies have enabled the redaction of a good practice guide in 2008, including a first series of cross curves of stability. Ongoing on this project, the present work deals with the updating of the cross curves, based on recent research developments. The cross curves presented here rely on plain strain yield design modelling, enhanced with the information collected through full-scale experimental campaigns. The charts provide the minimum base thickness of the wall, given its height, its <b>batter,</b> the <b>type</b> of stones composing the wall, and the nature of the backfill. Cross curves of stability are intended to be incorporated into professional standards. The establishment of standards dedicated to drystone retaining walls should contribute to ensure a simple but reliable design, and thus support reconstructions and new constructions in drystone and enable the profession to develop...|$|R
40|$|A model product, {{non-reactive}} {{in terms}} of Maillard and caramelization reactions, and with a structure and manufacturing process imitative of a sponge cake, was developed. A rational formulation design was used to identify the functional properties of the ingredients at {{each step of the}} process. Reactive ingredients (i. e. eggs, sucrose and flour proteins) were replaced by cellulose derivatives (hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and methylcellulose) to provide the main functionalities of the ingredients removed (foaming, thickening and gelling). Different properties of a real sponge cake were selected as targets to be reproduced in the model product: apparent viscosity, batter density before baking and homogeneity of the crumb cellular structure after baking. The concentrations of cellulose derivatives were determined to reach 1. 4 Pa s at 270 s(- 1), the mixing time was selected in order to incorporate 56 % (w/w) of air in the <b>batter,</b> and the <b>types</b> of cellulose derivatives were chosen to obtain homogeneous cellular structures. The use of HPMC alone led to cellular structures containing chimneys. The addition of a certain proportion of MC was necessary to obtain model cakes with homogeneous and fine crumb cellular structures. The sponge cake density was correlated with the HPMC and MC concentrations and ratios, both being linked to the ability of the batter to trap bubbles and prevent coalescence during baking. A colorimetric analysis of the crust confirmed the non-reactivity of the product during baking. The resulting product {{could be used as a}} realistic sponge-cake type matrix to study the reactions occurring throughout the processes...|$|R
40|$|Batters {{are highly}} complex systems with wide ranging {{ingredients}} including flours, water, flavorings, and spices. Interactions between the ingredients determine {{the performance of}} batters and the final quality of coated products. Addition of hydrocolloids into <b>batters</b> of different <b>types</b> of flour provides special effects on batter performance. The functionalities of hydrocolloids-flour mixtures {{in terms of the}} thermal and rheological properties of the resulting batter systems were investigated in this study. The rheological properties of the batter were determined using a strain/stress control rheometer. A steady state method was used to measure the viscosity {{as a function of the}} shear rate varying from 0. 5 to 150 s- 1 at 15 °C. The resulting data was then fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley Model. The viscoelastic properties were monitored as a function of temperature and were determined using a dynamic oscillatory test. Two different temperature profiles were used to simulate cooking and storage processes. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine thermal properties (namely glass transition temperature, gelatinization temperature, ice melting temperature, and enthalpy) and to describe the phase transitions that occur during heating and cooling processes. The rheological and thermal properties varied for different types of flours and their combination ratios, as well as different types of hydrocolloids at different concentrations. The replacement of corn flour greatly altered the viscosity and viscoelastic properties of wheat based and rice based batter systems. Using 100 % corn flour based batter showed highest yield stress, whereas 100 % rice flour based batter did not show any yield stress. Higher temperatures and longer times were required to gelatinize starch at the higher levels of rice flour for each batter system flour mix combination. The various combination ratios of the flours apparently did not significant influence the gelatinization temperatures of the batter systems. However they significantly influence the total enthalpies (DeltaHG) of the various samples. Wheat flour based batters showed the lowest glass transition temperatures. Thermal properties of wheat-based batters were influenced by the replacement of wheat with rice or corn flours. Corn flour based batters required considerably more energy for gelatinization during the cooking process. Hydrocolloids lowered flow behavior index (n) and increased the consistency index (k) of all batters. The gums also changed the onset temperature of structure development and the storage and loss moduli of the batter systems. Hydrocolloids greatly influenced the thermal properties of batter systems. The gums shifted gelatinization temperature and depressed glass transition temperature of resulting batter systems. Further, MC increased the melting temperature (Tm) for the test batter systems as compared with the values for the control system without methylcellulose (MC). Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) did not show statistically significant effects on the total enthalpies of ice melting for all samples. However, MC and CMC showed more pronounced effects on rice, corn, and their combined flour based batters than it did on wheat flour based batters. However, this characteristic does not show in batter systems containing xanthan gum...|$|R
