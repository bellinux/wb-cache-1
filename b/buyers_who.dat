5|$|In 1996, Lexus debuted {{its first}} sport utility vehicle, the LX 450, {{followed}} by the third generation ES 300 sedan. The marque's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995. Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans in 1998. The RX crossover targeted suburban <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX's off-road capability. It was particularly successful, eventually becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES sedan. The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous country when it launched sales in Brazil. In 1999, Lexus recorded its 1 millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market and was ranked the top-selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall.|$|E

25|$|These {{cars were}} {{considerably}} more economical {{than the traditional}} saloons they were replacing, and attracted <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> traditionally bought larger vehicles. Some 15years after the oil crisis, hatchbacks dominated most European small and medium car markets, and had gained a substantial share of the large family car market.|$|E

25|$|The {{first five}} blocks of housing units were {{completed}} by 1985. There were initial {{fears of a}} poor demand for houses in Bishan as they had bad fengshui since they were built on a former cemetery. However, the first batch of houses were all snapped out during their launch to <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> were attracted by the central location of Bishan.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} and hence small market for large format {{consoles}} led to pioneers such as Automated Processes Inc (API), {{to experiment with}} modular equipment design. API's product offering of single items in the signal chain such as pre-amps, equalisers and compressors all based around a flexible central power supply proved popular with <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> wanted very high quality but {{could not afford to}} buy a minimum of 24 channels at once.|$|E
25|$|Charlie Babbitt is in {{the middle}} of {{importing}} four Lamborghinis to Los Angeles for resale.

25|$|Toye and {{his wife}} were indicted for fraud in February 2010 in a {{conspiracy}} to sell counterfeit Hunter paintings with New Orleans antique dealer Robert E. Lucky, Jr. Prosecutors said Toye created phony bills of sale, and appraisals to establish the provenance he {{and his wife}} claimed, that she had bought the paintings from Hunter in the 1960s and 1970s. Some paintings, returned to Lucky by <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> suspected they were fakes, were resold to other buyers.|$|E
25|$|Subscription publishing: {{pioneered by}} the English {{in the early}} 17th century. A {{prospectus}} for a publication was drawn up by a publisher to raise funding. The prospectus was given to potential <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> {{signed up for a}} copy. If there were not enough subscriptions the publication did not go ahead. Lists of subscribers were included in the books as endorsements. If enough people subscribed, there might be a reprint. Some authors used subscription publication to bypass the publisher entirely.|$|E
25|$|The strong {{participation}} by AMC in Trans-Am and drag racing served to enhance its image, and notable was that its motorsports efforts were achieved {{on a shoestring}} budget with the automaker racking up a respectable number of points against its giant competitors. For example, with an estimated 4.5million participants and 6million spectators, drag racing was the fastest growing segment of motorsport in the U.S. The marketing strategy was to appeal to <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> otherwise would not give AMC a second glance.|$|E

25|$|This Cyclops was {{the second}} of four Alfred Holt ships to bear the name. The first was a two-masted sail and {{steamship}} built in 1880, transferred in 1894 to Alfred Holt's Dutch joint venture Nederlandsche Stoomvaart Maatschappij Oceaan and sold in 1902 to Uruguayan <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> renamed her Iberia. The third was a motor ship built in 1948, renamed Automedon in 1975 and scrapped in 1977. The fourth was built in 1975, sold to Greek buyers in 1983 and renamed Procyon.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessors, the 510 Bluebird {{line was}} {{imported}} into New Zealand, {{this time as}} a single 1.6-litre, four-speed manual Deluxe model, assembled from CKD kits by Campbell Industries (later Toyota New Zealand Thames assembly plant). Local content included glass, radiator, upholstery, carpet, paint, wiring and numerous other items. A few automatic and twin carburettor SSS versions were imported built-up from Japan, primarily for <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> had access to funds overseas and could utilise the country's 'no remittance' new car purchase scheme to avoid lengthy waiting lists.|$|E
25|$|The story Antoine tells {{compresses}} {{several years}} of horrific and lurid events into about 5,500 words. The instigating action is the sale at auction of a beautiful Senegalese woman, Laïsa. In a display of his superior wealth, a 22-year-old planter named Alfred outbids other potential <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> covet her beauty. Alfred compels Laïsa to share his bed, but when he fails to deprive her of her pride and self-containment, he grows bored and sends her to {{live in one of}} the poorest cabins on the plantation. There she gives birth to his child, whom he never acknowledges.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade after 2000, a housing crisis began in Auckland with the market not being able to sustain the demand for {{affordable}} homes. The Housing Accords and Special Housing Areas Act 2013 mandated that a minimum of 10 per cent of new builds in certain housing areas be subsidized to make them affordable for <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> had incomes on par with the national average. In a new subdivision at Hobsonville Point, 20 per cent of new homes were reduced to below $550,000. Some of the demand for new housing at this time was attributed to the 43,000 people who moved into Auckland between June 2014 and June 2015.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the 1977 model year that demand {{exceeded}} production capacity for the Oldsmobile V8, {{and as a result}} Oldsmobile began equipping most full size Delta 88 models (those with Federal emissions specifications) with the Chevrolet 350 engine instead. Although it was widely debated whether there was a difference in quality or performance between the two engines, there was no question that the engines were different from one another. Many customers were loyal Oldsmobile <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> specifically wanted the Rocket V8, and did not discover that their vehicle had the Chevrolet engine until they performed maintenance and discovered that purchased parts did not fit. This became a public relations nightmare for GM.|$|E
25|$|Finley nearly {{sold the}} team to <b>buyers</b> <b>who</b> would have moved them to Mile High Stadium in Denver for the 1978 season and the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans for 1979. Though the American League owners {{appeared}} to favor the Denver deal, it fell through when the city of Oakland and Alameda County refused to release the A's from their lease. At the time, the Oakland Raiders were threatening to move to Los Angeles, and city and county officials were not willing to lose Oakland's status as a big-league city in its own right. Not surprisingly, only 306,763 paying customers showed up to watch the A's in 1979, the team's worst attendance since leaving Philadelphia.|$|E
50|$|Cases of {{intentional}} torts or breaches of {{fiduciary duty}} often allow for claims of unjust enrichment, {{as well as}} cases of statutory torts and breaches of contract. A plaintiff can even have a claim in unjust enrichment {{when there is no}} other substantive claim. The Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") entitles a <b>buyer</b> <b>who</b> defaults restitution of the buyer's deposit to the extent it exceeds reasonable liquidated damages or actual damages. If the contract does not have a liquidated damages clause, the UCC provides a statutory sum: 20% of the price or $500, whichever is less, and the <b>buyer</b> <b>who</b> defaulted is entitled to restitution of any excess.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 the tower, {{described}} as needing $2.3 million of repairs, was listed for auction by the General Services Administration. It sold in October that year for $20,000, {{to a private}} <b>buyer</b> <b>who</b> planned to restore it.|$|R
