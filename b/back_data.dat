25|$|Mars 1 (1962 Beta Nu 1), an {{automatic}} interplanetary spacecraft launched to Mars on November 1, 1962, {{was the first}} probe of the Soviet Mars probe program to achieve interplanetary orbit. Mars 1 was intended to fly by the planet {{at a distance of}} about 11,000km and take images of the surface as well as send <b>back</b> <b>data</b> on cosmic radiation, micrometeoroid impacts and Mars' magnetic field, radiation environment, atmospheric structure, and possible organic compounds. Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at two-day intervals and later at 5 day intervals, from which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected. On 21 March 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106,760,000km from Earth, on its way to Mars, communications ceased due to failure of its antenna orientation system.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the river}} basin water data {{available}} from the year 1934 to 1971 (44 years <b>back</b> <b>data),</b> the tribunal estimated the average water yield in the total river basin as 767 TMC which corresponds to 47% dependability. The live storage capacity available in the river basin is nearly 310 TMC which is 40.5% of the average yield. The water used in the Cauvery delta in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry is nearly 280 TMC which is the tail end water use in the river basin and its regenerated water either goes to sea or outside the Cauvery basin. The total dissolved salt load generated in the basin is nearly 3.5 million metric tons per year. The estimated salinity or total dissolved salts (TDS) for the water available in Cauvery delta is 441 ppm which {{is close to the}} safe maximum permissible 500 ppm. There is no limit imposed by the tribunal for the ground water use in the river basin. The tribunal has also permitted the basin states to use all the excess water available in above normal water years. Moreover, the river basin population has reached 40 million in the year 2015 and the increasing per capita inorganic salts used/consumed in industrial, agriculture and residential sectors are enhancing the salt export requirements. When adequate salt export from the river basin is not taking place to the sea by forcing Cauvery delta to face water shortage, the water quality (salinity, pH, alkalinity, sodicity, etc.) available for Cauvery delta would deteriorate beyond the permissible limits impeding its sustainable productivity and its aquatic ecosystem conservation. Ultimately salt export criteria is the limitation for the water resources development in a river basin.|$|E

Mars 4 flew by the planet at a range of 2200km returning one swath of pictures and radio occultation data, which constituted the first detection of the nightside ionosphere on Mars.

2500|$|In November 2002, {{after the}} {{completion}} of the mission's only encounter with Jupiter's moon Amalthea, problems with playback of the tape recorder again plagued Galileo. About 10 minutes after the closest approach of the Amalthea flyby, Galileo stopped collecting data, shut down all of its instruments, and went into safe mode, apparently as a result of exposure to Jupiter's intense radiation environment. Though most of the Amalthea data was already written to tape, {{it was found that the}} recorder refused to respond to commands telling it to play <b>back</b> <b>data.</b> After weeks of troubleshooting of an identical flight spare of the recorder on the ground, it was determined that the cause of the malfunction was a reduction of light output in three infrared Optek OP133 light-emitting diodes located in the drive electronics of the recorder's motor encoder wheel. The GaAs LEDs had been particularly sensitive to proton-irradiation-induced atomic lattice displacement defects, which greatly decreased their effective light output and caused the drive motor's electronics to falsely believe the motor encoder wheel was incorrectly positioned. Galileo flight team then began a series of [...] "annealing" [...] sessions, where current was passed through the LEDs for hours at a time to heat them to a point where some of the crystalline lattice defects would be shifted back into place, thus increasing the LED's light output. After about 100 hours of annealing and playback cycles, the recorder was able to operate for up to an hour at a time. After many subsequent playback and cooling cycles, the complete transmission back to Earth of all recorded Amalthea flyby data was successful.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to improve the accuracy and reliability of the spinal midline reconstructions in scoliosis from <b>back</b> shape <b>data.</b> Design. An active shape model which covers the variety of scoliotic curves with a minimum of adjustable parameters is designed for the reconstruction of the spinal midline based on rasterstereographic back surface measurements. BACKGROUND. To reduce the number of X-rays needed for patients with a scoliosis, an automatic method was developed for the reconstruction of spinal deformities from <b>back</b> shape <b>data.</b> METHODS. 264 digital X-rays of 264 patients with scoliosis were used as a training set. By examining the statistics of the vertebral body centres a point distribution model was derived. The model is used as a basis to reconstruct the spinal midline from <b>back</b> shape <b>data</b> (active shape model). RESULTS. 478 rasterstereographs of 114 scoliotic patients have been evaluated with this new procedure and with an existing procedure. Both procedures deliver a three-dimensional curve of the spinal midline. The frontal projections of these spinal midlines are compared with the vertebral centres of the corresponding 478 X-rays. The active shape model improved the results as compared to the existing procedure from sigma(x) = 3. 4 mm to sigma(x) = 3. 0 mm. CONCLUSION. The use of the active shape model improves the overall accuracy of the spinal midline reconstructions in scoliosis from <b>back</b> shape <b>data.</b> RELEVANCE. Improvements to the accuracy and the reliability of the three-dimensional spinal reconstruction based on <b>back</b> shape <b>data,</b> can lead to an additional reduction of X-rays for patients with a scoliosis. status: publishe...|$|R
