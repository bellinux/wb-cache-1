For slender <b>bar</b> <b>turning</b> <b>operations,</b> dimensional deviation {{is one of the}} most important product quality characteristics due to the low stiffness of part. In this study, radial basis function neural network is employed to investigate dimensional errors in slender <b>bar</b> <b>turning.</b> The relationship between cutting parameters and dimensional errors is firstly described by the proposed model. Simulation is provided to investigate the effects of cutting parameters on dimensional errors. Further, real-time predictive model based on radial basis function neural network is developed to perform the dimensional error monitoring during slender <b>bar</b> <b>turning</b> process. Experiments verify that the proposed in-process predictive system has the ability to monitor efficiently dimensional errors within the range that they have been trained...|$|R

The <b>turning</b> <b>operation</b> is one kind of metal cutting that exhibits vibration related problems. Today the industry aims at smaller tolerances in surface finish.

As it is a basic operation for various industries it is very essential to optimize the various parameters affecting <b>turning</b> <b>operation</b> for the optimum operating condition. <b>Turning</b> <b>operation</b> is affected by both cutting parameters and geometrical parameters. The parameter influence most are cutting velocity, depth of cut, feed rate, geometry of cutting tool like principle cutting edge angle,rake angle, nose radius etc. In order to control surface roughness and cutting force acting on material during <b>turning</b> <b>operation</b> it is very necessary to control these parameters as the product with desired attributes are function of these parameter. The objective of the project is obtain the optimum values of different cutting parameter like cutting speed, depth of cut, feed rate and principle cutting edge angle for the minimum cutting force and surface roughness.
