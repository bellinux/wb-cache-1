25|$|I’m {{well aware}} that I {{sometimes}} “shoot from the hip” and speak on things about which I know very little. In this present situation, I published my personal opinions about drug addiction without knowing very much about the neuroscience behind addiction, or the addiction recovery field. Not only did I say some deeply regrettable and insensitive things, but as I’ve learned more about the questions and issues at hand, I accept that I have been wrongheaded {{on a number of}} topics related to these issues. Even at 84, I’m still learning. Please <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> folks.|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think of myself as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know if you like it raw.|$|E
60|$|<b>Bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> if I write {{like this}} for ever so many pages; <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> it is such easy writing, and only thus can I hope to make you {{understand}} my subsequent and slightly peculiar conduct.|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{words to}} thank you for your kindness," [...] he answered. [...] "No brother could have <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> more affectionately, or helped me more patiently than you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh I hope it's lasting!" [...] Miss Barrace said. [...] "But he only, at the best, <b>bears</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> He doesn't understand--not {{one little}} scrap. He's delightful. He's wonderful," [...] she repeated.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank my supervisor, Geraint Evans, for giving me a sense of clarity when it was most needed (and for {{accepting}} the abundance of emails); my mom and dad for their priceless support; Amy and Ula; Alex and Nicky; and last but not least my deepest gratitude to Mads for having <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas!" [...] exclaimed the prince, [...] "I can {{no longer}} control my passion. My life, not my {{happiness}} merely, depends upon Iduna becoming mine. <b>Bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> my beloved, <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me!</b> Were you Nicæus, you too would need forgiveness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It means this,--that {{you must}} <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> if I am more anxious as to your future career than another sister might be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Pendy, Mr. Pendy, I {{was very}} naughty! I didn't mean it. Oh, will you <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> again, though I don't deserve it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{hesitated a}} moment; then replied, slowly: [...] "She is. She's {{as fine as}} anny queen!" [...] Then after another pause, added: [...] "And the more shame to me, being what I am! She's a good girl, miss, true as steel. Never a word of {{complaint}} or a frown. She <b>bears</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> like an angel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{for twenty}} golden guineas, Andrew, would I face Mistress Janet. She has <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> well, though I know {{in her heart}} she disapproves of me altogether; but after this scrape into which I have got the boy I daren't face her. She might not say much, but to eat with her eye upon me would choke me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stay," [...] in a convulsed voice, and rocking himself, [...] "stay, stay! You {{have made}} a better man of <b>me.</b> You have <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> like a good Christian, and talked to me like one, and all that is enough without making me a present of these boxes. Here is the money. I won't take nay. There, there; and may Almighty {{goodness}} go with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{then this}} is not my natural manner?' she rejoined. 'Now you must really <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> because I ask for information. We never know ourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, father! Oh, my good gentle father, <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> if I am wicked!" [...] {{said the}} Blind Girl. [...] "This {{is not the}} sorrow that so weighs me down!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see how it}} is with me, Miles--feeble as an infant, {{and almost}} as troublesome. You must <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> for you will be my nurse. One promise I must have, dearest, before we leave this room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A thorough, {{determined}} {{dislike of}} me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute {{in some measure}} to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Elinor," [...] she cried, [...] "you {{have made}} me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who have <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in all my misery, who have seemed to be only {{suffering}} for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I {{have been trying to}} do it away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} leading a false life; I {{have not been}} fit to write to you before to-day. Now, when I am doing what I can to atone to those whom I have injured--now, when I repent with my whole heart--may I ask leave {{to return to the}} friend who has <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> and helped me through many miserable years? Oh, madam, do not cast me off! I have no one to turn to but you.|$|R
60|$|Now I must pause at this point, and beg {{the reader}} to <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> while I relate {{a few things that}} may appear at first sight overdrawn. Let {{judgment}} be suspended until all has been told.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, {{with a hand}} raised restrainingly, [...] "you must {{hear what}} I have to say, and try to <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> It is a little difficult, Gregory, {{but it must be}} said at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There!' he cried, despairingly. 'Now, I {{seem to have}} reproached you, {{instead of}} {{revealing}} to you the state of my own mind! <b>Bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I am always wrong {{when you are in}} question. It is my doom.' ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{turned away}} her head, {{and he went}} nearer her. [...] "There was always {{something}} of the mother in your love, Grizel; but for that you would never have <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> so long. A mother, they say, can never quite forget her boy--oh, Grizel, is it true? I am the prodigal come back. Grizel, beloved, I have sinned and I am unworthy, but I am still your boy, and I have come back. Am I to be sent away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Upon a leaf the Glow-worm did I lay, [...] To <b>bear</b> it <b>with</b> <b>me</b> {{through the}} stormy night: [...] 10 [...] And, as before, it shone without dismay; [...] Albeit putting forth a fainter light.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do him no wrong," [...] {{interrupted}} Zenobia, turning haughtily upon me. [...] "Presume not {{to estimate}} {{a man like}} Hollingsworth. It was my fault, all along, and none of his. I see it now! He never sought me. Why should he seek me? What had I to offer him? A miserable, bruised, and battered heart, spoilt long before he met me. A life, too, hopelessly entangled with a villain's! He did well to cast me off. God be praised, he did it! And yet, had he trusted <b>me,</b> and <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> a little longer, I would have saved him all this trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, {{there are}} other confidences which have to be {{respected}} in like wise. <b>Bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> dear, till I have told you all, and I am right sure that you will agree with me. I ask it, father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I did I {{should not}} love thee, Noll. But {{in such an}} hour I need your own assurance. Will you not be generous and <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> {{strengthen}} me to withstand anything that may be said hereafter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{why we are}} friends, Silas; and it's {{useless to}} quarrel with you now that I'm on my last legs. A few days more will end me, I'm positive; so <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> a little longer, my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bear me, good oceans, to some isle [...] Where I {{may never}} fear [...] The snake alurk in woman's smile, [...] The tiger in her tear. [...] Yet <b>bear</b> not <b>with</b> <b>me</b> her, O deeps, [...] Who never smiles and never weeps.|$|R
60|$|At {{this the}} last of my anger oozed all out of me; and I found myself only sick, and sorry, and blank, and {{wondering}} at myself. I would have given the world to take back what I had said; but a word once spoken, who can recapture it? I minded me of all Alan's kindness and courage in the past, how he had helped and cheered and <b>borne</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> in our evil days; and then recalled my own insults, and saw that I had lost for ever that doughty friend. At the same time, the sickness that hung upon me seemed to redouble, and the pang in my side was like a sword for sharpness. I thought I must have swooned where I stood.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' said Albinia, kindly; 'I do {{not expect}} that, my dear. I don't ask for {{any more than you}} can freely give, dear child. You must <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> having <b>me</b> in that place, and we will try and help each other to make your papa comfortable; and, Lucy, you will forgive me, if I am impetuous, and make mistakes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He paused awhile {{before he}} {{answered}} her. [...] "No; I do not blame you. I suppose I must blame {{no one but}} myself. But you should <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me.</b> I was so happy, and now I am so wretched." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All human resolution, Eleanor," [...] he said solemnly, [...] "has its limits. MY {{limits are}} inscribed on that Document. I cannot part with my white mice. <b>Bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me,</b> my angel, and remove {{them to their}} {{travelling}} cage upstairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|She held forth her hand, which Iskander took and involuntarily pressed. [...] "Noble lady," [...] he said, [...] "my {{skill is}} a mere pretence to enter these walls. The only talisman I <b>bear</b> <b>with</b> <b>me</b> is a message from your friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, <b>bear</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> thee, {{smoothly}} <b>borne,</b> [...] Dip forward under starry light, [...] And move me to {{my marriage}} morn, [...] And round again to-- ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah, <b>bear</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> thee, {{smoothly}} [1] borne, [...] Dip forward under starry light, [...] And move {{me to my}} marriage-morn, [...] And round {{again to}} happy night.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' she continued, 'it is {{the dead}} hand of my dead child, and I <b>bear</b> it <b>with</b> <b>me</b> that I may never forget, never for one short hour, that I live that I may see Wambe die, and be avenged. Will you bear it, my father, that your {{daughter}} and your daughter's child should be so treated by a Matuku? Will ye bear it, men of my own people?' ...|$|R
