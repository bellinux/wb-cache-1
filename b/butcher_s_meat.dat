40|$|Preliminary Results From Cycle V of The Cattle Germplasm Evaluation Program At The Roman L.

Diverse breeds are required to exploit heterosis and complementarity through crossbreeding and new composite breeds to match genetic potential with diverse markets, feed resources and climates. Beef producers are under increasing pressure to reduce fat while maintaining or improving tenderness and palatability of products. No single breed excels in all traits of importance to beef production. Previous results have shown that Bos indicus X Bos taurus (e. g., Brahman, Sahiwal and Nellore sired F 1 cows out of Hereford and Angus dams) crosses were exceptionally productive and efficient cows, especially in a subtropical environment(e. g., Florida versus Nebraska). However, as the proportion Bos indicus increased, the advantages of Bos indicus crosses were tempered by older age at puberty and reduced meat tenderness.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} domestic and foreign macroeconomic variables on U. <b>S.</b> <b>meat</b> exports, including beef, pork, turkey, and chicken, {{in the context of}} an open economy.

The implication is that the U. S. can increase its meat exports more effectively by expending efforts on international macroeconomic policy coordination rather than on domestic sectoral poIicy. The results also suggest that macroeconomic models of the agricultural sector should include foreign variables and should not be limited only to domestic ones. With ever-expanding international trade, the na-tional economies of the world and their related sectors have become closely intertwined. U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{influence}} of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on the change in consumer preference for U. <b>S.</b> <b>meat</b> and meat products in Mexico and to provide empirical estimates of the extent of sensitivity of meat price change to change in quantity demand. The analyses used an Inverse Almost Ideal Demand System (IAIDS) model to address the study objectives due to its appropriateness in modeling the level of utility for commodities with fixed or exogenously determined short run supply. The study findings show that Mexico’s participation in NAFTA could have indirectly effected a structural change in demand for imported meat from the U.

Also, while Mexican demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>meat</b> is inflexible, price response to changes in the quantity of imported U. S. poultry is much sensitive compared to pork and beef...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that today about 70 percent of the calves narketed from beef cattle herds in the U. S. are crossbred and hat between 50 and 60 percent of the cows are crossbred. This represents a major shift to crossbreeding from the straight-breeding programs which prevailed in the 19502 ̆ 7 s and early 19602 ̆ 7 s. This trend has been influenced by research demonstrating the favorable effects of heterosis and other advantages of crossbreeding. Also, increased use of feed grains in growing-finishing diets caused fatter carcasses contributing to increased consumer demand for leaner beef, which stimulated interest in breeds with greater potential for lean tissue growth and less fat. As a result, {{a large number of}} breeds, introduced from Europe via quarantine facilities in Canada, became available to North American beef producers. Interest in the newly Introduced breeds and in other breeds already available coincided with the establishment and development of the Roman L. Hruska U. <b>S.</b> <b>Meat</b> Animal Research Center (U. <b>S.</b> <b>Meat</b> Animal Research Center) in the late 19602 ̆ 7 s.

Phase II construction, consisting of the Meats Research Laboratory and the Biological Engineering Building, was completed in October 1977 and provides a physical plant for 25 scientists and about 60 support personnel. Phase III construction will provide for an Animal Health Systems Research Laboratory and a Veterinary Service- Training Facility. Both buildings are scheduled for completion in August 1989 and will accommodate 15 professional and 25 subprofessional employees. Approximately 50 percent of the research program is devoted to beef cattle, 30 percent to swine, and 20 percent to sheep. Current research program objectives require breeding-age female populations of approximately 7, 250 cattle (18 breeds), 4, 250 sheep (10 breeds), and 600 swine litters (4 lines) to carry out the various experiments. The research program at the Center is organized on a multidisciplinary basis and is directed toward providing new technology for the U.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} model of consumer response to publicized food safety information on meat demand is developed with an empirical application to U. <b>S.</b> <b>meat</b> consumption. Evidence is {{found for the}} existence of pre-committed levels of consumption, seasonal factors, time trends, and contemporaneous own- and cross-commodity food safety concerns. The average demand response to food safety concerns is small, especially in comparison to price effects, and to previous estimates of health related issues.
