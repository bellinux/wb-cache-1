5000|$|The bridge {{belonged to}} the London Brighton and South Coast Railway and had been reconstructed in 1859. The Board of Trade {{investigation}} {{was carried out by}} General Hutchinson, who had investigated a similar bridge failure at Carlisle in 1875. He found that the single girder that cracked was seriously flawed with a very large hidden casting defect in the flange and web. Even if perfect, the girder design did not meet current Board of Trade requirements for safety margins on cast-iron girder underbridges, and this was already known from a previous accident.The attention of the Brighton Company was drawn by the Board of Trade to this deficiency of strength after ... the accident on this bridge in December 1876 when two identical girders at {{a different part of the}} same bridge were broken by an engine getting off the rails, and they were then recommended to substitute stronger girders in their place, a recommendation to which unfortunately no attention was paid, or the present serious accident would have been prevented; the Brighton Company is therefore, in my opinion, deserving of much blame for having omitted to substitute stronger girders for the existing ones after attention had been thus specially directed to the weakness of the latterA cast-iron rail <b>bridge</b> <b>girder</b> had fractured under a passing train at Inverythan in Scotland in 1882, with five passengers killed and many more injured. The Board of Trade investigation report on the Inverythan accident had commented on the problem of latent defects, but had concentrated attention in the first instance on composite girders, bolted together mid-span, and those of over 25 ft span. The Portland Road bridge did not use composite girders, and its span was 25 ft. (The failed girder in the Carlisle incident was non-composite, with a 25-ft span and had a major hidden casting defect. It had been built before the 1847 Dee bridge disaster and the consequent specification by the Board of Trade of required wide safety margins on cast-iron structures; even if perfect it would have not have met them. The bridge had been rebuilt with wrought-iron girders and the failure had not triggered any wider survey of cast-iron bridges.) ...|$|E

40|$|Self-consolidating {{concrete}} (SCC) is {{a highly}} workable concrete that flows through densely reinforced or complex structural elements under its own weight. The benefits of using SCC include: a) Reducing labor costs by {{eliminating the need for}} mechanical vibration, b) Improving constructability, c) Providing a virtually flawless finish, d) Providing uniform and homogenous concrete, and e) Easily filling a complex shape formwork. Even though SCC is comparable to conventional concrete in terms of strength, the comparability of its bond to steel is less well-defined. This disparity of knowledge becomes more critical when using SCC in prestressed members due to the impact that bond strength has on the transfer and development lengths of prestressing tendons. The increasing interest among Illinois precasters in using SCC in <b>bridge</b> <b>girders</b> has motivated the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and the Illinois Center for Transportation (ICT) to sponsor this synthesis study, which reviews and combines information from literature discussing the impact of using SCC on the transfer and development lengths of prestressing tendons in AASHTO <b>bridge</b> <b>girders.</b> The primary objectives of this study include: (1) Utilizing the results of previous research to evaluate the effect of using SCC on the transfer and development lengths of prestressing tendons and evaluate how SCC compares with conventional concrete, (2) Investigating the feasibility of using SCC in AASHTO <b>bridge</b> <b>girders</b> without the need for changing current design provisions recommended by the ACI and AASHTO, and (3) Providing IDOT with recommendations regarding the application of SCC in prestressed <b>bridge</b> <b>girders.</b> 17.

40|$|A new static-based {{method for}} damage {{detection}} of cable-stayed bridges using {{the changes in}} cable forces is presented in this paper. In recognizing the fact that damage incurring in <b>bridge</b> <b>girders</b> will cause a redistribution of forces in stay cables, the proposed method uses the measured changes in cable forces to detect the damage in <b>bridge</b> <b>girders.</b> In this method, the damage identification is formulated as an optimization problem in which the cable force error between measurement results and analytical model predictions is minimized. The sensitivities of cable forces {{with respect to the}} structural parameters of <b>bridge</b> <b>girders</b> for the linear and geometrically nonlinear bridge structures are obtained by using the direct differentiation method and the finite difference method, respectively, and are used to solve the optimization problem. Regularization technique is used to alleviate ill-conditioning in the solution course of the optimization problem. The validity of the method is illustrated by numerical studies of damage detection of the cable-stayed Sutong Bridge with a main span of 1, 088 m. The effect of measurement noises and the number of measured cable forces on the accuracy of damage quantification is investigated. The proposed method correctly identifies the damage locations and damage magnitudes in <b>bridge</b> <b>girders</b> when using noise-free cable forces. It is also shown that structural damage can be quantified with acceptable accuracy in the case of low-level measurement noises and the damaged members being well spaced, and the identification accuracy is greatly improved when the forces in the cables connected to the damaged members are available for damage quantification.
