5000|$|Harold Saxton Burr (April 18, 1889 [...] - [...] February 17, 1973) was E. K. Hunt Professor of Anatomy at Yale University School of Medicine and {{researcher}} into <b>bio-electrics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Burr's {{research}} {{contributed to}} the electrical detection of cancer cells, experimental embryology, neuroanatomy, and the regeneration {{and development of the}} nervous system. His studies of the <b>bio-electrics</b> of ovulation and menstruation eventually led to the marketing of fertility-indicating devices. His late studies of the electrodynamics of trees, carried out over decades, suggested entrainment to diurnal, lunar and annual cycles. He also contributed a few papers on the history and sociology of his field.|$|E
5000|$|Kraus {{conducted}} {{research on the}} relationship of the nervous system's functional nature with mechanistic concepts. He demonstrated that living matter contained colloids and mineral salts, that when dissolved in a solution are electrolytes. He postulated that a type of bio-electrical system is present within the body that acted like a relay mechanism storing electrical charge (energy) and recharge (action). [...] He explained this proposition in the book [...] "Allgemeine und spezielle Pathologie der Person" [...] (General and special pathology of the individual). Kraus' theory on <b>bio-electrics</b> {{is considered to be a}} forerunner to psychologist Wilhelm Reich's work with biophysics and body psychotherapy (vegetotherapy).|$|E
