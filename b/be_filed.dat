5|$|California has {{experienced}} less possessory land claim litigation than other states. This is primarily {{the result of}} the Land Claims Act of 1851 (following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that required all claims deriving from the Spanish and Mexican governments to <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> within two years. Three U.S. Supreme Court decisions and one Ninth Circuit ruling have held that the Land Claims Act applied to aboriginal title, and thus extinguished all aboriginal title in the state (as no tribes filed claims under the Act). Two Deputy Attorneys General of California have advocated this view.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} of direct tax revenue was individuals, who paid a poll tax and a tax on their land, {{construed}} as a tax on its produce or productive capacity. Supplemental forms could <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile. Tax obligations were determined by the census, which required each head of household {{to appear before the}} presiding official and provide a head count of his household, as well as an accounting of property he owned that was suitable for agriculture or habitation.|$|E

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> {{with respect to a}} trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may be allowed to go forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI. Although the main petition office is the Complaints Office, petitions are usually sent to other offices and institutions (such as the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, the National People's Congress and party leadership {{as high as the}} PSC) as well. Petitions may also <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> on the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work (which sends inspection teams throughout the country). In a case handled by former ODIS Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li Huiran, a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner, several offices of the CCDI and PSC members Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing.|$|E
5|$|If a {{mandatory}} order, prohibiting order or quashing order is sought, the applicant must follow the procedure {{set out in}} Order 53 of the Rules of Court. In general, there are two stages. At the first stage, an applicant must obtain leave {{to apply for the}} prerogative order. This requirement prevents unmeritorious applications from being taken against decision-makers by filtering out groundless cases at an early stage to prevent wastage of judicial time, and protects public bodies from harassment, intentional or otherwise. An application for such leave must be made by ex parte originating summons and must be supported by a statement setting out the name and description of the applicant, the relief sought and the grounds on which it is sought; and by an affidavit, to <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> when the application is made, verifying the facts relied on. In granting leave, the judge hearing the application for leave may impose such terms as to costs and as to security as he or she thinks fit.|$|E

5|$|In 1646, {{the council}} allowed the Barber Surgeons {{to build their}} hall {{just east of the}} site: this {{agreement}} was given on 15 March 1647. In 1648, the plot of land was leased to the barber surgeons on condition that they constructed their hall within two years and that part of the site was to be laid out as a garden for medicinal herbs. A second hall built in 1730 disappeared under the railway viaduct in the 1840s. The most aged claimants were preferred for placements at the Hospital and on 22 March 1779, the Mayor and common council of Newcastle ordered that several candidates produce certificates to prove their respective ages, to <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> in the town-clerk's office.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to U.S. Army {{regulations}} as well, {{no charges}} were ever filed against Stone {{nor did he}} stand trial. While he was in solitary confinement at Fort Lafayette, he could not exercise, and consequently Stone's health began to degrade. His physicians protested heavily to Stanton, who ordered him transferred to the military prison at Fort Hamilton. There Stone was allowed to exercise and his condition improved. He stayed at Fort Lafayette for fifty days, and would spend another 139 in Fort Hamilton. Stone was finally released without explanation or apology on August 16, 1862. The reason for his release was new legislation written by California Senator James A. McDougall. In a small addition to another bill, McDougall reiterated the Articles of War requirement that official charges <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> within eight days of arrest, but went on to include that any imprisoned officer must be given their trial within thirty days. McDougall also made it clear this legislation applied to those currently under arrest, which covered Stone's case. It passed the U.S. Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Lincoln on July 17, 1862. Stanton then waited the thirty days before releasing Stone.|$|E
25|$|Many {{contracts}} {{contain a}} forum selection clause setting out where disputes {{in relation to}} the contract should be litigated. The clause may be general, requiring that any case arising from the contract <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> within a specific state or country, or it may require that a case <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may require that a case <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> in the U.S. State of California, or it may require more specifically that the case <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Federal {{legislation}} yields to state-regulated standard times in many diverse situations. For example, it yields {{in setting the}} normal working times of Federal employees, the recognition of public holidays, etc. The Federal government also relies on local times for Federal elections, so that the polls in Western Australia close {{two or three hours}} after those in the eastern states. Also, documents to <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> in a Federal Court may <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> based on the local time. The effect of this is that {{if there had been a}} failure to file a legal document on time in an eastern State, that document can sometimes still <b>be</b> <b>filed</b> (within two hours) in Western Australia.|$|E
