5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule. Bruno Heim says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> the right to bear, cardinals who are not bishops do not use it. Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do display a cross.|$|E
5|$|In theses 67–80, Luther {{discusses}} {{further the}} problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the guilt of even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.|$|E
25|$|Many controversies {{have arisen}} over its {{treatment}} of Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. In some cases, <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> threatened to withhold communion to such politicians; in others, <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> urged politicians in this situation to refrain from receiving communion. In a few cases, such as the case of Mario Cuomo, the possibility of excommunication has been considered.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{figures in}} the Catholic hierarchy, {{including}} cardinals and <b>bishops,</b> <b>have</b> sometimes actively campaigned against same-sex marriage or have encouraged others to campaign against it, and have done likewise with regard to same-sex civil unions and adoption by same-sex couples, and other LGBT rights (including non-discrimination). Some Church leaders have opposed decriminalization of homosexual activity in certain countries, and stood against a proposed call by the United Nations for global decriminalization of homosexuality. However, in other countries, and again at the United Nations, the church has opposed criminalization - reflecting {{a wide range of}} opinions within the global church.|$|E
25|$|If {{it should}} be {{declared}} that contraception is not evil in itself, then we should have to concede frankly that the Holy Spirit {{had been on the}} side of the Protestant churches in 1930 (when the encyclical Casti Connubii was promulgated), in 1951 (Pius XII's address to the midwives), and in 1958 (the address delivered before the Society of Hematologists in the year the pope died). It should likewise have to be admitted that for a half century the Spirit failed to protect Pius XI, Pius XII, and a large part of the Catholic hierarchy from a very serious error. This would mean that the leaders of the Church, acting with extreme imprudence, had condemned thousands of innocent human acts, forbidding, under pain of eternal damnation, a practice which would now be sanctioned. The fact can neither be denied nor ignored that these same acts would now be declared licit on the grounds of principles cited by the Protestants, which popes and <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> either condemned or at least not approved.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{scarcity}} of documents, it cannot be said with certainty who the diocese's bishops were during its first two decades. One group of historians points to Maksim Branković, a Serbian monk, probably named by Radu due to his {{good relations with the}} Serbian Despotate. Another group points to Macarie, starets of the Bistrița Monastery. This establishment was maintained by the Craiovești boyars, in whose interest it was to place an ally as bishop. Later, Neagoe Basarab, a former pupil at the monastery, would elevate Macarie to the Wallachia Metropolis, establishing a tradition wherein the leading candidate (willing or not) for the highest churchly office in the country would come from Râmnic, the bishops of which would be regarded as the second highest ranked clerics within the synod, behind the metropolitan. Including Macarie, three bishops of Râmnic went on to be elected metropolitan in the 16th century, three in the 17th and four in the 18th. Clearer records begin with Bishop Leontie, believed to have served between 1532 and 1534. Some forty <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> led the diocese, including Anthim the Iberian, the city's patron saint, and Calinic of Cernica, who rebuilt the bishop's residence.|$|E

25|$|In England, senior Church {{appointments}} are Crown appointments; the Church {{carries out}} state {{functions such as}} coronations; Anglican representatives have an automatic role on Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education; and 26 diocesan <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> seats in the House of Lords, where they are known as the Lords Spiritual {{as opposed to the}} lay Lords Temporal. The Lords Spiritual have a significant influence when they vote as a bloc on certain issues, notably moral issues like abortion and euthanasia (where their views differ from the majority of the population). A of state-funded schools in England are religious school, too, and most are controlled by the Church of England, with significant numbers of state-funded Catholic, Muslim, and Jewish schools as well. The Anglican Church also has specific legal rights and responsibilities in solemnised marriages that are different from other faith organisations. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, but non-religious humanist weddings are not yet legally recognised in their own right. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, and sixth formers have the right to opt out.|$|E
500|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} it is the [...] "one true church", [...] "the {{universal}} sacrament of salvation for the human race", and [...] "the one true religion". According to the Catechism, the Catholic Church is further described in the Nicene Creed as the [...] "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church". These are collectively known as the Four Marks of the Church. The church teaches that its founder is Jesus Christ. The New Testament records several events considered integral to the establishment of the Catholic Church, including Jesus' activities and teaching and his appointment of the apostles as witnesses to his ministry, suffering, and resurrection. The Great Commission, after his resurrection, instructed the apostles to continue his work. The coming of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, in an event known as Pentecost, is seen as the beginning of the public ministry of the Catholic Church. The church teaches that all duly consecrated <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> a lineal succession from the apostles of Christ, known as apostolic succession. In particular, the Bishop of Rome (the pope) is considered the successor to the apostle Simon Peter, a position from which he derives his supremacy over the Church.|$|E
2500|$|Other <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> been {{appointed}} as [...] "field bishops" [...] who {{are assigned to}} assist one of the twelve apostles. The Presiding Bishopric is also regarded as {{the presidency of the}} entire Aaronic priesthood. Bishops in general are therefore sometimes seen as ideal resources to provide support and mentoring to local members of the Aaronic priesthood.|$|E

2500|$|Churches having episcopal polity {{are governed}} by bishops. [...] The title bishop comes from the Greek word episkopos, which {{literally}} translates into overseer. In regard to Catholicism, <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> authority over the diocese, which is both sacramental and political; as well as performing ordinations, confirmations, and consecrations, the bishop supervises the clergy of the diocese and represents the diocese both secularly and {{in the hierarchy of}} church governance.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{south-west}} and north-west buttresses of {{the tower}} are ancient and almost-illegible carvings about [...] across, and about [...] from the ground. They may be consecration crosses, following the tradition in which Anglican <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> anointed each corner of the church with chrism {{as part of the}} consecration ritual, then commemorative crosses were placed at the same points. At first sight the carvings appear to be Tudor roses or the fleurs-de-lis used by English monarchs from the 14th to 18thcentury, but the raised [...] "petals" [...] may be the gaps between the curved arms of the deeply engraved cross.|$|E
2500|$|Although our {{missions}} are not canonical parishes, {{yet it is}} {{the desire of the}} bishops to conform as much as possible to the discipline of the universal church in this matter. In cities containing more than one church, accurate limits for their districts should be assigned. When in these decrees the terms [...] "parish" [...] or [...] "parochial rights" [...] are used, the <b>bishops</b> <b>have</b> no intention of thereby indicating that the rector of a church is irremovable. No priest should be appointed to a parish unless he has made an examination before the bishop and two priests, and has been five years in the diocese.|$|E
