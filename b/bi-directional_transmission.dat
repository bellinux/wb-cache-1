40|$|<b>Bi-directional</b> WDM <b>transmission</b> is a {{technique}} that allows {{data to be transmitted}} simultaneously in both directions of a fiber, with different sets of wavelength channels for each direction. Compared with unidirectional WDM systems, it not only saves the cost of deploying extra fibers, but also allows more flexible bandwidth provisioning. To exploit this flexibility, we investigate path protection schemes for <b>bi-directional</b> WDM <b>transmission</b> systems in this paper. With path protection, a call is accepted if and only if an active data path together with a disjointed backup path {{can be found in the}} network. With bi-directional WDM, backup resource sharing in both directions of a fiber is possible. Based on a set of judiciously designed link cost functions, two original path protection schemes are proposed in this paper, BiPro and BiProLP. BiProLP aims at further economizing the hardware cost incurred by BiPro. In contrast to the traditional unidirectional schemes, we show that both BiPro and BiProLP can yield noticeably lower call blocking probability, higher system capacity and shorter active/backup path length. © 2008 Elsevier B.

5000|$|An optical {{circulator}} is {{a special}} fiber-optic component {{that can be used}} to separate optical signals that travel in opposite directions in an optical fiber, analogous to the operation of an electronic circulator. [...] An optical circulator is a three- or four-port device designed such that light entering any port exits from the next. This means that if light enters port 1 it is emitted from port 2, but if some of the emitted light is reflected back to the circulator, it does not come out of port 1 but instead exits from port 3. Circulators can be used to achieve <b>bi-directional</b> <b>transmission</b> over a single fiber. Because of their high isolation of the input and reflected optical powers and their low insertion loss, optical circulators are widely used in advanced communication systems and fiber-optic sensor applications.|$|E

40|$|UFO is a {{hardware}} construction designed for data transmissions. The design handles data via USB (Universal Serial Bus), via fiber optics and via a parallel interface. The {{requirements for the}} device are, data speed transmission according to USB specification 1 [1], noise interference according to EMC-directive class A [11] and <b>bi-directional</b> data <b>transmission.</b> All the traffic on the board is handled by an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), {{which is supposed to}} prevent collisions between data transmissions, along with directing it to the correct endpoint. On the UFO there is an IC (Integrated Circuit), assigned to translate the USB communication between the host and the UFO. This device is particular of great importance to mention since it is responsible for some of the errors that occur when transferring information. The measurements and analyzes points to that there are several flaws in the UFO system. For instance: � When a target system reads with a speed below 1, 5 MHz (10 Mbit/s), it will cause data losses since there is nothing that prevents overflow in the FPGA’s buffer. � Measurement shows that there are synchronization problems between the UFO system and the target system. This results in information loss � The USB speed that is specified cannot be used maximally when the target system reads with a frequency of 1, 5 MHz or higher. This will result in large time gaps between the packages that are sent from the host. The {{reason for this is that}} the USB node is not used an optimal way. � One specified requirement for UFO was <b>bi-directional</b> data <b>transmission.</b> It is possible to transfer information in both directions, but it is only efficient to send information in one direction, which is from host to the target system...|$|R
