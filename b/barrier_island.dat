5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half <b>barrier</b> <b>island.</b> The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> that appeared as recently as the Holocene epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{terrain of}} a <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> is {{determined}} by a dynamic beach system with offshore bars, pounding surf, and shifting beaches; as well as grassy dunes behind the beach, maritime forests with wetlands in the interiors, and salt or tidal marshes on the lee side, facing the mainland. A typical <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> has a headland, a beach and surf zone, and a sand spit.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, three kakapo {{were moved}} from Resolution Island {{to the nature}} reserve of Little <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island</b> {{north-east}} of Auckland, but feral cats were present and the kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three kakapo were moved to another reserve, Kapiti Island, north-west of Wellington. One of them survived until at least 1936, {{despite the presence of}} feral cats for part of the intervening period.|$|E

5|$|Along the Texas coastline, Bret {{threatened}} several cities, prompting 180,000residents to evacuate. Numerous shelters {{were opened}} {{throughout the region}} and prisons were evacuated. Several days prior to the storm's arrival, the NHC issued hurricane watches, and later warnings for areas near the Texas–Mexico border. Several major roads leading to <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> towns were shut down to prevent residents from crossing bridges during the hurricane. In nearby Mexico, roughly 7,000people left coastal areas {{in advance of the}} storm. Officials also set up hundreds of shelters in northern regions of the country in case of major flooding.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the point}} of its first landfall, few {{structures}} were destroyed and ocean overwash across the <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> was limited, though {{the extent of the}} damage far exceeded that of Hurricane Charley. Wind damage to citrus groves led to a near total loss near the coast of east-central Florida between West Palm Beach and Melbourne, with lesser damage farther to the west across the Kissimmee River basin. Between Hurricane Charley and Frances, citrus losses totaled $2billion (2004 dollars). Significant tree damage was reported within golf courses along the Treasure Coast, with an average of 300-500 trees experiencing damage per course.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island</b> in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E

40|$|I. Corresponding author: <b>Barrier</b> <b>islands</b> within bays, lagoons, es-tuaries {{and other}} {{protected}} waters have nev-er {{been the subject}} of systematic research on a large scale. Within both the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays, <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> are nu-merous and widely distributed. Totaling more than 300 in number, these fetch limited <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> exhibit a range of morpholo-gies uncommon along open ocean shorelines. We group the <b>barrier</b> <b>islands</b> in the two bays into three primary categories based on their morphology and location. In general, they are much shorter (-lkm), narrower (< 25 m), and lower (1 - 2 m) than their open ocean ana-logs, yet they behave {{in much the same way}} in their response to oceanographic processes. The greatest difference between ocean and bay barriers is the strong control of evolu-tionary processes by vegetation, usually salt marsh, in the bays...|$|R
5|$|The Loop Parkway {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with Lido Boulevard {{on the eastern}} end of Long Beach <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island</b> in the neighborhood of Point Lookout. It proceeds north as a four-lane divided highway, crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach Alder Island, one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park. Here, the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island. Two U-turn ramps are built into the median near the western end of the island, serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on Alder Island. The Loop Parkway heads east from Alder Island, traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island. The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{were removed}} from Stanley, Red Mercury and Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991, and {{maintained}} in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, Little <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island</b> was found to hold only eight tuatara, which were taken into in situ captivity, where females produced 42eggs, which were incubated at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, the {{hurricane}} left quasi-permanent alterations on beaches and small islands. For example, North Bunces Key—an island of southern Pinellas County—lost {{most of its}} vegetation to the storm, and overwashing shifted {{the southern part of}} the island up to 330ft (100 m) from its original settlement. More extensive changes were seen on and near Caladesi Island, which formed in 1921 after a hurricane split a larger <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> into two by a new channel. The inlet became dominant over Dunedin Pass to the south, which grew narrower very gradually until Elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach, allowing Dunedin Pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of {{the hurricane}}'s passage. As a result, Clearwater Beach became connected to Caladesi Island. Elena also created a new inlet known as Willy's Cut, which existed until 1991. Interest in artificially reopening Dunedin Pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of such a project. Due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance, no action was taken.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery {{programme}} {{was developed}} and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it. The New Zealand Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of {{the plan was to}} relocate all the remaining kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kakapo without rehabilitation by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: Maud, Hauturu/Little Barrier, Codfish and Mana. Sixty-five kakapo (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and weka kept appearing. Little <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island</b> was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998. Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new kakapo sanctuaries, Chalky Island (Te Kakahu) and Anchor Island. The entire kakapo population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to Pearl Island in Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from Codfish. All kakapo on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In Martin and St. Lucie counties, {{the storm}} was {{considered}} among the worst on record. The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations. At Stuart, winds removed or badly damaged 75% of the roofs in town. The storm destroyed {{the third floor of}} the building that housed a bowling alley and the Stuart News, a local newspaper. At Olympia, an abandoned settlement also known as Olympia Beach, strong winds leveled the old Olympia Inn, a gas station, and the second floor of a pharmaceutical building. Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant. A bridge leading to the <b>barrier</b> <b>island</b> from Olympia was partly wrecked; the bridge tender survived by gripping the railing during the storm. Winds leveled his nearby home. According to the Monthly Weather Review, some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at Olympia. The storm left many homes in Hobe Sound uninhabitable, forcing crews to tear them down. Winter estates on the island, however, were better built and little damaged. While Stuart and Hobe Sound sustained significant damage, Port Salerno suffered minimally. In Stuart, the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless, up to nearly 10% of the population, which was 5,100 at the time. Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce, the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines. In the latter city, high waves washed out a portion of the causeway. In the 1980s, an elderly resident recalled that {{the storm was}} the most severe on record in Fort Pierce.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{attempts}} to conserve the huia, {{but they were}} few, poorly organised and poorly enforced legally: the conservation movement in New Zealand was {{still very much in}} its infancy. There were successive sharp declines in numbers of huia in the 1860s and in the late 1880s, prompting the chiefs of the Manawatu and the Wairarapa to place a rāhui on the Tararua Range. In February 1892, the Wild Birds Protection Act was amended to include the huia, making it illegal to kill the bird, but enforcement was not taken seriously. Island sanctuaries were set up for endangered native birds after this act, but the new bird sanctuaries, including Kapiti Island, Little <b>Barrier</b> <b>Island</b> and Resolution Island, were never stocked with huia. Although attempts were made to capture birds for transfer, no huia were ever transferred. The Kapiti Island attempt is documented as being particularly poorly managed. A live pair destined to be transferred to the island in 1893 was instead appropriated by Buller, who bent the law to take them back to England as a present for Lord Rothschild, along with the last collected live pair of laughing owls.|$|E
