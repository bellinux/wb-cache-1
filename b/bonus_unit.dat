Unlike previous Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} wonder. Players can choose from a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial <b>bonus</b> of <b>units</b> or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|R

50|$|Players either select or are {{randomly}} assigned a civilization {{led by a}} historical figure, based on several factual reigns and empires, including the Romans, Aztecs, and Americans; the civilization choice provides certain unique <b>bonuses,</b> <b>units,</b> and improvements for that player. Players start at random locations on the map, and must found their first city, becoming its default capitol until changed by the player, and explore the map and lift its fog of war {{to find out what}} is nearby, including potential resources {{that can be used in}} production, and where other civilizations are located. Cities will generate several resources based on how large the city is which affects how many map spaces it takes up: food which is required to sustain large cities and allow them to grow; production units used to determine how fast a city can build new units and improvements, science and culture which affect progress along the technology tree, and currency which can be used by the player for several tasks including upkeep of cities and units, speeding up production of a unit or offered as gifts in diplomacy actions. Once a city is founded, the player can then start to produce new units or city improvements. Units include military units, commerce-based units such as caravans to establish trade routes with other cities, and civilian-based groups like workers to help improve the land areas around a city such as by constructing fields or mines. City improvements include buildings that help to boost production types, such a library or university to improve research output, or World Wonders, unique buildings that can only be built by one civilization that grants a large bonus to the first to complete it. Cities will grow over time, expanding to cover more territory on the map while requiring more food and money to maintain, and players can create units that will be able to found new cities, expanding their empire.|$|R

Creeps guard key {{areas such as}} gold mines or neutral buildings and, when killed, provide experience points, gold, and special items to a player's hero.

5000|$|... Artillery units: These units {{specialize}} in attacking {{from a distance}} and have the highest range of all units. This is their best characteristic because {{in the rest of}} parameters they are worse {{than the rest of the}} units. They are effective against Ranged units due that they out range them and Heavy units because their poor mobility gives them a hard time to reach the far side of the battlefield. Artillery units do poorly against Light and Fast units that can reach the far side of the battlefield quickly. Artillery units receive an offensive bonus when attacking from hills and a <b>bonus</b> vs. Heavy <b>units.</b>|$|R

A unit that triggers good luck deals more (or receives less) damage, and a unit that triggers high morale receives an extra turn. In some other games, luck and morale can also be negative, with opposite corresponding effects. Luck and morale can be improved by hero abilities, artifacts, and spells. Morale may suffer with overwhelming odds in combat or by mixing incompatible unit types (e.g. Chaos with Order.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Pale Moon: A highly mysterious {{travelling}} circus {{who gives}} highly popular and mesmerizing performances all over Planet Cray, but secretly houses a guild of elite assassins who serve whomever pays for their services.

During the G-era, they gain the specific keyword Magia, which calls units from the Soul for extremely cheap costs or grants called <b>units</b> <b>bonus</b> effects, but forces them to return to the Soul at the end of turn. Introduced in Booster Set 3: Demonic Lord Invasion.|$|R
