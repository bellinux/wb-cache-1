Located on the shoreline at the terminus of 184th St. (Eureka Drive), [...] the highest storm surge levels was recorded (16.9ft) at the site. The building suffered more than [...] in damage and pushed the company from its offices during one of its more significant product pushes. Not only was the company forced from its facilities, roughly 300 members of its 700+ staff were left homeless. Immediately after the storm, Gibbons began a program to help get the company back on track. The company's recovery was helped due to pre-planning before the storm's landfall; Corporate <b>backoffice</b> data was moved to Seattle, Washington before the storm struck in order to safeguard critical records, and the company established a temporary [...] "command center" [...] at the Doral Resort and Country Club in Miami within eight days of the hurricanes passing. Additional operations were temporarily decentralized by temporarily shifting some corporate functions to regional offices. The facility would eventually take more than a year to rebuild, finally opening in September 1993.|$|E

40|$|There are {{apparently}} very few incentives for government managers to imple-ment Privacy-Enhanced Identity Management Systems {{on a large}} scale in an eGovernment architecture. In this paper we explain why this is understandable to some extent and introduce a less far-going alternative – provisionally – called Privacy-Friendly Identity Management. We conclude with a brief analysis of one important driver to choose for “Privacy-Friendly Identity Management Systems”: risk manage-ment. 1 Identity Management in eGovernment There are probably as many definitions of the term eGovernment as there are people working in that field. The definition used in Belgian federal eGovernment runs as follows: “eGovernment is the continuous optimization of service deli-very and governance by transforming internal and external relationships through technology, internet and new media”. 1. This optimization relies on a number of important principles, inter alia, treating information as a strategic resource for all government activities and the integration of <b>backoffices.</b> 2 From a technical perspective the integration of back-offices is typically looked for through a (cross-border) “Service Oriented Architecture”(SOA). In practice, identity management components are often integrated as basic service components of such a SOA in eGovernment. These services are then compiled with other services to so-called value-added services. 3 Depending on the goals of the eGovernment project, it is usually good to start with a risk assessment of the organization’s activity...|$|R
