50|$|The Ternus illusion, also {{commonly}} referred to as the Ternus Effect is an illusion related to human visual perception involving apparent motion. In a simplified explanation of one form of the illusion, two discs, (referred to here as L for left and C for centre) are shown side by side as the first frame in a sequence of three frames. Next a <b>blank</b> <b>frame</b> is presented for a very short, variable duration. In the final frame, two similar discs (C for centre and R for right) are then shown in a shifted position. Depending on various factors including the time intervals between frames as well as spacing and layout, observers perceive either element motion, in which L appears to move to R while C remains stationary or they report experiencing group motion, in which L and C appear to move together to C and R. Both element motion and group motion can be observed in animated examples to the right in Figures 1 and 2.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE—To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} experimental glaucoma in macaque monkeys on oscillatory potentials (OPs) in the slow-sequence multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG). METHODS—Photopic slow-sequence mfERGs were recorded from anesthetized adult macaque monkeys and normal human subjects. The stimulus consisted of 103 equal-sized hexagons within 17 ° of the fovea. The m-sequence was slowed, with 14 <b>blank</b> <b>frames,</b> ~ 200 ms, interleaved between flashes for monkeys and 7 <b>blank</b> <b>frames,</b> ~ 100 ms, for humans, to produce waveforms similar to the photopic full-field flash ERG. Recordings were made under control conditions (24 monkey eyes, 7 human) and after laser-induced experimental glaucoma in monkeys (n = 8). A Fourier fast transform [FFT] was used to {{determine the}} frequency ranges of the major OPs. OP amplitudes were quantified by using root mean square (RMS) for two-frequency bands in five horizontal and four vertical locations. Visual field defects were assessed using behavioral static perimetry. Full-field photopic flash ERGs also were recorded. RESULTS—OPs in two distinct frequency bands were discriminated in the monkey mfERG: fast OPs, with a peak frequency of 143 ± 20 Hz, and slow OPs, with a peak at 77 ± 8 Hz. There wer...|$|R

40|$|A change {{detection}} paradigm {{was used}} to estimate the role of explicit change detection in the generation of the irrelevant spatial stimulus coding underlying the Simon effect. In one condition, no blank was interposed between two successive displays, which produced efficient change detection. In another condition, {{the presence of a}} <b>blank</b> <b>frame</b> produced a robust change blindness effect, which is crucially assumed to occur as the consequence of impaired attentional orienting to the change location. The results showed a strong Simonlike effect under conditions of efficient change detection. By contrast, no Simon-like effect was observed under conditions of change blindness, namely when attention shifting towards the change location was hampered. Experiment 2 supported this pattern by showing that a Simon-like effect could be observed when the blank was present, but only when participants detected the change by means of a cue that was informative as to change location. Overall, our findings show that a Simon-like effect can only be observed under conditions of explicit change detection, likely because a shift of attention towards the change location has occurred...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} the timecourses of the crossmodal semantic priming effects elicited by naturalistic sounds and spoken words on visual picture processing. Following an auditory prime, a picture (or <b>blank</b> <b>frame)</b> was briefly presented and then immediately masked. The participants had {{to judge whether}} a picture was present or not. Naturalistic sounds consistently elicited a crossmodal semantic priming effect on visual sensitivity (d') for pictures (higher d' in the congruent than in the incongruent condition) at the 350 ms {{rather than at the}} 1000 ms stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). Spoken words mainly elicited a crossmodal semantic priming effect at the 1000 ms rather than at the 350 ms SOA, but this effect was modulated by the order of testing these two SOAs. It would therefore appear that visual picture processing can be rapidly primed by naturalistic sounds via crossmodal associations, and this effect is short-lived. In contrast, spoken words prime visual picture processing over a wider range of prime-target intervals, though this effect was conditioned by the prior context...|$|E

40|$|We {{provide an}} {{integrated}} approach for detecting commercial segments in video streams. This approach systematically fuses the “local ” multi-modal characteristics of commercials {{in the context}} of their “global ” temporal behavior throughout the video stream. Discriminative classifiers are employed to distinguish between commercial and program segments based on their local multi-modal features. The decisions made by different discriminators are fused using a Support Vector Machine. The fusion results are then used as the probabilistic outcomes of a generative model describing the transitions between the commercial and program segments, with explicit models for the inter-arrival times of the commercial segments throughout the video. This approach aims to enhance upon the simple, yet effective <b>blank</b> <b>frame,</b> which usually indicate the start of the commercials. It also provides acceptable performance when such indicators do not exist in the program stream. The results of comprehensive experiments on a heterogeneous data set of 36 hours of video taken from 6 different sources are reported.

40|$|Background: Recent {{research}} has shown that the presence of a task-irrelevant attractive face can induce a transient diversion of attention from a perceptual task that requires covert deployment of attention to one of the two locations. However, it is not known whether this spontaneous appraisal for facial beauty also modulates attention in change detection among multiple locations, where a slower, and more controlled search process is simultaneously affected by the magnitude of a change and the facial distinctiveness. Using the flicker paradigm, this study examines how spontaneous appraisal for facial beauty affects the detection of identity change among multiple faces. Methodology/Principal Findings: Participants viewed a display consisting of two alternating frames of four faces separated by a <b>blank</b> <b>frame.</b> In half of the trials, one of the faces (target face) changed to a different person. The task of the participant was to indicate whether a change of face identity had occurred. The results showed that (1) observers were less efficient at detecting identity change among multiple attractive faces relative to unattractive faces when the target and distractor faces were not highly distinctive from one another; and (2) it is difficult to detect a change if the new face is similar to the old. Conclusions/Significance: The findings suggest that attractive faces may interfere with the attention-switch process in change detection. The results also show that attention in change detection was strongly modulated by physical similarity between the alternating faces. Although facial beauty is a powerful stimulus that has well-demonstrated priority, it...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{report on}} the erasure of the iconic memory of an array of 12 black letters flashed on a continuously- present white field. Erasure is {{accomplished}} by replacing the 16 ms letter array (frame 1) with a <b>blank</b> white <b>frame</b> for 16 ms (frame 2). The letter array returns in frame 3, with from one to six letters missing. Report of the missing letters is accurate without the <b>blank</b> white <b>frame</b> but is impoverished with it, as if interposing the blank erases the icon. Erasure occurs without any obvious luminance masking, ‘mud splashes’, pattern masking (backward, forward, or metacontrast), lateral masking, or masking by object substitution. Erasure is greatly decreased if the blank is presented one frame earlier or later. We speculate that erasure {{is due to a}} rapid reset of the icon produced by an informational mis-match...|$|R

30|$|Beggs and Plenz’s {{conclusion}} is that such bursts of activity are avalanches defined as follows: the configuration of active electrodes in the array during one time bin of width Δt is termed a frame, and a sequence of frames preceded and followed by <b>blank</b> <b>frames</b> is called an avalanche. However, successive frames are not highly correlated, so the activity is not wave-like: {{it is in fact}} self-similar, and in addition, the avalanche size distribution follows the power law P[n] ∝ n^α. In addition the exponent α is approximately − 1.5. This is the mean-field exponent of a critical branching process [10]. This result was a step beyond that of Softky and Koch [11] who found Poisson-like spiking activity in individual cortical neurons, and introduced the possibility of criticality in brain dynamics. In fact this mean-field exponent turns up in several kinds of percolation processes on random graphs, including both isotropic and directed percolation. But branching and annihilating random walks are equivalent to directed percolation, so it is possible that what Beggs and Plenz observed in cortical slices was a form of directed percolation. We will return to this topic later.|$|R

Through an in-depth analysis of comics panels based on the stories of both Mexican and Guatemalan migrants, the paper explores how these largely unseen, unheard migrants are given a voice through the text of the comics and how the comics serve to narrate the loss and trauma inherent in migration. By combining comics theory and traditional subaltern theory the paper shows how comics can shed new light on decades-old discussions regarding the testimonial.
