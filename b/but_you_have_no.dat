2500|$|At {{the top of}} {{the social}} {{structure}} of Paris was the aristocracy, both old and new. In 1788, before the Revolution, the old nobility in Paris had numbered 15-17,000 persons, about three percent of the population. Those who escaped execution during the terror fled abroad to England, Germany, Spain, Russia, and even the United States. Most returned during the reign of Napoleon, and many found positions in the new Imperial court and government. They built new houses, mostly in the area around the Champs-Élysées. They were joined by a new aristocracy created by Napoleon, consisting of his generals, ministers and courtiers, as well as bankers, industrialists, and those who furnished military supplies; about three thousand persons altogether. The new aristocrats often made alliances by marriage with old families, who needed money. One old aristocrat, the Duke of Montmorency, told Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, who had been made a duke by Napoleon, [...] "You are a duke, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> ancestors!" [...] Soult replied, [...] "It's true. We are the ancestors." ...|$|E

60|$|You haven't. You're {{an admirable}} woman, {{with all the}} {{substantial}} virtues which make you an ornament to your sex, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> charm.|$|E
6000|$|... "A glue-pot can’t {{go without}} hands," [...] he said, obstinately. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{asked me for}} a little <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> had it, and welcome; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{business}} to take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been better to have faced the music. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> one to advise you, and did not know <b>but</b> that <b>you</b> would be sent to jail without a fair trial, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not suspect," [...] {{she heard}} him saying, [...] "that you would {{go out into the}} world and create the {{beautiful}} gardens of which I <b>have</b> heard. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> lack of spirit in those days, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold up {{now before}} you say {{something}} that you'll be sorry for. This is your house, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> right to insult me in it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir? <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{right to}} speak to me in that style. You know that you have no right to call me by my name in that way!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ma,' Bella struck in, 'Mr and Mrs Boffin are prosperous, no doubt; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{right to}} say they are proud. You must know very well that they are not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Deceive Papa and Mamma {{for three}} whole days!' cried Elizabeth; 'I wonder {{you are not}} ashamed of yourself. Besides, Harriet, I do not see what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to fear. It was Kate and I who did wrong; we knew better, and cast away Helen's good advice; we shut our eyes and went headlong into mischief, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> reason to suppose {{that you might not}} do as we did.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it well. It {{was your}} fatal truth that did it; truth {{too high and}} fine {{for me to have}} discerned save through such agony as.... You too loved my soul, like the rest, and <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> me <b>no</b> priest for the reason that they would have had me a priest--I see it. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right to love my soul and not me--you, a woman. A woman must not love only the soul of a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Humph!” The man {{fell back}} a little. “Well, I am thankful for that. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> boys <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right {{to look at}} it,” he grumbled.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, Lyra--I know it. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{right to}} keep him from taking a fancy to some young girl--and marrying her; to keep him to yourself; to make people talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; give me but a piece. You {{know what}} is behind you, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{knowledge}} of what is before you.' And picking up the tobacco in his beak, the raven flew away.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a big risk," [...] she said. [...] "The girl is dainty and fastidious. There's nothing coarse in you, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> outward polish. Perhaps {{the tastes}} you have {{inherited}} may make things easier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes;" [...] {{said the}} clown, indifferently. [...] "I suppose you're frightful looking enough. <b>But</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> teeth nor claws we don't mind your looks at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> if <b>YOU</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> choice nor {{feeling in}} the matter, why Shipley is far the better man. And {{if any of the}} scandal should come to his ears"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{viewing the}} {{question}} as one of faith," [...] said the stranger. [...] "It is not {{as a matter of}} religion, but as a matter of right, that I am considering it: as a matter, I should say, of private right and public happiness. <b>You</b> might <b>have</b> changed if <b>you</b> thought fit the religion of the abbots as you changed the religion of the bishops: <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> right to deprive men of their property, and property moreover which under their administration so mainly contributed to the welfare of the community." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{no great}} statesmen," [...] she {{answered}} simply. [...] "You {{have plenty of}} men who would make very fine local administrators, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> statesmen, or you would have provided for what is coming." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A saint and a heroine!" [...] said Claude. [...] "You shall know all; for {{you ought}} to know. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> news of Tom; and I have none either. I am losing all hope now." ...|$|E
60|$|There is a {{critique}} in the 'Satirist', [2] which I have read,--fairly written, and, though vituperative, very fair in judgment. One part belongs to you, viz., the 4s. and 6d charge; it is unconscionable, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> conscience.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{certainly}} not. <b>But</b> here <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> money, and as {{we cannot}} suffer any to 'walk among us disorderly, working not at all,' we must not exempt you from our rule." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{paused a}} moment while the lines were coming back into her face, and then said in a colder tone, [...] "I am your mother. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> love for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't know {{anything}} about the hare, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> certainly <b>have</b> <b>no</b> right to complain because I have been talking to Mrs. Smith;--unless indeed you tell me {{that you are going to}} make her Mrs. Shand.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I meant to, Marilla, as much {{as could}} be. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> idea how {{fascinating}} Idlewild is. And then, of course, I had to tell Matthew about the picnic. Matthew is such a sympathetic listener. Please can I go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With me," [...] he answered, [...] "it is the {{philosophy}} of approaching old age, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> such excuse. With you it must be sheer callousness. You are in an evil way, Lady Caroom. Do have another of these quails." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but it will}} {{be worse}} far away than near. I do not mean that we should conceal the fact, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> right to give him up before he comes home. The whole {{engagement}} was for the time of his voyage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here, Gale, {{we are all}} senior to you in {{the date}} of our commissions, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen <b>no</b> end of service and adventure; {{therefore}} I vote that you shall be commanding officer, until we get back to camp." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Very well,” he acquiesced bravely. “I have {{to fight}} this thing, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>no</b> trouble on my account. I find the light rather strong out here; if you will excuse me, I think I’ll go in.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{are going}} to make a start at once, Ned,' Mr. Hawtrey said; 'I cannot offer you a seat back to town, <b>but</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{engagement}} I hope that you will dine with us. Will you come too, Mr. Danvers?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have met}} my young photographer,' said De Stancy cheerily. 'What {{a small world}} it is, as {{everybody}} truly observes! I am wishing he could take some views for us as we go on; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> apparatus with you, I suppose, Mr. Dare?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No;--you {{would be}} afraid to do that. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> scruple in asking your mother, though you should force {{her to come to}} me or to other friends for assistance. You have squandered every {{shilling}} of your own, and now you are ruining her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have a {{right to}} require a {{definite}} answer to your questions, Mr. Delafield; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> right to exact my reasons for declining your very flattering offer--I am young, very young--but I know what is due to myself and to my sex--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only {{your last}} words, as I {{came up to}} ask Norman {{what he had done}} with my pocket-book. Mind, I ask no impertinent questions; <b>but,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> objection, I should like to know what gained me the honour of that compliment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs. Wimbush, {{interrupting}} her, [...] "I {{have more}} important things to think about than the Fair. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> need <b>have</b> <b>no</b> doubt that I shall do my best when Monday comes to encourage the villagers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I should advise you, in the morning, {{to manage}} to untie each other. We shall fasten the door {{up as we}} go out, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>no</b> {{difficulty}} in bursting that open, when you are once untied.|$|R
