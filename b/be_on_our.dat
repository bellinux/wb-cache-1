500|$|In 1809, Dennis Pennington, one of {{the most}} outspoken anti-slavery men and a friend of Henry Clay, was elected to the {{legislature}} as the representative from Harrison County, and became speaker of the assembly. His prominence allowed him to dominate the legislature. Before the constitutional convention in 1816, Pennington was quoted as saying [...] "Let us <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery." [...] At the constitutional convention, the anti-slavery party was able to take control, electing Jennings {{as the president of the}} convention. It was by their actions that slavery was banned by the first constitution.|$|E
500|$|Jennings and his {{supporters}} had control of the convention and Jennings was elected its president. Other notable delegates at the convention included Dennis Pennington, Davis Floyd, and William Hendricks. Pennington and Jennings were {{at the forefront of}} the effort to prevent slavery from entering Indiana and sought to create a constitutional ban on it. Pennington was quoted as saying [...] "Let us <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery". They succeeded in their goal and a ban was placed in the new constitution. But, persons already held in bondage stayed in that status for some time. That same year Indiana statehood was approved by Congress. While settlers did not want slavery, they also wanted to exclude free blacks, and established barriers to their immigration to the state.|$|E
500|$|Meade {{made his}} {{decision}} {{late that night}} in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There {{is some evidence that}} Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, [...] "If Lee attacks tomorrow, it will be in your front. ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to try it again, it will <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> centre." ...|$|E

[...] Several days later, he personally placed the girl's stepfather under arrest for the rape. In 2003, a jury sentenced the stepfather to death.|$|E
2500|$|Nearly {{one year}} later, while {{promoting}} the Alaska natural gas pipeline project to federal officials in Washington D.C., Palin said, [...] "Don't {{tell me that}} we should ever <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> knees to any dictator because of our desperation for energy, not when we have supplies here at home." [...] Referring to her son's imminent deployment to the Iraq War zone, she added, [...] "This mama grizzly ... has more reason than ever to protect our young." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1815 Pennington {{served as}} the Indiana Territory's census enumerator. He used the {{position}} to promote his anti-slavery platform to every home within the territory and {{laid the groundwork for}} the election of anti-slavery delegates to the constitutional convention. Pennington {{and other members of the}} anti-slavery movement tried to prevent slavery from becoming a part of Indiana's state constitution, which would be drafted in June 1816. Pennington remarked, [...] "Let us <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2009, CUPE's Ontario University Workers Coordinating Committee {{announced}} plans to introduce Resolution 50 that would ban Israeli academics from speaking, teaching or researching at Ontario universities. Sid Ryan, president of CUPE Ontario, stated that [...] "Israeli academics should not <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> campuses unless they explicitly condemn the university bombing and the assault on Gaza in general." [...] Ryan stated that the resolution was a reasonable response to Israel's attack on the Islamic University, which he likened to the torching of books by Nazis during the Second World War.|$|E
2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] I think that was the second thing Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't really have any lyrics. He came up with some ideas right there on the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> first record. But at the time, I was really young and just happy to be around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E
2500|$|Gardiner used similar {{methods to}} push the Don Valley Parkway project along. Engineers were {{interested}} in studying alternate routes, which Gardiner was able to prevent because [...] "councillors {{could not afford to}} stop, look and listen. Either the project was started forthwith, or the whole east end of the city will <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> shoulders like three tons of bricks." [...] Metro executive committee approved the preliminary plans one month later. When the plans were in draft, he secured section-by-section approval. The Parkway project went from proposal to approved policy in about two years, from January 1955 until February 1957.|$|E

2500|$|Sire Records made an {{unauthorised}} {{music video}} {{to promote the}} song. It intercut clips of the band playing live (including a shot of Johnny Marr showing Morrissey {{how to play the}} guitar), an industrial part of a city, and a girl dancing. The band were not pleased by the result. Morrissey told Creem in 1985, [...] "We saw the video and we said to Sire, 'You can't possibly release this... this degrading video.' And they said, 'Well, maybe you shouldn't really <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> label.' It was quite disastrous". Nonetheless, the video has been credited with helping make the song their most famous in the United States, along with heavy exposure on college radio.|$|E

2500|$|At the 2011 CPAC, {{during her}} question-and-answer segment, Coulter {{was asked about}} GOProud and the {{controversy}} over their exclusion from the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, [...] "The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I think they should <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> side," [...] and [...] "Gays are natural conservatives." [...] Later that year, Coulter joined advisory board for GOProud. On Logos [...] she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that [...] "The gays {{have got to be}} pro-life," [...] and [...] "As soon as they find the gay gene, guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?"

2500|$|In January 2009, the Ontario {{branch of}} the Canadian Union of Public Employees brought forward a {{proposal}} to ban Israeli academics from teaching at Ontario Universities. CUPE-Ontario leader Sid Ryan stated, [...] "we are ready to say Israeli academics should not <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> campuses unless they explicitly condemn the university bombing and the assault on Gaza in general." [...] Ryan subsequently said, [...] "Academic freedom goes both ways. What we are saying is {{if they want to}} remain silent and be complicit in these kinds of actions, why should they enjoy the freedom to come and teach in other countries like Canada?" [...] CUPE's national president, Paul Moist, issued a statement declaring his opposition to the motion and saying, [...] "I will be using my influence in any debates on such a resolution to oppose its adoption." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the fourth}} day of August we reached the north bank of the Republican River and went into camp. At 9 o'clock that evening, three white men came into camp and {{reported}} {{to me that a}} large band of Sioux warriors [...] camped 25 miles [...] northwest, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Pawnees for several days, anticipating that we would move up the river where buffaloes were feeding. Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, that I took him to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as far as you dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
