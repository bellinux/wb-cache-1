50|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rots</b> {{are caused}} by several types of bacteria, but most {{commonly}} by species of gram-negative bacteria, Erwinia, Pectobacterium, and Pseudomonas. It is a destructive disease of fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals found worldwide, and effects genera from nearly all the plant families. The bacteria mainly attack the fleshy storage organs of their hosts (tubers, corms, bulbs, and rhizomes), but they also affect succulent buds, stems, and petiole tissues. With the aid of special enzymes, the plant is turned into a liquidy mush {{in order for the}} bacteria to consume the plant cell's nutrients. Disease spread can be caused by simple physical interaction between infected and healthy tissues during storage or transit. The disease can also be spread by insects. Control of the disease is not always very effective, but sanitary practices in production, storing, and processing are something that can be done in order to slow the spread of the disease and protect yields.|$|R

40|$|Although taro is {{susceptible}} to attack by at least twenty-three pathogens, only a few cause serious reduction in growth and production. Phytophthora blight (Phytophthora colocasiae) and Pythium root and corm rot (Pythium spp.) are the most serious fungal diseases of taro. Phytophthora blight is not yet found in Samoa, the Marquesas, the Society and Cook Islands. Dithane-M 45 is available for control of Phytophthora blight. Pythium root and corm rot is found where ever taro is grown. Five Pythium spp. have been implicated as causal agents of the disease. Captan provides good control of the disease. Data to apply for metalaxyl registration on taro for control of Pythium root and corm rots are being collected.

40|$|ABSTRACT Although enteric human {{pathogens}} {{are usually}} {{studied in the}} context of their animal hosts, a significant portion of their life cycle occurs on plants. Plant disease alters the phyllosphere, leading to enhanced growth of human pathogens; however, the impact of human pathogens on phytopathogen biology and plant health is largely unknown. To characterize the interaction between human pathogens and phytobacterial pathogens in the phyllosphere, we examined the interactions between Pectobacte-rium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and Salmonella enterica or Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 with regard to <b>bacterial</b> popula-tions, <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> progression, and changes in local pH. The presence of P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum enhanced the growth of both S. enterica and E. coli O 157 :H 7 on leaves. However, in a microaerophilic environment, S. enterica reduced P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum populations and <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> progression by moderating local environmental pH. Reduced <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> was not due to S. enterica proteolytic activity. Limitations on P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum growth, disease progression, and pH eleva-tion were not observed on leaves coinoculated with E. coliO 157 :H 7 or when leaves were coinoculated with S. enterica in an aero-bic environment. S. enterica also severely undermined the relationship between the phytobacterial population and disease pro-gression of a P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum budBmutant defective in the 2, 3 -butanediol pathway for acid neutralization. Our results show that S. enterica and E. coliO 157 :H 7 interact differently with the enteric phytobacterial pathogen P. carotovo-rum subsp. carotovorum.

50|$|There {{are many}} ways in which a plant can become {{infected}} by a <b>bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rot.</b> They can be host to the bacteria either by being infected as seed, or from direct inoculation into wounds or natural openings (stomata or lenticels) in mature plants, which is most common. But, when a plant is infected and the conditions are favorable, the bacteria immediately begin feeding on liquids released from injured cells and start replicating. As they replicate they release more and more pectolytic enzymes that degrade and break down cell walls. And, because of the high turgor pressure within the cells, this maceration effectively causes the cells to explode and die providing more food for the bacteria.|$|E

40|$|The problem {{faced in}} {{cultivation}} of ginger is {{the availability of}} uniform plant propagation materials. Ginger is propagated through underground rhizomes. Growth of the rhizome is not uniform, since the shoots do not sprout at the same time. Most of the rhizomes were attacked by several diseases such as <b>bacterial</b> wilt, <b>soft</b> <b>rot,</b> and nematodes. Propagation of plant material through in-vitro culture is also an obstacle since the price of pure agar and chemicals is very expensive. Therefore, production of cheap, uniform and disease-free plant materials with rapid multiplication rate {{is necessary for the}} successful ginger cultivation. The use of alternative media on in-vitro culture of ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) cv. Gajah was conducted in order to substitute cheaper alternative media for in-vitro culture of ginger. An experiment using two basic composition of media (MS and liquid fertilizer) and three different types of agar (seaweed, Swallow and Oxoid agar) was done at the Tissue Culture Laboratory of Center for Research and Development of Isotope and Radiation Technology, Jakarta. The result showed that the highest shoot height, number of shoot and leaf was obtained from medium composition of sea weed and MS. Whilst the medium of Oxoid agar and MS produced the longest and the highest number of root.

40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Observations of <b>bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> {{of onions}} in the Lake Labish {{area in the}} Willamette Valley of western Oregon showed that two {{distinct}} symptom types occur during the growing season. The most prevalent symptom type appears in infected plants as a wilting and chlorosis {{of two or more}} lower leaves which is followed closely by appearance of elongated lesions emerging from the neck and extending up the adaxial side of one or more young leaves. Although most infected plants showing these symptoms usually decay quickly, some plants may appear to partially recover if conditions unfavorable for disease development return. A second symptom type is evident in those infected plants in which the collapse of all emerged leaves occurs simultaneously. During leaf collapse, foliar color changes from dark green to grey-green and finally, with desiccation, to light tan. Two kinds of soft rot also occur commonly in stored onions. One kind of decay, commonly called "slippery skin, " is characterized by the progression of soft rot down through {{one or two of the}} outer fleshy scales. These scales turn yellowish, soft, and are foul smelling. A second kind of soft rot is characterized by the interior of the bulb being totally macerated and putrid, but only slightly discolored. Only one or two of the outer fleshy scales remain firm. This decay is commonly called "stinking rot" because of its very offensive odor. Initial appearance of <b>bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> in the third week of June is directly related to occurrence of rain and cool, cloudy weather in the previous week. Occurrence of such periods of inclement weather are found to be predictable when past records of local climatological conditions are analyzed. Area-wide outbreaks throughout the remainder of the growing season also are related to such periods of inclement weather. The relationship between weather and disease suggests that outbreaks of <b>bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> can be forecast by occurrence of such periods of inclement weather. Irrigation of onions with contaminated surface waters significantly increases the amount of <b>bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> in the field, at harvest time, and in storage, over that found when uncontaminated well water is used. Varying the frequency of irrigations, the rates of application, and the size of sprinkler nozzles affect the amount of soft rot in the field and in storage somewhat less than does the source of water. Longer and more frequent periods of irrigation increase the incidence of <b>bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rot.</b> Much of the decay seen at harvest is either soft rot which has totally decayed the bulbs and will not go into storage, or is fungal in origin. Including storage rots which are fungal in origin under the general grouping of "soft rots" inflates the estimation of losses due to <b>bacterial</b> <b>soft</b> <b>rot.</b> Three isolates of seventeen unknown isolates capable of decaying inoculated onion bulbs were identified as Pseudomonas cepacia.

In this study, we present novel insights into the phylogeny and virulence of the <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> model Pectobacterium sp.

Genomic approaches, including proteome and genome comparisons of all sequenced <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> bacteria, revealed that SCC 3193, previously included in the species Pectobacterium carotovorum, can now be more accurately classified as Pectobacterium wasabiae. Together with the recently revised phylogeny of a few P. carotovorum strains and an increasing number of studies on P. wasabiae, our work indicates that P. wasabiae has been unnoticed but present in potato fields worldwide. A combination of genomic approaches and in planta experiments identified features that separate SCC 3193 and other P. wasabiae strains from the rest of <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> bacteria, such as the absence of a type III secretion system that contributes to virulence of other <b>soft</b> <b>rot</b> species.
