40|$|The {{case for}} or against craft {{training}} in construction {{from the perspective of}} constructors, owners, governments, workers, and other stakeholders is not completely clear, despite several studies to date. The business case for investing in construction craft training is examined from the employer’s perspective on a construction project. A survey of 93 training directors and construction managers from throughout the US construction industry was used to collect quantitative estimates regarding craft training benefits and learning rates. Using these data, a <b>benefit</b> to <b>cost</b> <b>ratio</b> was calculated for a hypothetical typical industrial project (the CII model plant). According to the analyses, the estimated <b>benefit</b> to <b>cost</b> <b>ratios</b> range from 1. 5 : 1 to 3. 0 : 1. While these ratios are based on expert opinion, the results were triangulated with actual data from company training and project performance records as well as results from other research studies. The estimated <b>benefit</b> to <b>cost</b> <b>ratios</b> on the study’s hypothetical industrial project are sensitive to the craft workers’ employment duration, assuming that the training is provided by a single employer. Training durations are likely to be longer under a ‘community training’ model in which firms collaborate to sponsor training and workers have greater opportunities to continue in their training programme as they move from firm to firm. Nevertheless, the results contribute to a growing body of evidence that an investment in craft training is economically attractive for an employer, even over a typical project life cycle.

40|$|<b>Benefit</b> <b>cost</b> <b>ratios</b> (BCR) {{have been}} applied to {{conservation}} decisions for two reasons: cost-efficiency and transparency in decision making. Because BCRs are <b>ratios</b> of <b>benefits</b> to <b>costs,</b> the uncertainties associated with the two components (<b>benefits</b> and <b>costs)</b> are compounded. Therefore, BCRs can potentially involve more uncertainty than allocation strategies based solely on maximizing benefits. The robustness of decisions, defined here as the inverse {{of the number of}} misallocations due to uncertainties in <b>benefits</b> and <b>costs</b> of projects, is an unexplored component of applying BCRs to conservation decision making. To investigate the robustness to uncertainty of conservation investment with BCRs, we developed an information-gap model (info-gap) for using BCRs in selecting "portfolios" of conservation projects. Our model allows us to explore how uncertain we can be in our estimates of <b>benefit</b> and <b>cost</b> parameters while still selecting a portfolio that performs better than a critical threshold of misallocations perceived to be unacceptable.

5000|$|The credit {{against the}} Federal tax {{may be reduced}} if the state has an {{outstanding}} advance (commonly called a “loan”). When states lack the funds to pay UI benefits, they may obtain loans from the federal government. To assure that these loans are repaid, and in accordance with Title XII of the Social Security Act, {{the federal government is}} entitled to recover those monies by reducing the FUTA credit it gives to employers, which is the equivalent of an overall increase in the FUTA tax. When a state has an outstanding loan balance on January 1 for two consecutive years, and the full amount of the loan is not repaid by November 10 of the second year, the FUTA credit will be reduced until the loan is repaid. This process is commonly called FUTA Credit Reduction and was designed as an involuntary repayment mechanism. The reduction schedule is 0.3% for the first year and an additional 0.3% for each succeeding year until the loan is repaid. From the third year onward, there may be additional reduction(s) in the FUTA tax credit (commonly dubbed [...] "add-ons").
