5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could not bear to put her in danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E
5|$|When he is 43, {{during what}} is to be his last year of life, Henry time travels to a Chicago parking garage on a frigid winter night where he is unable to find shelter. As a result of the {{hypothermia}} and frostbite he suffers, his feet are amputated when he returns to the present. Henry and Clare <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> without the ability to escape when he time travels, Henry will certainly die within his next few jumps. On New Year's Eve 2006 Henry time travels {{into the middle of the}} Michigan woods in 1984 and is accidentally shot by Clare's brother, a scene foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Henry returns to the present and dies in Clare's arms.|$|E
25|$|In early {{versions}} of the story, Duryodhana is also motivated {{by the idea that}} no matter what, Hastinapur should not remain divided. Yudhishthira shares this belief; <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> eventually, a conflict will arise and the nation will be ultimately reunified.|$|E
60|$|In that divine moment, {{when their}} mouths met, <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> their souls were one.|$|R
6000|$|They <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{she meant}} the reticent father and daughter, and March flung out, [...] "I shouldn't {{want them to}} think you weren't. There's {{such a thing as}} overdoing." ...|$|R
60|$|And all {{the while}} up and down paced Amyas and Sir Richard, talking long, earnestly, and slow; for they <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the turning point of the boy's life was come.|$|R
500|$|Book One {{is set in}} the café {{society of}} young American expatriates in Paris. [...] In the opening scenes, Jake plays tennis with his college friend Robert Cohn, picks up a prostitute (Georgette), and runs into Brett and Count Mippipopolous in a nightclub. Later, Brett tells Jake she loves him, but they <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they have no chance at a stable relationship.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} discussion {{about his relationship}} with Westfeldt, Hamm said: [...] "We may not have a piece of paper that says we're husband and wife, but after 10 years, Jennifer {{is more than just a}} girlfriend. What we have is much deeper and we <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> To me, people get married when they're ready to have kids, which I'm not ruling out." [...] Along with Westfeldt, Hamm has appeared in Gap-related campaign advertisements. During April 2009, Hamm and Westfeldt formed their own production company, Points West Pictures. Hamm and Westfeldt are advocates of animal rescue and have adopted a mixed breed dog named Cora from the Much Love Animal Shelter in California.|$|E
500|$|On January 5, 1996, a new {{development}} thrust the travel office matter again to the forefront. A two-year-old memo from White House director of administration David Watkins surfaced that identified First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as the motivating force behind the firings, with the additional involvement of Vince Foster and Harry Thomason. [...] "Foster regularly informed me that the First Lady was concerned and desired action. The action desired was the firing of the Travel Office staff." [...] Written in fall 1993, apparently intended for McLarty, the Watkins memo also said [...] "we <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there would be hell to pay" [...] if [...] "we failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes." [...] This memo contradicted the First Lady's previous statements in the GAO investigation, that she had played {{no role in the}} firings and had not consulted with Thomason beforehand; the White House also found it difficult to explain why the memo was so late in surfacing when all the previous investigations had requested all relevant materials. [...] House committee chair Clinger charged a cover-up was taking place and vowed to pursue new material.|$|E
60|$|He seemed {{unable to}} go on, and yet <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he had {{something}} important to tell them. He looked at them vacantly, as though {{all he had to}} say was suddenly gone out of his mind.|$|R
60|$|So {{presently}} they <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} blocked {{out of one}} another's houses {{for some time to}} come, and Dr. Gallagher walked forward and told Mr. Smith, who had never studied Greek, about Champlain crossing the rock divide.|$|R
50|$|Rhodes {{proposed}} that they merge the De Beers DMC into Kimberley Central DMC, forming one new consolidated company; De Beers Consolidated Mines. The merger made sense, {{even though they}} <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the merger would upset some of the shareholders.|$|R
2500|$|Gilbert {{wrote to}} a colleague, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish I had never built the Woolworth Building because I fear it may be regarded as my only work and you and I <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{whatever it may be}} in dimension and in certain lines it is after all only skyscraper." ...|$|E
2500|$|The game on {{the right}} {{is the same as the}} above game except that player 2 does not know what player 1 does when he comes to play. The first game {{described}} has perfect information; the {{game on the}} right does not. If both players are rational and <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> both players are rational and everything that is known by any player is known to be known by every player (i.e. player 1 knows player 2 knows that player 1 is rational and player 2 knows this, etc. ad infinitum), play in the first game will be as follows: player 1 knows that if he plays U, player 2 will play D' [...] (because for player 2 a payoff of 1 is preferable to a payoff of 0) and so player 1 will receive 2. However, if player 1 plays D, player 2 will play U' [...] (because to player 2 a payoff of 2 is better than a payoff of 1) and player 1 will receive 1. Hence, in the first game, the equilibrium will be (U, D' [...] ) because player 1 prefers to receive 2 to 1 and so will play U and so player 2 will play D' [...]|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't deceive {{us for a}} minute!" [...] she cried. [...] "Not for a second. We <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you've been enjoying {{yourself}} immensely. Hasn't he, Katharine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can look}} at it, but you can't handle it," [...] said Dave, and he gave Roger a look that the senator's son well understood. <b>Both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the money-lender's son could not be trusted with such an {{important}} bit of evidence.|$|R
50|$|The MWR and M&MR <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> their {{approaches}} to Llanidloes covered {{exactly the same}} ground. This caused the M&MR to prioritise work on this section, working west from Llangurig. Resultantly, by 1861 the surveyors and navvies of the two competing workforces were physically clashing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me and Petty <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> gang, {{and they}} knew us. The year before Perry married, him and me {{was in the same}} ranger company--and we fought that outfit down on the San Miguel, and brought back Ben Trimble and two others for murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} helped, sir. Miss Baker {{can do nothing}} in the matter now; nor can any one else. We <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the {{marriage}} would not suit us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{no use for}} you to try {{to speak}} of what I have done in Brittany, when we <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> your heart is full of what I did in Poitou." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, if you command it, Doctor, needs must;--but I {{can tell}} you there is a man we <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> has a {{thousand}} reasons at least for keeping him in the public ward." ...|$|E
5000|$|The FIA {{issues a}} {{statement}} detailing its reasons behind the sanctions imposed on McLaren. In the statement, the FIA said that emails between the McLaren drivers {{proved that the}} British-based team used information leaked from title rivals Ferrari. The FIA statement also said [...] "The emails show unequivocally that both Mr Alonso and Mr de la Rosa received confidential Ferrari information via Mike Coughlan. <b>Both</b> drivers <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> this information was confidential Ferrari information and <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the information was being received by Coughlan from Nigel Stepney".|$|R
6000|$|Irene {{looked at}} her a moment, and then, {{whatever}} thought was in her mind, said fiercely, [...] "Well!" [...] and left her to her dismay--her dismay and her relief, for they <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{this was the last}} time they should ever speak of that again.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{understand}} the question rightly, they who have thought proper {{to take their}} children away from your school because of Mr. Peacocke, have done so because that gentleman continued {{to live with that}} lady when they <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> they were not man and wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do it then, and let 'em <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you're there. Yes, Parkyns, I'll divide. And, Clavvy, you {{can come}} in now in Griggs' place." [...] Then Captain Clavering {{stripped}} himself for the battle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't keep away," [...] Julia said simply. [...] "I thought I'd better let you <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{the street}} below is filling up. They've heard that you are here. People were running away from before the Midland as I came round the corner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] said Miggles, [...] "it {{would be}} playing it rather low down on Jim to take {{advantage}} of his being so helpless. And then, too, if we were man and wife, now, we'd <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I was bound to do what I do now of my own accord." ...|$|E
60|$|The Golden Age of Hursley did not deduce all its honour {{from the}} manor house. The vicarage {{was perhaps the}} true centre of the light which the Park reflected, or rather <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> their {{radiance}} alike came from One Source above, in whose Light they sought to walk.|$|R
60|$|No {{words were}} needed. <b>Both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{something}} had happened to them during the last few moments; something which might be ignored but could not be forgotten. They were no longer acquaintances; the tie of friendship had broken with the strain and could be replaced only by a stronger bond.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} certain," [...] Arnold declared, vigorously, [...] "that {{if there}} has been anything irregular in her uncle's life, Miss Lalonde knew nothing of it. We <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he talked wildly, but, for the rest, his doings have been as much a mystery to her as to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall it be {{a bargain}} between us? Say so, and {{whatever}} is mine shall be mine and yours too. Though a Jew {{may not make}} a Christian his wife, a Jewish girl may love a Christian maiden; and then, Nina, we shall <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we have done our very best for him whom we both love better than all the world beside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{would be}} of no value at all," [...] Selingman admitted. [...] "It {{is not in the}} crockery {{business}} that I propose to make use of you. I believe that we <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> We may dismiss it from our minds. It is only fencing with words. I will take you a little further. You have heard, by chance, of the Anglo-German Peace Society?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Huh! As if you didn’t know why!” replied Roger, with {{something}} like a chuckle. “Don’t they <b>both</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Jessie is the very apple of your eye, and that anything that brings trouble to her will cut you to the heart? Of course they know that, Dave, and you can rest assured that {{they will try to}} hurt you quite as much through Jessie as they’ll try to hurt you direct.” ...|$|E
50|$|Brians {{left school}} at 14 {{to try to}} make money by doing a variety of jobs before running her own stableyard. Haslam set up her own {{business}} as soon as she was old enough.

50|$|By 1938, Reese was the Colonels' regular shortstop {{and one of}} the top {{prospects}} in the minors, and so impressed Boston Red Sox farm director Billy Evans that he recommended the Red Sox buy the team.

6000|$|... "And {{about your}} debts? Of course I couldn't pay debts which were always increasing. And of course your {{promises}} {{for the future}} were false.

He is dead now." ...|$|R
