Interestingly, the fifth stage, where one would seek to leverage the strength of a variety of methods by using appropriate consensus and ensemble mechanisms has barely been investigated.

It has been shown, that under {{the conditions of the}} chronic effect of the technogenous contaminations, the leading role adheres to the stereo typic distrophy-atrophic variations of the covering epithelium of the cornificating and mucous zones, lining the stomach cavity. With the ultrastructural investigation, the reduction of structures of the protein-synthesizing compartment of the cover-hollow epitheliocytes leading to the minimization of the secretory function, has been revealed.

The revealed morphological peculiarities of the covering epithelium can be considered as the <b>biological</b> <b>criterion</b> of the ecological trouble of the biogeocenosis, not possessing the specificity, concerning any factor of the medium, and the mice-species rodents can serve as the test object of the ecological monitoring.

50|$|As an example, the United States employs {{water quality}} {{standards}} {{as part of}} its regulation of surface water quality under the CWA. The national Water Quality Standards (WQS) Program begins with U.S. states designating intended uses (e.g., recreation, drinking water, natural habitat) for a surface water bodies, after which they develop science-based water quality criteria. The criteria include numeric pollutant concentration limits, narrative goals (e.g., free from algae blooms), and narrative <b>biological</b> <b>criteria</b> (i.e., the aquatic life that should be able to live in the waterbody). If the water body fails the existing WQS criteria, the state must develop a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for pollutants of concern.

[...] While it is for the Contracting state to determine conditions around legal gender recognition for post-operative transsexuals and its effect on existing heterosexual marriages, a transsexual should not be barred from enjoying the right to marry in any case.

40|$|The genus Brucella {{contains}} alpha-Proteobacteria {{adapted to}} intracellular life within cells {{of a variety}} of mammals. Controversy has arisen concerning Brucella internal taxonomy, and it has been proposed that the DNA–DNA hybridization-based genomospecies concept be applied to the genus. According to this view, only one species, Brucella melitensis, should be recognized, and the classical species should be considered as biovars (B. melitensis biovar melitensis; B. melitensis biovar abortus; etc.). However, a critical reappraisal of the species concept, a review of the population structure of bacteria and the analysis of Brucella genetic diversity by methods other than DNA–DNA hybridiza-tion show that there are no scientific grounds to apply the genomospecies concept to this genus. On the other hand, an enlarged biological species concept allows the definition of Brucella species that are consistent with molecular analyses and support the taxonomical standing of most classical species. Both the host range as a long-recognized <b>biological</b> <b>criterion</b> and the presence of species-specific markers in outer membrane protein genes and in other genes show that B. melitensis, B. abortus, B. ovis, B. canis and B. neotomae are not mere pathovars (or nomenspecies) but biologically meaningful species.
