50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the centre line of the <b>disc</b> <b>seat</b> and body seal (offset one), and the centre line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve the <b>disc</b> <b>seat</b> contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between <b>disc</b> and <b>seat.</b> In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal {{so that it can}} be machined such as to achieve a bubble tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{summarize}} the available evidence about total lumbar disc replacement (TDR), focusing our attention on four main topics: clinical and functional outcomes, comparison with fusion surgery results, rate of complications and influence on sagittal balance. Materials and methods: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase, Medline, Medscape, Google Scholar and Cochrane library databases in order to answer our four main research questions. Effective data were extracted after the assessment of methodological quality of the trials. Results: Fifty-nine pertinent papers were included. Clinical and functional scores show statistically significant improvements, and they last at all time points compared to baseline. The majority of the articles show there is no significant difference between TDR groups and fusion groups. The literature shows similar rates of complications between the two surgical procedures. Conclusions: TDR showed significant safety and efficacy, comparable to lumbar fusion. The major advantages of a lumbar TDR over fusion include maintenance of segmental motion and the restoration of the disc height, allowing patients to find their own spinal <b>balance.</b> <b>Disc</b> arthroplasty could be a reliable option in the treatment of degenerative disc disease in years to come.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{balancing}} {{devices have}} been created to reduce machinery vibration especially in a high-speed rotor system which is very sensitive to the rotating mass unbalance. The best solution is that this device can self-perceive vibration changes and then respond these changes in an optimized way according to the different situations, which means it is a self-recovery system. According to this consideration, an electromagnetic driven bi-disc compensator for rotor auto-balancing is proposed here. In this system, rotor unbalance is online identified and calculated, after that the <b>balancing</b> <b>discs</b> will be driven to the best compensating positions, so that the unbalance can be suppressed or eliminated. Long transition time and transient vibration enhancement are terrible roadblocks which limit the industry applications of such auto-balancing system. To solve these deficiencies, a freely rotation bi-disc strategy was established and the solutions of two special cases were also discussed. A rotor auto-balancing test rig was build up. Experiments using the new solution on this rig showed that the electromagnetic compensator could be moved more accurate and effective, by which not only the balancing time was reduced, but also the transient vibration enhancement was avoided...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} {{of a model}} of the foundation of a rotary machine has been recently attempted by using the difference between two sets of response data at some of the bearing locations from two consecutive rundowns of the machine, with and without known unbalance weights at certain positions on the two <b>balance</b> <b>discs</b> of each rotor respectively. However, {{it would be a great}} advantage to be able to perform the estimation with a single rundown. Due to practical restrictions in performing such tests (accessibility, costs etc.), there are cases in which data for only one rundown are available. In this case, the unbalance configuration is unknown and has, therefore, to be estimated, in addition to the unknown foundation model. Due to the special form of the unbalance force, this overall inverse problem can be solved by eliminating the unbalance configuration from the model estimation process. The remaining equation to estimate the foundation model consists of the projection of the response data, where the associated projector depends on the foundation model parameter. First results using the method, applied to a laboratory test rig and to a commercial turbo-generator, are presented...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} distinctly freestyle disc maneuver was the tip, the act of quickly pressing fingers {{on the bottom of}} the disc to maintain or alter its position without catching the disc or letting it fall to the ground.

This was the first freestyle event held in the US. The nail delay involves <b>balancing</b> the <b>disc</b> on the fingernail while the disc continues to spin.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{four sets}} of tests sponsored by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and conducted by the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The tests support research addressing {{the need to provide}} assurance that motor-operated valves are able to perform their intended safety function, usually to open or close against specified (design basis) flow and pressure loads. One of the parameters that affects a gate valve's operability is the friction between the <b>disc</b> <b>seats</b> and the valve body seats. In most gate valves, these surfaces are hardfaced with Stellite 6, a cobalt-based alloy. The tests described in this report investigate the changes that occur in the friction as the Stellite 6 surfaces develop an oxide film as they age. Stellite 6 specimens were aged in a corrosion autoclave, the oxide films were examined and characterized, and the specimens were subjected to friction testing in a friction autoclave. A very thin oxide film formed after only a fe w days of natural aging. Even a very thin oxide film caused an increase in friction. The surface structure of the oxide film was dominated by a hard crystalline structure, such that the friction response was analogous to rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. In the limited data provided by naturally aged specimens (78 days maximum exposure, very thin oxide films), the friction increased with greater aging time, approaching an as-yet-undetermined plateau. Although the thickness of the oxide film increased with greater aging time, the mechanical properties of the oxide film (larger granules with greater aging time) appeared to play a greater role in the friction response. Friction testing of specimens subjected to simulated in-service testing strokes at intervals during the aging process showed only a slight decrease in friction, compared to other specimens. Results from specimens subjected to accelerated aging were inconclusive, because of differences in the structure and comp osition of the oxide films, compared to naturally aged specimens. For the naturally aged specimens, the highest friction occurred on the first stroke. The first stroke smeared the oxide film and dislodged some of the granules, so that subsequent strokes saw lower friction values and less variation in the friction. This result underscores the importance of planning in-plant tests so that data are collected from the first stroke following a period of inactivity...|$|R
