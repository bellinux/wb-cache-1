5000|$|On May 10, in {{anticipation}} of the ceremony, Union Pacific's No. 119 and Central Pacific's No. 60 (better known as the Jupiter) locomotives were drawn up face-to-face on Promontory Summit, separated only by the width of a single tie. It is unknown how many people attended the event; estimates run from as low as 500 to as many as 3,000 government and railroad officials, and track workers. Social historians later thought the lack of Chinese workers seen in the official portrait was due to racism; however, their absence may well have been simply the result of poor timing: The more famous A.J. Russell photograph could not include the Chinese workers photographed earlier participating in the joining of the rails ceremony because at the moment the famous photo was being taken it was after the conclusion of the ceremony and the Chinese workers were away from the two locomotives to dine at J.H. Strobridge's <b>boarding</b> <b>car,</b> being honored and cheered by the CPRR (Central Pacific Railroad) management.Fifty years later, three of the eight Chinese workers who brought up the last rail were guests of honor at the Promontory Summit's golden anniversary celebrations in Ogden, Utah, in May 1919.The event at Promontory Summit, which was billed as the [...] "wedding of the rails", was officiated by the Reverend John Todd. Three spikes were driven: one (and probably the most famous) was the gold spike, one was silver, and one was a mix of gold, silver, and iron. In 1898, the golden spike was donated to the Stanford Museum (now Cantor Arts Center). The last laurel tie was destroyed in fires caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Stanford University loaned the original 1869 gold spike to Cecil B. DeMille for the film Union Pacific (1939). It was held aloft in the scene commemorating the actual event (a brass prop was used for the hammering sequence).|$|E
40|$|Oral history {{interview}} with Colin Pike, conducted by Dale Jarvis and Terra Barrett, {{with his son}} Wayne Pike present. Colin talks about growing up, the different jobs he had, including working on the railway, as a logger, and with Newfoundland Power as a lineman. He also talks about his father, including his service during the First World War, and {{his life as a}} trapper. Recorded at the office of the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, 1 Springdale Street, St. John's. 0 : 00 Colin Pike was born in Charleston, NL on January 31 st, 1929; 0 : 30 Colin names his parents, Alfred and Aurora Pike. Mother’s maiden name was Quinton – possibly a distant relative to the Red Cliff Quintons. The Pikes came from Carbonear. Colin is related to the pirate. 01 : 20 Colin’s grandfather came to Jamestown from Carbonear. His father moved to Charleston after he got married. 01 : 38 Colin comes from a family of 10 children. Remembers playing games as a child – games that they would make up. Also remembers swimming in a pool in the brook near the harbour – swimming early in the season (May). Would make things to pass the time. They would go sliding in the winter time. 03 : 00 Colin describes what school was like. He was late going to school – attended the Anglican school because that was all that was available. Went there for a couple of years, around 1938 - 1939. Described arguments and “scattered fights” between the United and Anglican kids (because Anglicans went to school and the United kids didn’t). Colin’s parents took them out of school after {{it got to the point}} that the kids no longer wanted to go. Finally, the minister at the time wanted to have a place for the children to go to school that wasn’t the Anglican school. Colin’s grandmother was living alone and had a house with a living room that wasn’t used, so she offered up her living room to be used as a classroom. The minister found a teacher and the children attended school in Colin’s grandmother’s living room. Doesn’t remember the name of the minister, but the teacher was Mary (he thinks) Janes from Grates Cove. There were 12 - 15 students. Everyone had to provide their own seat and desk. Colin made his own desk, with no help from anyone. By the time the school year ended in June, there was a school being constructed for the United children (1942). 1943 September, the new school was opened, even though the building wasn’t finished. Teacher was Rina King from Random Island. Colin finished school that year, in 1944. 06 : 07 After he finished school, Colin went to work. He was 16 years old, and went to work in the lumber woods (AND Company and Price? Bowaters?). Worked in a lumber camp in the forest near Terra Nova, cutting wood. Was there for a month and went home. Later that year he went to another lumber camp in Indian Bay. Part of the time he was there, he worked in the cookhouse as a “cookie”, helping the cook, peeling potatoes, etc. 07 : 40 Colin’s son, Wayne, reminds his father about a story of a plane crash he mentioned that morning. Colin doesn’t remember where he was, but he remembers hearing about when the Sabena Airliner crashed in Gander Lake. References cemetery where the victims were buried. 08 : 21 Later that year (1946) Colin and his brother and another gentleman decided to go to another lumber camp. His brother had been working on the military base in Stephenville (Harman Field?), and Colin really wanted to work there, but since everyone was going into the woods he went with them. Camp was near Badger. Were late getting to Badger because a train derailed ahead of them. They finally got to Badger and the next day went into the woods. 09 : 16 Colin didn’t want to go into the woods, he wanted to go to Stephenville. After a day in the woods it started to rain, so everyone went back to camp. Colin intent on not staying. He took his axe and his saw and walked them out of the camp, hiding them under a tree in case he needed them. Rain stopped and sun came out in afternoon, so Colin’s brother and friends went back into the woods. Colin went and got his saw, turned it in, jumped on the truck and left camp to head for Harman Field. 10 : 13 Colin took the train from Badger to Stephenville. Describes arriving and being shocked at the crowd of people there. Took a taxi onto the base. Ran into his second cousin (he’d known he was there). His cousin directed him to the employment office. Next day, he was hired on as a kitchen helped in the mess hall. September 1946. He was there until Christmas, and then he went home. 11 : 17 It was the early days, but Colin says they were already using the base to service planes, etc. He remembers servicemen being at the base, and serving them in the mess hall. Says they served 2000 men every morning for breakfast. Worked night shift for a little while – would go to work at midnight and spend the night cracking eggs for breakfast. 12 : 08 Colin lived in the dormitory on the base while he worked there. Later he went back to the base, working for a contractor, and had to find his own accommodation off the base. Colin, his brother, and another man lived in a canvas tent on someone’s lawn for three months. That was in 1948. 12 : 42 He was working as a maintenance man on the base, cleaning, sweeping, etc. A building was being renovated so they would pick up boards, scrape paint off windows with razors. Thinks they were finishing the dormitories then. He enjoyed being in Stephenville, being away from home, considered it an adventure. When payday came, they were paid in American dollars (because it was an US base), in cash. Canadian cash, but they were rated in American dollars. Cash in an envelope. 14 : 33 Worked as a postmaster in the early 50 s. When he left Stephenville, he thinks he went home, and worked as a fisherman for a bit. Remembers whole family going handlining in one boat. Father was a fisherman, but not very serious, used to do hand-lining. One summer they fished quite a bit in the late 40 s. 15 : 27 Colin’s son, Wayne, clarifies that it was June 1948 when Colin went to Stephenville the second time with “Hugh and Bert”. June 22. He made 63 cents an hour in Stephenville. Pay in the lumber woods depended on how much wood you cut. When he was a “cookie” he got an hourly pay. 16 : 49 Describes how he became postmaster in the post office in Charleston, what he did. Was there for a few years. Mail would arrive by train from Clarenville; sometimes three times a week, sometimes every day. Someone would pick the mail up from the train and bring it to Colin at the post office. Then he would sort it. 1952 - 1957 he worked at the post office. 18 : 29 Colin describes how he learned to wire houses. Bought a book from a department store catalogue and learned from that. Wired his own house first, then wired some others. Kept doing it until you needed a permit and to have it inspected, then he stopped. He wired Wayne’s house in Gander in 1986 and it was the only house on the street that passed inspection the first time. 20 : 25 Colin talks about building his own house. It was his first house in Charleston. He’d never built a house before. Learned how to do carpenter work and just did it. Didn’t have any wiring; there was no power at the time. Just used kerosene lanterns. Talks about Wayne blowing out the lamplight before going to bed when he was young. 21 : 15 Colin talks about how he met his wife. They were second-cousins, living in the same community. It was a small community, not very many people lived there. They stayed in Charleston until he went to work with the Newfoundland Power Commission as a lineman. 22 : 06 Went to trade school in Seal Cove to do a lineman course. Was placed with a crew in Grand Falls after he finished. Started school in Seal Cove in November 1965. Finished in April (1966), then was on contract in Swift Current for 6 months. There until October, and then he went to Grand Falls in October 1966. 23 : 45 Colin talks about working for the railway. Seasonal with the maintenance gangs. One summer out of Gaff Topsails. Wasn’t much to do in the evenings after work, would go berry picking. Maintenance meant laying new rails to replace ones that were worn, heavier rails, ballast replacement. Mostly rails. Talks about replacing the rails between Millertown Junction and Gaff Topsails with a heavier rail over the course of one summer. 40 - 50 men on a maintenance crew, covering half a mile. Men lifting rails. Most Colin did was drive spikes. Talks about how that happened. They lived in a <b>boarding</b> <b>car,</b> and had a meal car for meals. Food was good. Really good cooks. 26 : 49 Colin says he enjoyed working for Hydro as a lineman. Worked for them from 1965 - 1989, but doing different things. When he finished in 1989 he was working in the maintenance shop in Bishop’s Falls, testing safety equipment like heaving rubber gloves used by linemen. Testing the sticks for handling high lines. That was the last job he held with Hydro. 28 : 04 Colin still lives in Charleston. Lived in Grand Falls until 3 years after he retired. They’d maintained a house in Charleston where they would go on holiday. They moved back in 1993. In 2001 his wife passed away. He’s lived there on his own ever since. Called the death of his wife “end of an era”. Describes going camping with his wife when they were married. He sold the motor home after she died. 30 : 28 Colin describes how the town has changed since he was a boy. They have electricity now, paved roads, but it’s still the same place, you know everyone the same as you always did. 30 : 55 Colin describes what Christmases were like when he was a boy. Says they were an exciting time in his life. Talks about the busyness of the season. Christmas night you would hang up your stocking and go to bed, but not go to sleep. At first light, you would be up and down the stairs with one sock on (because the other was hanging on the wall). Says they’d have something special, like sheep or cow or something like that, to eat for Christmas, with plenty of homegrown vegetables. 32 : 49 Doesn’t remember his father letting mummers into the house. They would come to the door, but he’d hardly ever let them in. Colin went mummering around to houses lots of times. Would wear whatever he could get, as long as it covered him up. They were mummers, not jannys. Would last the full 12 days of Christmas, and especially the day before Christmas. They would have a glass of syrup and a piece of cake. Colin’s father never let them dance, but at some houses they would. 34 : 17 Colin talks about Bonfire Night. They would be preparing for weeks before the bonfire. Cut up every bush they could find; anything that was too big to cut down, they’d trim the limbs. Talks about the order of wood that they would burn. They would run through the smoke, sometimes accidently burn a hole in a jacket. Wayne asked if there were many fires; Colin replied there would fires all over the place. Colin’s family would set up their fire on the potato garden behind their house. Boys would get up to mischief. Says sometimes they would sneak over and light a pile of boughs on fire before the bonfire. Sometimes they’d steal things to burn. Would roast potatoes, dried capelin, marshmallows. 37 : 40 Colin says on Christmas Eve people would fire off guns. Talks about firing off a muzzle loading gun – loading and firing it, and the flash of flame from the muzzle – every Christmas. Would also fire off the gun after cleaning it. Also New Year’s Eve. 38 : 54 Colin says there were dances at the school around Christmas; there was always a concert. Teacher would organize it. People playing accordion, fiddles, etc. Family called Picketts that lived down the shore. Very musical family; would play for any concert that they had. Stan Pickett and another brother, played accordion and the violin. Colin wasn’t a dancer, never tried it. They’d take the school over, clear out the chairs, and get the music going, in the one room school (Anglican School). Doesn’t remember there being a dance after the new United School was built. The Orange Lodge would always have something on around Christmas. 41 : 06 Colin wasn’t involved with the Orange Lodge, but thinks his brother Chesley was. They had parades on Christmas Eve. Doesn’t know if it was Orange Lodge or what, but there was a parade right through Charleston. Remembers sitting in the windows of their house because the parade went right by there, watching. No band, but there might have been some music. Possibly an accordion, probably a drum. Salvation Army were popular at one time and had parades. That died out. Orange Society had parades after the SA left. Easter Parades as well. 42 : 45 Scattered person who was a good storyteller. One man could tell a yarn. They would tell stories about fishing (catching the biggest fish, etc.), and other things. 43 : 19 Colin never went to Labrador 43 : 24 Colin says he can’t remember people telling ghost stories, though he’s sure they did. Can’t remember any stories about faeries. 43 : 53 Comments that there’s a lot of things you can’t remember. Things that used to happen. 44 : 00 Talks about where he would go camping. Provincial Parks. They would spend time almost every summer in Pippy Park. 44 : 44 Dale asks if Wayne has a favourite story of Colin’s that he hasn’t told yet. Wayne says the story of how he got accepted to trade school is interesting. Wayne and Colin both tell the story of Colin applying and being accepted to trade school to be a lineman. Exaggerated his education when he applied; he was turned down because of his age. Admitted to the course when someone dropped out. Finished top of his class. Talked about learning to climb power poles with spurs; how changes over time changed how they would access the power lines. 50 : 26 Colin saved a lot of his paperwork over the years (graduation certificate, National Defense Registry card from 1942, etc.). Tells about being registered with the National Defense Registry when he turned 16 in 1942. Had to have the card to apply for work. 51 : 40 Colin describes what the War met for Newfoundland. He said it was on the news, but didn’t mean much else. People followed the news on the radio. Half a dozen or so from back home who went overseas. Talked about what people from home did during the war. Only one person worked for the Forestry Corps. 53 : 21 Colin’s father was wounded during the First World War, and then went to the Forestry Corps after. Talked about how they would get the wood down the hill in Scotland. His was wounded in the hip/buttocks at Cambrai. Also a cousin was wounded, Wallace Pike. Both men were close. Colin’s father, Alfred, never talked about the war. Spoke about Forestry Corps, but not about battles. Dealt with shrapnel in his leg all his life; would complain about his leg in certain weather, but kept walking. Was a trapper in the forest. 56 : 58 Talks about father’s work as a trapper, selling furs to Hudson’s Bay Company. Favourite fur was muskrat. Always had rabbits. Train would go down three times a week; men on the train would want rabbits so they could sell them in Bonavista. His father would sell the rabbits on the train when the train came through. Walked for miles when checking traps. Used snares; guns would get in the way. Family would cook rabbits that they couldn’t sell. Talked about seeing people who would sell rabbits all the time, but no one does that now. 1 : 00 : 53 Father would ship the furs to the HBC office in St. John’s. Talked about treating the rabbit before shipping. Hunting season were spring and fall. Would also catch otters.
