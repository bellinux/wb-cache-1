25|$|A later UK light tank using a ranging gun is the FV101 Scorpion, {{which uses}} a 7.62mm L43A1 machine gun. This is mounted as a normal co-axial machine gun and {{may be used as}} such. it is a {{development}} of the standard British L8 Tk MG, used on a number of AFVs. It has an additional <b>barrel</b> <b>bearing</b> that is used to mount the gun. This bearing, rather than mounting by the receiver as for the L8, gives a more consistent point of impact between a cold and hot barrel, which is important for use when ranging.|$|E

50|$|The M1919A6 {{first saw}} combat {{service in the}} fall of 1943. It had a metal {{buttstock}} assembly that clamped to the backplate of the gun, and a front <b>barrel</b> <b>bearing</b> that incorporated both a muzzle booster and a bipod similar to that used on the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle (BAR). A lighter barrel than that of the M1919A4 was fitted, and a carry handle was attached to the barrel jacket {{to make it easier to}} carry. Previous designs could change the barrel, but it required field stripping the gun - the pistol grip back plate, bolt group and the trigger group all had to be removed before the barrel could finally be replaced, and this put the gun out of action for minutes, and risked losing and damaging parts in the field. The M1919A6 muzzle device allowed the gun crew to replace the barrel from the front, an improvement, but still an awkward procedure compared to other machine guns of the day.The M1919A6 was a heavy (32 lb) and awkward weapon in comparison with the MG34 (26 lb) and MG42 (25 lb) and was eventually replaced in US service by the M60 machine gun in the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|The L42A1 was a 7.62×51mm NATO {{conversion}} of the [...]303 British chambered Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk1(T) and No. 4 Mk1*(T) WWII-era British sniper rifles, which had remained in service for some time after the L1A1 variant of the 7.62mm FN FAL replaced the No.4 Lee-Enfield as the standard service rifle in 1957. It differed from other post-war No4 based variants in that the trigger remained hinged on the trigger guard as on the No4 Mk1 and 1*, not hung from the receiver as in the later No4 Mk 2, Mk 1/2 and Mk 1/3 [...]303 British rifles, and other 7.62×51mm NATO conversions. The conversion programme was carried out at Royal Small Arms Factory Enfield from 1970 to 1971. About 1,080 rifles were converted. A new hammer-forged heavy 7.62×51mm NATO barrel was installed, with four-groove, right hand twist rifling instead of the five-groove left-hand Enfield-type rifling used in [...]303 British barrels. The heavier barrel was free-floating, which meant that the required accuracy standard could be achieved without the <b>barrel</b> <b>bearing</b> against the wooden fore-end, as had {{been the case with}} the No.4 MkI(T). Therefore the woodwork was modified by shortening the fore-end to 1/2" [...] in front of the middle band, and a new design upper handguard was fitted. The No. 32 3.5 power telescopic sight was refurbished and the bullet drop compensation on the elevation drum modified for the ballistic characteristics of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge in 50 m increments out to 1000 m. The modified version was renamed the [...] "Telescope, Straight Sighting, L1A1". A new magazine suitable for the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge was attached; it is recognisable by its shape, which is more angular compared to the [...]303 British version. A hardened projection of the left magazine lip serves as an ejector, although the [...]303 ejector screw remained in place. The butt with its screwed-on cheekpiece was retained, however the scope number on the wrist of the stock, was obliterated with [...] "X"-outs, and new numbers applied. The markings {{on the left side of}} the receiver were obliterated and new markings reflecting the new rifle's designation and chambering were applied. The original markings are sometimes partially visible underneath. A new, larger transit case was made for the L42A1.|$|E

The rifles use McMillan stocks and extraordinarily thick Krieger <b>barrels</b> <b>bearing</b> an 18 lb muzzle brake. [...] Overall, depending on options, the rifles weigh from 85 to 120 lb and are therefore only useful for shooting from a bench rest or heavy bipod. Despite the weight, recoil is significant and shooters must be sure to choose components (i.e., scopes and bipods) that can handle the abuse. The sheer size, weight, and power of these rifles make them rather impractical for hunting use. SSK only manufactured three of these rifles and as of 2014 no longer produces the ammunition.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{substrate}} specificity of Thermoascus aurantiacus xylanase 10 A (TAX) {{has been investigated}} both biochemically and structurally. High resolution crystallographic analyses at 291 K and 100 K of TAX complexes with xylobiose show that the ligand is in its α anomeric conformation and provide a rationale for specificity on p-nitrophenyl glycosides at the − 1 and − 2 subsites. Trp 275, which is disordered in uncomplexed structures, is stabilised by its interaction with xylobiose. Two structural subsets in family 10 are identified, which differ by {{the presence or absence}} of a short helical stretch in the eighth βα-loop of the TIM <b>barrel,</b> the loop <b>bearing</b> Trp 275.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 221 Compared to {{leading edge}} {{technologies}} such as high speed turbomachinery, reciprocating pumps {{may appear to be}} a simple technology: A reciprocating plunger causes liquid to be drawn from a low pressure manifold through the suction check valves, and expelled into a high pressure manifold through the discharge check valves. However, the interaction of flow, valve dynamics, and the acoustics of the pump and piping system can generate high amplitude pressure pulsation, causing severe vibration and reliability problem in some systems. The effects of improperly operating valves, and the successful resolution of such problems with valve design modifications are examined. Since the pump vales are operated by the action of the fluid, valve components (including the spring, valve body, valve disc shape, and sealing surfaces, etc.) must be carefully selected to ensure that the valves open and close at the appropriate times. Problems associated with valve dynamics include over pressure spikes at the opening of discharge valves, under pressure spikes {{at the opening of the}} suction valves, high noise levels, and excessive wear of valve components. Severe over pressure spikes have been known to cause fatigue failures of pump working <b>barrels,</b> connecting rods, <b>bearings,</b> and even drive-train components. Under pressure spikes can cause cavitation that can also lead to plunger and valve failures, due to pitting damage. High level valve noise is usually indicative of sever impacts associated with the opening and closing of the valves. Impacts at the valve closing are sometimes referred to as valve hammer and can result in damage to the sealing surfaces. Impacts at the valve opening, which may be identified by damage to the back side of the valve disc, are due to the over pressure and under pressure spikes which can result in fatigue failures of the components. Excessive valve wear can also be experienced when the valve disc material is not suitable for the pumping conditions. The use of field data coupled with a computer model to analyze the valve dynamics will be presented. Using this tool, the effect of various valve modifications such as changes in sealing surfaces, valve lift, spring preload, and spring stiffness can be observed. Instrumentation and data analysis techniques to evaluate these problems will also be discussed. The effects of modifications to valves (including changes in lift, spring preload, spring construction and stiffness, valve disc geometries, etc.) will be examined using data from actual systems...|$|R
5000|$|... "DEATH OF MR HENRY, THE GUNMAKER - Mr Alex. Henry, {{whose name}} is a {{familiar}} one {{in connection with the}} improvement of the modern rifle, died at his residence at Bellevue Crescent, Edinburgh, on Saturday night, at the ripe age of seventy-six, after about a fortnights illness. He was a native of Leith. In his seventeenth year he was apprenticed to Mr Mortimer, gunmaker in Edinburgh, and in due course he started in business on his own account.He seems at an early period to have taken an interest in the improvement of firearms, and the nature of his business led him also to take a leading part in the Volunteer movement. Indeed it was claimed for him that he was the father of the Scottish Volunteers. As early as 1859 the late Anthony Macrae, W.S., and he were associated in the endeavour to start a Volunteer corps in Edinburgh, in connection with the movement which was then common throughout the country, owing to the unsettled state of affairs on the Continent.A list of citizens favourable to the idea, and headed by Mr Henrys name, was published, but the movement was not taken up heartily until the promulgation, later in the same year, of the Derby Government War Office circular. In consequence of this, the Lieutenancy of the city having moved in the matter, The First Citizens Company was formed. Mr Henry for a time served in the ranks as a private, but subsequently became Armourer-Sergeant of what was them known as the Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers.In recognition of his devoted services to the Queens Rifle Volunteers Brigade, he was offered in 1870 the appointment of quartermaster, with the rank of Lieutenant, and four years later he received the honorary rank of Captain. As Quartermaster he was a well-known figure at the regimental camps. It may be guessed that he took a deep interest in fostering the shooting efficient of the Brigade. In connection with the early musketry of the Brigade, he presented a valuable gold medal to the best shot. At the first gathering at Wimbledon in 1860 he brought credit to himself and the corps by getting a place among the Queens [...] "Twenty" [...] and tying for the silver medal. He took a deep interest in the City, and Mid-Lothian Rifle Association, at whose meeting one of the chief prizes was the [...] "Henry" [...] Challenge Vase. He retired from the service in 1889, on which occasion the following district order was issued:-"Headquarters, Edinburgh, September 6, 1889 - The Major-General commanding the forces in North Britain regrets that Captain and Quartermaster Henry, of the Queens Rifle Volunteer Brigade, is retiring from active service with his corps. The Major-General wishes to take this opportunity of recording his appreciation of Captain Henrys valuable services, not only to his regiment, but to the army at large, more especially with regard to his scientific researches concerning the Government rifle, and to his liberality in offering prizes to stimulate good shooting among the Volunteers - By Order"It is by reason of his scientific researches that Mr Henrys name has been most widely known. The principal result of these was the well-known gun barrel and ammunition which bear his name. The barrel was invented in 1859, but the Government was slow to recognise its utility, and it was only in 1871 that, after a series of exhaustive trials, it was recommended for adoption by the British Army in a gun in which the Henry barrel was conjoined with the Martini breech action.The first issue of the Martini-Henry rifle was made to the army in 1874, and it gradually superseded the older Snider breech-loader. The strong points of the rifle were its extreme accuracy at all ranges, the simplicity of its action, and the great penetrative power of the bullet; and in its day it was the finest weapon of the kind in Europe, The barrel was of calibre [...]45 of an inch, and its peculiarity was that it had seven grooves which made a complete turn in twenty-two inches. The grip of the barrel on the rifle was further increased by the fact that between the grooves there were angular projections so that the bullet, in its passage down the <b>barrel,</b> had fourteen <b>bearing</b> surfaces. In addition to the barrel used in the Martini-Henry combination, Mr Henry also invented a complete rifle, which was adopted by the Government of New South Wales. In 1876 Mr Henry was returned to the Town Council as a representative of St Georges Ward, and he continued to sit till about 1885 as the colleague of the late Mr John Hope and Sir Thomas Clark. He was a justice of the peace of the city, and an active Freemason. Mr Henry is survived by two sons and three daughters." ...|$|R
