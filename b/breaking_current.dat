50|$|Breaking {{capacity}} or {{interrupting rating}} {{is the current}} that a fuse, circuit breaker, or other electrical apparatus is able to interrupt without being destroyed or causing an electric arc with unacceptable duration. The prospective short circuit current which can occur under short circuit conditions should not exceed the rated breaking capacity of the apparatus. Otherwise breaking of the current cannot be guaranteed. Breaking capacity current corresponds to a voltage, so an electrical apparatus may {{have more than one}} breaking capacity current, according to the voltage. <b>Breaking</b> <b>current</b> may be stated in terms of the total current or just in terms of the alternating-current (symmetrical) component. Since the time of opening of a fuse or switch is not coordinated with the reversal of the alternating current, in some circuits the total current may be offset and can be larger than the alternating-current component by itself.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{results of}} {{electro-discharge}} proc-esses in vacuum arc interrupters on the developed and constructed synthetic test stand are described. The stand ensures a current amplitude up to 100 kA {{with a duration}} of 10 ± 1 ms at a voltage up to 5 kV and an amplitude of transient recovery voltage up to 40 kV. It contains two circuits working synchro-nously: a current pulse generator with the total capacity of 0. 073 F (with a power of ~ 0. 9 MJ at 5 kV) and a voltage pulse generator with an operating volt-age 40 kV (with the power equal to 0. 32 MJ at 40 kV). There is also a complex of control and measuring equipment which allows one to register current through the circuit-breaker being tested, measure arc voltage when the circuit-breaker contacts are opened and determine the form of the transient recovery voltage curve. The research carried out has allowed constructing a vacuum arc interrupter with a rated voltage of 10 kV, a rated current of 3, 150 A, a rated short-circuit <b>breaking</b> <b>current</b> of 40 kA and a vacuum circuit breaker VVE-(S) M- 10 - 40 / 3150 on its basis.

An initial guess for terminal inductance is found by applying a solid fault {{at the line}} end of the inductor and at the critical distance defined in [9] (distance travelled by waves along the cable or overhead line within half the breaker operating time). The simulations must be used to verify that selected terminal inductances ensure that the fault currents do not exceed the breaker limit within the maximum breaker operating time.
