5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer laser used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> to produce stimulated emission at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam {{interacts with the}} material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E

25|$|The plasma lasts about one-billionth of a second, {{requiring}} {{the pulse of}} protons, which lasts one-trillionth of a second, to be precisely synchronized. The proton beam is preceded by a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons,</b> generated by the same laser, that pushes away electrons in the boron plasma, allowing the protons more {{of a chance to}} collide with the boron nuclei and initiate fusion.|$|E
25|$|De Broglie's formula was {{confirmed}} {{three years later}} for electrons (which differ from photons in having a rest mass) with the observation of electron diffraction in two independent experiments. At the University of Aberdeen, George Paget Thomson passed a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> through a thin metal film and observed the predicted interference patterns.

50|$|Flash {{photolysis}} is {{an alternative}} to pulse radiolysis that uses high-power light pulses (e.g. from an excimer laser) rather than <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> to initiate chemical reactions.

25|$|Other {{completely}} {{different approach to}} microscopy is electron microscope (EM), which gives a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> {{in order to be}} focused onto the desired specimen with a design capable of giving a magnifying power up to 100,000 times.6 Electron microscopes are also used but very little when compared to light microscopes. (TEM) transmission electron microscope is more difficult to use and requires more sample preparation than scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thus have found very few applications in forensic science.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{electron}} lenses {{allows the}} geometry of the diffraction experiment to be varied. The conceptually simplest geometry referred to as {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED) is that of a parallel <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> incident on the specimen, with the specimen field selected using a sub-specimen image-plane aperture. However, by converging the electrons in a cone onto the specimen, one can in effect perform a diffraction experiment over several incident angles simultaneously. This technique is called Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED) and can reveal the full three-dimensional symmetry of the crystal.|$|E
25|$|Samples for SEM {{have to be}} {{prepared}} to withstand the vacuum conditions and high energy <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons,</b> and have to be of a size that will fit on the specimen stage. Samples are generally mounted rigidly to a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analyis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.|$|E

25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM, also sometimes conventional transmission {{electron microscopy}} or CTEM) is a microscopy technique in which a <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is most often an ultrathin section less than 100 nm thick or a suspension on a grid. An image is formed from {{the interaction of the}} electrons with the sample as the beam is transmitted through the specimen. The image is then magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen, a layer of photographic film, or a sensor such as a charge-coupled device.|$|E
25|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (SEM) {{is a type of}} electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons.</b> The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} beam lithography (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is {{the choice of a}} positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E

500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{electron}} microscopes exist: transmission and scanning.

The corpuscular properties of a particle are demonstrated when it is shown to have a localized position in space along its trajectory at any given moment. The wave-like nature of light is displayed, for example, when a beam of light is passed through parallel slits thereby creating interference patterns.
