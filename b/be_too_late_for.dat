5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date may well <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> {{man who was}} an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up {{at about the same}} time. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E

25|$|Violet is revived in the {{facility}} run by Garth, and {{she realizes that}} Six might not actually be dead. She storms the Archministry and reaches a laboratory just as Daxus {{is about to begin}} the dissection. In the ensuing fight, Daxus reveals that he uses enhancements he gained from an accidental exposure to the hemophage virus to aid in his rise to power. Violet kills Daxus and leaves with Six's body. Six later wakes up, having been immunized by the hemophage virus in Violet's tears. It is theorized that Six might, after all, be instrumental in formulating a cure for the hemophages, although it may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> Violet (who is nearing the end of her 12 years).|$|E

25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> <b>For</b> {{we have no way of}} reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E
500|$|The third main {{theory is}} that Quistclose trusts could be {{constructive}} trusts, which are created when the future trustee uses the money in an [...] "unconscionable" [...] manner. In Quistclose situations, the requirement of [...] "unconscionableness" [...] could be met by the borrower using the money for a purpose {{other than the one}} for which it was lent, allowing the lender to claim an equitable interest in it. In Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd, the Quistclose trust principle was said by Peter Gibson J. to be that [...] "equity fastens on the conscience of the person who receives from another property transferred for a specific purpose only and not therefore for the recipient's [...] own purposes, so that such person will not be permitted to treat the property as his own or to use it for other than the stated purpose"; this reference to [...] "conscience" [...] could make Quistclose trusts constructive in nature. However, no constructive trust could be created until the money is misused, which may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> an effective remedy.|$|E
2500|$|In 232, {{when the}} Wu general Lu Xun led troops to attack Lujiang Commandery (廬江郡; around present-day Lu'an, Anhui), Man Chong's {{subordinates}} {{urged him to}} send reinforcements there. However, Man Chong refused and said, [...] "Lujiang may be small, but its troops are well-trained and seasoned in battle. They can definitely defend Lujiang for some time. Besides, as the enemy has left their ships and travelled 200 li deep into our territory, their rear must be unguarded. We should use this opportunity to lure them deeper into our territory and wait {{for an opportunity to}} strike back. Let's allow them to push further in. By the time they want to retreat, it'll <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>for</b> them." [...] He then assembled his troops and waited at Yangyikou (楊宜口). When the Wu forces heard about it, they immediately retreated that night. At the time, as the Wu emperor Sun Quan was eager to conquer Yang Province, he came up with new plans for invasion every year.|$|E
