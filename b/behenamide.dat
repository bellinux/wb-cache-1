40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered friction reducing agents used in plastic sheet production are the amides known as erucamide and <b>behenamide,</b> which despite being almost identical chemically, lead to markedly different values of the friction coefficient. To understand the origin of this contrasting behavior, in this work we model brushes made of these two types of linear chain molecules using quantum mechanical numerical simulations under the Density Functional Theory at the B 97 D/ 6 - 31 G(d,p) level of theory. Four chains of erucamide and <b>behenamide</b> were linked to a 2 X 10 zigzag graphene sheet and optimized both in vacuum and in continuous solvent using the SMD implicit solvation model. We find that erucamide chains tend to remain closer together through ππ stacking interactions arising from the double bonds located at C 13 C 14, a feature <b>behenamide</b> lacks and thus a more spread configuration is obtained with the latter. It is argued that this arrangement of the erucamide chains is responsible for the lower friction coefficient of erucamide brushes, compared with <b>behenamide</b> brushes, which is a macroscopic consequence of cooperative quantum mechanical interactions. While only quantum level interactions are modeled here, we show that <b>behenamide</b> chains are more spread out in the brush than erucamide chains as a consequence of those interactions. The spread out configuration allows more solvent particles to penetrate the brush, leading in turn to more friction, in agreement with macroscopic measurements and mesoscale simulations of the friction coefficient reported in the literature.

40|$|Hypothesis The {{amount and}} {{distribution}} of slip agents, erucamide, and <b>behenamide,</b> {{on the surface of}} high-density polyethene, is determined by integral characteristics of slip agent structure and polymer morphology. A suite of surface analysis techniques was applied to correlate physicochemical properties with slip-additive migration behaviour and their surface morphology. The migration, surface morphology and physicochemical properties of the slip additives, crystallinity and orientation of polyethene spherulites and interaction between slip additives and high-density polyethene influence the surface characteristics. Experimental The high-density polyethene closures were produced with erucamide and <b>behenamide</b> separately and stored until they produced required torque. Surface composition was determined employing spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The distribution of additives was observed under optical, scanning electron and atomic force microscopes. The surface energy, crystallinity and application torque were measured using contact angle, differential scanning calorimeter and a torque force tester respectively. Results and discussion Each slip additive produced a characteristic amide peak at 1645 cm - 1 in infrared spectroscopy and peaks of oxygen and nitrogen in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, suggesting their presence on the surface. The erucamide produced placoid scale-like structures and <b>behenamide</b> formed denticulate structures. The surface erucamide and <b>behenamide</b> responsible for reducing the torque was found to be 15. 7 µg/cm 2 and 1. 7 µg/cm 2...|$|E
