5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut,</b> implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

50|$|The Steel Company of Canada was {{established}} in 1910. It was founded after the merging of the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company (1900) with the Canada Screw Company (1866), Montreal Rolling Mills (1868), the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company (1883) and the Canada <b>Bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nut</b> Company. Charles S. Wilcox, president of the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company {{at the time of}} the consolidation, was appointed the first president of Stelco. He held the position until 1916, continuing on with the company as chairman of the board until his death in 1938.|$|E
50|$|The Meriden-Waterbury Turnpike, an east-west road, was {{extended}} through Marion in 1813, making the community a crossroads. Small-scale industrial activity {{began in the}} 19th century, including the manufacture of carriage <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> in the factory of L.B. Frost and Son, which began operation in Marion in 1842, using the water power of Humiston Brook.|$|R

50|$|Finished steel was {{delivered}} from Republic’s Youngstown plant to Upson’s plant on 1970 Carter Road in Cleveland. Bourne-Fuller then became the {{nut and bolt}} division of Republic. Republic consolidated its operations by closing or revamping its smaller plants of which Bourne-Fuller was one, although with Upson’s open hearths in downtown Cleveland and a capacity of 240,000 tons a year of ingot steel production, it gave Republic a <b>bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> manufacturing business. In 1984, Republic Steel was merged with Jones Laughlin Steel Company to form LTV Steel and ultimately, the Upson Nut Plant was shut down.|$|E
50|$|Railway and {{locomotive}} {{construction in}} the latter 19th century created a huge demand for steel. The Bessemer furnace at the Algom steel mill in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario went into operation in 1902. The Montreal Rolling Mills Co, The Hamilton Steel and Iron Company, the Canada Screw Company, the Canada <b>Bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nut</b> Company, and the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company were consolidated in 1910 to form The Steel Company of Canada headquartered in Toronto. With mills located in Hamilton and other cities, {{it was the largest}} producer of steel in Canada for most of the century. Its competitor, the Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited founded in 1912, renamed the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917 and Dofasco in 1980, had its Hamilton facilities located next to those of Stelco.|$|E
5000|$|Kenly {{was born}} in Harford County near Level, Maryland on April 18, 1877. He {{enrolled}} at the Maryland Agricultural College in 1895, and played {{on the football team}} from 1896 to 1898 as a quarterback. In 1898, he served as the team's head coach and captain, and Maryland amassed a 2 - 5 - 1 record. After the season, the Reveille yearbook wrote, [...] "Manager McCandlish and Captain Kenly worked faithfully with the material they had, but the team was deficient in weight as compared with the others of the league." [...] He graduated from the Maryland Agricultural College in 1899 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Kenly worked for the Port Chester <b>Bolt</b> <b>and</b> <b>Nut</b> Company, Baldwin Locomotive Works, York Safe and Lock Company, H. S. Kerbaugh, Inc., American Bridge Company, Pennsylvania Steel Company, and the Carnegie Steel Company.|$|E
5000|$|An {{impact driver}} {{is a tool}} that {{delivers}} a strong, sudden rotational and downward force, often used by mechanics to loosen larger screws (<b>bolts)</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> that are corrosively [...] "frozen" [...] or over-torqued.

50|$|The {{protection}} {{provided by}} hot-dip galvanizing is insufficient for products {{that will be}} constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses. For these applications, more expensive stainless steel is preferred. Some nails made today are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many outdoor applications because it is cheaper than hot-dip zinc coating and looks good when new. Another reason not to use hot-dip zinc coating is that for <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> of size M10 (US 3/8") or smaller, the thick hot-dipped coating fills in {{too much of the}} threads, which reduces strength (because the dimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to fit together). This means that for cars, bicycles, and many other light mechanical products, the practical alternative to electroplating <b>bolts</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> is not hot-dip zinc coating, but making the fasteners from stainless steel.|$|R
