Comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient, quick test method for deciding whether a <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be accepted and loaded. Traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances, {{as well as a}} large number of other compounds, can be detected. Further tests for establishing the quality of methanol include measurements of boiling point range, density, permanganate number, turbidity, color index, and acid number. More comprehensive tests include water determination according to the Karl Fischer method and gas chromatographic determination of byproducts. However, the latter is relatively expensive and time-consuming because several injections using different columns and detectors must be made due to the variety of byproducts present.|$|E

50|$|Additionally, the raw {{conversion}} {{cost of an}} API synthesis (in {{dollars per}} <b>batch)</b> <b>can</b> be calculated from the VTO, given the operating cost and usable capacity of a particular reactor. Oftentimes, for large-volume APIs, it is economical to build a dedicated production plant rather than to use space in general pilot plants or manufacturing plants.|$|E
50|$|Batch {{production}} {{also has}} some drawbacks. There are inefficiencies associated with batch production as equipment must be stopped, re-configured, and its output tested before the next <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be produced. Idle time between batches is known as downtime. The time between consecutive batches is known as cycle time. Cycle time variation is a Lean Manufacturing metric.|$|E

50|$|Rejuvelac is a raw food made by {{sprouting}} a grain, {{soaking the}} sprouted grain {{in water for}} about two days at room temperature, and then reserving the liquid. A second <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be made from the same sprouts, this time requiring only about one day to ferment. A third batch is possible but the flavor may be disagreeable. The spent sprouted grains are usually discarded.|$|E
50|$|After mixing, {{the rubber}} charge is {{dropped into a}} chute and fed by an {{extruding}} screw into a roller die. Alternatively, the <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be dropped onto an open rubber mill batchoff system. A mill consists of twin counter-rotating rolls, one serrated, that provide additional mechanical working to the rubber and produce a thick rubber sheet. The sheet is pulled off the rollers {{in the form of}} a strip. The strip is cooled, dusted with talc, and laid down into a pallet bin.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{optimization}} is {{employment of}} unary change accumulation and batch propagation. Such a solution can be faster because it reduces communication among involved nodes. Optimization strategies {{can then be}} employed which reason {{about the nature of}} the changes contained within, and make alterations accordingly. e.g. two changes in the <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> cancel each other, and thus, simply be ignored. Yet another available approach, is described as invalidity notification propagation. This approach causes nodes with invalid input to pull updates, thus resulting in the update of their own outputs.|$|E

50|$|Wood ash is {{primarily}} {{made up of}} calcium carbonate, which is used in many glaze recipes. The ash also contains potassium carbonate, phosphates, and other metals; however, the ratio of these chemicals depend on the location, soil, and type of wood the ash came from. The different chemical compositions make the glaze to produce different results from batch to batch. Furthermore, two pieces with the same glaze <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> even have different results. If the ash is not cleaned or mixed thoroughly, {{some parts of the}} glaze mixture can have more of one chemical and others could have more of another making each part of the glaze to actually have varying concentrations of chemicals.|$|E

50|$|Design with {{transistor}} opto-isolators requires generous {{allowances for}} wide fluctuations of parameters found in commercially available devices. Such fluctuations may be destructive, for example, when an opto-isolator in the feedback loop of a DC-to-DC converter changes its transfer function and causes spurious oscillations, or when unexpected delays in opto-isolators cause a short circuit through {{one side of}} an H-bridge. Manufacturers' datasheets typically list only worst-case values for critical parameters; actual devices surpass these worst-case estimates in an unpredictable fashion. Bob Pease observed that current transfer ratio in a batch of 4N28's can vary from 15% to more than 100%; the datasheet specified only a minimum of 10%. Transistor beta in the same <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> vary from 300 to 3000, resulting in 10:1 variance in bandwidth.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{method for}} {{producing}} creamed honey was patented by Elton J. Dyce in 1935 (...) [...] In this process, raw honey is first pasteurized to kill any yeasts {{that may be}} present in the honey. After pasteurization, previously processed creamed honey is added to the pasteurized honey to produce a mixture of 10% creamed honey and 90% pasteurized honey. The mixture is then allowed to rest at a controlled temperature of 57 °F (14 °C). This method will produce a batch of creamed honey in about one week. A seed <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be made by allowing normal honey to crystallize and crushing the crystals to the desired size. Large scale producers have modified this process by using paddles to stir the honey mixture while holding the mixture at 57 °F (14 °C).|$|E
50|$|Queso Palmita is a soft, salty, fresh white farm cheese. The Palmita {{cheese is}} usually made in large {{circular}} containers 6 {{feet in diameter}} and four feet in height. Each Palmita Cheese <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> vary in taste depending on the ingredients which are mixed slowly for 2 to 3 days until the cheese has settled. Then the containers are set for an additional 10 days until coagulation. For the best taste, {{it is imperative that}} the cheese reaches an optimum level of saltiness. It is packaged into pressed wooden crates of 30 kilos each and set for distribution. Once the cheese is packaged, it must be sold within two to three days due to the sweating (loss of liquid) of the cheese from the boxes. Queso Palmita is originally from the Zulia State in northwestern Venezuela, which is the main source of dairy products in the country.|$|E

Queries in these applications involve user-defined processing operations and distributed data structures to hold intermediate and final results. Our goal is to implement system components to leverage previously computed query results and to effectively utilize processing power and ag-gregated I/O bandwidth on SMP nodes so that both single queries and multi-query <b>batches</b> <b>can</b> be efficiently executed. ...|$|R
50|$|This {{designation}} {{was given}} to upgraded vehicles of the first batch of Leopard 2s, brought up to the standard of {{the second and third}} batches. This modernisation gradually replaced the original PZB 200 sights in the first batch with thermal sights for the EMES 15 as they became available. Furthermore, the upgrade included the fitting of filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tanks to allow separate refuelling, as well as the addition of a deflector plate for the periscope and a large coverplate to protect the existing NBC protection system. Finally, the tank was given new five metre towing cables with a different position. The programme began in 1984 and ended in 1987; the third, fourth and fifth batches were during this period produced with the same features. The modernised first <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be recognised by the circular plate covering the hole where the cross-wind sensor for the fire-control system was removed.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to laboratory grades, commercial methanol is generally classified according to ASTM purity grades A and AA. Methanol for chemical use normally corresponds to Grade AA. In {{addition to}} water, typical impurities include acetone and ethanol (which {{are very difficult}} to separate by distillation). When methanol is delivered by ships or tankers used to transportother substances, contamination by the previous cargo must be expected. Comparative ultraviolet spectroscopy has proved a convenient, quick test method for deciding whether a <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be accepted and loaded. Traces of all chemicals derived from aromatic parent substances, as well as a large number of other compounds, can be detected.

50|$|In {{batch drying}} methods, {{certain amount of}} grain is placed first, usually 2 to 4 inches, the batch is dried and cooled later, then drying is stopped and batch is removed. The batch dryers are usually {{operating}} under this sequence and repeating this sequence for several times. The bin-batch drying methods employ a full perforated floor as the dryer. Without stirring, large variety of equipment is available and the <b>batch</b> <b>can</b> be used as both dryer and cooler, {{but there may be}} large moisture gradient from top to bottom and losing time in loading and unloading process. When adding stirring system, unequilibrium moisture content problem is avoided, however, stirrer is an added expense. When using bin-batch roof dryer, time losing problem can be solved. There is a drying floor under the bin roof and the drying fan and burner is installed high on the bin wall. When the drying process is completed, grain is put in the regular bin floor, thus unloading time is reduced. However, there is no wet grain holding in bin-batch roof dryers and there is more expense on machines.|$|E
