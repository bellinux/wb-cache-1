40|$|The <b>Brassica</b> <b>pod</b> <b>midge</b> (Dasineura brassicae Winn.) is an {{important}} pest in oilseed rape (Brasica napus L.). It develops two generations per year and overwinters in the larval stage in cocoons in soil. Immigration {{of the first generation}} adults lasted from the beginning of April until the end of May. Larvae developed in pods from mid-April to mid-June, causing pod deformation and cracking, which resulted in premature falling out of seeds and yield reduction. Pod damage amounted to 11. 6...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Oilseed rape {{is one of}} the important oil plants. Pod shattering {{is one of the}} problems in oilseed rape pro-duction especially in regions with dry conditions. One of the important genes in <b>Brassica</b> <b>pod</b> opening is SHAT-TERPROOF 1 (SHP 1). Down-regulation of BnSHP 1 expression by RNAi can increase resistance to pod shat-tering. A 470 bp of the BnSHP 1 cDNA sequence con-structed in an RNAi-silencing vector was transferred to oilseed rape cv. SLM 046. Molecular analysis of T 2 trans-genic plants by RT-PCR and Real-time PCR showed that expression of the BnSHP alleles was highly decreased in comparison with control plants. Morphologically, trans-genic plants were normal and produced seeds at green-house conditions. At ripening, stage pods failed to shatter, and a finger pressure was needed for pod opening...|$|R
40|$|Loss in seed {{yield and}} {{therefore}} decrease in plant fitness due to simultaneous attacks by multiple herbivores {{is not necessarily}} additive, as demonstrated in evolutionary studies on wild plants. However, {{it is not clear}} how this transfers to crop plants that grow in very different conditions compared to wild plants. Nevertheless, loss in crop seed yield caused by any single pest is most often studied in isolation although crop plants are attacked by many pests that can cause substantial yield losses. This is especially important for crops able to compensate and even overcompensate for the damage. We investigated the interactive impacts on crop yield of four insect pests attacking different plant parts at different times during the cropping season. In 15 oilseed rape fields in Sweden, we estimated the damage caused by seed and stem weevils, pollen beetles, and <b>pod</b> <b>midges.</b> Pest pressure varied drastically among fields with very low correlation among pests, allowing us to explore interactive impacts on yield from attacks by multiple species. The plant damage caused by each pest species individually had, as expected, either no, or a negative impact on seed yield and the strongest negative effect was caused by pollen beetles. However, seed yield increased when plant damage caused by both seed and stem weevils was high, presumably due to the joint plant compensatory reaction to insect attack leading to overcompensation. Hence, attacks by several pests can change the impact on yield of individual pest species. Economic thresholds based on single species, on which pest management decisions currently rely, may therefore result in economically suboptimal choices being made and unnecessary excessive use of insecticides...|$|R
40|$|In organic seed {{production}} of Brassica vegetables, infections by Alternaria brassicicola and A. brassicae can cause severe losses of yield and seed quality. Four field experiments {{with or without}} artificial inoculation with A. brassicicola were conducted in organically managed seed-production crops of cauliflower cv. Opaal RZ in 2005 and 2006 in the Netherlands. The development of A. brassicicola and A. <b>brassicae</b> on <b>pod</b> tissues and developing seeds was followed and seed quality was assessed. Alternaria brassicicola was externally present on 1 · 2 % of the seeds 14 days after flowering and observed internally within 4 weeks after flowering. In both seasons, seed colonization by the pathogen increased slowly until maturation but sharply increased during maturation. A similar pattern was found for the colonization of pod tissues by A. brassicicola as quantified by TaqMan-PCR. The incidence of A. brassicicola on mature seeds reached 70 – 90 %. Internal colonization was found for 62 – 80 % of the seeds. External and internal seed colonization by A. brassicae was much lower, with incidences below 3 %. The quality of harvested seeds was generally low, with less than 80 % of seeds able to germinate. Seed quality was not affected by warm water treatments. It was concluded that A. brassicicola and A. brassicae {{have the potential to}} infect pods and seeds soon after flowering. For the production of high quality seeds, producers must prevent such early infections. Therefore, new control measures are needed for use in organic cropping system...|$|R

Pollen beetle larvae, seed weevil larvae and cabbage moth larvae where all relatively easy infected while infections of pod midge larvae only were observed twice.

The recovery of D. brassicae and Meligethes spp. was further studied after exposure to entomopathogenic nematodes during the pupating process. The recovery of D. brassicae was almost unaffected by the nematodes whereas recovery of Meligethes spp. decreased with increasing number of nematodes. The susceptibility of oil seed rape insects to entomopathogenic nematodes was indirectly demonstrated under field conditions. Here soil grown with oil seed rape for three years was compared to soil grown with grain by baiting with Tenebrio molitor. While entomopathogenic nematodes were almost absent in soil grown with grain, almost all samples were positive for nematodes in soil grown with oil seed rap...|$|E
40|$|The insect society {{living in}} oilseed rape is large. Change {{of the crop}} {{characteristics}} affects both harmful species and beneficious ones. The latter group consists of a lot of members of order Hymenoptera. This work focuses on the evaluation of impact of white oilseed rape cultivation on the insect society in comparison with two yellow winter varieties. Newly bred winter oilseed rape line variety Witt was compared to two hybrid varieties of yellow rape; Sherpa and DK Sensei. The experiment {{was carried out in}} 2015 and its plots were placed at Ruzyně at Crop Reserach Institute (VÚRV, v. v. i.) and also at the Experimental Unit of Czech University of Life Sciences (ČZU) in Uhříněves. The insects were collected by sweeping net, soil larvae traps and soil emergence traps. The occurrence of serious pests (pollen beetle Brassicogethes aeneus, <b>brassica</b> <b>pod</b> <b>midge</b> Dasineura brassicae, cabbage seed weevil Ceutorhynchus obstrictus, stem flea beetle Psylliodes chrysocephalus and cabbage flea beetles Phyllotreta sp.) was recorded. Dominant parasitoid species were Tersilochus heterocerus, Platygaster subuliformis, Trichomalus perfectus, Mesopolobus morys and Omphale clypealis. The level of pest mortality was evaluated. Numbers of species identified by key were processed using generalized linear model method in R statistical software. The results confirm suitability of the assessed varieties in the white oilseed rape cultivation system, notably in the combination of Sherpa and Witt. They give an insight into parasitoid community of oilseed rape in Czech republic, which is useful for management of serious pest species...|$|E

Pods infested by D brassicae larvae split prematurely, releasing seeds, and the larvae drop to the soil into which they burrow to pupate. At this stage in its lifecycle D brassicae is potentially vulnerable to predation by carabid beetles foraging on the soil surface. This is the first study in the UK to focus on carabid beetles as predators of D brassicae in the oilseed rape crop. The spatio-temporal distributions of larvae of D brassicae dropping to the soil from the crop canopy and of adult carabid beetles active on the soil surface were analysed in two consecutive years. Insect samples were collected from spatially referenced sampling points across each crop. Counts of insects were mapped and analysed, and the degree of spatial association between predator and prey determined using Spatial Analysis by Distance Indices (SADIE). Carabid species abundant and active during peak drop of first generation D brassicae larvae included Agonum dorsale, Amara similata, Harpalus rufipes and Nebria brevicollis. The larvae of D brassicae had a marked edge distribution within the crop. SADIE analysis revealed significant spatial association between larvae of D brassicae and adult H rufipes (P???<??? 0. 05) in 1998, but not with adults of A dorsale, A similata or N brevicollis. In 1999, there was strong spatial association only between larvae of D brassicae and adult A dorsale (P???<??? 0. 01). Aggregation of N brevicollis adults occurred in some areas of greatest D brassicae larval counts in 1999, but overall spatial association was not significant.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused on the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell wall loosening and cell extension in plant vegetative growth, but few studies have investigated ROS functions specifically in plant reproductive organs. In this study, ROS levels and antioxidant enzyme activities were assessed in Pisum sativum and <b>Brassica</b> chinensis <b>pods</b> at five developmental stages. In juvenile pods, the high levels of O 2. - and. OH indicates that they had functions in cell wall loosening and cell elongation. In later developmental stages, high levels of. OH were also related to increases in cell wall thickness in lignified tissues. Throughout pod development, most of the O 2. - was detected on plasma membranes of parenchyma cells and outer epidermis cells of the mesocarp, while most of the H 2 O 2 was detected on plasma membranes of most cells throughout the mesocarp. This suggests that these sites are presumably the locations of ROS generation. The antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) apparently contributed to ROS accumulation in pod wall tissues. Furthermore, specifically SOD and POD were found to be associated with pod growth through the regulation of ROS generation and transformation. Throughout pod development, O 2. - decreases were associated with increased SOD activity, while changes in H 2 O 2 accumulation were associated with changes in CAT and POD activities. Additionally, high POD activity may contribute to the generation of(.) OH in the early development of pods. It is concluded that the ROS are produced in different sites of plasma membranes with the regulation of antioxidant enzymes, and that substantial ROS generation and accumulation are evident in cell elongation and cell wall loosening in pod wall cells...|$|R
