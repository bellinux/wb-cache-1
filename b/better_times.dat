Several {{different}} riders in succession then posted successively (but, {{in the first}} few cases, marginally) <b>better</b> <b>times</b> than the best time that had come before them. Alessandro Bertolini, David Millar, Marco Pinotti, Giovanni Visconti, Bradley Wiggins, and Stefano Garzelli were all briefly the stage leader after they crossed the finish line. Bertolini in particular was stage leader for about three minutes, as Millar started just behind him and barely beat his time.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} bishop began {{to reside in}} Llandaff {{for the first time}} in centuries; no bishops of the see resided in Llandaff for almost 300 years. In 1836 there was another {{unsuccessful}} attempt to transfer the see—this time to Bristol. After the attempt at transferring the see, the office of Dean was restored to Llandaff; the position had not been filled in 700 years. The office of Dean was separated from that of the Archdeacon of Llandaff in November 1843. The restoration of the Dean's office was the beginning of <b>better</b> <b>times</b> for the cathedral. The new Dean, William Bruce Knight, was instrumental in bringing about the much-needed restorations.|$|E
5|$|World War II caused {{enrollment}} {{to decline}} {{and the student}} body consisted mainly {{of high school students}} and seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. <b>Better</b> <b>times</b> and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

25|$|The {{contract}} {{to build the}} Batillus class supertankers was signed on April 6, 1971, and the first sheet metal was cut in January 1975. Meanwhile, the oil shock caused by the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, resulted in higher oil prices and reduction of imports from industrialized countries. The cancellation of the order had been seriously considered, but Shell concluded {{that it was better}} to continue, mostly to not put the shipyard in very difficult position with withdrawal of such a huge, already initiated project, (the work commitments were already well advanced, with extremely heavy cancellation charges) hoping also on <b>better</b> <b>times</b> in future.|$|E
25|$|Falling ore prices {{caused the}} company's first post-war deficit in 1976, of NOK214.7million.

Lay-offs were avoided, but some employees took out early retirement and there was a recruitment stop.

She was the oldest person to compete for Comoros at the Games, aged 25.

Ahamada said the London Games would be an opportunity {{to allow her to}} improve her performance and record <b>better</b> <b>times.</b> She took part in the preliminary round of the women's 100 metres and was drawn in the first heat. Ahamada finished first with a time of 11.81 seconds, ahead of Dana Abdul Razak of Iraq (11.91 seconds) and Togo's Bamab Napo (12.24 seconds). It allowed her to qualify for the heats stage. In the heats, held on the same day as the preliminary round, Ahamada finished seventh out of eight athletes in heat four with a time of 11.86 seconds. She ranked ahead of Lorène Bazolo from Congo (11.90 seconds) and was 0.93 seconds behind heat winner Blessing Okagbare of Nigeria (10.93 seconds). Ahamada finished 50th out of 78 athletes overall, and did not progress in the semi-finals because she was 0.58 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the later rounds.|$|E

500|$|At {{the urging}} of Senator Clay, Harrison quickly called a special session of Congress. [...] With the Whigs to {{organize}} the House for the first time, Fillmore sought the Speakership, but it went to a Clay acolyte, John White of Kentucky. Nevertheless, Fillmore was made chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Harrison was expected {{to go along with}} anything Clay and other congressional Whig leaders proposed, but died on April 4, 1841, elevating Vice President Tyler to the presidency. Tyler, a onetime maverick Democrat, soon broke with Clay over congressional proposals for a national bank to stabilize the currency, which he vetoed twice, leading to his expulsion from the Whig Party. Fillmore remained on the fringes of that conflict, generally supporting the congressional Whig position, but his chief achievement as Ways and Means chairman was the Tariff of 1842. [...] The existing tariff did not protect manufacturing, and part of the revenue was distributed to the states, a decision made in <b>better</b> <b>times</b> that was by then depleting the Treasury. Fillmore prepared a bill raising tariff rates that was popular in the country, but the continuation of distribution assured a Tyler veto, and much political advantage for the Whigs. Once Tyler vetoed it, a House committee headed by Massachusetts' John Quincy Adams condemned his actions. [...] Fillmore prepared a second bill, this time omitting distribution, and when it reached his desk, Tyler signed it, but in the process offended his erstwhile Democratic allies. Thus, Fillmore not only achieved his legislative goal, but managed to politically isolate Tyler.|$|E

2500|$|In {{cells with}} {{sufficient}} nutrients, protease activity is high, which breaks down cII. This {{leads to the}} lytic lifestyle.
