5|$|Chelsea {{have always}} worn <b>blue</b> shirts, {{although}} they originally used the paler eton <b>blue,</b> which {{was taken from}} the racing colours of then club president, Earl Cadogan, and was worn with white shorts and dark <b>blue</b> or black socks. The light <b>blue</b> shirts were replaced by a royal <b>blue</b> version in around 1912. In the 1960s Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty changed the kit again, switching to <b>blue</b> shorts (which have remained ever since) and white socks, believing it made the club's colours more modern and distinctive, since no other major side used that combination; this kit was first worn during the 1964–65 season. Since then Chelsea have always worn white socks with their home kit apart from a short spell from 1985 to 1992, when <b>blue</b> socks were reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} {{enormous}} size, power and speed, adult <b>blue</b> whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in National Geographic Magazine of a <b>blue</b> whale {{being attacked by}} orcas off the Baja California Peninsula; the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, but the <b>blue</b> whale sustained serious wounds and probably {{died as a result}} of them shortly after the attack. In March 2014, a pack of orcas harassed a <b>blue</b> whale off California, with one of them biting the tip of the <b>blue</b> whale's tail fluke. The <b>blue</b> whale attempted to tail slap the orca and fled at high speed. A similar incident happened on May 18, 2017 in Monterey Bay, with the orcas swimming in a line up to the <b>blue</b> whale's side. The <b>blue</b> whale fled and escaped. Orcas have virtually no chance against an adult <b>blue</b> whale, but may attack them on occasion anyway for their own enjoyment. Up to a quarter of the <b>blue</b> whales identified in Baja bear scars from orca attacks.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of <b>blue</b> was darkened from royal to nautical <b>blue.</b> The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce <b>blue</b> pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the <b>blue</b> pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to <b>blue.</b>|$|E

5|$|The French team {{traditionally}} {{played in}} <b>blue</b> shirts, white shorts, and red socks, {{the colors of}} the national flag, and as such were nicknamed les tricolores. Due to the mostly <b>blue</b> strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as les Bleus (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker <b>blue.</b> In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear <b>blue</b> shirt, <b>blue</b> shorts and <b>blue</b> socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white shorts and white socks for their away kit.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>blue</b> phases are of {{interest}} for fast light modulators or tunable photonic crystals, they exist in a very narrow temperature range, usually less than a few kelvin.

5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a <b>blue</b> colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark <b>blue</b> silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt <b>blue.</b> Cobalt pigments such as cobalt <b>blue</b> (cobalt aluminate), cerulean <b>blue</b> (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E

5|$|<b>Blue</b> whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many <b>blue</b> whales in California. In September 2007, three dead <b>blue</b> whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this problem could be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. <b>Blue</b> whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on <b>blue</b> whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of <b>blue</b> whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
