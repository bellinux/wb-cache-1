50|$|A {{magneto-resistor}} (MR) is a two terminal device which {{changes its}} resistance parabolically with applied magnetic field. This {{variation of the}} resistance of MR due to the magnetic field {{is known as the}} Magnetoresistive Effect. It is possible to build structures in which the electrical resistance varies as a function of applied magnetic field. These structures can be used as magnetic sensors. Normally these resistors are assembled in a <b>bridge</b> <b>configuration</b> to compensate for thermal drift. Popular magneto resistance-based sensors are: Anisotropic Magneto Resistance (AMR), Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR), Giant Magneto Impendence (GMI) and Tunnel Magneto Resistance (TMR). All these MR-based sensors have higher sensitivity compared to Halleffect sensors. Despite of this, these sensors (GMR, CMR, and TMR) are still more expensive than Hall-effect devices, have serious drawbacks related with nonlinear behavior, distinct thermal drift, and a very strong external field can permanently alter the sensor behavior (GMR). GMI and TMR sensors are even more sensitive than GMR based sensors, but still in the test phase and no commercial version are available today.|$|E
