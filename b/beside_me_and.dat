2500|$|Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an {{audience}} at West Virginia University {{that she had}} been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church."I heard this unfolding on our air and I must have said something out loud because there was a print photographer standing <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> he said, 'Did you just say what I think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one alive,'" [...] the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying.|$|E
2500|$|Then {{looking at}} him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:"Do not sit <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> whine, you {{double-faced}} liar.To me {{you are the most}} hateful of all gods who hold Olympus.Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, wars and battles.…And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, sinceyou are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinouslong since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{shooting}} {{a movie in}} Arizona, Stewart {{received a phone call}} from Dr. Keagy, his veterinarian, who informed him that Beau was terminally ill, and that Gloria sought his permission to perform euthanasia. Stewart declined to give a reply over the phone, and told Keagy to [...] "keep him alive and I'll be there." [...] Stewart requested several days' leave, which allowed him to spend some time with Beau before granting the doctor permission to euthanize the sick dog. Following the procedure, Stewart sat in his car for ten minutes to clear his eyes of tears. Stewart later remembered:After [...] died there were a lot of nights when I was certain that I could feel him get into bed <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> I would reach out and pat his head. The feeling was so real that I wrote a poem about it and how much it hurt to realize that he wasn’t going to be there any more.|$|E
60|$|The {{botanist}} walks <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> white <b>and</b> nervously jerky in his movements, his ultimatum delivered.|$|R
60|$|The woman <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> turned, <b>and</b> with {{a supreme}} courage {{raised her head}} and faced the girl.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Poor child,’ she said, ‘poor child! Sit down <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> here, <b>and</b> tell <b>me</b> {{all about}} it. My heart really bleeds to see you. How does time go?’ ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had stepped}} out <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{regarded}} her with wonderment.|$|E
60|$|He swung {{himself up}} upon the parapet <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> lit a cigar.|$|E
60|$|Then she {{crouched}} <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> began whispering {{very softly}} and rapidly {{with her face}} close to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Rather not. You've {{absolutely}} summed me up. With you <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> stimulating <b>and</b> {{all that}} sort of rot, don't you know, I should show a flash of speed which would astonish you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Eh, {{you knew}} her? No? Ah! it is a story; But I speak not, like Pachita, the English: So? If I try, you will sit here <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> [...] <b>And</b> shall not laugh, eh? ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{sat down}} <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> again <b>and</b> spoke softly. [...] "I promise I will talk {{it all over}} with you again. When you are well. I promise I will meet you somewhere {{so that we can}} talk. You can't talk now.|$|R
60|$|I {{jumped up}} to peer over the stone. Steele lumbered up <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I heard him draw his breath hard.|$|E
60|$|As I walked, Nature {{came and}} talked <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{showed me the}} world and myself, and the ways of God seemed clearer.|$|E
6000|$|She {{hesitated a}} moment, {{and then sat}} down <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> laid her hand on mine. As if that honour would {{obliterate}} any remembrance! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why now, child, you've {{got a lot}} of notions. Besides what's {{the matter}} with the town? Looks good to me. I've had people that have {{traveled}} all over the world tell <b>me</b> time <b>and</b> again that Gopher Prairie is the prettiest place in the Middlewest. Good enough for anybody. Certainly good enough for Mama <b>and</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Besides!</b> Mama <b>and</b> <b>me</b> are planning to go out to Pasadena and buy a bungalow and live there." ...|$|R
60|$|Come, sit <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> colleen, <b>And</b> {{cut away}} your dreams of discontent, For I {{would have you}} light up my last days Like a bright torch of pine, and when I die I will make you the wealthiest hereabout; For hid away where nobody can find I have a {{stocking}} full of silver and gold.|$|R
60|$|It was my servant Michelot, a grizzled {{veteran of}} huge frame and strength, {{who had fought}} <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> at Rocroi, <b>and</b> who had {{thereafter}} become so enamoured of my person--for some trivial service he swore I had rendered him--that he had attached himself to <b>me</b> <b>and</b> my luckless fortunes.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{sat down}} <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> took my hand in his, and with very gentle words began to reason and argue with me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will {{you walk}} <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> not touch me;' for, his arm was coming about her again; 'while I {{speak to you}} very seriously, Mr Wrayburn?' ...|$|E
60|$|His lunging {{descent of}} the {{successive}} stairways followed, and he {{burst through the}} doorway <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> without heeding me, ran bareheaded down the sloping lawn.|$|E
60|$|But Giacomo was <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>and</b> in the {{quadrangle}} {{a silence}} reigned, all {{waiting for my}} command. From without there came such a din as seemed to argue that all hell was at the Castle gates. There were shouts of defiance and screams of abuse, whilst a constant rain of stones beat against the raised drawbridge.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was sitting}} still <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> Dozing likewise; <b>and</b> I turned to her, {{to take her}} hanging hand; When, the more regarding, that which like a spectre shook <b>and</b> tried <b>me</b> [...] In her image then I scanned; ...|$|R
60|$|I trod the water, {{and threw}} handfuls of spray at her. She laughed and blushed. Then Trip waded {{out to her}} and she fled swiftly from his shower-bath. George was {{floating}} just <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> looking up <b>and</b> laughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come sit <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I'll tell you, sir; that is, if {{you please}} I should love to talk with you, for it's lonely here when Bess is gone." ...|$|E
60|$|While {{he talked}} the massive form of Mr. Pike loomed <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> halted {{just out of}} sight of the man in the bunk. And the man talked on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Mellon," [...] he said, {{sitting down}} <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> patting my dog, [...] "I {{imagined}} from your tones, as I entered, {{that you were}} having some serious conversation with my wife." ...|$|E
60|$|Con. Ah, do not cease! say on! There {{is that in}} {{the music}} of thy voice that soothes <b>and</b> comforts <b>me.</b> Come, sit <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> fair Ione, <b>and</b> I will tell thee why I do not love thy princess.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Pike stopped <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> {{a moment}} <b>and</b> while {{he watched the}} men I watched him. The {{expression}} on his face was that of a cattle-buyer, and it was plain that he was disgusted with the quality of cattle delivered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come <b>and</b> sit <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> mother, <b>and</b> let <b>me</b> lay {{my head on}} your knee. You {{were the}} first to comfort me in this life, and I want you to be the last. Speak with Branwen, mother, after I am gone. She will comfort you as no one else can. Give me your hand, mother; I would sleep now as in the days gone by." ...|$|R
60|$|I donned the {{garments}} and {{sat down}} on the forward seat. The captain sat close <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> during the return to the vessel his watchful eyes did not once leave me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{because they}} are so very, very funny. Sit down <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I'll tell you about three kittens I once had. They were very little--at least they were little before they got big." ...|$|E
60|$|I had {{sat down}} on the wayside, where she took a place <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I told her all that matter much as I have written it, my {{thoughts}} about her father's dealing being alone omitted.|$|E
6000|$|All {{that day}} I was very ill; and Lemarchant, lying tossing <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> groaned <b>and</b> moaned in a fearful fashion. At last the truth seemed to dawn upon him gradually, and he cried aloud to me: [...] "Doctor, Doctor, quick, for Heaven's sake! {{you must get}} me out an antidote. The powders must have got mixed up somehow, <b>and</b> you've given <b>me</b> arsenic instead of quinine, I'm certain." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{recording}} {{opens with}} gospel singing including “Never Alone (He Walks <b>beside</b> <b>Me)</b> ” <b>and</b> {{a prayer for}} the sick. Video cuts to Mrs. Lois Shelton testifying about dedicating her life to god and attending Monroe Street Church. Dell reads Romans 1 : 21 - 24, and talks about people being thankful when they know God. He talks about tithing to God and if one doesn’t give God 10 percent are robbing God...|$|R
60|$|They {{tell me she}} {{is young}} and fair, but I seek more than that in her who is to pass her life <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> Youth <b>and</b> beauty fade, but a noble woman's love can never die. Oh, Irene, if thou couldst know how hard a thing it is to take thee, princess though thou art! [Enter Ione.] Ah, lady, thou hast mistaken thy way! Let me lead thee to the queen's apartments.|$|R
