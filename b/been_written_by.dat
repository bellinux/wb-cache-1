5|$|Archimedes' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a {{treatise}} with fifteen propositions on {{the nature}} of circles. The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic. The scholars T. L.

5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn in heaven. Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>by</b> Arhaths.|$|E
