60|$|As many wounded as {{possible}} were piled {{on to the}} engine, standing in the cab, lying on the tender, or clinging to the cowcatcher. And all this time the shells fell into the wet earth throwing up white clouds, burst with terrifying detonations overhead, or actually struck the engine and the iron wreckage. Besides the three field-guns, which proved to be 15-pounders, the shell-firing Maxim continued its work, and its little shells, discharged with an ugly thud, thud, thud, exploded with startling bangs on all sides. One I remember struck the footplate of the engine scarcely a yard from my face, lit up into a bright yellow flash, and left me wondering why I was still alive. Another hit the coals in the tender, hurling a black shower into the air. A third--this also I saw--struck {{the arm of a}} private in the Dublin Fusiliers. The whole arm was smashed to a horrid pulp--bones, muscle, blood, and uniform all mixed together. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>hung</b> the hand, unhurt, but swelled instantly to three times its ordinary size. The engine was soon crowded and began to steam homewards--a mournful, sorely battered locomotive--with the woodwork of the firebox in flames and the water spouting from its pierced tanks. The infantrymen straggled along beside it at the double.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The truth is,' {{said the}} man in the train, 'that we live in a {{tropical}} country for three months of the year, only we won't recognise. Look at this.' He handed over a long list of deaths from heat that enlivened the newspapers. All the cities where men live at breaking-strain were sending in their butcher-bills, and the papers of the cities, themselves apostles of the Gospel of Rush, were beseeching their readers to keep cool and not to overwork themselves while the hot wave was upon them. The rivers were patched and barred with sun-dried pebbles; the logs and loggers were drought-bound somewhere up the Connecticut; and the grass {{at the side of the}} track was burned in a hundred places by the sparks from locomotives. Men--hatless, coatless, and gasping--lay in the shade of that station where only a few months ago the glass stood at 30 below zero. Now the readings were 98 degrees in the shade. Main Street--do you remember Main Street of a little village locked up in the snow this spring?[2]--had given up the business of life, and an American flag with some politician's name printed across the <b>bottom</b> <b>hung</b> down across the street as stiff as a board. There were men with fans and alpaca coats curled up in splint chairs in the verandah of the one hotel--among them an ex-President of the United States. He completed the impression that the furniture of the entire country had been turned out of doors for summer cleaning in the absence of all the inhabitants. Nothing looks so hopelessly 'ex' as a President 'returned to stores,' The stars and stripes signified that the Presidential Campaign had opened in Main Street--opened and shut up again. Politics evaporate at summer heat when all hands are busy with the last of the hay, and, as the formers put it, 'Vermont's bound to go Republican.' The custom of the land is to drag the scuffle and dust of an election over several months--to the improvement of business and manners; but the noise of that war comes faintly up the valley of the Connecticut and is lost among the fiddling of the locusts. Their music puts, as it were, a knife edge upon the heat of the day. In truth, it is a tropical country for the time being. Thunder-storms prowl and growl round the belted hills, spit themselves away in a few drops of rain, and leave the air more dead than before. In the woods, where even the faithful springs are beginning to run low, the pines and balsams have thrown out all their fragrance upon the heat and wait for the wind to bring news of the rain. The clematis, wild carrot, and all the gipsy-flowers camped by sufferance between fence line and road net are masked in white dust, and the golden-rod of the pastures that are burned to flax-colour burns too like burnished brass. A pillar of dust on the long hog-back of the road across the hills shows where a team is lathering between farms, and the roofs of the wooden houses flicker in the haze of their own heat. Overhead the chicken-hawk is the only creature at work, and his shrill kite-like call sends the gaping chickens from the dust-bath in haste to their mothers. The red squirrel as usual feigns business of importance among the butternuts, but this is pure priggishness. When the passer-by is gone he ceases chattering and climbs back to where the little breezes can stir his tail-plumes. From somewhere under the lazy fold of a meadow comes the drone of a mowing-machine among the hay--its whurr-oo and the grunt of the tired horses.|$|E
5000|$|A tilt {{and turn}} window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This {{is the most common}} type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also {{widespread}} in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the [...] "turn first" [...] type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in <b>bottom</b> <b>hung</b> mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be [...] "tilt first" [...] i.e. <b>bottom</b> <b>hung</b> at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.|$|E

60|$|The cold was by {{no means}} {{excessive}} during the day, and although the snow was deep and heavy, there was no difficulty in keeping up with the convoy, as the pace of the bullocks was little over {{a mile and a half}} an hour. At night they were snug enough, for the doctor had adapted an empty wagon as their sleeping-place, and this, with a deep bed of straw at the <b>bottom,</b> blankets <b>hung</b> at the sides and others laid over the top, constituted as comfortable a shelter as could be desired.|$|R
60|$|The skins of the Horners were light brown, {{but they}} wore snow-white robes and were bare-footed. Dorothy thought the most {{striking}} thing about them was their hair, which grew in three distinct colors on each and every head--red, yellow and green. The red was at the <b>bottom</b> and sometimes <b>hung</b> over their eyes; then came a broad circle of yellow and the green {{was at the top}} and formed a brush-shaped top-knot.|$|R
50|$|Tree frogs can {{be caught}} and photographed by using PVC pipes that are capped on the <b>bottom</b> and <b>hung</b> {{vertically}} {{in a tree}} near water.If aquatic species are the target species {{the use of an}} aquatic funnel trap can be used.Drift fences have been used with a high success rate for capturing snakes. The use of a drift fences along with a pit-fall or funnel box trap has yielded high success. The length of the fence is variable, but the longer the fence results in a higher success rate. The fence is set with traps in the middle and/or the ends. Snakes encounter the fence and are directed or lead to the trap. Care must be taken in providing enough cover so the species do not die of heat exhaustion. Identifying all the species in the trap is recommended so an accidental envenomation is avoided. Pit fall traps are small buckets that are placed in holes dug out next to the drift fence.|$|R
60|$|To {{make them}} run easily and swiftly, the axles of {{carriages}} are anointed; and for {{much the same}} purpose, some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view {{is to make the}} boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling under its <b>bottom,</b> where it <b>hung</b> over the side, and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft's bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.|$|R
