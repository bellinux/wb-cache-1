50|$|In {{small-scale}} tests, cyclorotors {{achieved a}} higher power loading than comparable scale traditional rotors at the same disk loading.

Since the cyclorotor <b>blade</b> <b>span</b> {{is parallel to the}} axis of rotation, each spanwise blade section operates at similar velocities and the entire blade can be optimized.|$|E

50|$|By {{controlling}} {{the size of}} the driving region, the pilot can adjust autorotative rotational speed.

His three-bladed Gedser facility (1957) was Denmark's first large wind turbine. With a <b>blade</b> <b>span</b> of 24 m, it produced 200 kW of alternating current fed directly into the grid.

Stall control was provided through an asynchronous generator. The turbine, which for many years was the world's largest, operated from 1957 to 1967 without maintenance, demonstrating incredible durability. In connection with NASA testing for the U.S. wind energy programme, it was refurbished in 1975 and brought back into operation. It continued to run for a few years, providing test data for the further development of wind turbines in Denmark. Over the course of its lifetime, the Gedser wind turbine generated 2.2 million kW-hours (7.9 TJ).|$|E

Comparisons of the overall performance, radial distributions of performance parameters, diffusion factors at the near-stall conditions, blade element data, and the axial distribution of rotor tip static pressures yielded the following results: (1) higher peak pressure ratio, high stage and rotor efficiencies, and greater stall margin were obtained with the lower aspect ratio blading, (2) the lower aspect ratio blading showed improved performance over the entire <b>blade</b> <b>span,</b> and (3) the lower aspect ratio rotors operated at higher diffusion factors and higher incidence angles over the entire <b>blade</b> <b>span...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic stall is an {{aerodynamic}} {{phenomenon that}} may occur when an airfoil is subjected to rapid, cyclical changes in angle of attack {{with respect to the}} incident ambient flow. This phenomenon can often produce repeated and significant changes in lift and moment coefficients within very short time frames, which manifest as severe and rapid changes in structural loads. Rotorcraft such as helicopters and wind turbines are particularly susceptible to dynamic stall, which is a highly undesirable operating condition. The condition plays a part in limiting the forward speed of a helicopter whilst also producing cyclical loads that accelerate fatigue. The structural issues are more severe for wind turbines, where <b>blade</b> <b>spans</b> approaching seventy to eighty metres are becoming common. Research into techniques for reducing the severity of the undesirable effects of dynamic stall is often conducting in laboratory environments using wind tunnels as the main investigative tool. The required cyclical changes in angle of attack are achieved by using machines that oscillate the test airfoil about an axis parallel to the span of the wing. Such mechanisms can be powered electrically, mechanically, pneumatically or hydraulically, and have various combinations of complexity, advantages and disadvantages. The current work describes the design process of an electrically powered dynamical stall test rig. The use of CAD / CAM to assist in the performing of design calculations and a comparison of the rig with other mechanisms is presented...|$|R

Five wedge-shaped columnar-grained freshwater ice samples were crushed against a thick plate with a low-profile blade on it {{and the results were}} compared with those from another five crushing experiments using a plate without a blade. The two crushing plates were made of aluminum and had identical characteristics other than that one of them had a blade on it. The blade had an isosceles right triangular section profile with a height of 1 mm and base of 2 mm. The <b>blade</b> <b>spanned</b> the length of the plate and was centered relative to the wedge-shaped ice samples and parallel with their long axes. Tests were conducted at - 10 oC and the nominal crushing plate displacement rate was 10 mm/s. High-speed imaging was used to observe the ice contact zone, by viewing through the ice samples, as it evolved and moved around somewhat during the tests. Load records from the tests using the bladeless crushing plate exhibited a high-amplitude sawtooth load pattern, resulting from fairly regular ice spalling events, that is typical of ice crushing in the brittle regime. This type of spalling behaviour, and associated sawtooth load pattern, is responsible for ice induced vibration of structures when ice sheets encroach on them. The average loads were roughly the same during either set of tests. However for those tests where the plate with the blade on it was used it was observed that when the blade was in the hard zone region of the ice contact area the load pattern was dramatically affected. In those cases the blade effectively smoothed the sawtooth loading pattern by greatly increasing the spalling rate and reducing the spall size. Consequently the amplitudes of the load sawteeth were significantly reducedPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 18 calvarial bone grafts (CBGs) were {{harvested}} from 9 cadavers with the BHD. The recorded parameters included drilling time, graft harvest time, graft size, graft integrity, and violation of the calvarial inner table. Five CBGs were subsequently harvested in vivo and used for 2 nasal reconstructions and 3 orbital reconstructions. RESULTS: The CBG dimensions ranged from 1. 25 to 2. 5 cm in width and 3. 0 to 16. 0 cm in length. Graft harvest time ranged from 5 minutes, 55 seconds to 25 minutes, 30 seconds (mean 13 minutes, 7 sec-onds). There were no fractured grafts. The cadaver-ic inner table was violated twice with a cutting burr, and 1 dural exposure occurred in the clinical study. CONCLUSION: Although caution must be used with all CBGs, the BHD appears to be safe and more effi-cient than osteotomes or oscillating saws. (Otolaryn-gol Head Neck Surg 2000; 123 : 547 - 52.) Defects of the facial skeleton historically have been repaired with autologous grafts from the rib, 1 pelvis, 2 and tibia. 3 The calvarial bone graft (CBG) was first described as an osteocutaneous vascularized flap in 1890. 4 In the 1970 s Smith and Abramson 5 and Tessier 6 popularized {{the use of}} free outer table CBGs. Current applications for CBGs range from the repair of traumatic and congenital deformities to aesthetic uses in rhinoplasty. Numerous techniques have been described to harvest CBGs. The absence of a well-accepted, standardized method indicates the lack of a superior technique. The ideal method would involve an inexpensive tool that accurately follows the skull contour, has no chance of intracranial penetration, rapidly generates bone grafts of uniform thickness, and has no intrinsic limitations on the graft dimensions.

We study the flow-induced reconfiguration of buoyant, flexible aquatic vegetation through a combination of laboratory flume experiments and theoretical modeling. The laboratory experiments measure drag and posture for model <b>blades</b> that <b>span</b> the natural range for seagrass stiffness and buoyancy. The theoretical model calculates plant posture based on a force balance that includes posture-dependent drag and the restoring forces due to vegetation stiffness and buoyancy. When the hydrodynamic forcing is small compared to the restoring forces, the model blades remain upright and the quadratic law, Fx ∝ U 2, predicts the drag well (Fx is drag, U is velocity). When the hydrodynamic forcing exceeds the restoring forces, the blades are pushed over by the flow, and the quadratic drag law no longer applies. The model successfully predicts when this transition occurs. The model also predicts that when the dominant restoring mechanism is blade stiffness, reconfiguration leads to the scaling Fx ∝ U 4 / 3. When the dominant restoring mechanism is blade buoyancy, reconfiguration can lead to a sub-linear increase in drag with velocity, i. e., Fx ∝ Ua with a < 1. Laboratory measurements confirm both these predictions. The model also predicts drag and posture successfully for natural systems ranging from seagrasses to marine macroalgae of more complex morphology. National Science Foundation (U. S.)
