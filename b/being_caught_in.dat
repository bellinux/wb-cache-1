5|$|Presently, human-caused shark {{mortality}} is continuing, primarily from accidental and illegal catching in commercial and recreational fishing {{as well as}} from <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> beach protection netting, and the populations of great white shark in Australia are yet to recover.|$|E
5|$|McNeile {{interspersed}} his Drummond {{work with}} other novels and story collections, including two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works, Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish. McNeile {{was one of the}} most successful British popular authors of the inter-war period, before his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which has been attributed to <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a gas attack in the war.|$|E

5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised {{that he could not}} match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a collision and falling.|$|E

5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every social {{standing}} and class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers. This led to widespread media scrutiny and criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women {{died in the}} mid-19th century {{as a result of}} their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} produced waves up to 3ft (0.9m) around Anna Maria Island, {{where two}} people died of fatigue-related heart attacks after <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a rip current. Heavy rainfall in the New Orleans, Louisiana and Mobile, Alabama areas—aided by instability from {{the remnants of}} the depression—flooded streets, inundating an apartment complex in the former city and cutting power to 1,921 customers in the latter city. Forty homes and businesses were flooded in Avoyelles Parish. Rainfall accumulations peaked south of Natchez, Mississippi, where 13.9in (353mm) was documented.|$|E

5|$|The Anglican parish {{church of}} St Michael {{dates from the}} 15th century and has been {{designated}} by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building; its tower used to display a beacon light for ships approaching the harbour. After <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a violent storm at sea, Robert Quirke dedicated a ship and its cargo to God's service, as well as donating a cellar near the quay for prayers to be offered for those at sea. Dating from 1628 and known as the Gibraltar Celler , {{it is now the}} Chapel of St Peter. Quirke also donated money from the sale of the ship and its cargo to build almshouses.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulties}} of night fighting {{was evident in}} the performance of the night-fighter squadrons. One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft; some other Blenheims crashed after <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the glare of search lights at low-level and return-fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft. While identification friend or foe (IFF) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on. Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability. On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force-land. At this time he was joined by his gunner/observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently.|$|E
5|$|William John Bankes {{collected}} {{most of the}} house's antiquities. He travelled {{extensively in}} the Middle East and Asia, amassing the world's largest individual collection of Ancient Egyptian antiques. Most notable is the Philae obelisk which stands prominently in {{the grounds of the}} house. When in Genoa he acquired the portrait of Maria di Antonio Serra, by Sir Peter Paul Rubens, painted on the occasion of her marriage to Duke Nicolò Pallavicini in 1606. In 1841, after <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a homosexual scandal that could have resulted in a trial and his execution, William John fled the country for Italy. His art collection was left at Kingston Lacy, where his notes and drawings remained for many years in a cabinet, unpublished and forgotten.|$|E

5|$|After causing {{severe damage}} in the United States, the {{remnants}} of Hurricane Bob moved into Atlantic Canada. The highest rainfall amount in the country was 4.37in (111mm) in northern New Brunswick. St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador recorded a record 1inch (26mm) of rainfall during the storm's passage. Gusty winds were observed across the region, and winds reached 68mph (109km/h) in Digby, Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, two 17-year-old girls were washed out to sea near Cape Forchu after <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> rough swells produced by the storm. Rescue officials quickly began searching operations; however, it was later confirmed that the two had drowned. In Fredericton, New Brunswick, tropical storm-force winds downed trees and power lines, resulting in scattered power outages. Lightning associated with strong storms also reportedly struck some trees in the area. A two-story home in Pointe-Verte collapsed due to high winds. In Petit-Rocher, five fishing boats sank after being overwhelmed by large swells at port. Firefighters in the area were surveying the town all night on August20, checking for downed power lines and trees. Power outages were also reported on Prince Edward Island. The storm left about $1million in damage (1991CAD) on Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the rest}} of the front line between Albert to beyond Dernancourt was also being heavily attacked. In the north, forward troops of the 48th Battalion were firing almost {{continuously}} from the railway line. Attacked by elements of III/229 RIR supported by minenwerfers firing from a copse south of Albert, the 48th Battalion easily beat off every German assault. This was despite <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> enfilade by a machine gun sited on the bridge where the Albert–Amiens road crossed the railway line. Leane directed artillery onto the wood south of Albert from which the minenwerfers were firing. This was the same wood upon which the S.O.S. line of the 10th AFA Brigade had been laid. As the Germans were assembling for a renewed assault, a stray British shell exploded a munitions dump, scattering panicked troops of II/229 RIR, many of whom were then shot down by the Australians. The 48th lost only three officers and 59 men during the day's fighting. Wary of sending reinforcements from his support line down the exposed slope to the railway line, Leane only sent four men with two Lewis guns forward during the daylight hours. During the day, the right of the 48th was steadily extended to allow the 47th Battalion to move right in turn.|$|E
5|$|Despite the British {{attack on}} Saint Paul, French frigates {{continued}} {{to operate in}} the Indian Ocean, Hamelin personally leading a cruise in the Bay of Bengal during the autumn. His ships seized a number of small merchantmen and in the Action of 18 November 1809 he personally defeated and captured three large East Indiamen in convoy. Before his squadron and their prizes returned to Île de France in late December, they had also captured the British brig HMS Victor and the large Portuguese frigate Minerva. During the winter few ships were at sea, as the risk of <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> a seasonal hurricane was considered too severe to operate between December and March. Rowley correspondingly withdrew most of his forces to the Cape of Good Hope, leaving a handful of smaller ships to watch the French islands. Hamelin too kept his forces in harbour at Île de France, replenishing his ships and recruiting sailors from the large pool of unemployed men in Port Napoleon.|$|E

5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses {{what seems to be}} a human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving within sight of the Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> an avalanche.|$|E
5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fifth pole position of the season and his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:50.646; although he was optimistic about his race prospects, he was concerned about the start. Häkkinen was joined in the front row of the grid by Trulli, who equalled his best qualifying performance of the season (at the Monaco Grand Prix). Trulli was also optimistic about his chances because of the Jordan team's strong record at the circuit. Button qualified third, and said he was happy with his starting position. Michael Schumacher secured fourth position, nine-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, setting a lap time which pushed Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard into fifth. Coulthard, who had problems with grip, believed that he could have had a faster lap time. Ralf Schumacher secured sixth position after <b>being</b> <b>caught</b> <b>in</b> traffic during his final run, keeping the Williams driver from a quicker lap time. Villeneuve, in seventh, reported oversteering. Frentzen qualified eighth; his best lap time was disqualified after Coulthard blocked him at the Bus Stop chicane, which caused Frentzen to run onto the grass. Herbert and Barrichello rounded out the top ten drivers, with Barrichello spinning at the chicane during his third run after locking his brakes. Fisichella, eleventh, missed the top ten by three-tenths of a second on his only quick run of the session. Herbert's teammate, Eddie Irvine, qualified twelfth with tyre-grip problems. He was ahead of Zonta in the slower of the two BARs (which lost a half-second through Eau Rouge), Heidfeld in the faster Prost, Sauber's Pedro Diniz and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa. Alesi qualified 17th, despite spinning at the chicane and triggering a yellow flag. Salo qualified 18th, ahead of Wurz (who had engine problems and shared the spare Benetton monocoque with Fisichella). Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid, in positions 20 to 22.|$|E
