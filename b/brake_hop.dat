500|$|Crash Team Racing is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe, most of whom compete in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, <b>brake,</b> <b>hop</b> or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Two distinct forms of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of Crash Team Racing. Crates with question marks (?) on them hold power-ups and weapons, which {{can be obtained by}} driving through and breaking apart the said crates. When the player collects a weapon or power-up, it will appear in a box {{at the top of the}} screen. The player can activate the weapon or power-up to wreak havoc on the other racers or supplement the player's own performance. [...] "Fruit Crates" [...] carry [...] "Wumpa Fruit" [...] that increase the speed of the player's kart and strengthen the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained.|$|E
500|$|Crash Nitro Kart is {{a racing}} {{game in which}} the player {{controls}} characters from the Crash Bandicoot universe, most of whom race in karts. While racing, the player can accelerate, steer, reverse, <b>brake,</b> <b>hop</b> or use weapons and power-ups with the game controller's analog stick and buttons. Four distinct types of crates are scattered throughout the tracks and arenas of Crash Nitro Kart. [...] "Item Crates" [...] are marked with a question mark (?) and usually come in sets of four. The player can obtain a weapon or power-up by driving through an Item Crate and breaking it apart. The player can only carry one weapon or power-up at a time. [...] "Multiplier Crates" [...] are marked with an [...] "X" [...] and are usually found in hard-to-reach spots on the tracks. These special crates contain three of a certain weapon or power-up. [...] "Wumpa Crates" [...] are unmarked and carry [...] "Wumpa Fruit" [...] that strengthens the player's weapons and power-ups if ten of them are obtained. [...] "Activation Crates" [...] are marked with an exclamation point (!) and don't give the player anything when they are driven through; instead, they activate either a trap that can slow down the other racers or a boost pad.|$|E
