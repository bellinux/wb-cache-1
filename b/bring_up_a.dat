5|$|The tanks had {{difficulty}} {{keeping up with}} the advance. One obstacle was mines. On the first day, the 2/7th Field Company lifted fourteen mines but a tractor broke a track running over a mine. On 7 December, two more tanks were damaged by mines, one beyond repair. The sappers then cut a new track which they corduroyed. To support the attack on Lakona, the tanks had to cross a creek with steep coral banks, swollen by a torrential downpour. While efforts were made to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> compressor, tanks fired into banks and holes were packed with explosives and detonated. On the evening of 16 December, the infantry were joined by five Matilda tanks, and overran the Japanese positions. They counted 47 Japanese dead; and killed another 17 in mopping-up operations the next day. On 20 December, aided by four Matilda tanks and 750 rounds from the 25-pounders, the 4th Infantry Brigade occupied the Fortification Point area. Between 5 and 20 December, the4th Infantry Brigade reported 65 killed and 136 wounded. Japanese casualties were 420 killed and 136 found dead, victims of disease, malnutrition and suicide. Only six Japanese prisoners were taken.|$|E
25|$|When mice {{have more}} than one button, the {{software}} may assign different functions to each button. Often, the primary (leftmost in a right-handed configuration) button on the mouse will select items, and the secondary (rightmost in a right-handed) button will <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> menu of alternative actions applicable to that item. For example, on platforms with more than one button, the Mozilla web browser will follow a link in response to a primary button click, will <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> contextual menu of alternative actions for that link in response to a secondary-button click, and will often open the link in a new tab or window in response to a click with the tertiary (middle) mouse button.|$|E

25|$|Miami had {{to score}} a {{touchdown}} {{to tie the game}} and send it to a 3rd overtime. The Hurricanes drew a couple of blanks to put them in a 4th and 3 situation where Dorsey completed a 7-yard pass to Winslow for a 1st down. A facemask penalty was called on Ohio State during the play to make it 1st and 5 for Miami from the Buckeye 6-yard line. Ken Dorsey then threw an incomplete pass to Andre Johnson but a pass interference call on the Buckeyes defender gave Miami a 1st and goal from the 2-yard line. The Buckeye defense held Miami to only one yard in the next 3 plays to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> big 4th and goal on the 1-yard line. Ken Dorsey threw a pass as he was being hit by linebacker Cie Grant; it was incomplete, ending the game with Ohio State winning the BCS National Championship 31–24.|$|E
25|$|England {{came out}} to the evening session hoping to bat through losing one wicket maximum. Just a few overs in, Collingwood edged one through to the keeper, out for 5 off 36 balls. After that {{partnership}} in which 15 runs were scored for 75 balls, England had to bat more aggressively and Pietersen seemed the perfect man to do that for the team. Cook started looking much more confident against Warne and soon he was one run away from his maiden Ashes century, not made easy by Warne but eventually, Cook got the run to <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> 257-ball 100. The day had belonged firmly to England, but with just 3 overs left, McGrath took the wicket of Cook, edging behind to Gilchrist, and bowled nightwatchman Matthew Hoggard for a second-ball duck. McGrath proceeded to beat Flintoff with the remaining two balls, including an unsuccessful appeal for caught-behind. Flintoff and Pietersen, saw out the remaining overs, leaving England on 265 for 5.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the single campaign is {{a number of different}} battle scenarios, in which your pre-selected force will combat a number of enemy forces. Winning the scenario will award the player gold. Between battles the game switches to a map of the area, with the location of their army denoted by a figure of their champion. The player is then able to select his or her army and move to another location. This will <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> force selection screen, and the player will then have to select a limited number of troops and heroes to play the next scenario with. Although the campaign is for the most part linear, there are also optional side quests, which although mostly unrelated to the main story will usually result in the heroes acquiring additional gold, troops or equipment {{that can be used in}} the campaign. As well as traditional large scale battles there are also Duel scenarios in which a hero character of your choice will enter straight into a duel with an enemy champion, with victory of either champion immediately ending the scenario.|$|E
25|$|David Sheppard and Ray Illingworth both {{suffered}} from throat infections {{from the previous}} day and while Sheppard came to play after seeing a doctor, but Illingworth {{was sent back to}} the hotel to recover. Even if Dexter had wanted to go for the runs England's dismal start would have curtailed his ambitions. David Sheppard was caught - eventually - by Wally Grout on the first ball of the second over from Ken Mackay (1/13) to give him his 50th Test wicket and Geoff Pullar edged the ball to Simpson in the next over from McKenzie (1/63) to reduce England to 4/2. Ken Barrington and Colin Cowdrey saw the innings safely through the next hour and a half, adding 94 before he was run out by Norm O'Neill for 32. Barrington looked completely assured and began sweeping the Australian spin bowlers as Benaud, Simpson and O'Neill all tried their arm. Dexter was out to one-handed catch by Simpson off Benaud with 100 minutes to go and Ray Illingworth was recalled from the hotel in case he needed to bat, but he was not needed. A ball from McKenzie struck a nerve in Tom Graveney's arm, but after he recovered he settled down to a polished innings to accompany Barrington to his hundred. This was reached with a pull for six off Simpson over long-on, his seventh Test century and his first against Australia. Strangely, the stonewalling Barrington would <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> Test century four times with a six and he hit another in the same over. Benaud brought in the new ball and gave it to Bill Lawry who nearly knocked Barrington's cap off with a beamer that went for 4 byes followed this with 4 wides, as extras were not counted against the bowler in those days this counted as a maiden. Barrington finished with 2 sixes and 16 fours in his 132 not out and he and Graveney (36 not out) played out the day with an unbeaten partnership of 101 to take England to 223/4.|$|E

The family soon discovers that Meg can fit through the vent, so they force Meg through the vent and into the kitchen. Peter uses a loud speaker to contact Meg from the panic room, therefore alerting the burglars to the fact that somebody is in the kitchen. In order to take the family's mind off Meg being captured, Peter tells the story of Nate Griffin. Nate lived in the small village of Quahogsuana, but was captured by a white version of Cleveland Brown from South Carolina and taken to the United States. He, along with Quagdingo and Joe Mama, prank the ship captain. While sleeping, they push his bed into the ocean. Nate is caught after briefly escaping and forced to work on a plantation. He falls in love with the owner's daughter, Lois's relatives, and together, they <b>bring</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> secret family.
