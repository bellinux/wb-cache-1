40|$|This {{study shows}} <b>that</b> {{targeted}} <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> become acquirers generally overpay.

However, such a strategy is costly. I find that market reactions to bank mergers involving recently targeted acquirers are significantly more negative than market reactions to mergers involving nontargeted acquirers. This is consistent with the market perceiving acquisitions by targeted banks as being generally defensive in nature. ...|$|R

5|$|ExxonMobil leads a {{consortium}} of Chevron and Petronas that has invested $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves estimated at one billion barrels in southern Chad. Oil production began in 2003 with {{the completion of a}} pipeline (financed in part by the World <b>Bank)</b> <b>that</b> links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon. As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount. On 14 July 2006, the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70% of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to offer}} a {{comprehensive}} comparison of the characteristics between <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> securitize and <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> do not and to provide evidence of the capital arbitrage theory of securitization. Design/methodology/approach – First, the fundamental financial {{similarities and differences between}} <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> securitize assets and <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> do not participate in the securitization market are tested. Second, variables that help predict whether a bank securitizes assets are analyzed. Third, the determinants of securitization extent in <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> securitize assets are investigated – for general securitization extent and for specific type of asset securitized. Using a sample of 112 <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> securitize different assets, a matched sample of <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> do not securitize based on entity type and size is created. A quarterly panel data set of these banks dating back to 2001 is used. Findings – The results indicate <b>that</b> <b>bank</b> size is a significant determinant of whether a bank securitizes. Further, overall securitization extent is negatively related to the bank's capital ratio (in support of capital arbitrage theory), but this result is primarily driven by credit card securitization. Originality/value – Utilizing a unique data set of quarterly data from bank Call Reports; the panel data set is large relative to past studies. A matched sample approach was used to test fundamental financial similarities and differences between securitizing and non-securitizing banks. In addition to aggregated securitization, an examination was made of how different classes of assets affect the banks' risk-based capital ratios and test the capital arbitrage theory of securitization.

30|$|Bian et al. (2017) analyze bailouts in German savings <b>banks,</b> showing <b>that</b> <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> are {{bailed out}} by local {{politicians}} (decentralized resolution) experience less restructuring and perform considerably worse than <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> are bailed out by state associations (centralized resolution). In comparing the two alternatives they note the following trade-off: “On the one hand, close proximity {{has the potential}} to improve the decision making process, as it provides politicians with good information about <b>banks</b> <b>that</b> get into distress. On the other hand, close proximity could imply that politicians’ personal considerations distort the decision making process, which is clearly undesirable.” Such trade-off is similar to the one considered in this paper.|$|R
5|$|In 1982, bank Credireal was Atlético's first shirt sponsor. After one sponsorless {{season in}} 1983, Precon, a {{construction}} company, {{appeared on the}} shirts in 1984 and 1985; it was replaced by Agrimisa bank in 1986. In 1987, Coca-Cola sponsored all participating clubs of Copa União, and the brand remained on Atlético's kits until 1994. The club was subsequently sponsored by TAM Airlines (1995–96), Tenda (1997–98), and had temporary deals with Fiat and Telemar in 1999. Two sponsorless years followed, before permanent deals were signed with Fiat (2002–03), MRV Engenharia (2004–07) and Fiat again in 2008. After one more season without a brand on the club's shirts, BMG, a <b>bank</b> <b>that</b> was owned by the former club president Ricardo Annes Guimarães, was the main sponsor from 2010 to 2014. MRV returned as the club's main shirt sponsor in 2015, being replaced by state-owned bank Caixa Econômica Federal in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy seed <b>bank</b> <b>that</b> is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E

5|$|Tyler was {{not only}} the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency, but at age 51, was the youngest president to that point. One of the main political principles he was guided by was states' rights, and he opposed a national <b>bank,</b> <b>that</b> the Whigs wanted to help develop the country, but which Tyler saw as an imposition on the sovereignty of the states. Tyler vetoed two bills to establish a national bank. Whig leaders, who wanted such a bank, saw political advantage in a breach with him.

5|$|A {{settlement}} {{on the east}} bank of the Mississippi near St. Anthony Falls was envisioned in the 1830s by Joseph Plympton, who became commander of Fort Snelling in 1837. He made a more accurate survey of the reservation lands and transmitted a map to the War Department delimiting about 34,000 acres (140km²) within the reservation. He cleverly drew the boundary line to exclude {{certain parts of the}} east <b>bank</b> <b>that</b> {{had been part of the}} 1805 cession to Zebulon Pike. His plan was to stake a pre-emption claim at the falls. However, Franklin Steele also had plans to stake a claim. On July 15, 1838, word reached Fort Snelling that a treaty between the United States and the Dakota and Ojibwa had been ratified, ceding land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi Rivers. Steele rushed off to the falls, built a shanty, and marked off boundary lines. Plympton's party arrived the next morning, but they were too late to claim the most desirable land. Plympton claimed some less desirable land near Steele's claim, as did other settlers such as Pierre Bottineau, Joseph Rondo, Samuel Findley, and Baptiste Turpin. Steele went on to build a dam at the falls and built a sawmill that cut logs from the Rum River area.|$|E

Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda Raison) believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
