5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E
500|$|In each panel, Dyer {{is framed}} by a doorway, and set against a flat, {{anonymous}} foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame the <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|E

[...] Flying at such low altitude, each pilot was blinded by the reflection of his own landing light when he looked towards the ground. Walsh noticed that he could clearly see the ground beneath the other helicopter's light, and so instructed Nicholls to turn off his landing light and allow him to illuminate the landing site for him. [...] "This worked like a charm," [...] says Petter-Bowyer. Guided by Walsh's landing light, Nicholls safely landed and collected some of the casualties, then did the same for Walsh as he picked up the rest.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{calibration}} experiments were run {{in order to}} determine <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colour <b>of</b> suspended sediment on <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> optical backscatter sensors (OBS). Munsell notation describes <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> soil and sediment colour using the three parameters, hue, chroma, and value, which represent, respectively, the spectral position, lightness level, and amount of pure chromatic colour present. <b>The</b> exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OBS to Munsell Soil Chart patches revealed that the OBS is sensitive to variations in Munsell value and not Munsell hue or chroma. Since OBS output decreased with darkness level (and increased with lightness level and Munsell value), it is suggested that <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> particles acts to absorb the near-infrared (IR) signal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OBS, modifying its output. A strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 984) was found between the observed and predicted OBS outputs of varying concentrations and ratios of black and white suspended sediment.
