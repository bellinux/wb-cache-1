25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A derailleur for gear selection would introduce chain slack, which {{would interfere with}} <b>braking.</b> <b>Gear</b> selection can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all.|$|E
5000|$|Inspection of {{the track}} and {{equipment}} found no contributing defects. The track was [...] "in perfect surface and alignment". The <b>braking</b> <b>gear</b> on the engine was in working order. The engine and tender had undergone routine maintenance the prior May. The engine's throttle was observed after the accident as being [...] "wide open". The train passed a signal tower at St. Johnsville, 9.83 miles km east of the crash site, four minutes before derailing. From the distance, the train's speed {{at the time was}} calculated to be at least 60 miles km per hour. According to the survivors, the train was approximately 15 minutes behind schedule and the engineer was trying to make up time.|$|E
50|$|The NZR H class {{locomotive}} was {{a unique}} class of locomotive used by the New Zealand Railways Department on the famous Rimutaka Incline, the 3 mi section of 1 in 15 (6.67 %) gradient between Cross Creek and Summit, over the Rimutaka Ranges. The locomotives worked on the Fell mountain railway system and had four horizontal driving wheels between the frames, gripping a centre rail and providing the extra adhesion needed for the climb. The outside engines drove the rear pair of coupled wheels of 32 in diameter, and the inside cylinders four spring-loaded grip wheels of 22 in diameter. On the descent, powerful hand-brakes bore against the centre rail, and brake vans with similar <b>braking</b> <b>gear</b> were interspersed at intervals in the train. The locomotives were never required to run at speeds higher than 15 mph, and their usual operating speed was between 4 and 6 mph ascending the incline, about 10 mph descending.|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotives}} used {{saturated steam}} and had Walschaerts valve gear with slide valves. Like many other Central African locomotives of the day, they were wood-burners and some modifications {{were required to}} adapt them to coal-burning on the SAR. In addition, their tenders and <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> had been lost at sea {{and they had to}} be fitted with SAR tenders, which were pirated from unserviceable engines awaiting or undergoing repair. The required engine <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> was designed in the Pretoria drawing office and manufactured in the Salvokop workshops.|$|R
5000|$|A tiptronic {{transmission}} can {{operate in the}} same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission, but also offers the driver an additional method of manually overriding the automatic shift changes. By moving the shift lever into a second operating plane of the shift gate, equipped with two spring-loaded positions: [...] "upshift" [...] and [...] "downshift", the driver takes over most of the gear shifting decisions, which would ordinarily be performed by the transmission's computer. For example, this allows delayed upshifts for increased acceleration, increased engine <b>braking,</b> <b>gear</b> holding in curves, downshifting before passing, or early upshifting for cruising. On some models, the upshift and downshift operations can also be controlled by push-buttons or [...] "paddle shifters" [...] installed on the steering wheel, with an optional display in the instrument panel indicating the current gear selection. Since adding Tiptronic to a semi-automatic transmission involves an additional shift gate into the computer and update to the transmission software, it is inexpensive and lightweight to implement. Although tiptronic transmissions allow the driver a certain measure of discrete control, the tiptronic design is implemented using a torque converter like other automatic transmissions. A true tiptronic transmission is not a computer controlled manual transmission (with a conventional clutch), or semi-automatic transmission. Most tiptronic implementations still make some shifts automatically, primarily to protect the engine and transmission. For example, as used by licensee Audi, the five-speed tiptronic will automatically make the upshift from 1 to 2 when moving off from a stop, even when in manual mode; the transmission then waits for the user's upshift command before proceeding from 2 to 3, 3 to 4 and 4 to 5, although the transmission will still upshift if the redline is approached. On deceleration, the transmission will make all downshifts automatically when close to the tick-over or idle speed, to prevent the engine from stalling at too-low an RPM, although the user can accelerate any downshift that would not exceed the redline.|$|E
40|$|A robust ground {{traction}} (drive) assembly for {{remotely controlled}} vehicles, {{which not only}} operates smoothly on surfaces that are flat, but also upon surfaces that include rugged terrain, snow, mud, and sand, is provided. The assembly includes a sun gear and a <b>braking</b> <b>gear.</b> The sun gear is configured to cause rotational force {{to be applied to}} second planetary gears through a coupling of first planetary gears. The <b>braking</b> <b>gear</b> is configured to cause the assembly (or the second planetary gears) to rotate around the <b>braking</b> <b>gear</b> when an obstacle or braking force is applied...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new method for iterative road grade estimation based on sensors that are commonplace in modern heavy duty vehicles. Estimates from multiple passes {{of the same}} road segment are merged {{together to form a}} road grade map, that is improved each time the vehicle revisits an already traveled route. The estimation algorithm is discussed in detail together with its implementation and experimental evaluation on real vehicles.   An increasing need for goods and passenger transportation drives continuing worldwide growth in road transportation while environmental concerns, traffic safety issues, and cost efficiency are becoming more important. Advancements in microelectronics open the possibility to address these issues through new advanced driver assistance systems. Applications such as predictive cruise control, automated gearbox control, predictive front lighting control and hybrid vehicle state-of-charge control benefit from preview road grade information. Using global navigation satellite systems an exact vehicle position can be obtained. This enables stored maps {{to be used as a}} source of preview road grade information. The task of creating such maps is addressed herein by the proposal of a method where the vehicle itself estimates the road grade each time it travels along a road and stores the information for later use.   The presented road grade estimation method uses data from sensors that are standard equipment in heavy duty vehicles equipped with map-based advanced driver assistance systems. Measurements of the vehicle speed and the engine torque are combined with observations of the road altitude from a GPS receiver in a Kalman filter, to form a road grade estimate based on a system model. The noise covariance parameters of the filter are adjusted during gear shifts, braking and poor satellite coverage. The estimated error covariance of the road grade estimate is then used together with its absolute position to update a stored road grade map, which is based on all previous times the vehicle has passed the same location.   Highway driving trials detailed in the thesis demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of accurately estimating the road grade based on few road traversals. The performance of the estimator under conditions such as <b>braking,</b> <b>gear</b> shifting, and loss of satellite coverage is presented. The experimental results indicate that road grade estimates from the proposed method are accurate enough to be used in predictive vehicle control systems to enhance safety, efficiency, and driver comfort of heavy duty vehicles.

50|$|The main cradle {{frame was}} carried on {{adjustable}} pivots. The front pivot was a spherical type, {{located on the}} front engine unit's frame between the driving and trailing coupled wheels, while the rear pivot was a flat oil-bath type, located on the rear engine unit's frame over the driving wheels. Each engine unit’s frames were formed of two continuous bars, 33 ft long and extending from the buffer beams at the outer ends to the cross-beams over the Bissel wheels at the inner ends. The front engine unit was equipped with steam as well as vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>gear,</b> while the hind unit was equipped with steam <b>brake</b> <b>gear</b> and handbrake gear.|$|R
