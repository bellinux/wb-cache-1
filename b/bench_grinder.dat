25|$|A <b>bench</b> <b>grinder</b> {{is usually}} {{used to create}} the sparks, but {{sometimes}} this is not convenient, so a portable grinder is used. In either case, the grinding wheel must have adequate surface velocity, at least 23m/s (4500surface feet per minute (sfpm)), but should be between 38 and 58m/s (7500â€“11,500sfpm). The wheel should be coarse and hard, therefore aluminium oxide or carborundum often are employed. The test area should be {{in an area where}} there is no bright light shining directly into the observer's eyes. Moreover, the grinding wheel and surrounding area should be dark so that the sparks can be observed clearly. The test sample is then touched lightly to the grinding wheel to produce the sparks.|$|E

50|$|A flick grinder is {{a surface}} grinder or tool and cutter grinder, its usage is varied, {{but it may}} be used where great {{accuracy}} is not required, but a machine superior to a <b>bench</b> <b>grinder</b> is required.|$|E
50|$|Grinding is {{prohibited}} {{on the side}} of a typical (disk-shaped) <b>bench</b> <b>grinder</b> wheel, which is designed for grinding on the periphery only. Risk of wheel explosion otherwise threatens. Some tool and cutter grinders have cup-shaped wheels designed to do grinding on the side.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bench</b> <b>grinder,</b> {{which usually}} has two wheels of {{different}} grain sizes for roughing and finishing operations and is secured to a workbench or floor stand. Its uses include shaping tool bits or various tools {{that need to}} be made or repaired. Bench grinders are manually operated.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to arrange the weight distribution of the wheels for better balancing. There are several methods of doing this, all being conceptually analogous to tire balancing with wheel weights. Most <b>bench</b> <b>grinders</b> never have these operations performed, because wheel dressing alone is enough to keep them sufficiently balanced, but these additional methods are not unusual for <b>bench</b> <b>grinders</b> and are quite common for machine tools that do grinding, such as surface grinders and cylindrical grinders. This is sometimes achieved by drilling a few holes in the steel flanges that hold the grinding wheels and then finding the angular orientation at which the holes' lack of weight balances out a heavy spot elsewhere on the rotating mass. Another method is a dedicated type of large flange with little weights that can be screwed down wherever needed for balancing (called a balancing flange).|$|R
5000|$|A {{wire brush}} wheel or buffing wheels can be interchanged with the {{grinding}} wheels {{in order to}} clean or polish workpieces. Stiff buffing wheels {{can also be used}} when deburring is the task at hand. Some buffing machines (buffers) are built on the same concept as <b>bench</b> <b>grinders</b> except for longer housings and arbors with buffing wheels instead of grinding wheels.|$|R
50|$|Some {{grinders}} for knife sharpening duty {{are of the}} wet type, {{in which}} {{the bottom of the}} wheel runs within a pan of water or other coolant. A tube may also deliver a stream of coolant {{near the top of the}} wheel. These grinders are not always called <b>bench</b> <b>grinders,</b> but they are among the class of benchtop grinding machines.|$|R
50|$|These gauges {{are most}} {{commonly}} used when hand-grinding threading tool bits on a <b>bench</b> <b>grinder,</b> although they may be used with tool and cutter grinders. When the tool bit has been ground to the correct angle, they may then be used to set the tool perpendicular to the workpiece.|$|E
50|$|On May 21, 2009, {{a skeptic}} writing {{under the name}} Natan Weissman wrote an {{explanation}} of Perepiteia in relation to its motor, a Ryobi <b>bench</b> <b>grinder.</b> The author states that the acceleration behavior of the machine {{is due to the}} consumption of torque from the induction motor, rather than any unconventional manipulation of Electromagnetic fields or Counter-electromotive force.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bench</b> <b>grinder</b> is a {{benchtop}} type of {{grinding machine}} {{used to drive}} abrasive wheels. A pedestal grinder is a similar or larger version of grinder that is mounted on a , which may be bolted to the floor or may sit on rubber feet. These types of grinders are commonly used to hand grind various cutting tools and perform other rough grinding.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{wheels on}} most <b>bench</b> <b>grinders</b> are vitreous-bond wheels. They work {{best to do}} their {{intended}} task, but they inherently have a risk of cracking. Grinding wheels designed for steel {{are not to be}} used for grinding softer metals, like aluminium. The soft metal gets lodged in the pores of the wheel and later expands with the heat of grinding. This can dislodge pieces of the grinding wheel, causing injury.|$|R
50|$|A {{wire brush}} {{is a tool}} {{consisting}} of a brush whose bristles are made of wire, most often steel wire. The steel used is generally a medium- to high-carbon variety and very hard and springy. Other wire brushes feature bristles made from brass or stainless steel, depending on application. Wires in a wire brush can be held together by epoxy, staples, or other binding. Wire brushes usually either have a handle of wood or plastic (for handheld use) or are formed into a wheel for use on angle <b>grinders,</b> <b>bench</b> <b>grinders,</b> pistol-grip drill motors, or other power tools.|$|R
50|$|Power {{tools are}} {{classified}} as either stationary or portable, where portable means hand-held. Portable power tools have obvious advantages in mobility. Stationary power tools however often have advantages in speed and accuracy, and some stationary power tools can produce objects that cannot be made in any other way.Stationary power tools for metalworking are usually called machine tools. The term machine tool is not usually applied to stationary power tools for woodworking, although such usage is occasionally heard, and in some cases, such as drill presses and <b>bench</b> <b>grinders,</b> exactly the same tool is used for both woodworking and metalworking.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases of}} severe {{oxidation}} not removable by gentler methods, abrasion with something {{hard enough to}} remove oxide but not so hard as to scratch the iron plating can be used. A brass wire scourer, brush, or wheel on a <b>bench</b> <b>grinder,</b> {{can be used with}} care. Sandpaper and other tools may be used but are likely to damage the plating.|$|E
50|$|Spike mauls are {{hardened}} tools. Occasionally {{the head}} may become upset or chipped. Heads are often reground on a <b>bench</b> <b>grinder</b> to remove nicks and metal flow. This practice is becoming less common as grinding can hide cracks and other defects. It {{is also possible}} to overheat the steel while grinding and {{remove some of the}} temper from the tool.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bench</b> <b>grinder</b> wheels {{sometimes}} need to {{be restored}} to roundness and given a fresh grinding face with newly exposed grains. New wheels have suitable balance when first made, but whether the balanced state will last after the wheel has been mounted, and (especially) {{after it has been}} in use for a while, is [...] "quite uncertain". It can seem counterintuitive that they could wear as unevenly as they sometimes do, but a slow spin of the resting wheel by hand confirms it by showing the gap between wheel and tool rest varying substantially as the wheel turns. Thus it is normal that wheels sometimes {{need to be}} dressed (neatly trimmed), which is achieved by any of several types of wheel dresser. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing usually resolves this problem. Although some consumers might imagine buying a <b>bench</b> <b>grinder</b> and then using it for many years without thinking about wheel dressing, the need for dressing is not so seldom as that. Correcting the imbalance not only reduces the annoyance of vibration (which rattles the wheel guards and shakes the workbench) but also is important to prevent premature failure of the spindle bearings, as heavy vibration beats them excessively.|$|E
50|$|The Rockwell Tools brand {{features}} {{power tools}} (both corded and cordless) and hand tools. Some of these tools include drills, VersaCut circular saws, power planers, miter saws, G-Force angle <b>grinders,</b> sanders, and <b>bench</b> <b>grinders.</b> Many {{of the products}} offered by Rockwell Tools come with free batteries for life. Rockwell Tools also {{offers a variety of}} specialty tools including the Sonicrafter, an oscillating multi-tool that is used for remodeling and general home improvement. The Jawhorse is a clamping device that is similar in style to a bench vise, but offers hands-free operation. Rockwell also offers the ShopSeries, which is a line of tools aimed at budget-conscious DIYers.|$|R
50|$|Grinding metal on a {{power-driven}} {{grinding wheel}} quickly heats up the workpiece. Most <b>bench</b> <b>grinders</b> {{are of the}} dry type, in which no cutting fluid (coolant) is used at the grinding interface, but often the workpiece is recurrently dunked into a pan or pot of water for cooling so as {{to keep it from}} getting hot enough to lose its temper, burn the operator's hand, or both. Such pots are often mounted just below the grinder for safe and easy reach. For medium-carbon or high-carbon workpieces that are already hardened and tempered (such as tool bits and drill bits), the dipping of the piece into the water must be frequent enough to avoid very high heat followed by substantial quenching, which can easily destroy the existing heat treatment.|$|R
5000|$|True {{the wheel}} by {{knocking}} abrasive particles from the wheel's surface {{and making the}} wheel concentric. This minimizes vibration and improves surface finish, eliminating the vibration of the out-of-balance wheel across the workpiece's surface. It {{is not unusual for}} grinding wheels to become out of round with use. This is partially from loaded (clogged) areas of the wheel wearing at different rates from less loaded areas. It can also be exacerbated by grinding when the wheel is not under power, such as using the work to apply braking action to the wheel to stop it from coasting. Dressing restores the roundness. When <b>bench</b> <b>grinders</b> vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing resolves this problem.|$|R
50|$|V-Picks {{are made}} in two locations: Nashville TN and Modesto CA. The company {{produces}} over 100,000 hand made picks per year, and supplies guitar picks to 101 countries in the world. Some models are originally cut out by laser from sheets of cast acrylic. Others start as raw materials poured into molds. Both styles are then hand ground on a <b>bench</b> <b>grinder</b> and hand trimmed with a razor knife. This creates the bevel, feel, and sound of the pick. Next, they are tempered for strength with intense high heat, much like the process done on steel and glass. Then they are buffed with high heat flame for a smooth and slick playing edge and bevel.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of the drill bit sharpening jigs for <b>bench</b> <b>grinder.</b> The objective of this thesis is to design the drill bit sharpener jig that enhance the better outcome rather than manual sharpening operation. The thesis follows with the development of the drill bit sharpening jig that can be attached to the <b>bench</b> <b>grinder.</b> The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of drill bit sharpening jig was developed using the computer-aided drawing software which is CATIA V 5 R 21. The strategy of validation of the model design was developed. The generative part structural analysis was then performed using simulation in CATIA V 5 R 21 to detect the Von Mises distribution. The design and suitable material will be validated. The fabrication of the jig may undergoes in various machining process such as milling, turning, electrical discharge wirecut and grinding. The assembled part shall be tested on the <b>bench</b> <b>grinder.</b> Besides, several dull drill bits will be sharpen using the jig. These assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. Further analysis will be conducted by testing the drilling process on the workpiece. The resharpen drill bits and the new drill bits will results on the difference surface roughness. Thus, the surface roughness analysis is performed to distinguish hole surface roughness outcomes for both drill bits. The results shows the difference of surface roughness between both hole surface is small and insignificant. Thus, it means that the outcomes is relatively same. The jig can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” Java {{has become}} one of the {{predominant}} languages for embedded and mobile platforms due to its architecturally neutral design, portability, and security. But Java execution in the embedded world encompasses Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) specially tuned for the embedded world, with stripped-down capabilities, and configurations for memory-limited environments. While there have been some studies on desktop and server Java, there have been very few studies on embedded Java. The non proliferation of embedded Java benchmarks and the lack of widespread profiling tools and simulators have only exacerbated the problem. While the industry uses some benchmarks such as MorphMark, MIDPMark, and EEMBC Java <b>Grinder</b> <b>Bench,</b> their representativeness in comparison to actual embedded Java applications has not been studied. In order to conduct such a study, we gathered an actual mobile phone application suite and characterized it in detail. We measure several properties of the various applications and benchmarks, perform similarity/dissimilarity analysis and shed light on the representativeness of current industry standard embedded benchmarks against actual mobile Java applications. It was observed that for many characteristics, the applications had a broader range, indicating that the benchmarks were under representing the range of characteristics in the real world. Furthermore, we find that the applications exhibit less code reuse/hotness compared to the benchmarks. We also draw comparisons of the embedded benchmarks against popular desktop/client Java benchmarks, such as the SPECjvm 98 and DaCapo. Interestingly, embedded applications spend a significant amount of time in standard library code, on average 65 %, suggesting to the usefulness of software and hardware techniques to facilitate pre-compilation with out the real time resource overhead of JIT.
