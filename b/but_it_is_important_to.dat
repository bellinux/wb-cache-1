5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any analog signals (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or analog signals). Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E

Trotsky had previously suggested that Lenin's method of organisation would lead to a dictatorship, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> emphasise that after 1917 orthodox Trotskyists argue that the loss of democracy in the Soviet Union was caused by the failure of the revolution to successfully spread internationally and the consequent wars, isolation and imperialist intervention, not the Bolshevik style of organisation.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} crisis in the 1990s has been widely cited in the Anglo-American press as a social democratic failure, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note not only did profit rates begin to fall worldwide after the 1960s, also this period saw neoliberal ascendance in Social Democratic ideology and policies {{as well as the}} rise of bourgeois coalition rule in place of the Social Democrats. 1980s Social Democratic neoliberal measures—such as depressing and deregulating the currency to prop up Swedish exports during the economic restructuring transition, dropping corporate taxation and taxation on high income-earners, and switching from anti-unemployment policies to anti-inflationary policies—were exacerbated by international recession, unchecked currency speculation, and a centre-right government led by Carl Bildt (1991–1994), creating the fiscal crisis of the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an element}} of truth to Dayan's claim, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note that Israel {{regarded}} the de-militarized zones in the north as part of their sovereign territory and reserved the right to cultivate them—a right that the Syrians consistently resisted with force. Syria also worked to benefit from the Jordan river before it flowed into Israel, aiming to get use of it as a water source; Syria also actively supported Palestinian resistance movements against Israel. Israel occasionally exploited incidents in the de-militarized zones to strike at the Syrian water diversion project and to punish the Syrians for their support of the Palestinian resistance. Dayan's remarks must also be taken in context {{of the fact that he}} was a member of the opposition at the time. His attitude toward the Syrians changed dramatically once he became defense minister. Indeed, on June 8, 1967, Dayan bypassed both the Prime Minister and the Chief of staff in ordering the Israeli army to attack and capture the Golan.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, this is only a problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{aspect of the}} Moon is the contrast between its bright and dark zones. Lighter surfaces are the lunar highlands, which receive the name of terrae (singular terra, from the Latin for Earth), and the darker plains are called maria (singular mare, from the Latin for sea), after Johannes Kepler who introduced the name in the 17th century. The highlands are anorthositic in composition, whereas the maria are basaltic. The maria often coincide with the [...] "lowlands," [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note that the lowlands (such as within the South Pole-Aitken basin) are not always covered by maria. The highlands are older than the visible maria, and hence are more heavily cratered.|$|E
2500|$|Because Gacaca's {{original}} purpose {{was not to}} handle crimes {{at the level of}} severity as those committed during the genocide, the punishments associated with determination of guilt often do not fit the crime and require further proximity and intimacy between the perpetrator and victim. Despite its restorative nature, Gacaca is a legal process and with this in mind punishment constitutes a major element of the Gacaca courts. Perpetrators found guilty are sentenced to some form of punishment, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note that this rarely {{takes the form of a}} jail sentence and instead demands tasks such as the rebuilding of victims’ homes, working in their fields or other variations of community service. Thus, despite Gacaca’s clear punitive and legal elements, in many ways the nature of punishment remains within a restorative framework of repairing the harm done through practical measures.|$|E

[...] The species of tree on which the lichen is growing and the general location of that tree are both thought to be important factors for deciding if it is the right type of lichen to eat, but not everyone agrees on which locations and tree species are better. [...] Many people taste the lichen first to make sure that it isn't bitter, and some people choose the lichens that are darker coloured.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{after the}} Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy, Harris wrote, [...] "The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' {{is a dangerous}} fantasy—and {{it is now a}} particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It {{is not at all clear}} how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms is not the answer.

2500|$|The lunar {{geological}} time scale has been divided into five periods (Pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and Copernican) {{with one of}} these (the Imbrian) being subdivided into two epochs. These divisions of {{geological time}} are based on the recognition of convenient geomorphological markers, and as such, they should not be taken to imply that any fundamental changes in geological processes have occurred at these boundaries. The Moon is unique in the solar system in that it is the only body (other than the Earth) for which we possess rock samples with a known geological context. By correlating the ages of samples obtained from the Apollo missions to known geological units, it has been possible to assign absolute [...] ages to some of these geological periods. The timeline below represents one such attempt, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> note (as is discussed below) that some of the ages are either uncertain, or disputed.

2500|$|Behavioral {{control is}} an {{important}} application of cognitive inhibition in behavioral psychology, as is emotional control. Depression {{is an example of}} cognitive inhibition failure in emotion control. Correctly functioning cognitive inhibition would result in reduced selective attention to negative stimuli and retention of negative thoughts. [...] "There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes". Anger is another important emotion affected by cognitive inhibition. [...] "Trait anger is a robust predictor of the angry and aggressive response to hostile situational input, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> better understand the mechanisms underlying this personality...individuals low in trait anger systematically recruit cognitive control resources within hostile contexts". When situations that may elicit anger leading to violence arise, cognitive inhibition is used extensively. Hostile stimuli magnitude are considered and ignored to avoid confrontation. Social context situations that may be interpreted as hostile are processed, and through cognitive inhibition, logic and reasoning are used to handle the situation. When a degree of cognitive inhibition ability is absent in an individual, it can result in [...] "trait anger", or frequent angry and violent outbursts at relatively inoffensive stimuli. Without cognitive inhibition and its resulting omission of irrelevant or unimportant information, emotional stability can be compromised.|$|E
