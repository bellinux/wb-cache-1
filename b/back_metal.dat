[...] Water is broken into {{hydrogen and oxygen}} by electrolysis—a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) process which is also named artificial photosynthesis. William Ayers at Energy Conversion Devices demonstrated and patented the first multijunction high efficiency photoelectrochemical system for direct splitting of water in 1983. This group demonstrated direct water splitting now referred to as an [...] "artificial leaf" [...] or [...] "wireless solar water splitting" [...] with a low cost thin film amorphous silicon multijunction sheet immersed directly in water. Hydrogen evolved on the front amorphous silcon surface decorated with various catalysts while oxygen evolved off the <b>back</b> <b>metal</b> substrate.

[...] Research continues towards developing high-efficiency multi-junction cell technology at universities and the photovoltaic industry. [...] If this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water instead of using photovoltaic and an electrolytic system, the reaction is in just one step, which can improve efficiency.|$|E

A Nafion membrane above the immersed cell provided a path for proton transport. The higher photovoltage available from the multijuction thin film cell with visible light was a major advance over previous photolysis attempts with UV sensitive single junction cells.

5000|$|Anders Odden {{started out}} as a black metal {{musician}} and artist in the mid 80s, and went on to start one of Norway's first death metal bands, Cadaver, in 1988. He formed Magenta in 1995 as an outlet for other musical ideas than death metal. Celtic Frost recruited him as their live guitarist in 2006. He toured Europe, USA, Canada and Japan with them on their Monotheist Tour, which ended in 2007. After Celtic Frost he co-founded metal super group Doctor Midnight & The Mercy Cult that lasted between 2009-2011. He had by then joined Satyricon as their temp live bass player in 2009, but moved on to hold this position permanently from 2013.

Mumkhar deserts, {{and in the}} process of defeating the Mechon, the Monado paralyzes Dunban's right arm. In the present, Shulk studies the Monado in Colony 9, where Dunban and Fiora live. Colony 9 is soon attacked by a group of Mechon led by a special Face Mechon called Metal Face. Dunban is almost killed when he attempts to use the Monado again, prompting Shulk to use it: he wields it with ease, and receives visions of the future from it. While the Mechon are driven <b>back,</b> <b>Metal</b> Face proves immune to the Monado and kills Fiora before fleeing. Swearing revenge against Metal Face, Shulk sets out together with Reyn. They meet Sharla from the decimated Colony 6 and work to free it from Mechon occupation. They reunite with Dunban on their journey shortly thereafter. Guided by a vision from Shulk, the group travel to the High Entia capital to gain entry to Prison Island, joined by Melia and Riki. Shulk also meets Alvis, who is revealed to share Shulk's ability to wield the Monado. Gaining entry, they encounter Zanza, a being who created the Monado and who offers Shulk the ability to destroy the Face Mechon, revealed to be humans inside Mechon mechs. Though Shulk accepts and the Monado is granted the ability to destroy humans, Zanza is killed by Metal Face and another Mechon called Face Nemesis during an attack on the capital. During the ensuing battle, Face Nemesis is damaged to reveal a recreated and amnesiac Fiora controlling it.|$|E
50|$|The {{details of}} the {{fabrication}} sequence vary from group to group. Typically, good quality, CZ/FZ grown c-Si wafer (with ~1ms lifetimes) are used as the absorber layer of HIT cells. Using alkaline etchants, such as, NaOH or (CH3)4NOH the (100) surface of the wafer is textured to form the pyramids of 5-10μm height. Next, the wafer is cleanedusing peroxide and HF solutions. This is followed by deposition of intrinsic a-Si passivation layer, typically through PECVD or Hot-wire CVD. The silane (SiH4) gas diluted with H2 {{is used as a}} precursor. The deposition temperature and pressure is maintained at 200o C and 0.1-1 Torr. Precise control over this step is essential to avoid the formation of defective epitaxial Si. Cycles of deposition and annealing and H2 plasma treatment are shown to have provided excellent surface passivation. Diborane or Trimethylboron gas mixed with SiH4 is used to deposit p-type a-Si layer, while, Phosphine gas mixed with SiH4 is used to deposit n-type a-Si layer. It should be noted that direct deposition of doped a-Si layers on c-Si wafer is shown to have very poor passivation properties. This is most likely due to dopant induced defect generation in a-Si layers. Sputtered Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is commonly used as a transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layer on top of the front and back a-Si layer in bi-facial design, as a-Si has high lateral resistance. It is generally deposited on the back side as well fully metallized cell to avoid diffusion of <b>back</b> <b>metal</b> and also for impedance matching for the reflected light. The silver/aluminum grid of 50-100μm thick is deposited through stencil printing for the front contact and back contact for bi-facial design. The detailed description of the fabrication process can be found in.|$|E
