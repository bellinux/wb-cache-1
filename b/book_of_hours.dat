5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag {{is found in the}} Vienna <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours,</b> circa 1503, in which a white saltire is depicted with a red background. In the case of Scotland, use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century, with the first certain illustration of a flag depicting such appearing in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount's Register of Scottish Arms, circa 1542.|$|E
5|$|It was in {{this period}} that the {{national}} flag emerged as a common symbol. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, {{first appeared in the}} Kingdom of Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late 13th century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late 14th century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag {{is to be found in}} the Vienna <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours,</b> circa 1503.|$|E
5|$|Netherlandish artists found {{increasingly}} inventive ways {{to highlight}} and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored {{the interplay between}} the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text. An example is the Nassau <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> (c.1467–80) by the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy, in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland (possibly Gerard Horenbout), known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred {{the line between the}} miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.|$|E
50|$|In 1525 and 1527 Colines {{published}} <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> with decorations by Geoffroy Tory. Both books {{together are}} called the Tory <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours.</b> Colines also published <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> in the 1540s. Colines's miniature Vulgate was widely circulated and went through 50 editions. In 1541 Colines revised a Latin Bible folio with diacritical marks which contained a geographical index by Robert Estienne in Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. The volume, over 800 pages long, was a difficult printing job and published by Galliot du Pré and Lyonese Antoine Vincent.|$|R
40|$|PhDr. Kateřina Průšová Book as a Jewel, Francoflemish <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> {{from the}} National Library in Prague Abstract The {{purpose of this}} {{dissertation}} is to present the first comprehensive catalogue <b>of</b> Franco-Flemish <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> from the collections of the National Library in Prague (hereafter, NK). Some of the included manuscripts were already published in journals {{some of them have}} never been published previously. The core of the catalogue is a formal and stylistic analysis <b>of</b> <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> including an attribution to the individual masters and workshops, localization and dating based on a comparison of stylistically related manuscripts. This work is a development from previous my research done on Parisian <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> [NK Břevnov 297, NK Osek 70 and NK XXIII G 89; Master's thesis and 'rigorous work'].

30|$|Finally, {{we would}} like to emphazise that the results {{obtained}} with the study of this manuscript are intended not only to be a contribution to studies already initiated on the <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> the Library of Mafra National Palace and for future researches on this subject, but also for its application in other illuminated manuscripts—particularly the collection <b>of</b> <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> <b>of</b> the National Library of Brazil, institution which stores, since its origin, part of the Portuguese heritage, brought by the Portuguese crown to Rio de Janeiro between 1810 and 1811.|$|R
5|$|The More Library is {{the main}} library for {{students}} whilst the 'House Libraries' (the Arundell, the Bay, and the Square) contain many artefacts from the Society of Jesus and English Catholicism. The Arundell Library, presented in 1837 by Everard, 11th Baron Arundell of Wardour, is the most significant; {{it is not only}} a country-house library from Wardour Castle but also has a notable collection of 250 incunabula, medieval manuscripts and volumes of Jacobite interest, signal among which is Mary Tudor's <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours,</b> which it is believed was given by Mary, Queen of Scots to her chaplain on the scaffold. The manuscript Le Livre de Seyntz Medicines was written in 1354 by Henry, Duke of Lancaster. To these were added the archives of the English Province of the Society of Jesus, which include 16th-century manuscript verses by St Robert Southwell SJ, the letters of St Edmund Campion SJ (1540–81) and holographs of the 19th-century poet Gerard Manley Hopkins. The Arundell Library has a copy of the Chronicles of Jean Froissart, captured at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415, and held the 7th-century Stonyhurst Gospel of St John before it was loaned to the British Library, as well as a First Folio of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The saints are {{identifiable}} from Latin inscriptions {{lining the}} borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is identifiable from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously reads from a <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours.</b> He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.|$|E
5|$|There is {{relatively}} little information about native Scottish artists {{during the late}} Middle Ages. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits used for copies and reproductions, but the versions that survive are generally crude by continental standards. Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included the delicate hanging lamp in St. John's Kirk in Perth; the tabernacles and images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld, and vestments and hangings in Holyrood; Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III, the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named, and the illustrated Flemish Bening <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours,</b> given by James IV to Margaret Tudor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> {{were usually}} written in Latin (the Latin name {{for them is}} horae), {{although}} there are many entirely or partially written in vernacular European languages, especially Dutch. The English term primer is usually now reserved for those books written in English.

5|$|The {{adoption}} of Middle Scots by the aristocracy {{has been seen}} as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history {{in the service of the}} crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity, at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional versions of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late fourteenth century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the fifteenth century. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag is to be found in the Vienna <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours,</b> circa 1503.|$|E
25|$|Writers whose {{papers are}} in the library are as diverse as Charles Dickens and Beatrix Potter. Illuminated manuscripts in the library dating from the 12th to 16th centuries include: the Eadwine Psalter, Canterbury; Pocket <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours,</b> Reims; Missal from the Royal Abbey of Saint Denis, Paris; the Simon Marmion <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours,</b> Bruges; 1524 Charter {{illuminated}} by Lucas Horenbout, London; the Armagnac manuscript of the trial and rehabilitation of Joan of Arc, Rouen. also the Victorian period is represented by William Morris.|$|E
25|$|The Petites Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry is an {{illuminated}} <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> {{commissioned by}} John, Duke of Berry between 1375 and 1385–90. It {{is known for}} its ornate miniature leaves and border decorations.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the most}} heavily {{illuminated}} <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> were enormously expensive, a small book {{with little or no}} illumination was affordable much more widely, and increasingly so during the 15th century. The earliest surviving English example was apparently written for a laywoman living in or near Oxford in about 1240. It is smaller than a modern paperback but heavily illuminated with major initials, but no full-page miniatures. By the 15th century, there are also examples of servants owning their own <b>Books</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours.</b> In a court case from 1500, a pauper woman is accused of stealing a domestic servant's prayerbook.|$|R

25|$|Bona {{commissioned}} the <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> around 1490, fourteen {{years after the}} assassination of her husband Galeazzo Sforza. Completion of the book was probably abandoned in 1494 when Bona found herself excluded from power by her brother-in-law, Ludovico Sforza, {{following the death of}} her son Gian Galeazzo. She returned to her native Savoy in 1495 as a guest of her nephew Philibert of Savoy. Bona died in 1503 and Philibert also died the following year, whereupon the book became the property of his widow, Margaret of Austria.|$|E
25|$|Important non-Biblical {{writings}} include: Nagara Muse (The Conversation of Moses), Mota Aaron (Death of Aharon), Mota Muse (Death of Moses), Te'ezaza Sanbat (Precepts of Sabbath), Arde'et (Students), Gorgorios, Mäṣḥafä Sa'atat (<b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours),</b> Abba Elias (Father Elija), Mäṣḥafä Mäla'əkt (Book of Angels), Mäṣḥafä Kahan (Book of Priest), Dərsanä Abrəham Wäsara Bägabs (Homily on Abraham and Sarah in Egypt), Gadla Sosna (The Acts of Susanna) and Baqadāmi Gabra Egzi'abḥēr (In the Beginning God Created).

25|$|The Llanbeblig <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> (NLW MS 17520A) {{is a small}} {{manuscript}} book compiled around 1390. The manuscript has {{a number}} of entries in the calendar that connect it to Wales, including a celebration of the dedication of the church of Saint Peblig, Caernarfon. Isabella Godynogh (d. 1413) was possibly its original owner. The full-page miniatures, illuminated with gold, and the fine lettering indicate the value of the book. The Llanbeblig Hours is the only known illuminated manuscript that contains the iconographical Lily Crucifixion motif, and may be the earliest example of its use in any media.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the most}} famous works {{formerly}} attributed to René are the triptych of the Burning Bush of Nicolas Froment of Avignon in Aix Cathedral, showing portraits of René and his second wife, Jeanne de Laval, and an illuminated <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> in the French National Library. Among the men of letters attached to his court was Antoine de la Sale, whom he made tutor to his son John. He encouraged the performance of mystery plays; on the performance of a mystery of the Passion at Saumur in 1462 he remitted four years of taxes to the town, and the representations of the Passion at Angers were carried out under his auspices.|$|E
25|$|The core text of a <b>Book</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hours</b> is the Little Office of the Virgin, {{illustrated}} by {{scenes from the}} Life of the Virgin. This series of hourly prayers were prayed to the Mother of God, who co-mediates and sanctifies the prayers to God. The Penitential Psalms were recited to help one resist temptation of committing any of the Seven Deadly Sins. The prayers in the Office of the Dead were prayed to shorten the time a loved one spent in Purgatory. Supplementary texts were added to celebrate any personal patron, family saint, special circumstances, or a fortuitous event. This standard pattern of daily prayer provided the framework for the artists' efforts.|$|E
50|$|The term Black <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> {{refers to}} a type of Flemish {{illuminated}} manuscript lettered on vellum soaked on black dye or ink before they were lettered or illustrated, usually with gold or silver leaf, to an unusual and dramatic effect.

40|$|Printed <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> {{the best-seller}} <b>of</b> the late medieval trade in <b>books,</b> provide {{evidence}} <b>of</b> an information revolution {{equal to that}} occasioned by the Internet today. The Grey Collection of the National Library in Cape Town possesses eight <b>books</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> printed between 1498 and 1530, and they are almost completely unknown. Yet these valuable incunabula, all of them printed on vellum with hand-painted initials, {{and some of them}} with hand-painted miniatures, are of importance to anybody interested in <b>books,</b> the history <b>of</b> the <b>book,</b> the dissemination <b>of</b> information, the art of the late 15 th to the early 16 th centuries and early printing.

The books are therefore eminently suitable as subjects for transdisciplinary research through which the subjects of history, sociology, art and religion can be drawn together. Two <b>of</b> these <b>books,</b> printed by Thielman Kerver in Paris, are discussed in detail in this article. The books are especially remarkable for their many illustrations that include pictures around the borders of each page as well as full-page illustrations. The pictures are neither metal cuts nor woodcuts, as were usual in that period, but relief prints. The {{most important part of the}} texts is a sequence of prayers to the Virgin Mary.
