30|$|Finally, {{we noticed}} {{small changes in}} the <b>blood</b> <b>chemistries</b> in the non-septic control groups {{over the course of}} the experiment, {{particularly}} in creatine kinase which was probably related to some rhabdomyolysis because we positioned the animals in the supine position and did not turn the animal over the 10 -h course of the study (see Additional file 3 : Table S 2, Additional file 4 : Table S 3, Additional file 5 : Table S 4, Additional file 6 : Table S 5 and Additional file 7 : Table S 6).

25|$|Indications for {{intubation}} include airway obstruction, {{inability to}} protect the airway, and respiratory failure. Examples of these indications include penetrating neck trauma, expanding neck hematoma, and being unconscious, among other indications. In general, the method of intubation used is rapid sequence intubation followed by ventilation. Assessment of circulation in those with trauma includes control of active bleeding. When a person is first brought in, vital signs are checked, an ECG is performed, and, if needed, vascular access is obtained. Other tests should be performed to get a baseline measurement of their current <b>blood</b> <b>chemistry,</b> such as a arterial blood gas or thromboelastography. In those with cardiac arrest due to trauma chest compressions are considered futile, but still recommended. Correcting the underlying cause such as a pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade, if present, may help.|$|E
