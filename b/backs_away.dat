Ripley meets him at the furnace, where he tells her that he designed the Bishop android series; his medical team will extract the Alien Queen inside her and destroy it. Ripley does not believe him, and <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> towards the furnace as he begs her {{to give him the}} creature. Aaron sneaks up behind him and strikes him with a crowbar, nearly ripping off his ear. He watches in despair as Ripley sacrifices herself by falling into the lead smelter.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her {{to speak to a}} prostitute whom he sees across the room with a prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers.

25|$|The Babylonian Talmud relates {{that the}} {{practice}} of stepping backward after the Amidah is a reminder of the practice in the Temple in Jerusalem, when those offering the daily sacrifices would walk backward from the altar after finishing. It is also compared to a student who respectfully <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> from his teacher.|$|E
25|$|Like other pseudostigmatid damselflies, Megaloprepus {{feeds on}} web-building spiders. It forages {{in areas that}} receive direct sun, such as the gaps created by fallen trees or branches; the light helps it avoid {{becoming}} entangled. When it finds a web, it hovers {{in front of it}} until it locates the spider. Then it flies backward and quickly darts forward again to grab the spider in its forelegs. Finally it <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> and perches to consume the spider, removing the legs before eating the body.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{decision}} {{as to whether or not}} the mate is good can be made with the emotional boundary of the shadchan who, if so desired by the couple, can call and talk to either side in the beginning stages of the dating to iron out issues that can crop up during the dating process. Usually as the couple see more of each other the shadchan <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> and lets the couple manage it themselves. It's expected that the couple keep the shadchan up-to-date on how the shidduch is going at regular intervals.|$|E

25|$|On September 5, 2008, Todd and Marty share {{a passionate}} kiss as Todd helps her walk. He initiates the {{intimate}} contact, and viewers, {{as well as}} critics, argued that, given his sexual intimacy issues, {{it was out of}} character for him to be as sexually bold towards Marty; Marty being his rape victim had been the main source of his sexual hangups. On September 23, 2008, the show went further with intimacy between the two and had them almost engage in sex. Todd eventually <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> from the contact, presumably due to his conscience.|$|E
25|$|Stewart nervously {{returns the}} video to Charlotte, paying her compliments, and Charlotte lends him another video. After Imogen leaves that evening, Stewart watches the video, but fast {{forwards}} through the faith programme. Like the last video, it then goes {{straight into the}} middle of a porn movie – only this time, Stewart finally realises that it is Charlotte in the video. However, Imogen (having this time lost her nerve completely and left a cafe abruptly) returns early and catching him watching the video, much to her disgust. The following day, Stewart returns the video to Charlotte, again dropping compliments, he tries to kiss her, but Charlotte <b>backs</b> <b>away,</b> so Stewart leaves in guilt.|$|E
25|$|Aggressive sex is an {{activity}} that most cephalopods engage in; a protein in the male capsule sheath stimulates this behavior. Male- male aggression is seen in cephalopods; smaller males tend to lose these interactions. When a female is near the males charge on another continuously and begin to flair their arms. If neither male <b>backs</b> <b>away,</b> the arms extend to the back exposing the mouth {{which leads to the}} biting of arm tips. During mate competition males also participate in a technique called flushing. This technique is used by the second male attempting to mate with a female. Flushing removes spermatophores in the buccal cavity that was placed there by the first mate by forcing water into the cavity. Another behavior that males engage in is sneaker mating or mimicry- smaller males adjust their behavior to that of a female in order to reduce aggression. By using this technique, they are able to fertilize the eggs while the larger male is distracted by different male. During this process, the sneaker males quickly insert drop like sperm into the seminal receptacle.|$|E

25|$|Fred {{comes down}} with an illness and is cured by Mr. Lydgate, the newest doctor in Middlemarch. Rosamond, who is well-educated and seeks {{to make a good}} match, decides to marry Lydgate and uses Fred's {{sickness}} as an opportunity to get close to the doctor. Though he initially views their relationship as pure flirtation, Lydgate <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, after seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution to abandon his relationship with Rosamond and the two become engaged. At roughly the same time, Casaubon, returned from Rome, suffers a heart attack. Lydgate is brought in to deal with him and informs Dorothea that, in all likelihood, Casaubon only has around fifteen years left if he takes it easy and ceases his studies. Meanwhile, as Fred recovers, Mr. Featherstone becomes ill. On his deathbed, he reveals that he has two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be mixed up in the business of his will, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with the two wills still intact.|$|E
500|$|W. L. George {{described}} the fictional Baron as a [...] "comic giant" [...] of literature, describing his boasts as [...] "splendid, purposeless lie {{born of the}} joy of life". Théophile Gautier fils highlighted that the Baron's adventures are endowed with an [...] "absurd logic pushed to the extreme and which <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> from nothing". According to an interview, Jules Verne relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels. Thomas Seccombe commented that [...] "Munchausen has undoubtedly achieved ... The Baron's notoriety is universal, his character proverbial, and his name as familiar as that of Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, or Robinson Crusoe." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Hed PE {{signed with}} Suburban Noize Records, {{recording}} their fifth studio album, Back 2 Base X. The album {{was intended as}} a return to the basics of rock music, and did not rely as heavily on studio enhancement as previous releases. The album was released on June 6, 2006, the same day as The Best of (həd) Planet Earth, a compilation album produced by Jive Records without the band's authorization or consent. Back 2 Base X peaked at No.12 on the Independent Albums chart, and at No.154 on the Billboard 200. Allmusic's Rob Theakston wrote that [...] "Back 2 Base X suffers from the same problems as Amerika: it tries to be conceptual in thought à la Tool and vicious in its political commentary à la Fugazi or System of a Down, but somehow falls short by sounding like an angry stoner on a soapbox. It won't win any new fans, but existing fans of (hed) pe's work won't be turning their <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> from the band in anger anytime soon, either." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Sragow of Baltimore Sun {{described}} the only [...] "perfect aspect" [...] of Jennifer's Body as being its title. [...] "No {{one is going}} to like this movie for its brain", he said. Claudia Puig of USA Today stated of the film, [...] "Jennifer's Body is not as hot as you hope it would be". Where others praised the film's dialogue, MSNBC's Alonso Duralde called the writing lazy and [...] "orse still, all of Cody's trademark pop-culture–infused dialogue stands out as artificial and precious". Jennifer's Body, he said, wants [...] "so badly" [...] to be a Heathers-esque dark comedy, [...] "but its shortcomings makes you appreciate why that earlier film was so great". Ty Burr of The Boston Globe also said the film wants to be like Heathers, and reminded him [...] "a lot" [...] of Heathers but the only scene in the film that [...] "actually feels dangerous" [...] is when the possessed Jennifer initiates a long and passionate kiss with Needy, which the film [...] "very, very nervously <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> from" [...] and that [...] "Jennifer's Body falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre".|$|E
500|$|Fionna and Cake {{are helping}} Prince Gumball {{decorate}} for the Biennial Gumball Ball when Gumball asks Fionna {{if she would}} like to go to it tonight with him.

She becomes flustered and <b>backs</b> <b>away</b> when he begins to take his shirt off. A drop of water lands on her shoulder, she looks up to see the real Prince Gumball trapped inside a giant icicle on the ceiling. The fake prince is revealed to be Ice Queen. Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue.|$|E
