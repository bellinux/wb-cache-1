40|$|How does {{domestic}} regime type affect <b>bilateral</b> <b>cooperation,</b> {{and one of}} {{its most}} visible manifestations, bilateral treaties? This article explains how domestic political regime affects <b>bilateral</b> <b>cooperation</b> and, contrary to the expectations of some scholars, why autocracies should be expected to be more likely than democracies to enter into bilat-eral treaties. If the preferences of a pair of states are not identical, the sets of agree-ments that each party would consent to (win-sets) need to overlap for a bilateral treaty to be acceptable. Because additional domestic constraints reduce the size of a country’s win-set, autocracies should have broader win-sets than democracies. Therefore, autocratic dyads should be more likely to formalize bilateral treaties than other pairs of states. Based on an original data set, I present empirical evidence showing that pairs of autocracies are more likely than other pairs of states to enter into agreements formalizing <b>bilateral</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R
