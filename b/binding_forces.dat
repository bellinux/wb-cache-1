Hasenöhrl's idea was that the mass of bodies included a contribution from the electromagnetic field, he imagined a body as a cavity containing light. His relationship between mass and energy, like all other pre-Einstein ones, contained incorrect numerical prefactors (see Electromagnetic mass). Eventually Planck (1907) derived the mass-energy-equivalence in general {{within the framework of}} special relativity, including the <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> within matter. He acknowledged the priority of Einstein's 1905 work on , but Planck judged his own approach as more general than Einstein's.|$|E

25|$|When {{a cluster}} of microparticles are trapped within a {{monochromatic}} laser beam, {{the organization of the}} microparticles within the optical trapping is heavily dependent on the redistributing of the optical trapping forces amongst the microparticles. This redistribution of light forces amongst the cluster of microparticles provides a new force equilibrium on the cluster as a whole. As such we can say that the cluster of microparticles are somewhat bound together by light. One of the first experimental evidence of optical binding was reported by Michael M. Burns, Jean-Marc Fournier, and Jene A. Golovchenko, though it was originally predicted by T. Thirunamachandran. One of the many recent studies on optical binding has shown that for a system of chiral nanoparticles, the magnitude of the <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> are dependent on the polarisation of the laser beam and the handedness of interacting particles themselves, with potential applications in areas such as enantiomeric separation and optical nanomanipulation.|$|E

2500|$|A {{first step}} to {{explaining}} the Michelson and Morley experiment's null result {{was found in the}} FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction hypothesis, now simply called length contraction or Lorentz contraction, first proposed by George FitzGerald (1889) and Hendrik Lorentz (1892). According to this law all objects physically contract by [...] along the line of motion (originally thought to be relative to the aether), [...] being the Lorentz factor. This hypothesis was partly motivated by Oliver Heaviside's discovery in 1888, that electrostatic fields are contracting in the line of motion. But since there was no reason at that time to assume that <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> in matter are of electric origin, length contraction of matter in motion with respect to the aether was considered an Ad hoc hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{solution}} {{was found by}} authors such as Enrico Fermi (1922), Paul Dirac (1938) Fritz Rohrlich (1960), or Julian Schwinger (1983), who {{pointed out that the}} electron's stability and the 4/3-problem are two different things. They showed that the preceding definitions of four-momentum are non-relativistic per se, and by [...] changing the definition into a relativistic form, the electromagnetic mass can simply be written as [...] and thus the 4/3 factor doesn't appear at all. So every part of the system, not only [...] "closed" [...] systems, properly transforms as a four-vector. However, <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> like the Poincaré stresses are still necessary to prevent the electron from exploding due to Coulomb repulsion.

As both bonding and anti-bonding modes are present in the visible spectra of well-known spherical plasmonic heterodimer sets, <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> reversal is commonly believed to occur for all such heterodimers. But our work suggests a very different proposal. We demonstrate that for the symmetry broken heterodimer configurations: reversal of lateral (for on-axis heterodimers) and longitudinal (for off-axis heterodimers: end-fire and nearly end-fire configurations) near field <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> follow fully distinct mechanisms; i. e. later one on relative orientation and constructive dipole-quadrupole resonance but the former one on light polarization and the induced electric resonance. Interestingly, the reversal of longitudinal near field <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> can be easily controlled just by changing the direction of light propagation or just their relative orientation. Though it is commonly believed that plasmonic forces mostly arise from the surface force and Fano resonance can be a promising way to achieve <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> reversal; our study based on Lorentz force dynamics suggests notably opposite proposals (for both instances) for the case of plasmonic spherical heterodimers.

2500|$|Many {{scientists}} now {{believed that the}} entire mass and all forms of forces were electromagnetic in nature. This idea had to be given up, however, {{in the course of}} the development of relativistic mechanics. Abraham (1904) argued (as described in the preceding section Lorentz transformation), that non-electrical <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> were necessary within Lorentz's electrons model. But Abraham also noted that different results occurred, dependent on whether the em-mass is calculated from the energy or from the momentum. To solve those problems, Poincaré in 1905 and 1906 introduced some sort of pressure of non-electrical nature, which contributes the amount [...] to the energy of the bodies, and therefore explains the 4/3-factor in the expression for the electromagnetic mass-energy relation. However, while Poincaré's expression for the energy of the electrons was correct, he erroneously stated that only the em-energy contributes to the mass of the bodies.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} of the SDS-PAGE application, the {{compound}} works by disrupting non-covalent bonds in the proteins, and so denaturing them, i.e., causing the protein molecules to lose their native conformations and shapes. By binding to the proteins with high affinity and in high concentrations, the negatively charged detergent provides all proteins with a similar net negative charge and therefore a similar charge-to-mass ratio. In this way, the difference in mobility of the polypeptide chains in the gel can be attributed solely to their size as opposed to both their size and charge. [...] It is possible to make separation based {{on the size of the}} polypeptide chain to simplify the analysis of protein molecules, this can be achieved by denaturing proteins with the detergent SDS. The association of SDS molecules with protein molecules imparts an associated negative charge to the molecular aggregate formed; this negative charge is significantly greater than the original charge of that protein. The electrostatic repulsion that is created by SDS <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> proteins into a rod-like shape, thereby eliminating differences in shape as a factor for electrophoretic separation in gels.Dodecyl sulfate molecule has two negative charges at the pH value used for electrophoresis, this will lead the net charge of coated polypeptide chains to be much more negative than uncoated chains. The charge-to-mass ratio is essentially identical for different proteins because SDS coating dominates the charge.|$|E
60|$|It {{was while}} {{the people of}} the town were {{pursuing}} their enemies that another shock of the earthquake occurred, and it was so violent that many of the pursuers paused, while others turned at once and ran back to the town. Here they found the women and children in a state of consternation, for they had more thoroughly realised the force of the shock; and the dreadful scenes that had taken place in Caraccas, when upwards of ten thousand of the inhabitants perished, were still fresh in their memory. Another shock occurred just as Don Pedro, Will Osten, and his friends galloped into the principal square of the town. Here there were hundreds of cattle which had been driven there for safety, and crowds of people hurrying to and fro. The horsemen rode towards the principal church of the town, which had been made a place of temporary retreat for the women and children. They had got within a few hundred yards of it when there came a shock so terrible that {{it seemed as if the}} <b>binding</b> <b>forces</b> of nature were being dissolved. Hollow thunderings were heard deep in the bowels of the earth, which heaved and undulated almost as if it had been in a semi-liquid state, while great rents and fissures occurred here and there. Will Osten's horse stumbled into one of these and threw him, but he leaped up unhurt. Don Pedro and the others pulled up and dismounted hastily. Before they could make up their minds which way to turn or what to do, another shock occurred; the houses on either side of them began to sway to and fro, and one not far distant fell. Just then a terrible crash was heard, and Will Osten turned round in time to see the large church in the act of falling. Women and children were rushing out of it frantically, but those within were doomed. One wild and awful shriek mingled with the roar of the tumbling edifice, and five hundred souls were instantaneously buried in a common grave.|$|E

In particular, intertwined FimA-FimA and FimH-mannose interactions lead to a 5 to 25 -fold decrease of the fimbrial unwinding for pulling rates larger than 10 μm/s and for pH values outside the range 5 to 7.

Most of the current AFM single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments were performed on cells grown in vitro (cell lines) that are quite different from the human cells in vivo. From the view of clinical practice, investigating the drug-target interactions directly on the patient cancer cells will bring more valuable knowledge that may potentially serve as an important parameter in personalized treatment. Here, we demonstrate the capability of AFM to measure the <b>binding</b> <b>force</b> between target (CD 20) and drug (rituximab, an anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody targeted drug) directly on lymphoma patient cancer cells under the assistance of ROR 1 fluorescence recognition.

First, B-cell lymphoma Raji cells (a cell line) were used for ROR 1 fluorescence labeling and subsequent measurement of CD 20 -rituximab <b>binding</b> <b>force.</b> The results showed that Raji cells expressed ROR 1, and the labeling of ROR 1 did not influence the measurement of CD 20 -rituximab <b>binding</b> <b>force.</b> Then the established experimental procedures were performed on the pathological samples prepared from the bone marrow of a follicular lymphoma patient. Cancer cells were recognized by ROR 1 fluorescence.
