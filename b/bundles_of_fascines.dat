500|$|As {{the range}} closed the Allies became easy {{targets for the}} Franco-Bavarian musket- and grape-shot; the {{confusion}} exacerbated by fizzing hand-grenades thrown down the slope by the defenders. To aid their assault, each Allied soldier carried a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> (earlier cut from the Boschberg wood), with which to bridge the ditches {{in front of the}} breastworks to speed their passage. However, the fascines were mistakenly thrown into a dry gully– formed by the recent summer rains– instead of the Bavarians' defensive trench about 45 m (50yards) farther on. Nevertheless, the Allies continued to push forward, joining battle with the Bavarians in savage hand-to-hand fighting. Behind the defences the Elector's Guards and la Colonie's men bore the brunt of the attack so that, [...] "The little parapet which separates the two forces became the scene of the bloodiest struggle that could be conceived." [...] But the assault failed to penetrate the defences, and the Allies were forced to fall back to their lines. General Johan Wijnand van Goor, a favourite of Marlborough who had led the attack, numbered among the Allied fatalities.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the fortress was {{under the control of}} the French military engineer Simon Jocquet and work began on the 8 December 1663, The Feast day of the Immaculate Conception hence the name given to the new fortress. The first phase of construction was completed on the 20 January 1664 taking just 40 days. This first phase sore the construction built around a large central courtyard with Pentagon bastions built in each corner with reinforced earthworks around the perimeter with addition <b>of</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> brushwood <b>fascine’s</b> and filled Baskets of woven wicker timbers woven around steaks in circles to form Redoubts. The fort was garrisoned by 1500 infantrymen and 200 cavalrymen.|$|R
50|$|This tank {{introduced}} the use <b>of</b> the <b>fascine,</b> a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> brushwood, bound with chains, about 10 ft long and 4.5 ft in diameter {{carried on the}} front. It was dropped into trenches to allow the tank to cross over more easily.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fascine</b> - A <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> {{wooden poles}} or rough {{brushwood}} lashed together with wires carried {{in front of}} the tank that could be released to fill a ditch or form a step. Metal pipes in the center <b>of</b> the <b>fascine</b> allowed water to flow through.|$|R

50|$|Several {{projects}} {{were based on}} the R 35 such as a number <b>of</b> <b>fascine</b> carriers: these had frames or other contraptions mounted over the hull or turret with a fascine in them that could be dropped to fill trenches.|$|R
5000|$|First World War tanks, {{namely the}} British Mark IV, started the {{practice}} <b>of</b> carrying <b>fascines</b> on the roof, {{to be deployed}} to fill trenches {{that would otherwise be}} an obstacle to the tank. These were constructed from the traditional <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> brushwood used to make fascines since Roman times. Although these were cumbersome to deploy they proved an effective gap crossing device and were used widely by the tanks of the day that weighed up to about 30 tons.|$|R

6000|$|The labors of {{the night}} were carried on with {{activity}} and address. When a relief party arrived at four o'clock in the morning, two forts were in sufficient forwardness to furnish protection against small-arms and grape-shot; and such use was made <b>of</b> the <b>fascines</b> and <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> screwed hay, that, at dawn, a formidable-looking fortress frowned along the height. Howe gazed at the mushroom fortress with astonishment, as it loomed indistinctly, but grandly, through a morning fog.

50|$|Fascine bundles {{were used}} in {{military}} defences for revetting (shoring up) trenches or ramparts, especially around artillery batteries, or filling in ditches from earlier military actions. They were also used as a visual obstruction, providing cover for sappers and engineers. Military fascine bridges were used {{on a regular basis}} by the Romans to cross obstacles. Subsequently, the use <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> by military engineers continued almost wherever armies were deployed.|$|R

50|$|A 1955 CIA paper {{detailed}} the construction method. After {{the course of}} the railway had been surveyed, corduroy road was built over swampy ground. This was covered by layers <b>of</b> <b>fascine,</b> covered in turn by sand brought in by dump trucks. A 20 cm layer of ballast was placed on this sand, and was topped by additional sand. The railroad ties were built up on top of this. The rail line was very curvy because of the emphasis on avoiding swamps.|$|R

60|$|The Turks vied {{with the}} British in activity, making {{frequent}} night {{attacks on the}} trenches, and generally succeeding in carrying off a number <b>of</b> <b>fascines,</b> which were greatly needed, and were of special utility {{in the construction of}} the ravelin. The day after the repulse of the fourth attack the garrison suffered a heavy loss in the death of Colonel Phelypeaux, who died of fever brought on by want of rest and exposure to the sun. On the same day another, and almost as serious a loss, was sustained, for Captain Wilmot was killed by a musket shot while in the act of mounting a gun in the breach.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} the 20th that a fresh attempt to carry the place by storm was made. At this time Marlborough's {{position}} was becoming critical. The fortress held out bravely. The consumption of ammunition was so enormous, that his supplies were almost exhausted, and a great army lay directly upon his line of communication. It became a matter of necessity that the place should be taken. Immense efforts were made to secure the success of the assault. Enormous quantities <b>of</b> <b>fascines</b> were made for filling up the ditch, and 5000 British troops were sent by Marlborough from his army to lead the assault.|$|R

Port of Spain or as it was known to the Spanish, Puerto de los Hispanioles, initially was restricted to a few streets east of the St. Ann's or Tragarete River which at that time ran west along what is now Park Street and south to the foreshore through what is now Woodford Square and Chacon Street.|$|R
