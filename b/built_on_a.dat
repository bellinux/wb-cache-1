Further production of the M13 and M14 was ceased in favor of production of the M16 and M17 (an M16 <b>built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> M5 Half-track chassis).|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being <b>built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flat surface, Borobudur is <b>built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E

5|$|Creeks {{traverse}} the UCSC campus within several ravines. Footbridges span those ravines on pedestrian paths linking various areas of campus. The footbridges {{make it possible}} to walk to any part of campus within 20 minutes in spite of the campus being <b>built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mountainside with varying elevations. At night, orange lights illuminate the occasionally fogged-in paths.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the bridge}} is <b>built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> gravel bed covered by {{shifting}} sand. The north end by the swing bridge section is next to the rock of Figle Fawr {{at the base of}} the Rhinogydd Range of mountains and the river channel here can flow up to 9 knots (16.7km/h). The first two spans here are built directly onto the rock.|$|E

The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} was <b>built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of}} the Des Prairies River. This windmill was like no other in New France (although a similar fortified windmill was later built in Quebec), with thick walls, square loopholes for muskets, with machicolation at the top for pouring lethally hot liquids and rocks onto attackers.|$|E

5|$|<b>Built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> site long {{favored by}} pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and {{a haven for}} loggers, boatmen, and other {{travelers}} on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of unemployment in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Street Station was <b>built</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{site where}} the Hanseatic merchants' {{steelyard}} was based from the 10th century until 1598.

The SER had already made plans to extend their line towards , but decided that they should complement this with a terminus in the City.|$|E
