40|$|AbstractAn {{enhanced}} sampling method—biased Brownian dynamics—is {{developed for}} the calculation of diffusion-limited biomolecular association reaction rates with high energy or entropy barriers. Biased Brownian dynamics introduces a <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> {{in addition to the}} electrostatic force between the reactants, and it associates a probability weight with each trajectory. A simulation loses weight when movement is along the <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> and gains weight when movement is against the <b>biasing</b> <b>force.</b> The sampling of trajectories is then biased, but the sampling is unbiased when the trajectory outcomes are multiplied by their weights. With a suitable choice of the <b>biasing</b> <b>force,</b> more reacted trajectories are sampled. As a consequence, the variance of the estimate is reduced. In our test case, biased Brownian dynamics gives a sevenfold improvement in central processing unit (CPU) time with the choice of a simple centripetal <b>biasing</b> <b>force...</b>|$|E

This task is {{characterized}} by two sources of force: that from the nozzle contacting the car and that from the hose attached to the pump.

The research presented in this dissertation develops technology for robots to mate connectors that concurrently experience appreciable forces from encumbrances, like those from hoses, cables and oscillating masses, in addition to forces from contact.

40|$|Calculating {{transition}} {{rates and}} other kinetic quantities from molecular simulations requires knowledge {{not only of}} the free energy along the relevant coordinate but also the diffusivity as a function of that coordinate. A variety of methods are currently used to map the free-energy landscape in molecular simulations; however, simultaneous calculation of position-dependent diffusivity is complicated by biasing forces applied with many of these methods. Here, we describe a method to calculate position-dependent diffusivities in simulations including known time-dependent biasing forces, which relies on a previously proposed Bayesian inference scheme. We first apply the method to an explicitly diffusive model, and then to an equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation of liquid water including a position-dependent thermostat, comparing the results to those of an established method. Finally, we test the method on a system of liquid water, where oscillations of the free energy along the coordinate of interest preclude sufficient sampling in an equilibrium simulation. The adaptive <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> method permits roughly uniform sampling along this coordinate, while the method presented here gives a consistent result for the position-dependent diffusivity, even in a short simulation where the adaptive <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> is only partially converged...|$|E
40|$|We {{make use}} of the {{formulation}} developed by Lovalenti and Brady 1 for the hydrodynamic force acting upon a spherical particle undergoing arbitrary time dependent motion in an arbitrary time dependent uniform flow field at low Reynolds numbers, to derive an expression for the effects of a constant <b>bias</b> <b>force</b> acting on a periodically forced rigid spherical particle in a Newtonian fluid. We use Newton's second law to relate the total force acting on the particle to the motion of the particle. The total force is given by: Totalforce=F ext+ FH, where, F ext is the external force inclusive of both the periodic force and the constant <b>bias</b> <b>force.</b> F H is the hydrodynamic force derived by Lovalenti and Brady 1 including both unsteady and convective inertia. The equation derived contains a nonlinear history term and is nonlinear. This equation is solved numerically using an adaptive step size Runge - Kutta scheme. We obtain several phase plots (plots between particle displacement and particle velocity), which show the effects of low Reynolds numbers, the periodic force and the effects of the constant <b>bias</b> <b>force</b> on the particle motion. It is observed that at low magnitudes of the periodic forcing the external constant force dominates and the particle moves along the direction of the external constant force. As we increase the magnitude of the periodic forcing, the periodic force is seen to dominate and the particle is seen to oscillate along a mean position with a slight drift along the direction of the periodic force and the external constant force, when they are imposed in the same direction. However the motion of the particle becomes more complicated when the directions of the periodic forcing and external constant force are opposite to each other. We also observe a reflection in phase space when the directions of both the forces are reversed. The phase plots typically are of a half sinusoidal, sinusoidal and a coiled (solenoidal) pattern. These plots include the effects of both periodic force and the constant <b>bias</b> <b>force.</b> As the Reynolds numbers increases the drift of the particle reduces, which indicates the effects of inertia.

40|$|A {{reaction}} probability {{is required}} to calculate the rate constant of a diffusion-dominated reaction. Due to the complicated geometry and potentially high dimension of the reaction probability problem, it is usually solved by a Brownian dynamics simulation, {{also known as a}} random walk or path integral method, instead of solving the equivalent partial differential equation by a discretization method. Building on earlier work, this article completes the development of a robust importance sampling algorithm for Brownian dynamics—i. e., biased Brownian dynamics with weight control—to overcome the high energy and entropy barriers in biomolecular association reactions. The biased Brownian dynamics steers sampling by a <b>bias</b> <b>force,</b> and the weight control algorithm controls sampling by a target weight. This algorithm is optimal if the <b>bias</b> <b>force</b> and the target weight are constructed from the solution of the reaction probability problem. In reality, an approximate reaction probability has to be used to construct the <b>bias</b> <b>force</b> and the target weight. Thus, the performance of the algorithm depends {{on the quality of the}} approximation. Given here is a method to calculate a good approximation, which is based on the selection of a reaction coordinate and the variational formulation of the reaction probability problem. The numerically approximated reaction probability is shown by computer experiments to give a factor-of-two speedup over the use of a purely heuristic approximation. Also, the fully developed method is compared to unbiased Brownian dynamics. The tests for human superoxide dismutase, Escherichia coli superoxide dismutase, and antisweetener antibody NC 6. 8, show speedups of 17, 35, and 39, respectively.

40|$|For systems out of {{equilibrium}} {{and subjected}} to a static <b>bias</b> <b>force</b> it can often be expected that particle transport will usually follow the direction of this bias. However, counter-examples exist where particles exhibit uphill motion (known as absolute negative mobility - ANM), {{particularly in the case}} of coupled particles. Examples in single particle deterministic systems are less common. Recently, in one such example, uphill motion was shown to occur for an inertial driven and damped particle in a spatially symmetric periodic potential. The source of this anomalous transport was a combination of two periodic driving signals which together are asymmetric under time reversal. In this paper we investigate the phenomena of ANM for a deterministic particle evolving in a periodic and symmetric potential subjected to an external unbiased periodic driving and nonuniform space- dependent damping. It will be shown that this system exhibits a complicated response behaviour as certain control parameters are varied, most notably being, enhanced parameter regimes exhibiting ANM as the static <b>bias</b> <b>force</b> is increased.

40|$|Problem statement: Resonance-type microscopies {{have been}} widely used to {{evaluate}} the nanoscaled or microscaled surface elastic properties of materials by the resonance-frequency shifts of an oscillator, which contacts the surface of materials by a spherical tip. Approach: The tip-specimen contact is modeled to be a spring support, whose stiffness is given by the traditional Hertzian contact theory. However, because of the influence of the oscillator vibration and the anisotropy in nanoscaled or microscaled region of materials, the predicted results from the traditional Hertzian contact theory can not coincide with the experimental observations. In order to explain this discrepancy, dynamic contact stiffness at the contact interface between a rigid sphere and a semi-infinite cubic solid is investigated. Results: An oscillating force being superposed on a <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> excites the oscillation of the sphere contacting with the solid surface, which causes the contact radius to vary with the oscillation. The assumption of sufficiently small oscillating force compared with the <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> yields an oscillating-contact-pressure distribution of the constant contact radius and then dynamic contact stiffness. Because the oscillating-contact-pressure distribution cannot promise the uniform contact deformation, the influence of contact-displacement conditions is discussed.

An atomic wave packet in a tilted lattice undergoes Bloch oscillations; in a high-finesse optical cavity the backaction of the atoms on the light leads to a time-dependent modulation of the intracavity lattice depth at the Bloch frequency which can in turn transport the atoms up or down the lattice. In the optomechanical picture, the transport dynamics can be interpreted as a manifestation of dynamical backaction-induced sideband damping/amplification of the Bloch oscillator. Depending on the sign of the pump-cavity detuning, atoms are transported either with or against the <b>bias</b> <b>force</b> accompanied by an up- or down-conversion of the frequency of the pump laser light.

40|$|As a {{promising}} {{target for the}} treatment of lung cancer, the MutT Homolog 1 (MTH 1) protein can be inhibited by crizotinib. A recent work shows that the inhibitory potency of (S) -crizotinib against MTH 1 is about 20 times over that of (R) -crizotinib. But the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations were used to elucidate the mechanism about the effect of chirality of crizotinib on the inhibitory activity against MTH 1. The binding free energy of (S) -crizotinib predicted by the Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) and Adaptive <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> (ABF) methodologies is much lower than that of (R) -crizotinib, which is consistent with the experimental data. The analysis of the individual energy terms suggests that the van der Waals interactions are important for distinguishing the binding of (S) -crizotinib and (R) -crizotinib. The binding free energy decomposition analysis illustrated that residues Tyr 7, Phe 27, Phe 72 and Trp 117 were important for the selective binding of (S) -crizotinib to MTH 1. The adaptive <b>biasing</b> <b>force</b> (ABF) method was further employed to elucidate the unbinding process of (S) -crizotinib and (R) -crizotinib from the binding pocket of MTH 1.
