5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> and often removed.|$|E
25|$|Education of patients, families, and {{caregivers}} {{is an important}} component of the appropriate treatment of PBA. Crying associated with PBA may be incorrectly interpreted as depression; laughter may <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> It is therefore critical for families {{and caregivers}} to recognize the pathological nature of PBA and the reassurance that this is an involuntary syndrome that is manageable.|$|E
25|$|In Western societies, {{after the}} spread of Christianity, public {{exposure}} of a woman's bare skin between the ankle and waist started to be disapproved of culturally. Upper body exposure due {{to the use of}} the popular vest bodices used in Western Europe from the 15th century to early 20th century, as the widespread dirndls used even in more traditionally conservative mountain areas and the more or less loose shirts under these, enabled a permissive view of the shoulders, décolletage and arms allowing a free exposure of upper body hair in women of all classes with less rejection or discrimination than body hair on the sex organs, obviously to conceal by implication. Many people came to consider public exposure of pubic hair to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> It may be regarded as immodest and sometimes as obscene. However, it never came to have a full hold in Western culture in wide tracts of Central Europe, until the encroaching of Protestantism during the 16th century on formerly more tolerant customs.|$|E

25|$|Elena {{approaches}} Towers' {{security advisor}} Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), claiming knowledge of an impending attack, {{the details of}} which she will only divulge to Harry Pearce. However, he is scheduled for immediate deportation to the United States. Ruth relays this information to her former team mates at Section D. Section chief Erin Watts (Lara Pulver), case officer Dimitri Levendis (Max Brown) and analyst Calum Reed (Geoffrey Streatfeild) decide to illegally break Harry out of CIA custody and escape to an abandoned Ministry of Defence bunker, where they meet with Ruth, Elena and Sasha. Harry interrogates Elena, who admits {{she does not know}} the details, but it has been planned by her handlers, Russian politicians who view their government is becoming too weak, and that a partnership with the UK would <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing.</b> However Elena does recall a telephone number, leading Dimitri and Erin to an address. There they find a picture of a man in a jammed paper shredder. Elena recognises the man as Pavel Zykov (Andrew Byron), a Russian ultranationalist.|$|E
500|$|British and European psychiatrists {{assessing}} the documents on psychiatric abuse released by Bukovsky characterized him in 1971: [...] "The {{information we have}} about [...] suggests {{that he is the}} sort of person who might <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to authorities in any country because he seems unwilling to compromise for convenience and personal comfort, and believes in saying what he thinks in situations which he clearly knows could endanger him. But such people often have much to contribute, and deserve considerable respect." ...|$|E

Bray decided to cash-in the publicity for the release, although he knew that Madonna would never approve of the album. He said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release, and added [...] "There's nothing in these tapes that would <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> and just hoping that she would like it as much as we do." [...] In the European countries, the album was re-titled as In the Beginning, featuring different artwork, and a re-arranged track list.|$|E

500|$|The first reviews Rand {{received}} {{were for}} Night of January 16th. Reviews {{of the production}} were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> because of significant changes made to her script by the producer. Rand believed that her first novel, We the Living, was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says [...] "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work. Her 1938 novella Anthem received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.|$|E
500|$|City of Death {{is one of}} five Doctor Who serials {{from the}} series' {{original}} run (1963–1989) not to have been novelised by Target Books; the others are The Pirate Planet, Shada, Resurrection of the Daleks, and Revelation of the Daleks. Target approached Douglas Adams {{on a number of occasions}} with a view to commissioning a novelisation, offering their standard advance of £600; Adams replied saying, [...] "I don't want to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> but I do have a tendency to be a best-selling author". Target, concerned that their regular authors would seek better terms, refused to change their offer. Several years later, Target editor Nigel Robinson offered an advance of £4,000– double what was the standard advance at the time– but Adams again declined. Adams was unwilling to allow another author to write the novelisation. However, after Adams' death his estate allowed Gareth Roberts to write an adaptation of the unfinished serial Shada, which was published by BBC Books in 2012. In 2013, Roberts announced that he was working on a novelisation of City of Death, to be published on 21 May 2015. Roberts later announced that James Goss was working on the book instead.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{published}} {{two separate}} reviews for the episode. Sam Wollaston started by saying [...] "they never listen", noting the [...] "prisoner either disappears or is killed" [...] and that Section D [...] "need {{to rethink the}} whole prisoner thing, or hire less rubbish guards"; however, Wollaston also noted that since it was Sarah who was killed, [...] "mo one's really going to miss snaky Sarah much". Plot-wise, Wollaston liked the phrase [...] "getting pretty Finding Nemo about it", and said that Ros [...] "better had" [...] survived the cliffhanger, claiming [...] "Spooks without Ros would be like Christmas without presents". Vicky Frost called the episode a [...] "cracking finale", stating that after [...] "weeks of build-up, it feels almost a relief to have the Nightingale plot finally revealed". In regards to the cliffhanger, Frost commented that Spooks has [...] "passed its peak but not sunk so low as to <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing,</b> it still goes out on something of a high, and it's remembered as a decent example of its type". She was also receptive of Norris' portrayal as Ros in her likely final appearance, but felt the Harry and Ruth relationship was [...] "wolly".|$|E

2500|$|The second Quest was {{launched}} in 1953, and along with it the criterion of embarrassment was introduced. This criterion states that a group is unlikely to invent a story that would <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> to themselves. The criterion of [...] "historical plausibility" [...] was introduced in 1997, {{after the start of}} the third Quest in 1988. This principle analyzes the plausibility of an event in two separate components: contextual plausibility and consequential plausibility, i.e., the historical context needs to be suitable, as well as the consequences.|$|E
2500|$|Although their sensational nature {{made the}} revelations fodder for tabloid and {{television}} programs specializing in such stories, the files were also newsworthy because {{of questions about}} whether Ryan had accurately described the documents to GOP party leaders. [...] Prior to release of the documents, Ryan had told leading Republicans that {{five percent of the}} divorce file could cause problems for his campaign. But after the documents were released, GOP officials including state GOP Chair Judy Baar Topinka said they felt Ryan had misleadingly indicated the divorce records would not <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing.</b>|$|E

If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> for them, and I understand that.

Their chosen method of being helpful was to attend meetings at one another's homes and discuss the problems of the hungry hordes after dinner. I am not trying to be amusing; it's what they really did. A Party member was usually invited to lead the discussions. I was apolitical. To some, that meant that I was either stupid or [...] "inner-directed"—which meant according to them that I didn't care about my fellow man. What I really didn't care about was the four or five of her friends who later became known as the Hollywood Ten.|$|E
2500|$|Erections {{during sleep}} or when waking up are {{medically}} known as nocturnal penile tumescence and colloquially {{referred to as}} morning wood. The penis can regularly get erect during sleep and men or boys often wake up with an erection. Once a boy reaches his teenage years, erections occur much more frequently due to puberty. Erections can occur spontaneously {{at any time of}} day, and if clothed may cause a bulge or [...] "hump". This can be disguised or hidden by wearing close-fitting underwear, a long shirt and baggier clothes. Erections are common for male children and infants, and can even occur before birth. Spontaneous erections are also known as involuntary or unwanted erections and are normal. Such erections can <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> if they happen in public, such as a classroom or living room.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, Jessica Thomson {{requested}} that police not keep a permanent record {{of her name}} or release her details to third parties, as it would <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> and harmful to her reputation {{to be linked to}} such a case. The police agreed – a decision that hampered later investigations. In news media, books and other discussions of the case, Thomson was frequently referred to by various pseudonyms, including the nickname [...] "Jestyn" [...] and names such as [...] "Teresa Johnson née Powell". Gerry Feltus (2010) claimed he was given permission by Thomson's family to disclose her names and that of her husband, Prosper Thomson. Nevertheless, the names Feltus used in his book were pseudonyms. Feltus also stated that her family did not know of her connection with the case, and he agreed not to disclose her identity or anything that might reveal it. Her real name was considered important as the possibility exists that it may be the decryption key for the purported code.|$|E

2500|$|Physical {{symptoms}} {{often include}} excessive blushing, excess sweating, trembling, palpitations, and nausea. Stammering may be present, along with rapid speech. Panic attacks can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Some sufferers may use alcohol or other drugs to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It {{is common for}} sufferers of social phobia to self-medicate in this fashion, {{especially if they are}} undiagnosed, untreated, or both; this can lead to alcoholism, eating disorders or other kinds of substance abuse. SAD is sometimes referred to as an illness of lost opportunities where [...] "individuals make major life choices to accommodate their illness". According to ICD-10 guidelines, the main diagnostic criteria of social phobia are fear of being the focus of attention, or fear of behaving {{in a way that will}} <b>be</b> <b>embarrassing</b> or humiliating, avoidance and anxiety symptoms. Standardized rating scales can be used to screen for social anxiety disorder and measure the severity of anxiety.|$|E
