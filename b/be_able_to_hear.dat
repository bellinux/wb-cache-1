Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal. Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention.|$|E
5|$|Gaudron, and jointly Gleeson, Gummow and Hayne, {{decided that}} the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 validly conferred the {{jurisdiction}} to determine disputed elections on the High Court, in its capacity as the Court of Disputed Returns. They said that if Hill's argument about {{the structure of the}} Act were correct, there would be the odd result that the court could hear disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Act itself (which imposes certain requirements for candidates), but it would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> disputes about a candidate's eligibility under the Constitution. They also said that if only a house of Parliament could dispute a candidate's constitutional eligibility, then in the time it took for that house to determine the issue, an ineligible candidate would be able to participate in the business of that house, including passing laws and other activities.|$|E
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> casual speech over distance of 6 meters {{to be cleared}} for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive {{when it comes to}} the license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists obligatory health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets obligatory escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E

There is also a general danger that music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to dangerous situations.|$|E
25|$|Their slow-moving, curious nature, {{coupled with}} dense coastal development, {{has led to}} many violent {{collisions}} with propeller-driven boats and ships, leading frequently to maiming, disfigurement, and even death. As a result, {{a large proportion of}} manatees exhibit spiral cutting propeller scars on their backs, usually caused by larger vessels that do not have skegs in front of the propellers like the smaller outboard and inboard-outboard recreational boats have. They are now even identified by humans based on their scar patterns. Many manatees have been cut in two by large vessels like ships and tug boats, even in the highly populated lower St. Johns River's narrow channels. Some are concerned that the current situation is inhumane, with upwards of 50 scars and disfigurements from vessel strikes on a single manatee. Often, the lacerations lead to infections, which can prove fatal. Internal injuries stemming from being trapped between hulls and docks and impacts have also been fatal. Recent testing shows that manatees may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> speed boats and other watercraft approaching, due to the frequency the boat makes. However, a manatee may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the approaching boats when they are performing day-to-day activities or distractions. The manatee has a tested frequency range of 8 kilohertz to 32 kilohertz.|$|E

Scholar Natasha Vall suggests that the station's commitment to broadcasting comedy helped establish a regional identity.

For example, clicks can contain significant energy in frequencies greater than 110 kHz (for comparison, it is unusual for a human to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> sounds above 20 kHz), requiring that equipment have a sampling rates of at least 220kHz; MHz-capable hardware is often used.|$|E
500|$|The most {{comprehensive}} archaeological {{survey of the}} Church {{and the remains of}} the hospital are found in Douglas Simpson's book.

500|$|Iran {{announced}} that they would file suit against the United States in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for reparations if the U.S. courts begin to [...] "plunder" [...] assets from the Citibank account {{to give to the}} winning plaintiffs. However, the ICJ may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the case. The U.S. withdrew its general recognition of the ICJ's jurisdiction in response to the ICJ's ruling in Nicaragua v.

A working group has been established in the Iranian Cabinet to investigate the ruling and determine ways of reestablishing Iran's rights to the account.|$|E
500|$|A {{proposed}} {{rule was}} published for comment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in January, 2013. It would require hybrids and electric vehicles traveling {{at less than}} [...] to emit warning sounds that pedestrians must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> over background noises. The agency selected 30km/h as the limit because according to NHTSA measurements, this is {{the speed at which}} the sound levels of the hybrid and electric vehicles [...] approximated the sound levels produced by similar internal combustion vehicles. According to the NHTSA proposal, carmakers would be able to pick the sounds the vehicles make from a range of choices, and similar vehicles would have to make the same sounds. The rules were scheduled to go into effect in September 2014. The NHTSA estimates that the new warning noises would prevent 2,800 pedestrian and cyclist injuries during the life of each model year electric and hybrid vehicle.|$|E

500|$|Infants {{begin to}} {{understand}} words such as [...] "Mommy", [...] "Daddy", [...] "hands" [...] and [...] "feet" [...] when they are approximately 6 months old. Initially, these words refer to their own mother or father or hands or feet. Infants begin to produce their first words when they are approximately one year old. Infants' first words are normally used in reference to things that are of importance to them, such as objects, body parts, people, and relevant actions. Also, the first words that infants produce are mostly single-syllabic or repeated single syllables, such as [...] "no" [...] and [...] "dada". By 12 to 18 months of age, children's vocabularies often contain words such as [...] "kitty", [...] "bottle", [...] "doll", [...] "car" [...] and [...] "eye". Children's understanding of names for objects and people usually precedes their understanding of words that describe actions and relationships. [...] "One" [...] and [...] "two" [...] are the first number words that children learn {{between the ages of}} one and two. Infants must <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> and play with sounds in their environment, and to break up various phonetic units to discover words and their related meanings.|$|E
500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, but I wanted to put 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's what we used to do." ...|$|E

The act does not stipulate a specific speed for the simulated noise but requires the U.S. Department of Transportation to study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that would set requirements for an alert sound.
