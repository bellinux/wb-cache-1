5|$|To {{eliminate}} the threat these isolated frigates posed, Hood ordered a squadron under Rear-Admiral John Gell {{to investigate the}} harbour at Genoa. The squadron arrived on 5 October and discovered Modeste and two smaller warships at anchor. Later in the day, three ships of the squadron launched their ship's boats and instigated a boarding action against the anchored ships, in defiance of Genoese neutrality. The French crews resisted, but the British boarding parties successfully captured all three vessels without suffering any casualties. Six days later the detached HMS Captain also seized the abandoned Impérieuse, which had fled to La Spezia. The action had strategic consequences: the Republican faction in Genoa was strong and they successfully barred Austrian reinforcements from sailing to join the Allied garrison at the developing Siege of Toulon. The outnumbered defenders of the port were overwhelmed and driven into the sea <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> assault on 17 December.|$|E

25|$|Although the McGovern {{campaign}} {{believed that}} its candidate {{had a better}} chance of defeating Nixon because of the new Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution that lowered the national voting age to 18 from 21, the plan backfired when most of the youth vote went to Nixon. This was the first election in American history in which a Republican candidate carried every single Southern state, continuing the region’s transformation from a Democratic bastion into a Republican one as Arkansas was carried <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> presidential candidate {{for the first time in}} a century. By this time, all the Southern states, except Arkansas and Texas, had been carried <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> in either the previous election or the one in 1964 (although Republican candidates carried Texas in 1928, 1952 and 1956). As a result of this election, Massachusetts was the only state that Nixon did not carry in any of his three presidential campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Bloomberg's {{election}} {{marked the}} first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> in a presidential election since Calvin Coolidge won in 1924. Bloomberg is considered a social liberal, who is pro-choice, in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and an advocate for stricter gun control laws.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, Sumners {{spoke out}} against the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, {{introduced}} <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> congressman from Saint Louis, Missouri. Sumners said that the bill's sponsors did not have adequate statistics to prove their case (that lynching should be a federal crime), that the bill would increase racial mob violence, and that the bill ultimately impinged on states' rights. Most southern states and jurisdictions had established their determination not to prosecute anyone for lynching murders.|$|E
25|$|In {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 1964, he was defeated by Lyndon Johnson in a landslide that brought down many senior Republican Congressmen across the country. Goldwater won five states in the deep South, the strongest showing <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> presidential candidate in the South since 1872. Goldwater blamed the magnitude of his defeat on the assassination of John F. Kennedy {{a year before the}} election and on Johnson running a successful campaign.|$|E

25|$|Before {{his rise}} to power, Francisco Franco was posted to Tenerife in March 1936 <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> {{government}} wary of his influence and political leanings. However, Franco received information and in Gran Canaria agreed to collaborate {{in the military}} coup {{that would result in}} the Spanish Civil War; the Canaries fell to the Nationalists in July 1936. In the 1950s, the misery of the post-war years caused thousands of the island's inhabitants to emigrate to Cuba and other parts of Latin America.|$|E
25|$|In 1917 the warlord Zhang Xun {{restored}} Puyi to {{the throne}} from July 1 to July 12. Zhang Xun ordered his army to keep their queues to display loyalty to the emperor. During that period of time, a small bomb was dropped over the Forbidden City <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> plane, causing minor damage. This is considered the first aerial bombardment ever in East Asia. The restoration failed due to extensive opposition across China, and the decisive intervention of another warlord, Duan Qirui.|$|E
25|$|When anti-leftist generals {{rebelled against}} the Popular Front {{government}} of the Second Republic in July 1936, Goded unsuccessfully led troops in the Catalan capital Barcelona. Catalonia, being among the most industrialized regions of Spain was a stronghold of the organized left and Goded's local operations failed. He was captured by government forces on August 11 and imprisoned on the steamship Uruguay. Tried <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> military court and compelled to order his remaining troops, via radio, to surrender, he was condemned to die by firing squad. He was executed the following day at Montjuïc in Barcelona.|$|E

25|$|The Democratic Party {{holds the}} {{majority}} of public offices. As of April 2016, 69% of registered voters in the city are Democrats and 10% are Republicans. New York City has not been carried <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> in a statewide or presidential election since President Calvin Coolidge won the five boroughs in 1924. In 2012, Democrat Barack Obama became the first presidential candidate of any party to receive more than 80% of the overall vote in New York City, sweeping all five boroughs. Party platforms center on affordable housing, education, and economic development, and labor politics are of importance in the city.|$|E
25|$|Also in this election, Democrat Shirley Chisholm {{became the}} first black person to run for a major party nomination, and Patsy Mink was the first Asian {{candidate}} to run for the Democratic Party candidacy. It was also the first time that Hawaii was carried <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican.</b> Together with the House and Senate elections of 1972, it was the first electoral event in which people aged 18 to 20 could vote in every state, according to the provisions of the 26th Amendment. It was also the first election in which California had the most votes in the electoral college and it has remained the most populous state since then.|$|E
25|$|During the 1928 election, Clark {{founded the}} Democratic Warriors Club with Richardson Dilworth, {{beginning}} a long political {{partnership between the}} two. Both men became active in the reform movement to end corruption in city government, which was long controlled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> machine. Clark was an unsuccessful candidate for the Philadelphia City Council in 1933, with Dilworth serving as his campaign manager. The following year, he joined the firm of Dechert, Bok, Smith and Clark, and continued to practice law for seven years. He managed Dilworth's unsuccessful campaign for the Pennsylvania State Senate in 1934. From 1934 to 1935, he served as Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania. In this capacity, he engaged in trial work related to the closing of banks.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt {{submitted}} the Brownlow Committee's report to Congress and on January 12, 1937, sought legislative approval {{to implement the}} Committee's recommendations. The bill immediately sparked concern that it delegated far too much power to the president. Additionally, members of Congress were unhappy that the bill would further diminish the patronage system, abolish the position of Comptroller General (a position then held <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican),</b> and disrupt congressional committee oversight of and relationships with executive branch agencies. However, the bill's prospects for passage appeared relatively good. On February 5, Roosevelt {{submitted the}} Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937, to allow Associate Justices to the Supreme Court to be appointed for every sitting member {{over the age of}} 70-and-one-half years of age, up to a maximum of six.|$|E
25|$|While Hall {{was very}} {{conservative}} even by Texas Democratic standards, his conservatism {{can be attributed}} to the demographics of the 4th District. It had once been reliably Democratic, but became increasingly friendly to Republicans as Dallas' suburban growth spilled into the western portion of the district. The 4th has not supported the Democratic nominee for president since 1964. Despite this district's increasingly Republican tilt, Hall won 10 more terms as a member of the Democratic Party with an average of 60% of the vote. In 1994, for instance, he was re-elected by a 19-point margin, even as other conservative Democratic congressmen lost their seats. By the 1990s, he was the only elected Democratic official above the county level in much of the district. It was taken for granted that he would be succeeded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> once he retired.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg's {{election}} {{marked the}} first time in New York City history that two different Republicans had been elected mayor consecutively. New York City has not been won <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> in a presidential election since Calvin Coolidge won in 1924. Bloomberg is considered a social liberal, who is pro-choice, in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage and an advocate for stricter gun control laws. Despite the fact that 68 percent of New York City's registered voters are Democrats, Bloomberg decided the city should host the 2004 Republican National Convention. The Convention drew thousands of protesters, many of them local residents angry over the Iraq war and other issues. The New York Police Department arrested approximately 1,800 protesters, but according to The New York Times, more than 90 percent of the cases were later dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence.|$|E
