40|$|This paper {{describes}} how risk-based risk control allocation models work on pressure vessels and piping. We begin by discussing the economic rationale for allocating risk control in a diversified organization {{such as an}} enterprise. Considering a probability model for risk control decision making under uncertainty and risk, we propose a model involving stochastic total-loss amount constraints with respect to various tolerable default levels. Our main objective {{is to develop a}} method that would allow shaping the risk associated with risk control outcomes. The direct and indirect losses caused by the simulated disasters can be estimated using the engineering and financial analysis model. Based on this model, we can generate an exceeding probability (EP) curve and then calculate how much loss will be eliminated or transferred to other entities should funds be allocated to risk control. Optimal natural disaster risk control arrangement with probabilistic formulation is explained in this paper. Results from the proposed formulations are compared in case studies.

Results show that the analysis of scenarios to identify opportunities and challenges is one of the bases for the construction of planning in the state and that the budget is not a major locus of decision, as it merely presents the allocation of resources previously established in MAPP and its annual reviews. Dialogue is evident in the presentation of documents to civil society, although limitations between rhetoric and practice are observed in some points. It can be concluded, based on the theory, that a moderate, but important, integration exists between planning and budget in Minas Gerais...|$|E

The second model aims {{to quantify the}} thermal balance of conditioned rooms and unconditioned circulation halls – central or lateral. The third model approaches some middle-design and detailing envelope decisions. In this model, different alternatives for shading devices, walls, roofs properties and external colours were simulated.
