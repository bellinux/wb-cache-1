50|$|The {{reason that}} the <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> was used for {{only a short time}} is also the reason that it {{developed}} in the first place. At the time reed boats were being used to carry goods up and down the Nile. A mast and sail were wanted to make these journeys go more quickly through wind power. The problem was that a pole mast would have to be secured or stepped {{in the center of the}} craft, at its weakest point. This would have caused the bottom of the boat to rupture. Because reed materials were not strong enough to support a single pole, the bipod was developed to better distribute the weight. The <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> continued to be used even when builders begun using wood to construct boats. It was used both along the Nile and once actual seafaring began. When it was reed materials being used the <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> was secured through backstays. Once the builders switched over to wood the two rods were tied to the wood continued to be secured with cables. These bipod masts could easily be stored by folding one side into the other laying it across the ship with its weight evenly distributed on stands also called forked crutches. Thus, the bipod masts were convenient for travel along the Nile. The Nile is easy to travel when heading north, with the current, but when heading south, sailors must use man power and wind power against the current. For this reason the development of the <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> was very important. The <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> allowed for faster travel south. It is likely that this improved trade because Egyptians did not waste as much time traveling south. Also, the development of the mast was part of the transition into seafaring. In voyaging across the sea a mast and sail are required. So, in conclusion the <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> played a major part in ushering in overseas trade.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> is a two-legged mast used {{originally}} in Egypt {{during the}} 3rd millennium BCE. It {{can be described}} as two poles secured together at the top, forming a thin isosceles triangle. It did not appear until the Old Kingdom, third dynasty, and disappeared after the sixth dynasty when the pole mast took over during the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{historical}} significance, Zhang's original {{painting of the}} Along the River During the Qingming Festival reveals much about life in China during the 11th-12th century. Its myriad depictions of different people interacting with one another reveals the nuances of class structure and the many hardships of urban life as well. It also displays accurate depictions of technological practices found in Song China. For example, it depicts one river ship lowering its <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> before passing under the prominent bridge of the painting. It shows ships in two major types, yet {{all of which have}} slung rudders for steering; the painting depicts freighters with narrow sterns or passenger boats and smaller craft with broad sterns, sailing upriver or docked along the banks while loading and unloading goods. Large stern sweeps and bow sweeps can be seen on at least three of the river ships, worked by up to eight men each. It also shows how personal gardens had begun to take root in China—in addition to the immense walled garden on the far left of the scroll, for example, one sees several private gardens with their man-made mountains and rockery (for example, the small private garden close to the city gate, squeezed between a chemist's shop and a large building selling furniture, consisting of a small pond surrounded by trees and bamboo).|$|E
5000|$|Attaching the {{two large}} bundles {{that form the}} gunnels or [...] "sawi" [...] is the last step of the hull construction. Rope is wound around each gunnel and passed through each main bundle rope {{along the length of}} the ship. The rigging will be {{attached}} here and the gunnels help break the larger waves.The crew and volunteers constructed the rest of the vessel. Two <b>bipod</b> <b>masts</b> were positioned on either side of a bamboo cabin for Viracocha I and a smaller mast was utilized further aft for the Viracocha II. The masts were held in place by [...] "shoes" [...] roped into the bundles. Two rudder oars were lashed to a steering platform placed above and to the rear of the bamboo cabin. The ship was rigged with natural fiber sisal rope, the same rope that holds the reed bundles together. Two center boards were positioned in the slide boxes placed in the fore and aft of the ship and aided in the tacking into the wind. Several lee-boards were placed on the lee-side of the ship and were removable. Two cotton Lateen sails were hand sewed for the first journey and 5 sails were used for the second.|$|R
5000|$|After {{five years}} {{production}} of the 37ft boat, the RNLI decided to extend the water ballast self-righting principal to a larger boat suitable for slipway launching and lying afloat. In 1962 a prototype boat was built, 48-01 Earl and Countess Howe (ON 968) and in appearance it resembled an extended [...] with a long tapering superstructure running forward from an aft cockpit which was covered, but open to the stern. The boat's water ballast system used 2 tons of water compared to 1 tons in the smaller boats. Power came from two 110 bhp Gardner 6LX six cylinder diesel engines, the redesigned and uprated version of the engine fitted to the last ten 52ft [...] class boats. Displacing 29 tons and built {{at a cost of}} £40,000, [...] was the first RNLI lifeboat to be built with radar installed and went on station at [...] in February 1963. It was four years before further examples were built, by which time a major redesign of the superstructure had resulted in the Mk. II version. In this an enclosed wheelhouse was positioned amidships, accessed by sliding doors on either side at the forward end. Behind the wheelhouse was an aft cabin which could accommodate a loaded stretcher. Initially, radio aerials were rigged between the foremast and a <b>bipod</b> <b>mast</b> {{at the back of the}} aft cabin, on the roof of which the radar scanner was mounted on a pylon. Later, the masts were removed and twin pole aerials fitted to the aft cabin just behind the wheelhouse with a small tripod mast fitted to the wheelhouse roof. [...] went on station at [...] in March 1967, followed by [...] which took up duties at [...] in July 1967.|$|E
