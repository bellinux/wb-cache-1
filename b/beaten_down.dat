5|$|Following the feud, Kelly and Knox {{were moved}} into a storyline with CM Punk in September, in which Kelly was shown to have {{developed}} a liking for Punk, and Knox was shown to be increasingly protective and jealous. During the next month, Kelly continuously flirted with Punk and was shown watching his matches from the crowd, until Knox stopped her. Subsequently, Kelly's character dressed as Punk for ECW's Halloween Costume Contest, enraging Knox and leading to a match between the two, during which Kelly cheered for Punk. At December to Dismember, Kelly and Knox took on the team of Ariel and Kevin Thorn in a mixed tag team match, during which Knox refused to tag in before abandoning Kelly, leaving her to be <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by Ariel. On the following episode of ECW, Kelly defeated Ariel with a roll-up on her first ECW singles match, after which Knox came to ringside with flowers, only to throw them in Kelly's face and perform his signature swinging reverse STO on her, ending their relationship and giving her a scripted injury, removing her from the program for six weeks.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Salt sathyagraha at Dandi, Gandhi intended to lead a pack of sathyagrahis to the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, but was arrested by the police. A few days later, Congress leader Abbas Tyabji was also arrested. So the mantle fell upon Sarojini Naidu to lead the sathyagrahis at Dharasana. The sathyagrahis marched to Dharasana, where they were stopped by a deportment of the police. The non-violent sathyagrahis proceed to confront the police and were <b>beaten</b> <b>down.</b> American journalist Webb Miller, who witnessed the gruesome scene, counted around 320 bodies. Miller's reporting of the violence at the Dharasana Salt Works was later credited for helping turn world opinion against British colonial rule of India.|$|E

On one episode of Raw, the Outlaws shaved the head of Road Warrior Hawk and were <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> further by DX. On February 23, 1998, on Raw, the Legion of Doom seemed to have won the Tag Team titles back when they hit the Doomsday Device, but as Animal went for the pin, the referee was distracted by Hawk's celebration, allowing the Outlaws to take advantage and win the match. After the match, the Legion of Doom brawled with one another out of frustration and weren't seen on WWE television after that, indicating that the team was disbanded for good.|$|E
25|$|Weaving {{normally}} begins {{from the}} bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the knot count of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.|$|E

25|$|The cupola was a reverberatory furnace. The fuel {{was burned}} in a {{combustion}} chamber {{at the side}} of the furnace, separate from the “charge” of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, arched roof and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his victory}} over Konnan Cibernético began {{targeting}} {{the other members}} of La Legión, especially longtime member El Zorro and Vampiro who had recently sided with them. When El Mesias was forced out of the ring due to a shoulder injury Cibernético had to fight the odds by himself. At Triplemanía XVIII Cibernético teamed up with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) worker Abyss to fight El Zorro and Vampiro in a hardcore match. The match saw the interference of La Legión members Chessman, Christopher Daniels, Alex Koslov, Nosawa and Hernandez throughout the match. Near the end of the match Vampiro got into an argument with Konnan resulting in Konnan tossing a handful of white powder into Vampiro's face. Blinded, Vampiro became a victim of Cibernético's Garra Cibernetica for the pin fall. After the match La Legión attacked the two tecnicos again, but were fought off, then <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by Cibernético, with assist from La Hermandad 187 (Nicho el Millonario and Joe Líder).|$|E
25|$|Through {{the rest}} of the year, Brother Runt {{continued}} to feud with Abyss and several other heavyweight wrestlers while having a short-lived alliance with Raven (Raven saved Brother Runt from being smashed through two stacked tables covered in thumbtack-covered boards from Abyss, before throwing Abyss in himself), before he turned on Raven on September 15, 2006. In September and October 2006 Hyson had formed a new look, very similar to Travis Bickle in the hit 1976 movie Taxi Driver complete with Bickle's trademark green army jacket and mohawk. At No Surrender (2006), Brother Runt competed in a No Disqualification 3-Way Dance which was won by Abyss, At Bound for Glory (2006), Brother Runt competed in a fatal four way Monster's Ball match which was won by Samoa Joe. On the December 21 episode of Impact! Brother Runt made his first TNA appearance in a while dressed up as Santa Claus, and was subsequently <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by The Latin American Xchange (LAX) until being saved by Eric Young, Sonjay Dutt, Jay Lethal, and Petey Williams.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} the post-WrestleMania episode of Raw, Kane inadvertently revealed that Triple H had masterminded the attack on The Shield on the previous month's SmackDown and as a result, when Triple H faced the new WWE World Heavyweight Champion Daniel Bryan in a title match after Bryan had already been attacked by Kane, Orton and Batista, The Shield interrupted the match to turn on Triple H, chasing the other wrestlers away to protect Bryan. The Shield finally defeated The Wyatt Family in a six-man tag match on the April 8 episode of Main Event. On the April 14 episode of Raw, Triple H forced The Shield to wrestle an 11-on-3 handicap match, which ended in a no contest and left The Shield outnumbered and <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> before being further attacked by Triple H, Orton and Batista, who reformed the group Evolution. Booked to wrestle another 11-on-3 handicap match on the April 25 episode of SmackDown, The Shield attacked and took out six of their opponents throughout SmackDown and defeated the remaining five in the handicap match. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, Ambrose retained the United States Championship in a fatal four-way match against Alberto Del Rio, Curtis Axel and Ryback.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, 2010, Electroshock officially {{announced}} that he was not part of La Sociedad and urged his stablemates Silver King and Último Gladiador to leave the group. At the November 18 event in Naucalpan Electroshock once again turned down an offer to join La Sociedad and was as a result <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by Silver King, Último Gladiador and La Milicia. On November 28 the man who had attacked Octagón prior to Héroes Inmortales IV was revealed as Super Fly, when he attacked Octagón and his fellow Real Fuerza Aérea co–leader Aero Star and beat them down with help from La Milicia. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes El Zorro defeated Dr. Wagner Jr., with help from his La Sociedad stable mates, to win the AAA Mega Championship. In the main event of the evening Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly of Los Perros del Mal faced Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown), a trio, who hadn't lost a single match since their debut in December 2007, in an elimination steel cage weapons match. In the end of the match, someone wearing a Monster Clown mask climbed up the cage and prevented Murder Clown from escaping. After the man had dropped Murder Clown back into the cage, Halloween climbed out of the cage to win the match and end Los Psycho Circus long undefeated streak. Afterwards, the man who had interfered in the match was revealed as El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who had suffered a knee injury after his match with El Mesías and was supposed to be out of action {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|In September 2010, Silver King and Último Gladiador, {{two thirds}} of the stable Los Maniacos, {{announced}} they were joining La Sociedad, and although their stablemate Electroshock made no official announcement on whether or not he would be following them, he agreed to represent the group at Héroes Inmortales IV in order to get his hands on longtime rival Heavy Metal, who would represent AAA in the steel cage match between the two groups. After the event, during which Heavy Metal suffered an injury, which would sideline him for four months, Electroshock officially announced that he was not part of La Sociedad and urged Silver King and Último Gladiador to leave the group. At the November 18 event in Naucalpan he once again turned down an offer to join La Sociedad and was as a result <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by Silver King, Último Gladiador and La Milicia, turning him técnico in the process. When Heavy Metal returned from his injury on February 4, 2011, he and Electroshock entered a Best of Five series, with the loser having his hair shaved off. During the series, King and Gladiador tried to recruit Heavy Metal as the newest member of Los Maniacos and even interfered in several of the matches, but Heavy Metal made clear {{that he did not want}} to join them. The fifth match, a best two-out-of-three falls Bull Terrier match, took place on March 18 at Rey de Reyes, where Heavy Metal was victorious after a guitar shot, forcing Electroshock to have his hair shaved off. After the match both Electroshock and Heavy Metal were attacked by members of La Sociedad, bringing the former rivals together to fight a common enemy. Just two days later, Los Maniacos surprisingly lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, after which Silver King and Último Gladiador were seemingly about to break up, but were brought back together by La Legión Extranjera member Chessman, with whom they would re–form Los Maniacos under the new name La Maniarquía. La Maniaquía was booked to settle their grudge with Electroshock and Heavy Metal at Triplemanía XIX in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match, for which the técnicos recruited a veteran of hardcore wrestling, Joe Líder, whose partner, Nicho el Millonario, La Maniarquía had injured, as the third member of their team.|$|E

25|$|Cibernético was {{scheduled}} to team up Heavy Metal, La Parka and Octagón at Héroes Inmortales IV against La Sociedad, a superstable consisting of the invading Los Perros del Mal stable, La Legión Extranjera, La Milicia and Los Maniacos, but prior to the match La Sociedads leader Konnan announced that Cibernético had decided to turn his back on AAA and join his team instead. AAA bought Konnan's claim and replaced Cibernético and Octagón, who was injured in a backstage assault by someone resembling Cibernético (later revealed as Super Fly), in the match with Dark Ozz and Dark Cuervo. However, in the end Cibernético interfered in the match and helped AAA pick up the win. Afterwards, Cibernético, upset with AAA and in particular his friend La Parka for believing he had turned on the company, decided to re–form Los Bizarros with Amadeus, Escoria, Nygma and Taboo. On November 22 Los Bizarros solidified their statuses as tweeners by attacking not only La Sociedad, but also La Parka. On December 5, 2010, at Guerra de Titanes Charly Manson was revealed as {{the newest member of}} Los Bizarros, as he made a surprise jump from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) back to AAA. During Cibernético's and La Parka's heated rivalry it was implied that Cibernético had assaulted and hospitalized Parka's three-year-old son, his own godson. On March 13, 2011, La Milicia and La Sociedad member Billy el Malo, who had been secretly working for Cibernético since at least October 2010, made a jump to Los Bizarros. In May, La Parka formed his own group El Inframundo ("The Underworld") to counteract Los Bizarros. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Cibernético, Billy el Malo, Charly Manson and Escoria defeated La Parka, Dark Ozz, Drago and Octagón, when Cibernético pinned Parka following a distraction from Taboo, who appeared {{at the top of the}} ramp with his son. After the match it was revealed that Taboo was in fact Parka's brother. On October 9 at Héroes Inmortales, both Cibernético and La Parka took part in the Copa Antonio Peña gauntlet match and ended up causing each other's eliminations from the match. Later in the event, the rivalry took a surprise twist, when Parka turned rudo and joined La Sociedad. Cibernético finalized his technico turn on December 1 by feigning joining La Sociedad, before turning on them and being <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> and bloodied by Los Perros del Mal. On March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, Cibernético, Billy el Malo and Escoria defeated La Parka, Dark Dragon and Tito Santana in what was billed as the final chapter in the rivalry between Cibernético and Parka. After the match, Parka's stablemates attacked him, which led to Los Bizarros returning to the ring and chasing them away, saving Parka.|$|E

500|$|On the {{characterization}} of Catwoman, Waters explained [...] "Sam Hamm {{went back to the}} way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> secretary." [...] Harvey Dent appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, [...] "Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie." [...] In early scripts Max Shreck was the [...] "golden boy" [...] of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother. Max Shreck was also a reference to actor Max Schreck, known for his role as Count Orlok in Nosferatu.|$|E

But a stream gurgled through the gorge, and a capful of water dashed over his face brought the senses back to the injured man.

500|$|In early 2000, Crash Holly {{joined the}} {{hardcore}} division. On the February 24 episode of SmackDown!, he defeated Test {{to begin his}} first of 22 Hardcore Championship reigns. He decreed that he must defend the championship twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, which later {{became known as the}} [...] "24/7 Rule". This meant that the title was permanently contested, not just in sanctioned matches, and could change hands anywhere, anytime anyone pinned the champion, so long as a WWF referee counted the fall. Holly was frequently attacked by other wrestlers in unlikely locations, including an airport, a funhouse, a circus, and his hotel room. Though he was often pinned, he usually immediately regained the title. His most common tactic was to sneak a pin, often after the champion had been <b>beaten</b> <b>down</b> by someone else, and quickly run backstage, away from possible challengers. This turned him into a crowd favorite and earned him the nickname [...] "The Houdini of Hardcore". He frequently defended the championship against non-wrestlers, including referees and road agents, like Gerald Brisco and Pat Patterson. He had a long feud with The Mean Street Posse (Pete Gas, Rodney and Joey Abs) over the title. He even lost, and quickly regained, the title against one of the Godfather's hos.|$|E
