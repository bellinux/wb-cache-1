5000|$|Within {{the context}} of a fixed specie basis for money, one {{important}} controversy was between the quantity theory of money and the real bills doctrine (RBD). Within this context, quantity theory applies to the level of fractional reserve accounting allowed against specie, generally gold, held by a bank. Currency and banking schools of economics argue the RBD, that banks should also be able to issue currency against <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>trading,</b> which is [...] "real bills" [...] that they buy from merchants. This theory was important in the 19th century in debates between [...] "Banking" [...] and [...] "Currency" [...] schools of monetary soundness, and {{in the formation of the}} Federal Reserve. In the wake of the collapse of the international gold standard post 1913, and the move towards deficit financing of government, RBD has remained a minor topic, primarily of interest in limited contexts, such as currency boards.

40|$|The most {{well known}} and {{developed}} sea transport document is the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, a legal institution of its own with many advantages, {{but it is also}} known to be a main contributor to high costs <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> due to delayed arrival of original documents, inaccurate or insufficient information and fraudulent issuance of incorrect or forged <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading. The <b>trade</b> community’s response to the problems associated with the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading has been to develop the concept <b>of</b> the electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. This work began as early as 1970 but still has not gained commercial momentum. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate whether electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading are legally valid and if such documents can be submitted and accepted as evidence {{in a court of law}} and if there are such legal obstacles, to investigate international and/or national initiatives aimed at resolving the situation. A secondary purpose is to investigate how electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading are used today and how their functionality is perceived by the trade parties. The traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is a document of title granting right to control of the goods to its holder. It is by Swedish law not clear if an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading qualifies as such a document of title meaning that a buyer of goods that is being transported under an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading may not have the right to control of the goods. Delayed arrival <b>of</b> original <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading cause carriers to deliver goods against letters of indemnity instead <b>of</b> surrender <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, hereby exposing themselves to risk and loss of P&I cover. Paper <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading are considered secure but are still subject to fraud and forgery. Electronic alternatives are considered equally or more secure, much thanks to the use of electronic signatures. World trade is increasing, in part due to the introduction of ICT systems that minimizes manual intervention and allows for free flow of information between concerned parties. Current offerings <b>of</b> electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading are integrated in such information systems. Existing, such as the American, and proposed, such as the Rotterdam Rules, legislation that promotes the use <b>of</b> electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading applies the principle of equivalence, whereby it is the functionality, not the media, which defines the legal qualities of a transport document. The document of title functionality is achieved by applying the principle of singularity, according to which, only one party may control the transport record, which is the functional equivalence of being the holder <b>of</b> a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Such laws do not yet exist in Sweden, leaving it unclear whether holders of electronic transport records have the same right to control of the goods as do holders <b>of</b> traditional paper <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading. Key conclusions of the thesis are that legislation based on the functional equivalence principle would eradicate the legal obstacles to the use <b>of</b> electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading and that such legislative action combined with the current trend of implementing ICT systems in the shipping industry would serve to overcome the “traditional inertia” that has characterized the industry for so long, and ease the transition in to modern document management systems that will serve to eradicate the problems caused by the paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve the efficiency of the construction process through the application of electronic data interchange (EDI). This thesis describes the development and application of EDI messages. The messages described are targeted to provide a means for transferring construction specific information during the construction process. The definition of electronic data interchange and its technical issues are first described. The nature of EDI, replacing paper based communication with electronic messages, impacts on the way in which business is conducted, and also has far reaching legal implications due to the reliance of many legal systems on paper documents and signatures. The business and legal implications are therefore discussed in detail. The application of EDI in the construction industry is investigated by means of a literature review. This work is furthered by a longitudinal study of the construction industry's application of EDI, which consisted of two surveys at a five year interval. A model of the information flows within the traditional construction process is developed to assist in the identification of information flows suitable for EDI. A methodology for message development was produced. The methodology was then applied to develop a description data model that could be utilised in the existing <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> quantity and <b>trading</b> cycle messages. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> quantity message set was at a stage ready for trial. To determine the issues related to implementation specifically in the construction industry a trial implementation of this message set was undertaken. The official implementation undertaken by EDICON is described. Software was also developed to undertake the trial. This software was tested and proved the message set developed was suitable for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> quantity related information during a construction project. The factors causing the failure of the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> quantities message set are discussed. A number of these factors are considered valid for all construction project information flows. Finally, the use of shared project models to re-engineer construction information tasks is recommended as a means of achieving significant benefit from electronic data exchange in the construction process...|$|R

30|$|Amid {{an era of}} {{widespread}} economic and political stability, {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century witnessed an unprecedented expansion <b>of</b> cross-border <b>trade</b> and capital flows (Obstfeld and Taylor 2004). However, owing to the costs as well as the inelastic supply of gold-backed money, the massive increase in international payments was not matched by a corresponding increase of cross-border transfers of gold bullion or coins. Hence, international capital flows exceeded by far the volume <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> which was, in turn, far larger than cross-border transfers of gold (Eichengreen 2008, pp. 24 ff.). These discrepancies reflect that, since the Middle Ages, <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange were widely used to finance international payments (see, e.g. Denzel 2010, ch. 3, Einzig 1962, ch. 7). In essence, a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange was a written order by an issuer, called the drawer, instructing a counterparty 2, called the drawee, to pay a certain amount of money at a specific place either immediately (sight-bill) or at the end of a given—usually 3 months—term to maturity (long-bill).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{doctoral}} dissertation is to chart and analyze the flow of payments and credits to and from Gothenburg for the period 1790 − 1820, with {{a special interest in}} the transactions involving The Merchant House Ekman & Co. Both <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange transactions within Ekman & Co and protested <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange for other firms are studied. Markus A. Denzel’s model of Cashless Payment is an instrument to study how <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange were used to ease payments and credit relations in the European Early Modern Credit market between 1790 and 1820. European trade possibilities for the period 1790 − 1820 are discussed in chapter III. The period under scrutiny was rather dramatic with economic and political changes. In Great Britain there was the industrial revolution and France experienced the great political revolution, followed by the Napoleonic wars. Chapter IV explores the credit- and <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange markets. Since protested <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange and different ways to deal with the problems that occur are important, this dissertation examines protested <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange for two periods 1798 − 1800 and 1811 − 1812. The reasons for protesting <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange are either lack of acceptance or lack of payment, both of which are common in this analysis. As a consequence there were no more endorsement possibilities. Chapter V describes the business of The Merchant House Ekman for the period 1790 − 1800, with special interest in the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange transactions. Peter III Ekman started his business ca 1760. He realized the importance of European contacts and from early on he traded with Merchants in Amsterdam, Hamburg, Greifswald, Wolgast and Stralsund. During the period 1790 − 1800 {{he was one of the}} most important producers of salted herring in Gothenburg. As a return good he imported grain from Merchant houses in the Baltic Sea. He imported the important salt by using his own ships. Ekman’s credit transactions in the form <b>of</b> <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange contracts are of central importance, but the difficulty with the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange transactions is that there are no obvious connections with the commodity transactions. Because of endorsement, it is impossible to tell exactly what <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> exchange belonged to a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>traded</b> commodity. Chapter VI examines the Ekman & Co shift from mostly trading in herring and iron to concentrate on colonial trade at the time of war. Concerning credit relations, a database has been created for <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange dating from 1810, which is then used to analyze the credit relations that Ekman & Co had with other firms in the European market. The dissertation shows the benefits of discounting and how the endorsements were used, as well as the fact that the Cashless Payments system with the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> exchange transactions worked. When the system failed there was an effective law that solved the problem. All of this is further evidence that Gothenburg was an integrated part of the European financial system...|$|R

Process of replacing hard copy communication with electronic shipping communication has undergone a great expansion. The use of EDI systems in all industrial branches, including transport and shipping industry, create great innovations, and are treated as a major benefit for the international mass and fast transfer of goods. Digitalization in the field <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> transport and logistic operator’s contributes to reducing paper costs, reducing timeline for transport route, and simplification of analysis and storage <b>of</b> transport and <b>trade</b> documents. Despite these efficiencies and convenience, until recently, electronic documentation in the field of transport was not covered by an international convention.
