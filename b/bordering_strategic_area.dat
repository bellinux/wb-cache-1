As the discussion elaborates, {{an examination of the}} way that water has been used in the past and in the present demonstrates the dynamism of the religious practices prominent in locations such as Kangding. The study of water, and of the everyday religious practices with which it is associated, also intersects with growing resource management challenges that have come to the forefront during a contemporary period of development and modernization. I suggest that the recent resurgence of religion could deepen our understandings about local knowledge of the natural environment while shedding light on some ideas about its ideal use...|$|R

The 498 km Bilaspur-Manali-Leh rail project has been expedited and the Final Location Survey (FLS) for this has been undertaken {{at a cost of}} Rs 345 crore. The railway had requested the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council, Leh (LAHDC) to provide adequate land for setting up a camp office, and the required infrastructure.

This makes the relationship between the areas tend to be imbalanced. To develop a balanced/appropriate interaction, adaptive concept can be applied by strengthening the database, doing benefit-cost-risk analysis, identifying potential conflicts, making priorities, scenarios and corrective actions, as well as involving public...|$|R
50|$|After 1957, the new South African Defence Force {{was faced}} with a post-war upsurge in African nationalism, and forced to expand its {{resources}} accordingly. In 1963 its total strength stood at around 25,000 men. By 1977, the United Nations was imposing arms sanctions on the republic due to its controversial policy of racial apartheid. South Africa responded by developing a powerful domestic arms industry, capable of producing quality hardware, including supersonic jet fighters, armoured cars, multiple rocket launchers, and small arms. SADF units fought in the Angolan Civil War during Operation Savannah and were also active alongside Rhodesian Security Forces during the Rhodesian Bush War. Although both campaigns were strategically unsuccessful, it was clearly proven that South Africa's military was immeasurably superior in strength and sophistication than all her African neighbours combined. Further enlargement and modernisation of the armed forces continued under former defence minister Pieter Willem Botha, who became state president in 1984. Shortly after Botha took office, the SADF numbered some 83,400 men (including 53,100 conscripts and 5,400 non-whites): one armoured brigade, one mechanised infantry brigade, four motorised brigades, one parachute brigade, a special reconnaissance regiment, twenty artillery regiments, supporting specialist units, a balanced air force, and a navy adequate for coastal protection in all. In addition, numerous auxiliary formations were trained as support units capable of occupying <b>strategic</b> <b>border</b> <b>areas,</b> including the predominantly Angolan 32 Battalion, Namibia's South West African Territorial Force, and several Bantustan militias.|$|R

After the tourism market was identified, the relation among the visitors’ origins, the places they visited, and their next trips were explored to identify the dominant characters of the movement and places. This study used survey technique and network analysis. The findings conclude that the main tourism market in tourism <b>strategic</b> <b>area</b> was still dominated by domestic market with their specific characters. The visitors did not only visit the tourism attractions in Sambas, but also pass the border to go to the neighbouring country, either directly or through Sambas.
