The intention was to eventually remove all the Jews from Poland, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> their final destination {{had not yet been}} determined. Together, the Wehrmacht and the Einsatzgruppen also drove tens of thousands of Jews eastward into Soviet-controlled territory.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{navigation}} ceased to operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock remained in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over {{the navigation}} were owned by the navigation, and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the navigation was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the navigation would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> it was agreed that the navigation had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{developer}} Ken Levine {{had created}} Irrational Games in 1997 out of former members from Looking Glass Studios. Their first game was System Shock 2, {{a sequel to}} Looking Glass's System Shock, and was met with critical success, though it did not prove a financial one. Levine had attempted to pitch a sequel to System Shock 2 to Electronic Arts, but the publisher rejected the idea based on the poor performance of the earlier game. Irrational would proceed to develop other games, including Freedom Force, , the cancelled title Deep Cover, and the completed The Lost which was never released due to legal complications, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Levine wanted {{to return to a}} game in the same style as System Shock 2, a more free-form game with strong narrative.|$|E
5|$|Schreck was a {{founding}} member of the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Department"; SA), being involved in its growth and development. This was a paramilitary wing of the party designed to disrupt political opponents and provide muscle for security tasks. Hitler, in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service and protection rather than an uncontrolled mass of the party, such as the SA. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Schreck and Joseph Berchtold. It was designated the Stabswache ("Staff Guard"). The Stabswache were issued unique badges, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> the Stabswache was still under overall control of the SA, whose membership continued to increase. Schreck resurrected the use of the Totenkopf ("death's head") as the unit's insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of Imperial Germany in World War I who used Hutier infiltration tactics.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{positions}} were well-sited {{on the spur}} for an attack from the east along the track from Katika to Sattelberg, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> Captain B. G. Cribb, the commander of D Company, 2/13th Infantry Battalion, came {{on the radio and}} announced that he was in contact with the Japanese to the west, and was going to attack from that direction. A furious fight ensured. The Japanese held their fire until the Australians were almost on top of them. Realising that the position was stronger than he had thought, Cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded. Windeyer ordered the 2/17th to bypass the position and proceed to its objective, the high ground south of the Song River. The 2/15th was ordered to attack Katika Spur. The attack was delivered at 15:15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars, but the Japanese defenders had withdrawn, leaving behind eight dead. By nightfall, most of the brigade was on their objectives.|$|E

50|$|All SAGA {{specifications}} {{are defined}} in (a flavor of) IDL, and thus object oriented, but language neutral. Different language bindings exist (Java, C++, Python), <b>but</b> are, <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> not standardised.

5|$|The cast {{finished}} filming {{their final}} episode for 2005 on 20 December, {{aware that the}} show's future {{was the subject of}} discussion, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> the show had not been cancelled. To prepare for the possibility of cancellation, two alternate endings for the show were filmed in 2005 for a possible series finale in 2006. One ending was left open ended, to serve as a lead-in to a possible 14th season, the other ending wrapped up all the show's storylines. The cast were on their New Year non-rating period hiatus when they were told of Blue Heelers cancellation. Thus, the eleven final episodes the cast had filmed in late 2005 were to be used for the 2006 season. For the series finale, the latter ending, wrapping up the show's storylines was used. Although, rather than completely wrapping everything up, the producers made it possible to resume from where they left off, should Seven decide to start producing Blue Heelers again.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} these {{so-called}} Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, {{on the side}} of the clergy, and Warwick, Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was the most experienced of the earls, and took on a modifying role in the group. Thomas of Lancaster, who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir, was the king's cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> he took a less active part in the reform movement. Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers; he was certainly the most aggressive. The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king's financial freedom, and his right to appoint his own ministers. It alsoonce moreordered Gaveston to be exiled, to return only at the risk of excommunication.|$|E
5|$|The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and {{the dancers}} fled the {{building}} as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre, and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon. This too, would burn {{to the ground in}} 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.|$|E

25|$|Flintoff {{enforced}} the follow on, {{and once}} again Mubarak was out in single figures to Hoggard, the total 10 for one. However, Tharanga and Sangakkara built Sri Lanka's largest partnership of the match thus far, both making half-centuries and sharing a stand of 109. Eventually both batsmen were caught by Jones off spinner Monty Panesar, with Sangakkara's innings lasting {{four and a half}} hours for 65 runs, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> England required seven wickets and had two days to do it in.|$|E

Ibn Atiyyah began to attack the rebels, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> he received a message from Marwan that he had been placed in charge of the pilgrimage for that year, necessitating his return to Mecca. Seeing no other choice, he quickly made peace with the Ibadis without defeating them, and departed from the region.|$|E
25|$|A lack {{of oxygen}} or {{chemical}} changes in the lungs may cause the heart to stop beating. This cardiac arrest stops {{the flow of blood}} and thus stops the transport of oxygen to the brain. Cardiac arrest used to be the traditional point of death <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> there is still a chance of recovery. The brain cannot survive long without oxygen and the continued {{lack of oxygen}} in the blood combined with the cardiac arrest will lead to the deterioration of brain cells causing first brain damage and eventually brain death from which recovery is generally considered impossible. The brain will die after approximately six minutes without oxygen at normal body temperature, but hypothermia of the central nervous system may prolong this.|$|E

After a year passes and Subaru finally realises his love for Seishirō, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> Seishirō reveals he is the Sakurazukamori, Japan's top one assassin. Having become the Sakurazukamori, Seishirō was supposed to kill the young Subaru when being found by him.

As a result, he almost kills the young onmyōji, but Subaru's grandmother intervenes to free him from the illusion, leaving herself crippled as a result.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February {{a formal}} {{reconciliation}} was concluded between Ocko tom Brok, {{the town of}} Groningen, Oostergo, Westergo, Hunsingo, Fivelgo, and the small territories of Vredewold, Langewold, and Humsterland. This took place behind John of Bavaria's back, {{and when he got}} wind of it, he demanded it to be rescinded. <b>But</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> he had lost almost all his support in the Frisian territories. His last stronghold there was the city of Dokkum, on the north coast, which was held for him mainly by privateers, who preyed on the ships plying the trade route along the North Sea coast. At the end of May a fleet from the cities of Groningen, Hamburg, and Lübeck sailed to Dokkum, and drove the privateers out, thus depriving John of this last foothold on Frisian soil.|$|E
25|$|Remington {{continued}} sketching <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> {{his results}} were still cartoonish and amateur. After {{less than a}} year, he sold his ranch and went home. After acquiring more capital from his mother, he returned to Kansas City to start a hardware business, but due to an alleged swindle, it failed, and he reinvested his remaining money as a silent, half-owner of a saloon. He went home to marry Eva Caten in 1884 and they returned to Kansas City immediately. She was unhappy with his saloon life and was unimpressed by the sketches of saloon inhabitants that Remington regularly showed her. When his real occupation became known, she left him and returned to Ogdensburg. With his wife gone and with business doing badly, Remington started to sketch and paint in earnest, and bartered his sketches for essentials.|$|E

[...] Pitchfork said that [...] "It's raw stuff, <b>but</b> even <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point</b> Green Day's records were at least halfway decently recorded, unlike most of their peers' tin-can-and-twine set-ups, and songs like 'At the Library' and 'Don't Leave Me' were downright hummable." ...|$|R
