5|$|Charles demanded {{not only}} the {{surrender}} of Lombardy, but also of Burgundy and Provence, forcing Francis to argue that French law prevented him from surrendering any lands possessed by the crown without the approval of Parlement, which would not <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b> On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|By 5 May 1536, {{the town}} council of Buena Esperanza had now lost all faith in Cerezeda and {{voted for the}} {{abandonment}} of Higueras {{and a return to}} Trujillo; Cerezeda opposed this decision, but the council forced him to sign off on the move. In the meantime, any party foraging outside of Buena Esperanza was ordered to consist of at least 20 members for defence from the hostile natives. A chaotic evacuation back to Trujillo began, and resentment against Cerezeda was such that he feared for his life and fled to Naco to seek refuge amongst friendly natives there. On 9 May, amidst this disordered Spanish retreat, García de Celís returned from Guatemala with news that help would soon <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} the sortie was to attack Japanese {{transports}} at Kota Bharu, but in the afternoon of 9 December the Japanese submarine I-56 spotted the British ships, and in the evening they were detected by Japanese aerial reconnaissance. By this time it had been made clear that no RAF fighter support would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b> At midnight a signal was received that Japanese forces were landing at Kuantan in Malaya. Force Z was diverted to investigate. At 02:11 on 10 December the force was again sighted by a Japanese submarine and at 08:00 arrived off Kuantan, {{only to discover that}} the reported landings were a diversion.|$|E
5|$|At 09:50 on 23 August, a U.S. PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (based at Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands) {{initially}} sighted Tanaka's convoy. By late afternoon, with no further sightings of Japanese ships, two aircraft strike forces from Saratoga and Henderson Field took off {{to attack the}} convoy. However, Tanaka, knowing that an attack would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming</b> following the PBY sighting, reversed course once he had departed the area, and eluded the strike aircraft. After Tanaka reported to his superiors his loss of time by turning north to avoid the expected Allied airstrike, the landings of his troops on Guadalcanal was pushed back to 25 August. By 18:23 on 23 August, with no Japanese carriers sighted and no new intelligence reporting of {{their presence in the}} area, Fletcher detached Wasp (which was getting low on fuel) and the rest of TF18 for the two-day trip south toward Efate Island to refuel. Thus, Wasp and her escorting warships missed the upcoming battle.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming,</b> Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties felt she should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% felt she should continue.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolt of}} 1381 {{broke out in}} Essex, {{following}} the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May. Bampton {{was a member of}} Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles. He based himself in Brentwood and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of Corringham, Fobbing and Stanford-le-Hope to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June. The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks. Bampton first interrogated the people of Fobbing, whose representative, Thomas Baker, declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more money would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b> When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out. Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as jurors were killed. Robert Bealknap, the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.|$|E

Expansion remained dormant throughout World War II.|$|E

If, as the evidence suggests, he was very short-lived, such clarification {{is not likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b> The result is that the Amarna Succession is dictated by the underlying theory on the identity of King Ankhkheperure-mery Neferkheperure Neferneferuaten-mery Wa en Re.|$|E

25|$|The Sixth WTO Ministerial Conference {{took place}} in Hong Kong, 13 to 18 December 2005. Although a flurry of {{negotiations}} {{took place in}} the fall of 2005, WTO director-general Pascal Lamy announced in November 2005 that a comprehensive agreement on modalities would not <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming</b> in Hong Kong, and that the talks would “take stock” of the negotiations and would try to reach agreements in negotiating sectors where convergence was reported.|$|E
25|$|Bishop Adelbert Anson, {{the first}} Bishop of Qu'Appelle (1884–1892), {{established}} the St John's College Farm, a boys' school, agricultural and theological college {{shortly after his}} arrival in the diocese in 1884. When {{it became clear that}} funding from eastern Canada, the heartland of Canadian Anglicanism, would not <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming,</b> English funding for the Anglican mission on the Canadian prairies soon dried up and St. John's College dissolved shortly after Bishop Anson's departure in 1893.|$|E

Although Urlus and his wife had several children already, and needed the money, he turned down the Frankfurt offer because the company would not grant him time off each summer to attend Bayreuth: he still hoped for a call from the festival's directors which, as it transpired, would not <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming</b> for another 13 years.|$|E
25|$|Euler {{made the}} first conjectures about {{biquadratic}} reciprocity. Gauss published two monographs on biquadratic reciprocity. In the first one (1828) he proved Euler's conjecture about the biquadratic character of 2. In the second one (1832) he stated the biquadratic reciprocity law for the Gaussian integers and proved the supplementary formulas. He said that a third monograph would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming</b> with the proof of the general theorem, but it never appeared. Jacobi presented proofs in his Königsberg lectures of 1836–37. The first published proofs were by Eisenstein.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} twelve cities {{throughout}} {{the central and}} southern parts of Sweden hosted the tournament. FIFA regulations required at least six stadiums to have a capacity of at least 20,000. If Denmark had qualified, the organisers had planned to use the Idrætsparken in Copenhagen for Denmark's group matches. The Idrætsparken was renovated in 1956 with this in mind, but Denmark lost out to England in qualification. When doubts arose about whether funding would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming</b> for rebuilding the Ullevi and Malmö Stadion, the organisers considered stadiums in Copenhagen and Oslo as contingency measures.|$|E

25|$|After {{calling the}} U.S. Customs {{to run a}} {{criminal}} background check which came back negative, Lavy was denied entry into Canada, fined $750 for trying to import the weapons, and the ricin powder was confiscated. He was then released back into the United States and told to report to U.S. Customs; he did so, he declared $22,500 in cash and listed his address in Valdez as PO Box 1297. At this point, it seemed clear that no laws were considered to have been broken, and no prosecution would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1975 New Year Honours, Queen Elizabeth II created Sobers a Knight Bachelor for his {{services}} to cricket. The award {{was made in the}} British Diplomatic and Overseas section of the list, rather than on the nomination of the Government of Barbados, which had stopped putting forward recommendations for British honours. This caused the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office some unease, as shown by papers released by The National Archives in 2005. However, since Barbados had not yet introduced its own system of honours, the Prime Minister of Barbados was pleased that an honour would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming</b> for Sobers.|$|E

After visiting the local Copperhead leader, Dr. William A. Bowles, Hines learned that no desired support would <b>be</b> <b>forthcoming.</b> He and his scouts were soon identified as actually being Confederates, and, in a small skirmish near Leavenworth, Indiana, Hines had to abandon his men as he swam across the Ohio River under gunfire. He wandered around Kentucky for a week seeking information on Morgan's whereabouts.|$|E
