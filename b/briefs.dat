Seven entities filed amici curiae <b>briefs</b> with the Supreme Court {{in support of}} hearing the case. This included amici <b>briefs</b> by two former Solicitors General of the United States, Paul Clement {{on behalf of the}} guardian ad litem, and Greg Garre on behalf of the birth mother, suggesting that the Equal Protection Clause requires applying strict scrutiny to ICWA’s race-based placement preferences. The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the National Council for Adoption, the California State Association of Counties and the Center for Adoption Policy were also among those that submitted <b>briefs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} {{underwear}} {{are described as}} bikini underwear and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear, panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini <b>briefs</b> are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular <b>briefs.</b> Men's bikini <b>briefs</b> can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini <b>briefs</b> have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E

5|$|The term men's bikini is {{sometimes}} {{used to describe}} swim <b>briefs.</b> Men's bikinis can have high or low side panels, and string sides or tie sides. Most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim <b>briefs,</b> bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and sun tanning. The posing brief standard to bodybuilding competitions {{is an example of}} this style.

5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, and he now claimed {{that the answer to}} Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus <b>briefs</b> supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus <b>briefs</b> supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their <b>briefs</b> and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts be charged with examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and <b>briefs,</b> and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} the management tools and variables that impact <b>briefing,</b> assess {{the nature of}} current <b>briefing</b> practices, review {{the need for more}} structured techniques and determine the place of facilities management in <b>briefing.</b> Design/methodology/approach: A detailed literature review to analyse and critique the <b>briefing</b> process was followed by a brainstorming session to explore relevant technical frameworks. A questionnaire survey investigated opinions of structured approaches to <b>briefing.</b> Findings: The facilities manager operating within the strategic framework of the client organisation and having the necessary skills is a natural choice as <b>brief</b> writer. Facilities managers’ involvement is not strongly reflected in this research, indicating perhaps that they do not consider <b>briefing</b> a natural role or that they do not possess the skills for its undertaking. It is concluded that while <b>briefing</b> remains an unstructured investigative process, the skills for which are learned through experience, then architects and project managers will continue to dominate the activity. Practical implications: Currently, <b>briefing</b> is unstructured, iterative, and uses a variety of media for its exposition. More formalised processes recognising strategic and project <b>briefing</b> are advocated in the literature. Options for improvement include a structured approach to investigative <b>briefing</b> and facilitated value management. Originality/value: The limited involvement of facilities managers in <b>briefing</b> prompted this research.

The NAACP took primary responsibility for Supreme Court cases (often led by lead NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall), with the ACLU focusing on police misconduct, and supporting the NAACP with amicus <b>briefs.</b> The NAACP achieved a key victory in 1950 with the Henderson v.
