40|$|With the Greens now {{in control}} of the Australian Senate is the Gillard government’s plans for Internet {{censorship}} dead asks Jo Coghlan.   • If it were up to Gillard and Conroy they would introduce Internet filter legislation today. But the reality of the new political paradigm is that the Labor Party’s legislative agenda will now be set by the Greens until the next federal election. The Gillard government is {{not going to want to}} go to the polls early on the back of a double dissolution - because they know that they will lose office and likely be in opposition for at least two terms - so they will ideally only introduce legislation that they know, or think they know, the Greens will back. To do otherwise - and introduce legislation that is going to be defeated would only make Labor seem even more defeated than they currently are. The question is: Is Internet censorship a <b>big-ticket</b> <b>item</b> that Labor either really believes in and must legislate on in this parliament (there is no compelling evidence that Gillard or Conroy really believe in it) or that if Labor do introduce the legislation there is political capital in it - will it help persuade voters in urban cities, mainly the marginal seats in Sydney, Melbourne,and parts of Brisbane, to vote for the Labor Party at the next election. Is Internet censorship legislation an issue that will deliver Labor votes and if it is then what will they give the Green’s to get it through the Senate? Should Gillard and Conroy introduce the much talked about Internet censorship bill, the Greens would have to oppose it in the Senate. If they didn 2 ̆ 7 t it would be like the Meg Lee’s Democrats all over again. The political motivations of the Gillard government to introduce Internet censorship haven’t changed. It remains determined to act as a moral compass for Australian families in order to get some much-needed mum and dad votes from the suburbs. Gillard and Conroy frame this political pragmatism in the mantra that laws are designed to suit the needs of the majority. Similarly the libertarian objections of the Greens to Internet censorship have not changed. Freedom of communication remains a core ideal of the Greens. Should the Gillard government go a little mad (and there is some evidence of a little panic going on in Sydney and Canberra) and introduce its long awaited Internet filter bill, what arguments might sway the Green’s to support the bill? Are current censorship laws enough? Currently, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) is empowered to investigate media issues under the Broadcasting Services Act (1992). It responds to what is seen as offensive and illegal material online by administering a national regulatory scheme that includes the investigation of complaints about prohibited online content. Prohibited content since 2000 (under Section 5 of the 1992 Broadcasting Services Act) refers to “refused classification” material such as child sexual abuse imagery; detailed instruction in crime; non-violent sexually explicit material (X 18 +); and material unsuitable for person under 18 (R 18 +). Since 2008 the Gillard government has proposed to extend regulation of the Internet by ACMA by introducing filters. In December 2009 the government announced it would proceed with plans to censor the Internet after Government-commissioned trials found filtering a blacklist of banned sites was possible. As at 30 April 2009, there were 977 URLs on the ACMA blacklist. Australia already has detailed censorship laws such as the classifications which control what is seen on public television. These classifications could be expanded to other forms of media. The Internet is like a television - it broadcasts images and text that audiences watch or don 2 ̆ 7 t watch. However the problem with Internet censorship is that it is not the ‘Australian internet’ it is global, a point returned to shortly. For now it is reasonable to argue that rather than censorship by filtering certain websites, the government could use the National Classification Code (2005) as it does now to warn viewers. There does however remain a difference between censorship and banning. Under the National Classification Code adults are already refused access to films and videos which: depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime, cruelty, violence or revolting or abhorrent phenomena in such a way that they offend against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that they should not be classified; or depict in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult a minor who is, or who appears to be, under 16 (whether or not engaged in sexual activity); or promote, incite or instruct in matters of crime or violence. Material generally agreed to be potentially harmful to children on films and videos, or in magazines, should be regarded in the same way on the Internet. The Internet 2 ̆ 7 s power and (potential) pervasiveness make it crucial to immediately begin trying to develop an effective and usable system for extending classification to it. But classification is not, and should not be, confused with censorship: censorship in this case being the use of filters to deny adults’ access to the Internet. Is the Internet a free speech issue? Australian law recognises that the maintenance of social cohesion and public order necessitates limits on freedom of speech where it may lead to a breach of the peace and a range of civil and criminal laws are directed at racial hatred. For example, the Anti-Discrimination Act (NSW 1977) and the Racial Hatred Act (Cth 1995) include the offences of racial vilification. International legal instruments also accept that the right to freedom of speech is limited. It is the issue of freedom of communication that is of concern to the Greens and its libertarian position. In terms of violation of freedoms of communication, Australian law hasn’t a strong legal framework. While freedom of communication on matters of government and politics is contained in Sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution, it was not until 1992 that the High Court of Australia formally recognised that the Constitution protected freedom of communication. The decisions in Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills and Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth both found that the Constitution contained only an implied freedom of communication. Legal argument in opposition to Internet content regulation is established in freedom of speech and communication jurisprudence. These arguments are more likely to stiffen the Greens’ resolve to deny Gillard and Conroy any pragmatic censorship bill. The Greens however might be swayed to consider extensions of the National Classification Code if it accepts – as most jurisprudence does – that the right to freedom of communication is not absolute. The 2 ̆ 7 right to know 2 ̆ 7, requiring access to knowledge and information and incorporating the idea of freedom of information, is a modern political development. The political ideal of free speech and the idea of freedom to express inquiry and identity, as John Stuart Mill first conceived it, are tied to freedom of thought and opinion. Individuals need to be free to test their ideas of identity, without being held accountable to the state. Increasingly (at least in the West) citizens are taking this idea and using this to defend the right of people to freely access information based on the idea that the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become. Free speech is not an absolute value however and current national laws and international conventions have functioned to regulate adult behavior. In Australia, there are laws dealing with defamation, blasphemy, copyright, obscenity, incitement, use of insulting words, official secrecy, contempt of court and of parliament, sedition and consumer protection that place limits on speech. These laws recognise that there are countervailing interests that must take precedence over freedom of speech in some circumstances. Debates about Internet censorship are problematic: there are moral and value judgments about what is appropriate content, who gets to decide what is normative, and the role of parliament in introducing forms of censorship when freedom of communication is an implied right of the Constitution. The other significant issue that may block any Internet censorship bill in the current parliament is: does it work? How do you censor the Internet? Apart from the political, moral and legal issues of government censorship of the Internet, the technological issues associated with trying to censor the Internet are large, complex and ultimately expensive. The Internet distributes information hence should it be treated as a piece of technology or because it provides interactive text and image, should content be the subject of censorship? Content censorship may work with a book published in Sydney. But the Internet poses considerable challenges for the effective regulation of the reproduction and dissemination of material in digital form, considering that: information distribution can be anonymous; there is an ability to hide information through encryption; and there are jurisdictional difficulties in either enforcing controls or applying punitive measures. There is an inconsistency of cross-border regulation of the Internet even among national partners like European Union states. There are also difficulties in establishing effective co-operation of authorities across national borders, and the labour-intensive cost of attempting the technological difficulties (or impossibilities) of regulating Internet content. To pursue Internet censorship, even if it technologically possible across states who may or may not share national interests will mean it is likely to be a very expensive proposition with little chance of success. Recent accounts of hacking at the IMF, Sony, and the U. S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin show that determined web users will find ways to subvert national efforts. As has been said, there is no such thing as ‘an Australian internet’– the World Wide Web is not a misnomer. Labor’s best legislative attempts to regulate internet content will continue to be frustrated by jurisdictional issues, unlimited costs and well skilled hackers and hacktivists. Never mind, they will also be frustrated by the Greens. In February (2011) Senator Conroy was asked to comment on the Egyptian government cutting Internet access ostensibly to hinder pro-democracy. The Minister assured the journalist that such a thing could never happen in Australia: "…Australia 2 ̆ 7 s a vibrant democracy, where the government doesn 2 ̆ 7 t control the internet [...] . " A year earlier, in February (2010) Conroy had to back peddle after telling ABC radio listeners “you can 2 ̆ 7 t regulate the internet”. While Labor may still aspire to regulating the internet they will be limited by the need to negotiate with the Greens and may therefore need to find new ways of helping the community avoid inappropriate content. Or wait until there is a change to the senate but that won 2 ̆ 7 t be until 2013.

The money flexibility under price dispersion discovers specific features of Veblen effect. When the smart shopping of luxuries results in price reductions, which are greater than the wage rate, the marginal utility of labor income becomes negative. The marginal utility of luxuries also becomes negative. And the total consumption-leisure utility is increasing only due to the increase in leisure time.

This paper attempts to highlight the different strategies which children today use to influence their parents. Achild's demographic factors like age, gender and number of child's siblings have {{an important role in the}} usage of different influence tactics by children. The study was conducted through primary survey (questionnaire) on 175 children in the age-group 8 - 12 years. Collected data was analyzed based on frequency distributions. The collected data were summarized, coded, and manipulated by using Statistical Package for Social Scientists 16. 0 (SPSS) and Microsoft Excel. The general findings of the study suggest that demographics play an important role only in few influence strategies like emotional and persuasion.

40|$|Trade ministers {{from member}} {{countries}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) convened in Hong Kong in December 2005 to jump-start the flagging Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The ministerial accomplished more in spirit than in substance and placed more emphasis on negotiating process than on policy reform. The industrial countries offered up kernels of subsidy reform and development assistance, but all the <b>big-ticket</b> <b>items</b> were studiously deferred to future meetings. Progress on nonagricultural market access and services was microscopic. Without substantive offers in these areas, the United States and European Union {{will not be able}} to augment their offers on farm reforms. Developing countries are skeptical that the European Union will up the ante in agriculture even if they offer concrete reforms on goods and services trade. In any event, most developing countries are reluctant to lower their own market access barriers. So neither side moves. Trade ministers do not have the political authority to break this "Alphonse and Gaston" routine and approve reforms in sensitive areas that are needed to produce a comprehensive package of accords acceptable to all WTO members. To succeed, the Doha Round needs a political jolt. A trade summit involving heads of state of countries whose policy reforms are crucial to the success of the WTO talks must be convened to break the impasse. ...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} pressure for cost containment in health care, <b>big-ticket</b> <b>items</b> such as magnetic resonance (MR) are getting attention. Can 0. 5 -T state-of-the-art sys-tems be as clinically efficacious as 1. 5 -T systems? It is therefore worthwhile to compare contrast enhancement between the field strength as was {{discussed in the}} AJNR article “Effect of Dose and Field Strength on Enhancement with Paramagnetic Contrast Media ” (1). Such a study requires a fair comparison. First, T 1 re-laxation times differ at 0. 5 T and 1. 5 T. Should not the authors have first selected the optimal repetition time for each field strength and then made the comparison? Sec-ond, the echo times used were not comparable. In “Meth-ods, ” the authors state that the echo times ranged between 10 and 20 milliseconds. In fact, the clinical cases at 0. 5 T from Figures 1 and 2 are annotated as 25 milliseconds. Were the echo times actually set for 25 milliseconds at 0. 5 T because of the gradient limitations of that system but were 10 to 20 milliseconds on their 1. 5 -T system? It is currently very difficult to make a truly valid com-parison between field strengths, because many other hard-ware differences exist even within the same vendor’s sys-tems. In addition to more powerful gradients often being available on 1. 5 -T systems, radio frequency coils, soft-ware, and so forth, also generally differ. Based on my own experience with different field strengths and vendors, there {{will continue to be}} some applications for which high-field systems will significantly outperform middle- and particularly low-field systems. The issue of contrast enhancement and image contrast’s dependency on field strength remains an unanswered question in my mind...|$|E
40|$|Outsourcing in {{the public}} sector has been an issue of much debate in the Australian public sector over the last one and a half decades. Following a decade long {{experimentation}} elsewhere in the wake of public sector reforms, primarily in Western and other OECD countries, it has impacted upon various tiers of the Australian Public Sector since the late eighties. The reasons for such debates centred on the role of government in serving its citizens from a shrinking revenue base and rising unemployment levels. After the early 1990 s management theorists have challenged the efficiencies of governments. Government production has been labelled as inefficient and ineffective. To redress these allegations, various countries adopted measures to lift the performance of the public sector. Some of the measures were administrative in nature, while others directly impacted the operational aspects of government service provision. As a result, intellectual currents flowed back and forth among countries about their practices to address the inefficiencies. Overall, the tiers of governments were scrutinised for their performance. Local governments in different countries were seen to have addressed these concerns more than any other level of government. This is evidenced by the prevalence of a rich body of literature on contracting out in local government contexts. Ironically, the outsourcing practices in local governments lacked the rigour demanded by critics. Allegations were made that the methods for evaluating government efficiency and of reforms for making sourcing decisions are historically flawed. Though these did not bear much on the decisions of the public servants in the past, they mattered a lot in recent times, especially in the wake of declining revenue bases in local government. The reform advocates demanded inputs from accounting professionals in making their administrative decisions. In particular, outsourcing of <b>big-ticket</b> <b>items</b> over multi-year period attracted the attention of local government bodies. So there have been increasing calls for more research into outsourcing decisions using contemporary managerial and accounting practices. The role of local government management accountants suddenly became prominent within their organisations. This thesis has addressed this gap in the literature by introducing a holistic framework for pricing government production and evaluating bid decisions. Attempts have been made to use theory triangulation, drawing on literature from public administration, economics, management accounting and government financial management. The conceptual framework of the thesis extends research to date by bringing in the theoretical and practical rigour for competitively pricing internal bids and making decisions. A case study method has been adopted to collect and analyse data from primary and secondary sources. In analysing data, the triangulation approach has been used to reinforce the findings and validate the conclusions reached in this thesis. A local government city council in New South Wales has been used to conduct the case study. The major findings of this thesis are that outsourcing practices in the researched organisation reflected two distinct theoretical perspectives, the transaction cost theory (TCE), and the new managerialism (which descended from Public Choice Theory Overall, outsourcing practices in the researched organisation were not prevalent. But after the introduction of public sector reforms, the processes of sourcing decisions were much more formalised, and the managerial accountability was made more rigorous. Finally, overhead allocation played a vital role in pricing internal bids in both cases. Especially, the role of overhead allocation in bid pricing emerged as a dominant theme after the introduction of public sector reform in the researched organisation. It required the introduction of private sector and commercial style accounting and management practices. The researched organisation changed its Accounting Information Systems in general, and Management Accounting Systems in particular, across the board, borrowing private sector managerial and accounting expertise. It was also revealed that strategic management accounting had enormous potential to reshape the accounting and operating environment of the researched organisation...|$|E
40|$|Whatever the outcome, Australians {{should be}} able to say that they cast an {{informed}} vote, writes Paul Kildea in the Australian Financial Review IIN THE SPACE of a few days, Julia Gillard has committed to referendums on constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and recognition of local government. She has stressed the need for open community discussion but, if history is a guide, public debate will soon become polarised and confused, dashing any chances of success and leaving voters dissatisfied. Our last attempt at constitutional change in 1999 was typical of Australian referendums. Even after years of debate about the republic, half of Australians said they didn’t know enough to make an informed vote. This had a lot to do with the overblown and misleading claims made by both sides, leaving people short-changed and disillusioned with the process. Many people understandably voted ‘no’ in frustration. Fortunately, this need not be the case. The answer is to involve citizens early in a process that enables them to make meaningful contributions, and gives them the tools to do so. First, it is crucial to involve the public in deciding what sort of proposal should be put to a referendum. This might seem obvious but, under our constitution, the responsibility for deciding which reforms should be voted on rests solely with federal Parliament. This has led many governments to spring referendums on voters at the last minute, almost always resulting in a decisive ‘no’ vote. When it comes to recognising indigenous Australians or local government in the constitution, there are a number of options for reform. If the public are to feel any ownership over process, they need to be given a say on which option should proceed to a vote. Second, the government and the expert panel must provide people with meaningful opportunities to participate in the process. We need to think beyond <b>big-ticket</b> <b>items</b> like the 1998 Constitutional Convention. This left ordinary citizens on the outer, feeling like their input didn’t count. Instead, the government should provide a variety of forums for citizens to participate, and signal how their input will feed into the decision-making process. When it comes to political engagement, one size does not fit all. Targeted consultations, particularly with a diverse range of indigenous leaders and community groups, must be central to the process. More broadly, holding public meetings will also be important, but they tend to attract the most confident and vocal citizens, while excluding people who can’t make them due to disability, caring duties or other responsibilities. To ensure that the process is inclusive, the government should therefore draw on a wide variety of options in its policy toolkit, including written submissions, interactive online forums and recent innovations like citizens’ juries and deliberative polls. And sometimes it pays to think outside the box – some of the most popular participation tools before the 1999 referendum were preamble-writing competitions, which attracted hundreds of entries. Lastly, putting in place an effective program of public education will be critical to the success of our national conversation. Too often, governments are guilty of doing ‘too little, too late’ in their attempts to educate the public about complex referendum issues. The main source of voter information is usually the adversarial ‘Yes/No’ pamphlet, which typically contains few basic facts about the proposed reform and is posted to voters only a few weeks before polling day. Education must start early – if the government delays it until a firm proposal has been determined, it will be too late. It makes sense to start educating people from the beginning, even if that is years before the referendum. The Gillard government has an opportunity to learn from past failures and put in place the conditions for an inclusive, constructive public debate on constitutional reform. Of course, there would still be no guarantee that the referendum would end in success. But genuine community discussion will almost certainly improve the chances of a ‘yes’ vote, as people will be more comfortable about voting for change if they feel a sense of ownership over the process. And whatever the outcome, all Australians will {{be able to say that}} they cast an informed vote and made a real contribution on two issues of national importance. •Paul Kildea is a Research Fellow and Co-Director of the Referendums Project at the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law, UNS...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of EconomicsSteven P. CassouThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in asymmetric empirical macroeconomics. Making macroeconomic policies has become increasingly difficult because of intricate relationships among macroeconomic variables. In this dissertation, we apply state-of-the-art macroeconometric techniques to investigate asymmetric relationships between key macroeconomic aggregates. Our findings have important macroeconomic policy implications. An analogue to the Phillips curve shows {{a positive relationship between}} inflation and capacity utilization. Some recent empirical work has shown that this relationship has broken down when using data after the mid- 1980 s and several popular explanations for this changing relationship, including advancements in technology and globalization, were put forward as possible explanations. In the first essay, we empirically investigate this issue using several threshold error correction models. We find, in the long run, a 1 % increase in the rate of inflation leads to approximately a 0. 0046 % increase in capacity utilization. The asymmetric error correction structure shows that changes in capacity utilization show significant corrective measures only during booms while changes in inflation correct during both phases of the business cycle with the corrections being stronger during recessions. We also find that, in the short run, changes in the inflation rate do Granger cause capacity utilization while changes in capacity utilization do not Granger cause inflation. The Granger causality from inflation to capacity utilization can be interpreted as supporting recent calls made in the popular press by some economists that it may be desirable for the Federal Reserve Bank to try to induce some inflation in an effort to stimulate the economy. In the second essay, we examine the role of consumer confidence on economic activities like households’ consumption in good and bad economic times. We consider the “news” versus “animal spirit” approach interpretation of consumer confidence. In the wake of the Great Recession of 2008 - 09, many have called for confidence-boosting policies to help speed up the recovery. A recent study has reinforced these policy calls by showing that the Michigan Consumer Confidence Index contains important information about “news” on future productivity that has long-lasting effects on economic activities like aggregate consumption. Using US data, we show this conclusion is more nuanced when considering an economy that has different potential states. We investigate regime-switching models which use the National Bureau of Economic Research US business cycle expansion and contraction data to create an indicator series that distinguishes bad and good economic times and use this series to investigate impulse responses and variance decompositions. We show the connection between consumer confidence to some types of consumer purchases is important during good economic times but is relatively unimportant during bad economic times. We also use this type of model to investigate the connection between news and consumer confidence and this connection is also shown to be state dependent. In the context of the animal spirits versus news debate, our findings show that during economic expansions, consumer confidence shocks likely reflect news, while during economic contractions, consumer confidence shocks are consistent with animal spirits. These findings also have important implications for recent policy debates which consider whether confidence boosting policies, like raising inflation expectations on <b>big-ticket</b> <b>items</b> such as automobiles or business equipment, would lead to a faster recovery. The third essay investigates expectation shocks and their effect on the economy. For instance, this essay investigates whether the economy responds to expectation shocks in an importantly asymmetric way. A growing literature shows that agents' expectation about the future can lead to boom-bust cycles. These studies so far ignore the transmission effects of expectations on current economic activities across the policy regimes. Using the Survey of Professional Forecasters and Livingstone Survey data, this study empirically investigates the effects of expectation shocks on macroeconomic activities when policy regimes shift. Identifying a structural shock to expectations by using the timing of information in the forecast surveys and actual data releases, we show that the effects of agents' expectations about the future on current macroeconomic activities are asymmetric across the policy regimes. In particular, we find that a perception of good times ahead typically leads to a significant rise in current measures of economic activity in a hawkish regime relative to a dovish regime. We also find that monetary policy's reactions to agents' expectations are asymmetric across the policy regimes. Our findings do not support the views of critics of the central banks, who argued that keeping monetary policy too easy for too long is responsible for fueling the booms. Instead, our findings support the traditional view that a positive (negative) expectation about the future coincides with an anticipatory tightening (easing) of monetary policy...|$|E
40|$|From last Friday to Monday, {{sandwiched}} between official parliamentary sittings, {{a different type}} of parliament sat in Old Parliament House. The so-called Citizens’ Parliament convened to consider how our democracy could be improved. The message from the participants, randomly chosen from the electoral roll, was clear. Most of the citizen parliamentarians were deeply sceptical and often openly cynical about our parliamentary system and certain that it fails to connect sufficiently with its citizens. Particular disdain was felt for Australia’s political parties and their divisive approach to politics. This deeply shocked those former politicians present, including co-chair, former Liberal federal minister Fred Chaney. The Citizens’ Parliament was convened by a coalition of interested individuals and groups that included the new Democracy Foundation, the idea of Sydney architect Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, and researchers from three universities Australian National University, Sydney and Curtin supported by an Australian Research Council Linkage Grant. At a cost of $ 500, 000 plus a lot of volunteer time, this experiment brought together a representative from each federal electorate, 150 in all, to form a parliament. After earlier online discussions and one round of preparatory face-to-face regional meetings which generated 11 proposals, they gathered under the guidance of the co-chairs, Lowitja O’Donoghue and Chaney, as well as numerous professional facilitators. The 11 proposals quickly grew to nearly 50. The time available was double that allocated to the recent 2020 Summit, though still much too short. What occurred was an intense mix of small-group interaction, engagement with expert panelists, brain-storming and quiet reflection with the aim of creating proposals, refining and consolidating them, and ultimately setting priorities for action. The final outcomes focused on reducing duplication in government, making it more open and accessible and empowering all citizens, especially the young, to take part in it. Ultimately, however, the particular propositions that emerged are not as important as what the Citizens’ Parliament stands for and what it says about Australian democracy. The Citizens’ Parliament is part of a growing worldwide intellectual and activist movement that aims to reinvigorate the style of decision-making in representative democracy and in society at large. Different threads of the movement are associated with diverse and overlapping concepts including participatory democracy, citizens’ juries, town hall meetings, deliberative democracy, and e-democracy. For many decades now, business people, academics and activists, despairing about the inadequacies and shallowness of our parliamentary system, have been seeking new ways of involving citizens more directly in decision-making. They have, in many different ways, been seeking to eradicate adversarial politics, to build new deliberative mechanisms and to foster common ground. Some elements have already entered the existing Australian system, not transforming it but supplementing conventional ways of doing things. They have even fed into the fringes of the party system itself through the processes practiced by the Democrats and the Greens. Initiatives have included <b>big-ticket</b> <b>items</b> funded by both federal and state governments. In the 1990 s, the Government-funded Constitutional Centenary Foundation staged hundreds of local constitutional conventions to examine questions like the future of federalism at the local community level in the lead-up to the Centenary of Federation in 2001. Another strand has been deliberative polls, many run by Issues Deliberation Australia, made up of randomly-selected Australians brought together to discuss controversial questions such as the republic (just before the 1999 referendum), reconciliation and bills of rights. At state and local level there have also been experiments trying to bring together antagonistic interests around a table. Former Western Australian state minister Alannah McTiernan told the Citizens’ Parliament how the Western Australian state government tried to find common ground on a divisive question like the growing size of road trains by bringing together industry groups, environmentalists and other interested parties. Citizens have long been involved in various forms of consultation and enquiry processes by parliaments and governments. The Bill of Rights consultation chaired by Father Frank Brennan fits into this category. The important difference though is the lower level of structured on-going interaction as distinct from learning what individuals think on a single occasion. A parallel development has been what might be called elite citizens’ parliaments. These go back {{at least as far as}} the National Economic Summit called by Bob Hawke in 1983. Kevin Rudd’s 2020 Summit last year is in this tradition. They involve selected community and corporate leaders and professional and academic experts brought together for facilitated debate. These initiatives are very different but they share a common view that not all wisdom lies in Parliament and that official representative democracy needs a greater injection of citizen thinking. What does it all mean and will it ever change the way Australian democracy operates? Representative democracy needs help. It is losing legitimacy. Governments and parliaments need to change their processes and reach out more to their citizens. This conclusion attracts widespread sympathy, if not agreement, in different quarters. The practical difficulties in achieving this goal, however, remain enormous, though information technology helps by breaking down distances, costs and time constraints. There remains widespread ignorance in the community about all things political and constitutional. Much more community education is required to reverse that. It may even be an unrealistic goal. The bulk of the population may not be interested in more democratic involvement and are not touched by any of these developments. To touch them would require not just 150 representatives on one occasion, but at least one Citizens’ Parliament, repeated frequently, in each federal electorate. Even that would be just scraping the surface of what is necessary to reinvigorate our democracy. But the challenge is a more than worthy one.   [...] - John Warhurst is an adjunct professor of political science in the Faculty of Arts at the Australian National University.
