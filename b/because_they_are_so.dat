Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, cutting and roping. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, {{they are sometimes}} mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Naja nigricollis is {{currently}} expanding from the southeastern regions of Nigeria {{to the more}} desert and arid conditions in {{the central part of}} the nation. They also live in coastal scrubs and dry grasslands. Like other cobra species, they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent holes to hide or cool off. However, tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places. They are excellent tree climbers, thus can be arboreal at times. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> common across Africa, they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
60|$|Then why did God {{take such}} trouble for them? Why did God care for them, and help them, and work wonders for them? Why? Exactly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> bad. He that hath ears to hear let him hear, and {{understand}} by this example of all examples what manner of God our God <b>is.</b> Just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> bad, His goodness yearned over {{them all the}} more, and longed to make them good. Just <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> unclean and brutish His holiness longed all the more to cleanse them. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> stupid and ignorant, His wisdom longed to make them wise. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> miserable, His pity yearned over them, as a father over a child fallen into danger. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sick, <b>they</b> had all the more need of a physician. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lost, there {{was all the more}} reason for seeking and saving them. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> utterly weak, God desired all the more to put His strength into them, that His strength might be made perfect in weakness.|$|R

25|$|These {{differences}} {{could be}} explained by the collectivistic-individualistic culture continuum. In this case, these differences could reflect the extent of social networking typically seen in each culture. In an individualistic culture, this social networking is more diversified than in the collectivistic cultures, where family is generally the center of the network. Additionally, these differences could reflect the closeness of the interpersonal relationships in collectivistic cultures, where it can be difficult for individuals to recognize when the social sharing occurs <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> often together.|$|E

25|$|During sleep, {{a person}} is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a {{sleeping}} person {{to a person who}} is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus.

When {{a person is}} asleep, their senses are not acting as they do when they are awake and this results in them thinking like a person who is influenced by strong feelings.

500|$|Saturn is {{the most}} distant of the five planets easily {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus and {{occasionally}} 4 Vesta are {{visible to the naked eye}} in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light with an apparent magnitude of usually between +1 and 0. It takes approximately 29.5 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn's rings, in which clear resolution is present. [...] Twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view, due to the way in which they are angled and <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> thin.

500|$|Bronze {{objects such}} as pins, jewellery, and rivets have been found on the site, dating from the Middle Iron Age. As there was no local source of tin and copper ore, this {{demonstrates}} long distance trade, probably with the southwest. Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle, {{there is evidence of}} it being reworked. Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area, but the hill fort {{does not appear to have}} been a centre for iron production in this period; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire, Dorset, Hampshire, and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production. Early in the Iron Age, most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally– within about – however later on sources further afield became more important, and by the Late Iron Age 95% of the pottery came from the area around Poole Harbour over [...] away. This long-range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities. Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> closely related to agriculture and storage, Cunliffe and fellow-archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as [...] "town-like settlements", a form of proto-urbanism.|$|E
