Reicha proposed that second entries of fugue subjects in major keys could occur in keys other than the standard dominant), to widen the possibilities for modulations and undermine the conservative tonal stability of the fugue. The fugues of the collection not only illustrate this point, but also employ a variety of extremely convoluted technical tricks such as polyrhythm (no. 30), combined (nos. 24, 28), asymmetrical (no. 20) and simply uncommon (no. 10 is in 12/4, no. 12 in 2/8) meters and time signatures, {{some of which are}} derived from folk music, an approach that directly anticipates that of later composers such as Béla Bartók. No. 13 is a modal fugue played on white keys only, in which cadences are possible on all but the 7th degree of the scale without further alteration. Six fugues employ two subjects, one has three, and No. 15 six. In several of the fugues, Reicha established a link with the old tradition by using subjects by Haydn (no. 3), Bach (no. 5), Mozart (no. 7), Scarlatti (no. 9), Frescobaldi (no. 14) and Handel (no. 15). Many of the technical accomplishments are unique to fugue literature.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} tonality, [...] Tippett shifted his {{ground in the}} course of his career. His earlier works, up to The Midsummer Marriage, are key-centred, but {{thereafter}} he moved through <b>bitonality</b> into what the composer Charles Fussell has summarised as [...] "the freely-organized harmonic worlds" [...] of the Third Symphony and The Ice Break. Although Tippett flirted with the [...] "twelve-tone" [...] technique—he introduced a twelve-tone theme into the [...] "storm" [...] prelude that begins The Knot Garden—Bowen records that he generally rejected [...] serialism, as incompatible with his musical aims.|$|E
500|$|In The Firebird, Stravinsky {{had begun}} to {{experiment}} with <b>bitonality</b> (the use of two different keys simultaneously). He took this technique further in Petrushka, but reserved its full effect for The Rite where, as the analyst E.W. White explains, he [...] "pushed [...] to its logical conclusion". White also observes the music's complex metrical character, with combinations of duple and triple time in which a strong irregular beat is emphasised by powerful percussion. The music critic Alex Ross has described the irregular process whereby Stravinsky adapted and absorbed traditional Russian folk material into the score. He [...] "proceeded to pulverize them into motivic bits, pile them up in layers, and reassemble them in cubistic collages and montages".|$|E
500|$|The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a [...] "fantaisie lyrique" [...] to a {{libretto}} by Colette. She and Ravel {{had planned}} {{the story as}} a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto. It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole, and the jazz elements and <b>bitonality</b> {{of much of the}} work upset many Parisian opera-goers. Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds [...] "profoundly serious feeling {{at the heart of this}} vivid and entertaining work". The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, [...] "extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout".|$|E
500|$|Tristano's {{advanced}} {{grasp of}} harmony pushed his music beyond {{the complexities of}} the contemporary bebop movement: from his early recordings, he sought to develop the use of harmonies that were unusual for that period. His playing has been labeled [...] "cool jazz", but this fails to capture the range of his playing. Biographer Eunmi Shim summarized the changes in Tristano's playing during his career: The trio recordings of 1946 show a novel approach in the linear interaction between piano and guitar, resulting in counterpoint, polyrhythm, and superimposed harmonies. The sextet recordings of 1949 are notable for coherent ensemble playing and soloing, and the free group improvisations based on spontaneous group interactions and the contrapuntal principle. In the 1950s Tristano employed an advanced concept in jazz improvisation called side-slipping, or outside playing, which creates a form of temporary <b>bitonality</b> when chromatic harmony is superimposed over the standard harmonic progressions. Tristano intensified his use of counterpoint, polyrhythm, and chromaticism in the 1960s ...|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{characteristics}} that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, <b>bitonality</b> and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; [...] "He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part {{a product of the}} composer's poor health: [...] "the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance [...] "a spirit of practical comradeship... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible".|$|E
2500|$|Schickele {{began working}} on the {{character}} while studying at the Aspen Music Festival and School and at Juilliard, and has performed a variety of P. D. Q. Bach shows over the years. The Village Voice mentions the juxtaposition of collage, <b>bitonality,</b> musical satire, and orchestral surrealism in a [...] "bizarre melodic stream of consciousness". [...] "In P.D.Q. Bach he has single-handedly mapped a musical universe that everyone knew was there {{and no one else}} had the guts (not simply the bad taste) to explore." [...] As of 2012 he has decreased touring due to age. He performed two concerts to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his first concert at The Town Hall in New York on December 28 and 29, 2015, and continues to have live concert performances.|$|E

5000|$|Bartók's [...] "Playsong" [...] {{demonstrates}} easily perceivable <b>bitonality</b> through [...] "the {{harmonic motion}} of each key ... being relatively uncomplicated and very diatonic" [...] Here, the [...] "duality of key" [...] featured is A minor and C minor: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Morrison has {{provided}} a reactionary and sentimental score. Notwithstanding momentary bites of <b>bitonality,</b> an infusion of harmonic sevenths and patterns that trace whole-tones, it resides mostly in a space between Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes and Aaron Copland's The Tender Land." ...|$|E
5000|$|Compositionally, Stravinsky {{interprets the}} ragtime in a cubist way rather than imitate the style. [...] Stravinsky {{incorporates}} elements from his Russian period (ostinati, shifting accents, <b>bitonality)</b> with rhythmic and harmonic fragments from ragtime. The irregular meters give the piece an improvisatory character.|$|E
5000|$|Leeuw {{points to}} Beethoven's {{use of the}} clash between tonic and dominant, such as in his Third Symphony, as polyvalency rather than <b>bitonality,</b> with polyvalency being, [...] "the {{telescoping}} of diverse functions that should really occur in succession to one another" [...]|$|E
50|$|She is {{the author}} of highly cited {{academic}} work in music theory, specifically on <b>bitonality,</b> mode and interval in the music of Karol Szymanowski, the role of the piano introduction in Franz Schubert's Lieder, and the octave expansion and sonata form of Grażyna Bacewicz's Second Piano Sonata.|$|E
5000|$|From this, one can {{see that}} Bartók has {{partitioned}} the octatonic collection into two (symmetrical) four-note segments of the natural minor scales a tritone apart. Paul Wilson argues against viewing this as <b>bitonality</b> since [...] "the larger octatonic collection embraces and supports both supposed tonalities" [...]|$|E
5000|$|Polytonality (also polyharmony [...] ) is {{the musical}} use {{of more than}} one key simultaneously. <b>Bitonality</b> is the use of only two {{different}} keys at the same time. Polyvalence is the use {{of more than one}} harmonic function, from the same key, at the same time [...]|$|E
5000|$|Brucci’s {{style is}} {{basically}} conventional, but attempted to incorporate new ideas, such as <b>bitonality,</b> polytonality, and atonality.

50|$|Many {{facets of}} musical modernism were invented in the stylus fantasticus at Kroměříž, such as <b>bitonality</b> in Battalia, minimalism in The Peasants go to Church, stochasticism in Vejvanovsky's Bells. What {{is not always}} {{mentioned}} is that these techniques are used to represent chaos, drunkenness, stupidity, and animal noises {{rather than as a}} principal resource.|$|E
50|$|In {{measures}} 29 through 32… the melodic {{figure is}} centered on G-flat, accompanied by the ostinato built on C. Another example of emphasis of the tri-tone occurs in measures 44 through 46: the right hand pattern {{is based on a}} B seventh chord, while the left-hand ostinato pattern is based on F. These passages also hint at <b>bitonality.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Halcyon Days is {{the eighth}} studio album by American singer and pianist Bruce Hornsby. The album, {{recorded}} with his touring band the Noisemakers, {{was released in}} 2004. It was Hornsby's first release with Columbia Records. One song, [...] "What The Hell Happened", {{has been described as}} a rare example of the use of <b>bitonality</b> in a pop piece.|$|E
50|$|Liszt {{was also}} one of the first composers to {{experiment}} with <b>bitonality.</b> One example occurs in the funeral march he wrote for László Teleky in his Historische ungarische Bildnisse (Historical Hungarian Portraits). This march is based on a four note ostinato based on the gypsy scale. The question of whether this ostinato is in G minor or B minor, and the resulting tonal ambiguity, remains unresolved.|$|E
5000|$|The Gloria {{is based}} on a 7/8 ostinato derived from the incipit Gloria XV that would be intoned by the celebrant in some liturgical settings. The {{additive}} time signature allows for various patterns of word stress. The central [...] "Qui Tollis" [...] juxtaposes F major against the prevailing D / F-sharp <b>bitonality</b> and contrasts short phrases for solo voice with those for tutti unison.|$|E
5000|$|Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring {{is widely}} {{credited}} with popularizing <b>bitonality,</b> and contemporary {{writers such as}} Casella (1924) describe him as progenitor of the technique: [...] "the first work presenting polytonality in typical completeness—not merely {{in the guise of}} a more or less happy 'experiment', but responding throughout to the demands of expression—is beyond all question the grandiose Le Sacre du Printemps of Stravinsky (1913)" [...]|$|E
5000|$|Both {{the vocal}} melody and the accompaniment are in C major, but Ginastera [...] "adds dissonance and dislocates tones {{horizontally}} {{to lend a}} polytonal aura to the background, and in the instrumental interludes between vocal stanzas, there is a frank espousal of <b>bitonality,</b> similar to sections of the earlier Danzas Argentinas" [...] (Wallace, 86). As with [...] "Chacarera," [...] the words of [...] "Gato," [...] though not entirely nonsensical, are more significant for their rhythm than for their meaning.|$|E
50|$|Stravinsky {{composed}} the music {{during the winter}} of 1910-11 for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. It was premièred in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 June 1911 under conductor Pierre Monteux, with choreography by Michel Fokine and sets by Alexandre Benois. The title role was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky. The work is characterized by the so-called Petrushka chord (consisting of C major and F major triads played together), a <b>bitonality</b> device heralding the appearance of the main character.|$|E
50|$|Like other {{tracks for}} Pet Sounds, Wilson {{constructed}} the song's symphonic Wall of Sound arrangement {{using a variety}} of instruments not normally associated with popular music of its time, including accordions and a detuned twelve-string guitar. The music contains classical music devices that are unusual for a rock song, such as <b>bitonality</b> and ritardando. After recording the instrumental track, the Beach Boys overdubbed their voices to Wilson's exact specifications. Love was not originally listed as co-writer, and only received his credit after a 1990s court case.|$|E
5000|$|Bimodality is the {{simultaneous}} use of two distinct pitch collections. It is more general than <b>bitonality</b> since the [...] "scales" [...] involved {{need not be}} traditional scales; if diatonic collections are involved, their pitch centers need not be the familiar major and minor-scale tonics. One example is the opening (mm. 1-14) of Béla Bartók's [...] "Boating" [...] from Mikrokosmos (no. 125, vol. 5). Here, the right hand uses pitches of the pentatonic scale on E and the left hand uses those of the diatonic hexachord on C, perhaps suggesting G dorian or G mixolydian.|$|E
5000|$|In {{terms of}} tonality, Tippett shifted his {{ground in the}} course of his career. His earlier works, up to The Midsummer Marriage, are key-centred, but {{thereafter}} he moved through <b>bitonality</b> into what the composer Charles Fussell has summarised as [...] "the freely-organized harmonic worlds" [...] of the Third Symphony and The Ice Break.

5000|$|Busoni {{recognized}} the change: [...] "My entire personal vision I put down at last {{and for the}} first time in the Elegies" [...] and [...] "the Elegies signify a milestone in my development. Almost a transformation. Hence the title, 'nach der Wendung'." [...] Even the backward-looking pieces based on previously published works (the tarantella and neapolitan song from the Piano Concerto, and Frauengemach and Die Nächtlichen from the Turandot Suite) have been changed to reflect his new outlook. Tonality is weakened by the use of <b>bitonality.</b> Introductory measures, bridge passages, and transpositions have been added which incorporate this new style.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{the term}} tone {{paintings}} here describes the nature of a large portion of Debussy's work which was concerned with mood and colour, eschewing traditional tonality in favour of constructions such as the full-tonal scale, parallel chords, <b>bitonality,</b> and to a certain extent atonality, in order to achieve a greater degree of musical expression not allowed by strict adherence to a single key. Thus, the term tone painting is quite appropriate, in that Debussy's compositions often experimented with a much broader palette of tones, allowing each to behave similar to a colour within an illustration.|$|E
5000|$|In The Firebird, Stravinsky {{had begun}} to {{experiment}} with <b>bitonality</b> (the use of two different keys simultaneously).

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1890s, Novák began to explore {{influences}} beyond the prevailing Wagner/Brahms aesthetic of his contemporaries in Prague. Among these were folk influences from Moravia and Slovakia, which at that time were considered culturally backward in the cosmopolitan Czech capital. He also developed an interest in what would {{come to be called}} musical Impressionism, although in later life he denied any exposure to the music of Debussy at this time, claiming instead to have arrived at similar techniques on his own. These included forays into <b>bitonality</b> and non-functional, parallel harmony. Finally, after the Prague premiere of Salome in 1906, Novák formed an attachment to the music of Richard Strauss that would remain {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
50|$|The {{completion}} of Górecki's Fourth Symphony, subtitled 'Tansman Episodes', was delayed for many years, partly by Górecki's unease at his new-found fame. Indeed, {{it had not}} even been orchestrated {{when he died in}} 2010, and his son Mikołaj completed it after his death from the piano score and notes left behind by his father. It uses similar repetition techniques to the Second and Third Symphonies, but to very different effect; for example, the opening of the symphony consists of a series of very loud, repeated cells that together spell out the name of the composer Alexandre Tansman via a musical cryptogram, punctuated with heavy strokes on the bass drum and clashing <b>bitonality</b> between the chords of A and E flat.|$|E
5000|$|Holst's {{friend and}} fellow {{composer}} Ralph Vaughan Williams noted Holst's use of modal style in the opera. [...] John Warrack has commented on Holst's use of <b>bitonality</b> {{at the opening of}} the opera, representing the distinct yet subtly connected realms of Sāvitri and Death. [...] Donald Mitchell, in his highly critical comments on the opera, noted the influence of Richard Wagner in the vocal style, even as Holst had nominally renounced the epic scale of Wagner's operas in terms of size of musical forces. [...] Byron Adams has described the opera's characters as more [...] "archetypes" [...] than people. [...] By contrast, Andrew Clements has written highly of how well the opera combines 'Eastern' culture into a 'Western' music format.|$|E
