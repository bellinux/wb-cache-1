5000|$|Ironically, {{it is the}} Irish Draught's {{popularity}} as {{a foundation}} animal {{for the production of}} sport horses that has put the <b>breed</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> a second time. Many Irish Draught mares never produce a purebred replacement for the herd. Aggressive selection for show jumping characteristics has degraded the foundation stock, and inbreeding to a few popular performance bloodlines has further endangered the genetic diversity of the breed. The Irish Draught is considered an [...] "endangered maintained" [...] breed by the Food and Agriculture Committee of the United Nations. In 2009, the breed was upgraded to the [...] "Watch" [...] category on the American Livestock Breed Conservancy's Rare Breed Conservation Priority List. The Irish Draught Horse Society of Ireland, with support from the Royal Dublin Society and technical assistance from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, have spearheaded research into a breeding plan to improve genetic diversity, and to maintain the traditional breed traits that are the defining characteristics of the Irish Draught breed.|$|E

40|$|Enhancement of Sicilian {{autochthonous}} breeds {{and their}} typical dairy products. With regard of the valorization of local Sicilian dairy breeds, the authors focus on {{some aspects of}} management based on which to qualify their dairy products, and drive their enhancement and promotion in the market. It is noted the beneficial effects of feeding of local cows on pasture and of the traditional farming system on nutritional and health properties of Caciocavallo Palermitano cheese. It is shown, in organic farms and in conventional ones, the possibility to integrate the diet of grazing animals with concentrates based on locally produced grains, safer and less expensive than maize and soybean. It is proposed an out-of-season sheep farming model that, based on out-of-season lambing and nocturnal grazing for attenuating the effects of heat stress, permits to extend the production period in summer, and thus ensures the presence of dairy products on the market. In order to contribute in recovering the Girgentana goat <b>breed,</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of extinction, it highlights its adaptation to free-housing and to intensive grazing on forage crops, and the good cheese-making aptitude of milk from goats with genotype characterized by strong alleles of αs 1 -casein...|$|E
40|$|The Flat Coated Retriever is a <b>breed</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of {{development}} of histiocytic sarcoma (HS), but {{in contrast to}} the disseminated form of disease recognized in the Bernese Mountain Dog, most reports of HS in Flat Coated Retrievers describe a localized lesion affecting the musculature or fascia of limbs. The {{purpose of this study was}} to review data and material received though an ongoing Flat Coated Retriever tumor survey to better define the presentation of HS in the breed and to determine the utility of subclassification of tumors arising at different sites by histology and immunohistologic phenotyping. Data on 180 dogs bearing HS-like tumors were available for review, which showed that although the majority (101 lesions, 57 %) were primary limb lesions, 47 dogs (26 %) had visceral, mainly splenic lesions with no peripheral primary tumor. A detailed histologic and immuno-histologic review of 20 limb tumors and 20 splenic tumors showed that 2 distinct phenotypic subtypes could be identified: a histiocytic subtype, most prevalent in the splenic tumors, and a histiocytic–spindle–pleomorphic subtype, mainly seen in the limb tumors. Despite their variable morphology, all tumors expressed major histocompatibility complex class II and the leukocyte anti-gen CD 18, but only those tumors in the spleen consistently expressed CD 11 d. The majority of tumors also contained a mild to moderate infiltrate of T lymphocytes...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to measure the live performance of “coloured dwarf” rabbits available in the Italian market during both the growing and adult maintenance periods to provide new insights on this breed, with specific regard to the gender effect. A further objective was to identify the morphometric characteristics of the selected population and compare them to the standard breeding requirements. Body weight (BW) and body morphometric development were monitored in 145 “coloured dwarf” rabbits (80 males and 65 females) during 2 different periods: 7 - 21 wk of age (growth) and 28 - 45 wk of age (adultmaintenance). The animals were housed in individual cages and fed ad libitum with a commercial pelleted diet. Individual BW and feed consumption were measured twice a week to determine weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion index, whereas the health status was monitored daily. At 20 and 45 wk of age, the skin fold width and body measurements were taken on each rabbit at predefined anatomical points. The body measurements included: body length (BL), ear length (EL), head height (HH), shoulder width (SW), rump width (RW), forehead width (FHW), head width (HW), tibia width (TW), thoracic circumference (TC), abdominal circumference (AC) and 3 body indices: RW/BL, TC/BL, AC/BL. At 20 wk of age, the body weight of females (F) was heavier than that of males (M) (F: 1. 630 vs. M: 1. 542 g, P< 0. 001) and this significant difference was also maintained during the maintenance phase of the study (F: 1. 953 vs. M: 1. 850 g; P< 0. 001 at 45 wk). Interestingly, up to 20 wk of age average feed intake was higher and weight gain more rapid in F than M, whereas from 40 wk of age onwards the situation was reversed, as M registered a higher average feed intake (P< 0. 05). At 45 wk of age, the skin fold width was thicker in M than in F (M: 4. 28 vs. F: 3. 56 mm; P< 0. 001). All body measurements were affected by age and almost all of them also by gender, with the exception of BL, EL, FHW and TC/BL. Females presented higher AC and lower FHW than M at 45 wk (AC: 29. 5 vs. 27. 8 cm; P< 0. 01 and FHW: 4. 13 vs. 4. 25 cm; P< 0. 05). Males showed higher mean values than F for HW at both 20 and 45 wk of age (4. 64 vs. 4. 29 and 4. 34 vs. 4. 18 cm; P< 0. 01, respectively). Males also showed a lower RW/BL index at 20 wk (27. 8 vs. 29. 7; P< 0. 05). During the first 20 wk of age, 9 rabbits died from digestive problems, whereas 13 were culled for either digestive or respiratory problems and 5 for teeth problems. These findings showed a clear sexual dimorphism in live performance of the selected population of “coloured dwarf” rabbits, which may justify the use of diversified diets according to the gender. Moreover, adult BW and EL exceeded the Italian breed standards for “coloured dwarf” rabbits. Animals also showed a high degree of variability, suggesting that the use of uncontrolled selection and crossbreeding to satisfy the increasing demand for this breed in the market may place the standard <b>breed</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|There is {{increasing}} global {{concern about the}} potential long term consequences {{of the loss of}} domestic animal biodiversity. Of particular interest is the situation in Africa where on one hand, livestock make the greatest contribution to human livelihoods while on the other, genetic erosion has placed important indigenous <b>breeds</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of extinction. Economic valuation of these animal genetic resources (AnGR) would improve decision making regarding their conservation and sustainable utilisation. This paper investigates the valuation of indigenous cattle in Kenya, an example of a genetic resource <b>at</b> <b>risk.</b> Using data from a stated choice experiment survey conducted in Kenya’s pastoral livestock markets, a latent class, random utility approach is employed to characterise heterogeneity in valuations across and within various segments of buyers.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the preferences of}} farmers for cattle traits in southern Burkina Faso using Conjoint analysis, a survey-based system for measuring preferences for multiple-attribute goods. Here the technique {{is used in the}} context of a West African country where literacy is low, where cattle perform multiple functions, where low-input management is the norm, and where cattle are exposed to a number of tropical diseases and other environmental stresses. The results reflect the production practices of the region, suggesting that important traits in developing breed improvement programs should include disease resistance, fitness for traction and reproductive performance. Beef and milk production are less important traits. The study shows the potential usefulness of conjoint analysis for quantifying preferences in less developed countries for livestock and for the wide variety of other multiple-attribute goods.

Data of a total of 2, 543 canine uroliths analysed in the laboratory of the Budapest Urolith Centre were evaluated retrospectively from 2001 to 2012. Logistic regression was used to assess odds ratios for the proportion of each affected breed compared to those of crossbreeds. The annual incidence of urolithiasis was evaluated by the number of submissions compared to the estimated number of dogs in the population from which the samples originated. Epidemiologic data revealed a relatively high and increasing proportion of struvite urolithiasis. Statistical analysis of breed predispositions resulted in the detection of breeds not having been reported <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> (e. g.

A significant percentage (, 10 %) of the Fell ponies born each year dies from FIS, compromising the long-term survival of this breed. Moreover, the likely spread of FIS into other breeds is of major concern. Indeed, FIS was identified in the Dales pony, a related breed, {{during the course of}} this work. Using a stepwise approach comprising linkage and homozygosity mapping followed by haplotype analysis, we mapped the mutation using 14 FIS–affected, 17 obligate carriers, and 10 adults of unknown carrier status to a, 1 Mb region (29. 8 – 30. 8 Mb) on chromosome (ECA) 26. A subsequent genome-wide association study identified two SNPs on ECA 26 that showed genome-wide significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing: BIEC 2 - 692674 at 29. 804 Mb and BIEC 2 - 693138 at 32. 19 Mb. The associated region spanned 2. 6 Mb from, 29. 6 Mb to 32. 2 Mb on ECA 26.
