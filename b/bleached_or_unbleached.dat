50|$|Brown stock washers, using countercurrent flow, {{remove the}} spent cooking {{chemicals}} and degraded lignin and hemicellulose. The extracted liquid, known as black liquor in the kraft process, and red or brown liquor in the sulfite processes, is concentrated, burned and the sodium and sulphur compounds recycled {{in the recovery}} process. Lignosulphonates are a useful byproduct recovered from the spent liquor in the sulfite process. The clean pulp (stock) can be bleached in the <b>bleach</b> plant <b>or</b> left <b>unbleached,</b> depending on the end use. The stock is sprayed onto the pulp machine wire, water drains off, more water is removed by pressing the sheet of fibres, and the sheet is then dried. At this point the sheets of pulp are several millimetres thick and have a coarse surface: {{it is not yet}} paper. The dried pulp is cut, stacked, bailed and shipped to another facility for whatever further process is needed.|$|R

5000|$|The mundu (മുണ്ട്; {{pronounced}} [...] ) is {{a garment}} worn {{around the waist}} in Kerala, the Tulunadu region, and the Maldive Islands. It {{is closely related to}} the dhoti, sarong, and lungi. In South Kanara, a district of Karnataka state, the Tulu speaking folk and Beary community also wear the mundu. It is normally woven in cotton and coloured white or cream. The colour is dependent on whether the cotton is <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached.</b> A kaddar mundu is made using handlooms. When unbleached, the mundu is called [...] "neriyathu". In modern times, two types of mundu are prevalent - the single and the double. A single mundu is draped once around the waist, while the double is folded in half before draping. A mundu is usually starched before use.|$|E
50|$|A liquid {{packaging}} board {{might be}} up to five plies and is formed on a multi-ply paper machine with online coating. The most common is to use three plies with a basis weight of about 300 g/m2. The base or middle ply is normally made of pulp from <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached</b> chemical pulp, CTMP or broke (waste paper from a paper machine). CTMP gives more bulk and stiffness. The top ply (inside) is made of bleached chemical pulp. The barrier coating depend of the application and might be applied on both sides. When induction welding is employed an aluminum foil layer is used for barrier protection and for heating. The {{back side of the}} board is the printing side and might have an extra ply made from chemical pulp of quality that is suitable for the printing applications. Liquid packages are normally heat sealed.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{that control the}} natural rate of lipofuscin accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell and its stability over time are not well understood. Similarly, the contributions of retinoids, phospholipids and oxidation to the rate of accumulation of lipofuscin are uncertain. The experiments {{in this study were}} conducted to explore the individual contribution of rod outer segments (ROS) components to lipofuscin formation and its accumulation and stability over time. During the period of 14 days incubation of ROS, lipofuscin-like autofluorescence (LLAF) determined at two wavelengths (530 and 585 nm) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was measured from RPE cells. The autofluorescence increased in an exponential manner with a strong linear component between days 1 and 7. The magnitude of the increase was larger in cells incubated with 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE-ROS) compared with cells incubated with either <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached</b> ROS, but with a different spectral profile. A small (10 - 15 %) decrease in LLAF was observed after stopping the ROS feeding for 14 days. The phagocytosis rate of HNE-ROS was higher than that of either <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached</b> ROS during the first 24 h of supplementation. Among the different ROS components, the increase of LLAF was highest in cells incubated with all-trans-retinal. Surprisingly, incubation with 11 -cis-retinal and 9 -cis-retinal also resulted in strong LLAF increase, comparable to the increase induced by all-trans-retinal. Supplementation with liposomes containing phosphatidylethanolamine (22 : 6 -PE) and phosphatidylcholine (18 : 1 -PC) also increased LLAF, while incubation with opsin had little effect. Cells incubated with retinoids demonstrated strong dose-dependence in LLAF increase, and the magnitude of the increase was 2 - 3 times higher at 585 nm compared to 530 nm, while cells incubated with liposomes showed little dose-dependence and similar increase at both wavelengths. Very little difference in LLAF was noted between cells incubated with either unbleached or bleached ROS under any conditions. In summary, results from this study suggest that supplementation with various ROS components can lead to an increase in LLAF, although the autofluorescence generated by the different classes of components has distinct spectral profiles, where the autofluorescence induced by retinoids results in a spectral profile closest to the one observed from human lipofuscin. Future fluorescence characterization of LLAF in vitro would benefit from an analysis of multiple wavelengths to better match the spectral characteristics of lipofuscin in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{environmentally}} friendly concepts are emerging to replace chemical treatments of fabrics. In this work, a new {{process for the}} coloration of flax fabrics via enzymatic oxidation of natural flavonoids (morin, quercetin) has been developed. Laccase from Trametes hirsuta is able to react with flavonoids and polymerize them, resulting in a strongly colored polymeric solution which {{can be applied to}} the coloration of flax fabrics. Two methods were investigated: (i) the simultaneous enzymatic polymerization and coloration of fabrics and (ii) the polymerization of flavonoids with laccase, followed by a further coloration of the flax fabrics. Factors such as temperature, reaction time, presence of NaCl or the use of <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached</b> fabrics were evaluated in order to increase the color of the fabrics and the color fastness. The increase of temperature, the presence of salt and the use of unbleached fabrics allowed the final color to be improved. Colorized flax fabrics with oxidized quercetin solution showed a color fixation two times higher than the fabrics colorized with oxidized morin. Finally, the polymerization of flavonoids and their binding to fibers were verified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results confirmed this {{environmentally friendly}} process as useful for the coloration of flax fabrics. A similar technique could also be extended to the treatment of other types of fabrics in textile processes...|$|E
40|$|Textile Technology: The sun-blocking {{properties}} of a textile are enhanced when a dye, pigment, delustrant, or ultraviolet absorber finish is present that absorbs ultraviolet radiation and blocks its transmission through a fabric to the skin. For this reason, dyed fabrics provide better sun protection than bleached fabrics. Since naturally-colored cottons contain pigments that produce shades ranging from light green to tan and brown, it seemed reasonable to postulate {{that they would}} provide better sun protection than conventional bleached cotton, and that natural pigments might prove more durable to laundering and light exposure than dyes, {{but there is no}} published research on the ultraviolet transmission values for naturally-pigmented cottons. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the ultraviolet protection (UPF) values of naturally-pigmented cotton in three shades (green, tan, and brown), and the effect of light exposure and laundering on the sun-blocking {{properties of}} naturally-pigmented cotton. Naturally-pigmented cotton specimens were exposed to xenon light and accelerated laundering, ultraviolet transmission values measured, and UPF values calculated following light exposure and laundering. The naturally-pigmented cottons exhibited significantly higher UPF values than conventional cotton (<b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached).</b> Although xenon light exposure and laundering caused some fading, the UPF values of naturally-pigmented cotton continue to be sufficiently high so that all three shades continue to provide good sun protection after the equivalent of 5 home launderings and 80 American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists fading units (AFUs) of xenon light exposure...|$|E

40|$|Microspectrophotometry {{was used}} to study lateral {{diffusion}} of the visual pigment, porphyropsin, in the disk membrane in intact mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus) rod outer segments (ROS), isolated in frog Ringer's solution. A concentration gradient of unbleached visual pigment was produced on the disks by rapidly photobleaching 40 % of the pigment in an area spanning 1 / 4 or 1 / 2 of the cell's width. The change in optical density of the cells at 580 nm was then followed with time on either the <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached</b> side. The temperature dependence of porphyropsin diffusion yielded a Q 10 of 2. 5 between 10 and 20 degrees C with an activation energy of 12 +/- 2 kcal. At completion of pigment diffusion, the center and edge of the disk had, respectively, attained only 90 and 55 % of the concentration expected. Computed diffusion coefficients (5. 4 X 10 (- 9) cm 2 /s) were similar at the center and periphery of the disk immediately after the flash, however, an additional slow component for diffusion was detected at the periphery. A comparison of optical density at 525 nm along the diameter of ROS {{before and after the}} flash showed a persistent (20 min) postbleach concentration gradient of unbleached porphyropsin. This suggests that 15 % of the prophyropsins may be sequestered into distinct areas on a mudpuppy disk and are not free to diffuse over the whole surface. This argument is supported by the observation that mudpuppy disks are separated into petal -shaped regions by incisures, some of which penetrate nearly to the disk center...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} water content of fiber is presented. Tritiated water is added to a pulp/water suspension whereupon the tritium partitions between the bulk water and the pulp. Through this technique a fiber:water partition coefficient is developed, Kpw. This thesis will cover {{the development of the}} Kpw procedure and three different case studies. The first study involves comparing Kpw to traditional methods of fiber water content. The procedure provides a value of ten percent for the tightly bound water content of unrefined hardwood or softwood kraft fiber, either <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached.</b> If this water is assumed to cover the fiber surface as a monolayer, then an estimate of the wet surface area of fiber can be obtained. This estimate compares well to independent measurements of surface area. Kpw has also been found to be valuable in furthering the understanding of refining. Based on the study, it is proposed that refining occurs in three discrete stages. First, refining removes the primary cell wall and S 1 layer while beginning to swell the S 2 layer. Next, internal delamination occurs within the S 2 layer. Finally, fiber destruction occurs at high refining levels. By using Kpw, the three stages of refining are clearly recognized. Lastly, Kpw is used to study the effect of hornification on bleached softwood kraft fiber. The recycling effects at three refining levels were characterized by Kpw and followed closely the findings of the refining study. At low and high refining levels, the impact of recycling was minimal according to Kpw results, but at 400 mL csf the impact of recycling was much more pronounced. This could be attributed to the closing of internal delaminations within the fiber. Ph. D.

40|$|The SAPPI Ngodwana mill is {{the largest}} {{integrated}} pulp and paper mill in Africa and is situated in the Elands River catchment in the Mpumalanga province. A need has arisen at the mill to reduce effluent volumes requiring discharge. The combined mill effluent is currently irrigated onto pastures {{and over the years}} percolation of attenuated effluent has resulted in elevated chloride levels in the Elands River. Elevated chloride levels in the river have in turn impacted on the tobacco farmers downstream of the mill. Reclamation of Kraft Liner Board effluent was identified as a means of reducing the hydraulic load onto the irrigation pastures {{and at the same time}} reduce the intake of fresh water into the mill. Two possible uses for the reclaimed effluent, namely washing of <b>bleached</b> <b>or</b> <b>unbleached</b> pulp, were identified. The major reclaimed water quality variables of concern for re-use are; biodegradable organic material, colour and suspended solids. Approximately 9 months of pilot-scale activated sludge treatment of the effluent demonstrates that sufficient organic material can be removed for re-use, as wash water. Removal of the organic material was not influenced by sludge age in the range 2 to 8 days. A high degree of colour removal was achieved, which is contrary to reports in the literature. Even with the high colour removal achieved, however, insufficient colour was removed to allow washing of bleached pulp. Pulp and paper effluents are often reported to result in filamentous bulking activated sludges. This was confirmed in the testwork. Severe sludge settleability problems were experienced throughout the pilot-scale testwork. Filamentous bulking was identified as the cause of poor sludge settleability and preventative or control strategies would have to be implemented on full-scale.
