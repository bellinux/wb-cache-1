30|$|The {{materials}} {{used for this}} study were taken from exploration borehole EPS- 1 from the Soultz-sous-Forêts geothermal site (Fig.  1). Granite cores were sampled from three depths within the standard porphyritic granite (monzogranite) facies: 1420, 1558 and 1915  m. The sample collected from 1420  m depth is very close to the contact between the granite and sedimentary cover (at a depth of ~[*] 1400  m) and is therefore within the palaeo-weathered zone. The studied granites have essentially identical crystal sizes and distributions (Fig.  2) and almost identical mineral compositions. The primary iron-bearing minerals (biotite, magnetite and amphibole) are partly altered into iron-hydroxide or hematite in the palaeo-weathered horizon (Fig.  2 a), but are fresh in the deeper zones (Fig.  2 <b>b).</b> <b>Sampling</b> these two visibly different horizons was important to understand whether we should treat the granite from ~[*] 1400 to ~[*] 2200  m (the depth range for the structural data for the borehole) as one or two mechanically distinct layers.|$|E

This paper reports on an effort to assess the automated use of computational fluid dynamics level aerodynamics for the development of tables for flight dynamics analysis at the conceptual stage.

40|$|Protein {{structure}} prediction {{has remained}} a major challenge in structural biology {{for more than half}} a century. Accelerated and cost efficient sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to sequence new organisms and discover new protein sequences. Novel protein structure prediction technologies will allow researchers to study the structure of proteins and to determine their roles in the underlying biology processes and develop novel therapeutics. Difficulty of the problem stems from two folds: (a) describing the energy landscape that corresponds to the protein structure, commonly referred to as force field problem; and (<b>b)</b> <b>sampling</b> of the energy landscape, trying to find the lowest energy configuration that is hypothesized to be the native state of the structure in solution. The two problems are interweaved and they have to be solved simultaneously. This thesis is composed of three major contributions. In the first chapter we describe a novel high-resolution protein structure refinement algorithm called GRID. In the second chapter we present REMCGRID, an algorithm for generation of low energy decoy sets. In the third chapter, we present a machine learning approach to ranking decoys by incorporating coarse-grain features of protein structures. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Mercury {{contamination}} in fish {{is a serious}} public health concern that contrasts with other health benefits of eating fish. Like most US states, Illinois has monitored fish mercury contamination for deca-des to warn the public of mercury exposure risks by consuming fish. Has this monitoring program been effective in detecting public mercury exposure risks? I analyzed fish mercury contamination data from Illinois inland lakes (1974 – 1998;> 2, 300 samples, 18 fish species, 149 lakes) and found that: (a) sampling and analyses have been severely limited since 1985; (<b>b)</b> <b>sampling</b> effort varied widely among lakes and species, and (c) trends and spatial patterns were confused by this variability. As {{a result of a}} severely limited and nonstrategic monitoring pro-gram, public mercury exposure risks via Illinois fish consumption remain unclear, despite much effort over many years. Illinois monitors fewer fish per angler than many US states, but is not alone in this regard. Illinois should resurrect and redesign its fish contam-inant monitoring program to one that strategically and systematically assesses human mercury exposure risk. Other US states and nations may also benefit from similar retrospective examinations of monitoring programs intended to protect public health...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In Brazil, meiofauna studies {{began in}} the middle of last century, but they adopted a purely taxonomical approach, {{describing}} species from various zoological groups. After this first step, this benthic group was largely neglected {{until the end of the}} 20 th century when ecological studies began. We here provide a brief review of present knowledge of the meiofauna found on Brazilian sandy beaches to provide information for ReBentos (Coastal Benthic Habitats Monitoring Network). Our methodology consisted of a bibliographic survey undertaken using different datasets (Web of ScienceTM, SCOPUS, Google Scholar and Lattes Plataform). For the survey, we considered only those studies published till early 2015. Our analysis showed that the number of meiofauna studies has increased over the last two decades, though they are mainly still concentrated on the Southeast of Brazil. These studies aim to explain the distribution pattern of the meiofauna of the intertidal region of sandy beaches. Based on the results, we presented a discussion of three main topics, i. e., (a) current knowledge of Brazilian sandy beach meiofauna, (<b>b)</b> <b>sampling</b> strategies for monitoring of the meiofauna, and (c) use of the meiofauna as a tool to assess climate change.
