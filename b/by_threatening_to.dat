5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into {{surrendering}} <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> kill or torture them.

One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E

5|$|As a {{token of}} respect, {{prosecutor}} Klavier Gavin, Kristoph's brother and Apollo's rival, invites him and Trucy to attend a concert for his band, the Gavinners. During a guest performance by the diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in her dressing room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to squeeze a confession out of Daryan <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> have Machi testify.|$|E

He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> take away her daughter. However, Erin and a police officer Al Garcia (Armand Assante) begin to suspect the congressman's guilt in the murders, and Erin concocts a plan to bring the congressman to justice. She tricks him into confessing on tape, and he is soon after arrested. Thus, Erin regains full custody of Angela, quits stripping, and gets back her job in the FBI. Darrell returns to prison after he is convicted of his crimes.|$|E

Meanwhile, Commander T'Pol, having {{lost contact with}} the team, attempts to destroy the station, but the Klingon ship intervenes. Malik uses Phlox's friendship to finally coerce the security codes from Lucas (<b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> expose him to a pathogen as well). Soong, who had previously stolen 19 genetically enhanced and frozen embryos from C-12, is now able to access the remaining 1,800, a carry-over from the Eugenics Wars. Soong and the Augments then escape, but not before Malik kills Smike, helps himself {{to a number of}} pathogen samples, and sets the viral containment fields to fail.|$|E

The dispute was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as referee for the final three matches. Gil Evans had refereed the All Blacks versus England Test and was well respected by the New Zealanders.|$|E

5|$|Jaime Lannister and Bronn {{lead the}} Lannister army to Riverrun, where Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers attempt to coerce the Blackfish into {{surrendering}} the castle <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> execute Edmure Tully. The Blackfish calls their bluff {{and refuses to}} surrender. Disgusted with the Freys' incompetence, Jaime takes charge of the siege, orders Edmure to be bathed and fed, and attempts to parley with the Blackfish, warning him that the Lannisters will show no mercy to the Tullys {{if they do not}} surrender the castle.

One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery; so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> tell his father about {{his involvement in the}} mugging, and then does it anyway. Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.|$|E
5|$|The District of Columbia {{government}} responded <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> veto {{any further}} Metro subway construction unless {{construction of the}} Green Line was made Metro's highest priority. Twenty-four hours of intense discussions later, Metro agreed to the District government's wishes. Construction began on the Waterfront Station, and the station was largely complete by January 1981. Once complete, the station was used for storage. By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that the Green Line to Anacostia would open in July 1986. But in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints. Two months later, Metro estimated {{the cost of building}} the Green Line from U Street NW to Anacostia at $175 million.|$|E

Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts Dealbreakers down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt Universals soap opera, the Dealbreakers titles will be shown.|$|E

5|$|Wallenberg started {{sleeping}} in a different house each night, to guard against being captured or killed by Arrow Cross Party members or by Adolf Eichmann's men. Two days before the Soviet Army occupied Budapest, Wallenberg negotiated with Eichmann and with Major-General Gerhard Schmidthuber, the supreme commander of German forces in Hungary. Wallenberg bribed Arrow Cross Party member Pál Szalai to deliver a note in which Wallenberg persuaded the occupying Germans to prevent a Fascist plan {{to blow up the}} Budapest ghetto and kill an estimated 70,000 Jews. The note also persuaded the Germans to cancel a final effort to organize a death march of the remaining Jews in Budapest <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> have them prosecuted for war crimes once the war was over.|$|E
5|$|With {{crude oil}} as the country's primary export, Gaddafi sought to improve Libya's oil sector. In October 1969, he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair, benefiting foreign {{corporations}} {{more than the}} Libyan state, and <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> reduce production, in December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil. In 1970, other OPEC states followed suit, leading to a global increase {{in the price of}} crude oil. The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement, in which they secured income tax, back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought Libya an estimated $1 billion in additional revenues in its first year.|$|E

5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E

He jokes around and tells her to go to her room, leading to a bonding moment between the two. As he leaves the party, Michael brings Gabe into the joke <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> kill him if he breaks Erin's heart.|$|E
5|$|In July 1956, Nasser {{unilaterally}} nationalised the Suez Canal. The {{response of}} Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt {{that would give}} Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal. Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns was {{the possibility of a}} wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage <b>by</b> <b>threatening</b> <b>to</b> sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives, UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.|$|E
