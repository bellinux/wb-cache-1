5|$|The Eurasian Customs Union {{has already}} brought partial {{economic}} integration <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> states, and the Eurasian Economic Union {{is said to}} be a continuation of this customs union.

5|$|As various {{agreements}} were reached, {{activities in}} Luxembourg gradually shifted to Brussels and the Parliament, although bound {{to remain in}} Strasbourg, also started to work in Brussels while the courts remained in Luxembourg. The final agreement in 1992 set up the present arrangement, including {{the division of the}} Parliament's work <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> cities. In 2002, the European Council, having previously rotated between different cities, decided to base itself in Brussels.|$|E

Similar updates to the Sea and Army Cadet programs rationalize the connectivity <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> programs and more efficiently provides the training that is common to all three elements.|$|E

5|$|Edward Martyn was a {{neighbour}} of Lady Gregory, and it {{was during}} a visit to his home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats. Discussions <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> of them, over the following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's The Heather Field and Yeats's The Countess Cathleen.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium(III) oxide (Es2O3) was {{obtained}} by burning einsteinium(III) nitrate. It forms colorless cubic crystals, which were first characterized from microgram samples sized about 30 nanometers. Two other phases, monoclinic and hexagonal, are known for this oxide. The formation of a certain Es2O3 phase depends on the preparation technique and sample history, {{and there is no}} clear phase diagram. Interconversions <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> phases can occur spontaneously, as a result of self-irradiation or self-heating. The hexagonal phase is isotypic with lanthanum(III) oxide where the Es3+ ion is surrounded by a 6-coordinated group of O2− ions.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, James Patton, Maria da Silva, and Jay Malcolm {{reported}} on mammals {{collected at the}} Rio Juruá in western Brazil. In this report, they provided further information on the Oryzomys species reviewed by Musser and colleagues, including sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Their analysis reaffirmed that O.emmonsae was a distinct species {{and found that it}} was closest to O.macconnelli and O.russatus, differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome b sequence; O.nitidus was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%. The average sequence difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> O.emmonsae studied was 0.8%.|$|E
50|$|The {{sunbittern}} {{was formerly}} treated as two species (E. helias and E. major), {{but now they}} are treated as a single species with considerable variation <b>between</b> <b>the</b> subspecies. <b>The</b> <b>three</b> subspecies are recognised on the basis of plumage characters and size. <b>The</b> <b>three</b> subspecies are allopatric.|$|R

5|$|In 2006, Canterbury City Council began {{a public}} {{consultation}} {{to discuss the}} regeneration. A concern raised by the council is that the shopping centre is incoherent and fails to attract the tourists that come for the seafront. Other issues raised are the lack of holiday accommodation, car parks and clear pedestrian routes <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> main attractions in the town: the seafront, Memorial park and shopping centre. The council is considering relocating the sports centre from the pier {{and replacing it with}} other tourist attractions.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010 The Guardian {{published}} {{an open letter}} from several public figures asking the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to proceed with a prosecution or explain its position. In July that year Keir Starmer, director of the CPS, announced {{that there would be}} no prosecution because of the medical disagreement <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> pathologists. Starmer said there was enough evidence for an assault charge, but the six-month deadline for that had expired.|$|E
5|$|M.pithecoides {{from the}} central plateau was a {{specialized}} leaf-eater (folivore), but the other two species had a more mixed diet, eating fruits and seeds in addition to leaves.

5|$|Martin Lichtenstein {{described}} C. a. foetens, the Andean black vulture, in 1817, and Charles Lucien Bonaparte described C. a. brasiliensis, from Central and South America, in 1850 on {{the basis}} of smaller size and minor plumage differences. However it has been established that the change <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> subspecies is clinal (that is, there is no division between the subspecies), and hence they are no longer recognised.|$|E
5|$|Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> {{subspecies}}, {{and also}} within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally {{larger than the}} others, and within this form {{there is a tendency}} for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east.|$|E

5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E
5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown.
