40|$|In many neurons, trains {{of action}} {{potentials}} show frequency-dependent <b>broadening.</b> This <b>broadening</b> {{results from the}} voltage-dependent inactivation of K+ currents that contribute to action potential repolarisation. In different neuronal cell types these K+ currents {{have been shown to}} be either slowly inactivating delayed rectifier type currents or rapidly inactivating A-type voltage-gated K+ currents. Recent findings show that inactivation of a Ca 2 +-dependent K+ current, mediated by large conductance BK-type channels, also contributes to spike <b>broadening.</b> Here, using whole-cell recordings in acute slices, we examine spike <b>broadening</b> in lateral amygdala projection neurons. Spike <b>broadening</b> is frequency dependent and is reversed by brief hyperpolarisations. This <b>broadening</b> is reduced by blockade of voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and BK channels. In contrast, <b>broadening</b> is not blocked by high concentrations of 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) or alpha-dendrotoxin. We conclude that while inactivation of BK-type Ca 2 +-activated K+ channels contributes to spike <b>broadening</b> in lateral amygdala neurons, inactivation of another as yet unidentified outward current also plays a role...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{have solved}} the rate {{equations}} for InGaAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum-dot laser considering homogeneous and inhomogeneous <b>broadening</b> of optical gain numerically using fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. Dynamic-characteristics are analyzed; relaxation oscillation frequency, modulation bandwidth, and turn-on delay improve as injection current increases. With enhancing {{of the full}} width at half maximum (FWHM) of homogeneous <b>broadening,</b> threshold current and turn-on delay increase, because of elevating of central group density of states. Simulation results of static-characteristics show that slope-efficiency increases as the FWHM of homogeneous <b>broadening</b> heightens due to enhancing of central group carriers. Exceeding of the FWHM of homogeneous <b>broadening</b> from FWHM of inhomogeneous <b>broadening</b> results in degradation of slope-efficiency and static-characteristics because empty DOS increas. Nonlinearity appears in light-current characteristics at a special interval from ratio of FWHM of homogeneous <b>broadening</b> to FWHM of inhomogeneous <b>broadening.</b> Differential gain decreases as initial relaxation time and recombination times heighten. Consequently, relaxation oscillation frequency and modulation bandwidth decline...|$|R
