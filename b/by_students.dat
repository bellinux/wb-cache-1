5|$|Two former {{restaurants}} operated at the campus: the Conservatory Restaurant was led <b>by</b> <b>students</b> of the Farm-to-Table {{concentration in}} the CIA's bachelor's degree programs. The Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant (WSGR) was run <b>by</b> <b>students</b> in the associate degree program in culinary arts. The restaurant focused on using local and seasonal ingredients, and the dining room had open cooking stations to give diners a {{full view of the}} working kitchen. The WSGR initially served food of the Mediterranean cuisines, and was at first professionally run. Later on, it became fully student-run, however changes in late 2015 led to lunch service staffed <b>by</b> <b>students</b> and dinner service staffed by employees. The restaurants closed around 2016 with the campus' reorganization after purchasing Copia.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills. The school accommodates {{the needs of students}} with smaller class sizes, staff trained to handle autistic children, more visual teaching methods, more predictable environments and individual education plans for each student. Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To prepare students for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a design studio and a cafe staffed <b>by</b> <b>students.</b> The school also produces book compilations of thoughts written <b>by</b> <b>students,</b> conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made <b>by</b> <b>students,</b> to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism events such as the WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism care with about 560 delegates.|$|E
5|$|Annual {{events on}} campus {{celebrate}} Georgetown traditions, culture, alumni, sports, and politics. In late April, Georgetown University celebrates Georgetown Day.

5|$|Didsbury {{is served}} by several bus routes into Manchester city centre, The Trafford Centre, Northenden, and other destinations. Wilmslow Road {{provides}} Didsbury with a regular bus service due to the strong demand for travel <b>by</b> <b>students</b> along the corridor. The service is cheap and passengers rarely have to wait {{more than a couple}} of minutes. According to some analysts, Wilmslow Road is the busiest bus corridor in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Dogs {{have been}} {{associated}} with the school's sports teams on an unofficial basis since the late nineteenth century. Early dog mascots may have included a mutt called Hoya around 1900, a Borzoi named Richmond Jack in 1906, a bulldog named Hoya in 1907, and a Boston Bull Terrier in 1911. At that time, most mascots were primarily associated with the school's football team, and were cared for <b>by</b> <b>students</b> or individual sports teams, rather than the administration.|$|E
5|$|Each {{class is}} managed {{by one of}} eleven {{academic}} departments. Nine departments will be experienced <b>by</b> <b>students</b> {{before the end of}} their senior year, as one or more of their classes are mandatory for graduation. The other two departments are specialized courses; one involves the Culinary Arts, while the other involves a precollegiate form of ROTC. This system of Professional Learning Communities was designed by Illinois's former Adlai E. Stevenson High School principal, Richard Du Four.|$|E

In February 2010, Granderson represented MLB at a White House function announcing Let's Move!, a childhood anti-obesity effort sponsored by First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama.

5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally <b>by</b> <b>students</b> of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 4, the {{shooting}} of four students at Kent State protesting against the United States' invasion of Cambodia led directly to the student strike of 1970, a nationwide protest <b>by</b> <b>students</b> on college campuses against US involvement in Vietnam, including at Syracuse. Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E
5|$|Local tradition, first {{written down}} by John Leland in 1542, holds that Cadbury Castle was King Arthur's Camelot.
