The authors comprehensively survey {{the layout of the}} power network and also ISO 27001 international standards, and proposed a new <b>security</b> <b>baseline</b> reinforcement method for the power information system. By using the multi-class fuzzy comprehensive judgment model and the SSE-CMM method, the authors proved the reinforcement method is reliable in theory. This method combines ISO 27001 PDCA model with the <b>security</b> <b>baseline</b> testing process, and applies ITU-T X. 805 security architecture to the testing indicators extraction process, which makes the security evaluation process for the power information system quick and practical...|$|R

40|$|Information plays a vast {{contributing}} role to all resources {{within an}} organisation. Organisations should recognise {{the importance of}} information and implement information security controls to protect their information as this will ensure that the organisation‟s information retains its confidentiality, integrity and availability. Information security controls, which are the means of managing information risks, rely heavily on the user‟s knowledge {{regarding the use of}} these controls for their effectiveness, and as such, users should be educated in order to maximise effectiveness of these controls. Current information security educational programmes are created without necessarily taking into account the target audience, who comprises of all employees, stakeholders, suppliers, third parties, customers or other external parties or third party that requires access to the organisation‟s information. This results in programmes that are not linguistically appropriate; or that present knowledge at an inappropriate level for the target audience. This could leave users bored or confused, without successfully changing their behaviour or improving knowledge. This dissertation identifies a <b>baseline</b> for information <b>security</b> knowledge targeted at end users. This was done by means of a Delphi Study, where a profile of “generic” end users comprised of information security topics and concepts were rated by experts from the field of information security education. This resulted in the elimination of inappropriate topics and concepts and retaining the relevant and appropriate aspects. This <b>baseline</b> for information <b>security</b> knowledge can be characterised as a minimum standard that everybody should be educated on as an introductory or refresher course. This can also serve as the foundation phase to educate end users with knowledge of the basic topics and concepts to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities in order to protect information. If needed, topics and concepts could be added to the <b>baseline</b> for information <b>security</b> knowledge for specialised target audiences (e. g. specialised End Users, ICT Staff or Top Management) ...|$|R

50|$|Microsoft <b>Baseline</b> <b>Security</b> Analyzer (MBSA) is a {{software}} tool released by Microsoft to determine security state by assessing missing security updates and less-secure security settings within Microsoft Windows, Windows components such as Internet Explorer, IIS web server, and products Microsoft SQL Server, and Microsoft Office macro settings. Security updates {{are determined by}} the current version of MBSA using the Windows Update Agent present on Windows computers since Windows 2000 Service Pack 3. The less-secure settings, often called Vulnerability Assessment (VA) checks, are assessed based on a hard-coded set of registry and file checks. An example of a VA might be that permissions for one of the directories in the /www/root folder of IIS could be set at too low a level, allowing unwanted modification of files from outsiders.|$|E

40|$|Context: Security {{considerations}} are typically {{incorporated in the}} later stages of development as an afterthought. Security in software system is put {{under the category of}} non-functional requirements by the researchers. Understanding the security needs of a system requires considerable knowledge of assets, data security, integrity, confidentiality and availability of services. Counter measures against software attacks are also a security need of a software system. To incorporate security in the earliest stages, i. e. requirement gathering, helps building secure software systems from the start. For that purpose researchers have proposed different requirements elicitation techniques. These techniques are categorized into formal and informal techniques on the basis of finiteness and clarity in activities of the techniques. Objectives: Limitations of formal methods and lack of systematic approaches in informal elicitation techniques make it difficult to rely on a single technique for security requirements elicitation. Therefore we decided to utilize the strengths of formal and informal technique to mitigate their weaknesses by combining widely used formal and informal security requirements elicitation techniques. The basic idea of our research was to integrate an informal technique with a formal technique and propose a flexible framework with some level of formality in the steps. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review to see “which are the widely used security requirement elicitation techniques?” as a pre-study for our thesis? We searched online databases i. e. ISI, IEEE Xplore, ACM, Springer, Inspec and compendeX. We also conducted a literature review for different frameworks that are used in industry, for security requirement elicitation. We conducted an experiment after proposing a security requirements elicitation Framework and compared the result from the Framework with that of CLASP and Misuse cases. Results:Two types of analysis were conducted on results from the experiment: Vulnerability analysis and Requirements analysis with respect to a <b>security</b> <b>baseline.</b> Vulnerability analysis shows that the proposed framework mitigates more vulnerabilities than CLASP and Misuse Cases. Requirements analysis with respect to the <b>security</b> <b>baseline</b> shows that the proposed framework, unlike CLASP and Misuse cases, covers all the <b>security</b> <b>baseline</b> features. Conclusions:The framework we have proposed by combining CLASP, Misuse cases and Secure TROPOS contains the strengths of three security requirements elicitation techniques. To make the proposed framework even more effective, we also included the security requirements categorization by Bogale and Ahmed [11]. The framework is flexible and contains fifteen steps to elicit security requirements. In addition it also allows iterations to improve security in a syste...|$|R
