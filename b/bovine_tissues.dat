40|$|Prolonged {{consumption}} of Indigofera pasture plants can cause both hepatotoxicosis and reproductive losses in grazing animals with the responsible toxin indospicine forming persistent tissue residues. Separate accumulation and depletion feeding trials were undertaken in calves fed Indigofera spicata (3 mg indospicine/kg bodyweight) {{to ascertain the}} appearance and elimination of indospicine from various tissues. In the accumulation trial indospicine concentrations increased throughout the 42 -day feeding period with maximum levels of 15 mg/L in plasma and 19 and 33 mg/kg in liver and muscle, respectively. In the depletion trial, calves were fed I. spicata for 35 days, after which the plant was withdrawn from the diet.

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to develop a}} short-term culture system and {{to examine the effects}} of vitrification and short-term culture on the viability of fresh and vitrified <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue</b> and the follicles within. 	The first objective was to compare the health and development of preantral follicles in <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue,</b> as well as the neovascularization of these tissues, subjected to avian chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) culture with the traditional in vitro culture system. We hypothesized that the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo is a  more suitable culture system than traditional in vitro culture. Bovine ovaries were retrieved from a local abattoir and cortical pieces (1 - 2 mm 3) were randomly assigned to one of the following groups; control (fixed immediately), CAM or in in vitro culture. Ovarian tissue fragments from both groups were removed on D 1, D 3 and D 5 of culture, fixed, sectioned (5 μm) and stained with H&E. The numbers of healthy and degenerated follicles, primordial and activated preantral (primary and secondary), and the number of infiltrated bovine and avian blood vessels were determined using standard stereological procedures. All grafts placed on the traumatized CAM demonstrated increased neovascularization over time. The healthy primordial follicle density decreased over time concomitant with an increase in degenerated (primordial and activated preantral) follicles in both treatment groups. Healthy activated preantral follicle density did not differ between the two culture systems at a given time. In CAM group, blood vessel density increased over time (p = 0. 015). The second objective of this thesis was to develop a suitable vitrification protocol for <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue.</b> The viability of <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue</b> vitrified using two non-permeating cryoprotectants (sucrose and trehalose) and two cryodevices (cryotop and cryovial) was assessed. We hypothesized that during vitrification the higher cooling rate on the cryotop (open vitrification method) will yield better post-thaw viability of <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue</b> as compared to the cryovial (closed vitrification method). We also hypothesized that trehalose is a superior non-permeating cryoprotectant to sucrose for vitrification of <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue.</b> The ovarian tissue was fragmented (1 - 2 mm 3) and divided into 6 different treatment groups. Tissues were vitrified in TCM 199 supplemented with 15 % EG, 15 % DMSO, 20 % calf serum and 0. 5 M sucrose or trehalose then placed in a cryovial or on a cryotop. After warming, the vitrified tissues were either immediately placed in 10 % formalin (control) or on the chorioallantoic membrane of a 10 -day old chicken embryo for 5 days. Follicles from control and vitrified tissue were observed under a light microscope for normal morphology and the total, normal and degenerated follicle densities were determined by standard stereological procedures. Sucrose and trehalose did not differ, nor was a difference observed between the cryovial and the cryotop for total, healthy or degenerated follicle density. Proportion of healthy follicles was higher in the control than all treatment tissues grafted to the CAM. All grafts placed on the traumatized CAM demonstrated presence of avian erythrocytes in the blood vessels after 5 days, but no difference was observed for blood vessel density among treatments. Lastly, the cooling rate of <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue</b> subjected to open and closed system devices for vitrification was evaluated. A thermocouple wire was used to determine the cooling velocity of 1 - 2 mm 3 fragments of <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue</b> placed on a cryotop (open system) or in a sealed cryovial (closed system). The cooling rate of tissues on the cryotop and in the cryovial was 7481 ± 205. 9 ° C/min and 664 ± 26. 0 ° C/min respectively. In conclusion, the CAM supported the <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue,</b> thus the CAM culture system may be considered an acceptable alternative to traditional in vitro culture system for <b>bovine</b> ovarian <b>tissue.</b> Furthermore, angiogenesis may be an additional indication of ovarian tissue health. The hypotheses of our second study were refuted.

Methodology: A full length α-TTP cDNA was amplified from bovine liver by RT-PCR. Poly (A) + RNA obtained from <b>bovine</b> <b>tissues</b> was subjected to RT-PCR analysis to examine α-TTP mRNA expression. Western blot analysis was performed using polyclonal antibody raised against an oligopeptide derived from bovine α-TTP to examine α-TTP protein expression in various <b>bovine</b> <b>tissues.</b> The localization of α-TTP in bovine lung tissue was examined by immunostaining with anti-bovine α-TTP polyclonal antibody. Results: The open reading frame consists of 846 nucleotides encoding 282 amino acids with 98 % and 83 % identities to sheep and rat orthologs, respectively. Bovine α-TTP mRNA and protein were expressed most strongly in liver and lung, whereas expression of α-TTP mRNA and protein are reported to be very weak or absent in human and rodent lungs. In the lung, immunostaining suggested that α-TTP is expressed specifically in alveolar walls, which consists of alveolar cells, epithelial cells of small bronchi, and endothelial cells of pulmonary blood vessels.

Here, we identified two proviruses, designated bovine endogenous retrovirus K 1 (BERV-K 1) and BERV-K 2, containing full-length envelope (env) genes in the bovine genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that they belong to the genus Betaretrovirus. By reverse transcription (RT) -PCR, both BERV-K 1 and -K 2 env mRNAs were detected in the placenta and cultured bovine trophoblast cells. Real-time RT-PCR analysis using RNAs isolated from various <b>bovine</b> <b>tissues</b> revealed that BERV-K 1 env mRNA was preferentially expressed in the placenta. Moreover, we also found the expression of doubly spliced transcripts, named the REBK 1 and REBK 2 genes.

Recently, RGN has been identified as a target gene for sex steroid hormones in the prostate glands and testis of rats and humans, but no studies have focused on RGN expression in <b>bovine</b> <b>tissues.</b> Thus, in the present study, we examined RGN mRNA and protein expression in the different tissues and organs of veal calves and beef cattle. Moreover, we investigated whether RGN expression is controlled through sex steroid hormones in bovine target tissues, namely the bulbo-urethral and prostate glands and the testis. Sex steroid hormones are still illegally used in bovine husbandry to increase muscle mass. The screening of the regulation and function of anabolic sex steroids via modified gene expression levels in various tissues represents a new approach for the detection of illicit drug treatments. Herein, we used quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses to demonstrate RGN mRNA and protein expression in <b>bovine</b> <b>tissues.</b> In addition, estrogen administration down-regulated RGN gene expression in the accessory sex glands of veal calves and beef cattle, while androgen treatment reduced RGN gene expression only in the testis.

The beta gamma subunits were cross-linked to omega-aminobutyl agarose. Up to 7 nmol of alpha subunit could bind to each milliliter of beta gamma-agarose and be recovered by elution with AIF 4 -. This affinity resin effectively separated the alpha subunits of Gi 1 and Gi 2 from "contaminating" alpha subunits of Go, the most abundant G protein in bovine brain, {{by taking advantage of}} the apparent lower affinity of the alpha subunits of Go for beta gamma subunits.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for the determination of melengestrol acetate in <b>bovine</b> fat <b>tissue</b> at or less than the established tolerance level of 25 ppb. The procedure uses a combination of supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) techniques to produce an extract suitable for analysis with either high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Overall recovery of the analyte from <b>bovine</b> fat <b>tissue</b> is 99. 4 % with a coefficient of variation of 4. 14 %. The SFE-SPE procedure uses a total of 12 mL of organic solvent per fat tissue sample versus more than 1. 7 L consumed in current extraction procedures...|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate-pol-yacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cell-free translation, and elastin-specific antibodies {{were used}} to identify three tropoelastin isoforms secreted by <b>bovine</b> <b>tissue</b> and cells. Tropoelastin isolated from nuchal ligament and from conditioned culture medium or cell-matrix extracts of ligament fibroblasts and auricular chondro-cytes resolved as three distinct bands on sodium dode-cy 1 sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with molecular weights of approximately 67, 500 (tropoe-lastin I), 65, 000 (tropoelastin 11), and 62, 000 (tropoe-lastin 111). Three tropoelastin polypeptides with molec-ular mass 2 - 3 kDa higher than their corresponding tissue forms were also evident in cell-free translation products of ligamentum nuchae RNA, suggesting tha...|$|R
