5|$|Shortly {{after the}} project {{received}} the {{cease and desist}} letter, an alpha version of the patch was leaked on the internet. ZeaLitY expressed his disapproval and embarrassment on the Crimson Echoes website, noting that the alpha version was extremely buggy and lacked many of the improvements made in the <b>beta</b> <b>version.</b> In January 2011, a more complete <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> was leaked which could be played from beginning to end, {{believed to be the}} final build of the project prior to cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Sixteen {{months after}} the release of version 2.0, Microsoft skipped version 3.0 and {{released}} Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0. A public beta program started on 18 November 2011, when Microsoft sent out invitations to potential participants without announcing a version number. The first <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> was released on 29 November 2011, and the final build on 24 April 2012. Microsoft subsequently initiated a pre-release program that provides volunteers with the latest <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> and accepts feedback.|$|E
5|$|Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine {{successfully}} {{installed the}} <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, {{depending on the}} operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took {{more than an hour}} on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found.|$|E

5|$|Before Windows Server 2012 was finalized, two test builds {{were made}} public. A public <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> of Windows Server 2012 was {{released}} {{along with the}} Windows 8 Consumer Preview on February 29, 2012. The release candidate of Windows Server 2012 was released on May 31, 2012, along with the Windows 8 Release Preview.|$|E
5|$|The public <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> {{received}} several reviews, citing its low resource usage, straightforward user interface and price point.

5|$|Japanese website ITmedia {{reviewed}} the <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> in September 2004. The reviewer enjoyed the experience overall and found communication with other players easy, but {{found a few}} faults with the game that they hoped would be resolved later, and generally found the female characters less effective in battle. During its first day of operation, the game registered 200,000 users, making it the best-selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times. According to Ito, by 2006, the game was still highly popular in Japan.|$|E
5|$|By July 2011, Rohrer had {{submitted}} a <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> {{of the game}} for Nintendo approval. This was followed up with the master version in October. An issue raised during the approval process was Rohrer's desire to credit Bailey on the game's cover, which Nintendo rejected. He got around this by officially naming the game Jason Rohrer with Music by Tom Bailey: Diamond Trust of London. In May 2012, the game was ready for manufacturing. However, due to changing market conditions, Zoo Publishing was {{no longer able to}} afford the manufacturing of cartridges given the large minimum order of 6,000 units that Nintendo required, and so, Rohrer turned to the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter.|$|E
5|$|Xgrid's {{original}} concept can {{be traced}} back to Zilla.app, found in the OPENSTEP operating system, created by NeXT in the late 1980s. Zilla was the first distributed computing program released on an end-user operating system and which used the idle screen-saver motif, a design feature since found in widely used projects such as Seti@Home and Distributed.net. Zilla won the national Computerworld Smithsonian Award (Science Category) in 1991 for ease of use and good design. Apple acquired Zilla, along with the rest of NeXT, in 1997 and later used Zilla as inspiration for Xgrid. The first <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> of Xgrid was released in January 2004.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{successful}} North American {{release of the}} original Final Fantasy by Nintendo in 1990, Square Soft, Square's North American subsidiary, began work on an English language localization of Final Fantasy II, to be called Final Fantasy II: Dark Shadow Over Palakia. Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for Final Fantasy IV and Secret of Mana (known as Seiken Densetsu 2 in Japan). Although a <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, {{the age of the}} original Japanese game and the arrival of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES's successor console, led Square Soft to cancel work on the Final Fantasy II localization in favor of the recently released Final Fantasy IV (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled Final Fantasy II to reflect the jump in releases).|$|E
5|$|Nuka-Worlds {{release date}} of August 30, 2016 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One was {{announced}} in a post on the Bethesda Game Studios blog on August 15,. along with the expansion's trailer. Bethesda started releasing keys for the <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> on August 16 and pre-release gameplay was live streamed through Twitch.tv on August 23, with the official trailer coming out two days later. The expansion has a larger file size than Far Harbor, being 3.66 GB as opposed to 2.69 GB. This resulted in people wondering if Nuka-World would contain more gameplay, although the price implied it would be somewhere between Automatron and Far Harbor. The North American release of Nuka-World on PlayStation 4 was delayed due to unknown problems. Unlike the PS4 launch of Far Harbor, no major stability or frame-rate issues were found while playing, except when inside a location called The Galactic Zone. In the article on the website Push Square, {{it was noted that}} the cause of the frame-rate issues in The Galactic Zone were unknown and were not consistent.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Wipeout was first {{discussed}} during a pub conversation, when {{one member of}} Psygnosis' staff envisioned an idea of creating a futuristic racing game which featured anti-gravity ships. Some elements of the game were inspired by Matrix Marauders, an Amiga game released by the Liverpudlian studio in 1990. A <b>beta</b> <b>version</b> of Wipeout appeared in the cult film Hackers, in which the game was being played by the protagonists in a nightclub. The game's appearance in the film led to Sony purchasing the studio in the following months after its release. The Wipeout franchise has been well received by critics, with Wipeout 2097 in particular being listed as among the PlayStation's best games. Wipeout 2048 was the last game to be developed by Studio Liverpool prior to their closure in August 2012. The series was later revived, with Wipeout Omega Collection being released in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a <b>beta</b> <b>version,</b> the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E
