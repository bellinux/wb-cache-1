5|$|Puerto Rico {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} Great Depression of the 1930s, and many Puerto Ricans {{moved to the}} East Coast of the United States looking for jobs and {{a better way of}} life. On the island, the unemployment rate continued to rise and many Puerto Ricans who were unable to find a job looked to the Armed Forces of the United States as a source of employment. Not only were they paid better than at the few other available jobs, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> guaranteed three meals a day, clothing, and shelter.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Japanese {{performers}} had voiced {{their characters}} in the games, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress Sanae Kobayashi was not sure {{she would be able}} to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
5|$|The Marsh Tacky {{is known}} by owners for its stamina {{and ability to}} work in water and swamps without panicking. They tend to be sure-footed, sturdy, smart, and able to survive in {{challenging}} coastal environments, {{as well as being}} easy keepers. Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> used as working animals due to their abilities in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E

5|$|Things {{changed when}} Ivan Basso's team came {{forward on the}} third climb {{of the day to}} set a much faster pace in the peloton, and Basso himself {{attacked}} and came free, with only Stefano Garzelli holding his wheel. They caught some members of the morning breakaway, as that group also splintered, but were eventually themselves caught. Danilo Di Luca launched an attack on the fourth climb of the day, and for a time he and Menchov were clear of the other GC contenders, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> caught — the top seven in the GC were unchanged after this stage.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{were first}} {{documented}} in 1839 by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville when {{he described the}} Masoala fork-marked lemur (P.furcifer) as Lemur furcifer. The holotype {{is thought to be}} MNHN1834-136, a female specimen taken from Madagascar by French naturalist Justin Goudot. The source of this specimen is unknown, but thought to be Antongil Bay. In 1850, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire moved the fork-marked lemurs to the genus Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> commonly listed in the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs). In 1870, John Edward Gray assigned fork-marked lemurs to their own genus, Phaner, after initially including them and the mouse lemurs in the genus Lepilemur (sportive lemurs). Although French naturalist Alfred Grandidier accepted Gray's new genus (while also lumping the other cheirogaleids in Cheirogaleus and illustrating the cranial similarities between cheirogaleids and Lepilemur) in 1897, the genus Phaner was not widely accepted. In the early 1930s, Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others resurrected the name, citing characteristics that were intermediate between Cheirogaleus and Microcebus.|$|E
5|$|Skiklubben Ull {{was founded}} on 29 January 1883, and named after the Norse deity Ullr. In Norse mythology, Ullr was a god for hunting and competition, {{superior}} with his skis and his bow. SK Ull has been credited as being the second-oldest skiing club in the world, after Christiania SK. The club founders were a group of university students who socialized in apartments in Wessels gate. The young men usually conversed about their studies or played card games, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> hobby cross-country skiers, and decided to take up skiing in a more organized form by starting a club. The term describing a club member was ullaner.|$|E

25|$|The {{other major}} British {{effort in the}} early French Revolutionary Wars was mounted against the French {{possessions}} in the West Indies.

25|$|When {{her husband}} died in 1531 in Anet, Diane adopted the habit of wearing the colours of black and white, her {{personal}} trademark {{for the rest of}} her life. They were among the permitted colours of mourning, which, as a widow, she was required to wear, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> the symbolic colours of the bright and dark sides of the moon. They played on her name, Diane, which derived from Diana, the name of the Roman moon goddess.|$|E

25|$|The South Vietnamese {{crews and}} {{personnel}} {{on the island}} posed {{as members of a}} dissident northern communist group known as the Sacred Sword of the Patriot League (SSPL), which opposed the takeover of the Hanoi regime by politicians who supported the People's Republic of China (PRC). The kidnapped fishermen were well fed and treated, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> subtly interrogated and indoctrinated in the message of the SSPL. After a two-week stay, the fishermen were returned to northern waters.|$|E
25|$|By the 18th century, {{following}} developments by Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke, {{more easily}} portable models in boxes became available. These were extensively used by amateur artists while on their travels, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> employed by professionals, including Paul Sandby and Joshua Reynolds, whose camera (disguised as a book) {{is now in}} the Science Museum in London. Such cameras were later adapted by Joseph Nicephore Niepce, Louis Daguerre and William Fox Talbot for creating the first photographs.|$|E
25|$|For an {{extended}} period of time—prewar through the early 1950s—the Pontiac was a quiet, solid car, but not especially powerful. It came with a flathead straight eight. Straight 8s were slightly less expensive to produce than the increasingly popular V8s, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> heavier and longer. Additionally, the long crankshaft suffered from excessive flex, restricting straight 8s to a relatively low compression ratio with a modest redline. However, in this application, inexpensive (yet very quiet) flatheads were not a liability.|$|E

25|$|The 1990s were {{a time of}} {{financial}} constraint as the Alberta government made budgetary cutbacks. <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> {{a time in which}} the university benefited from philanthropic support. The $11-million Timms Centre for the Arts, which began construction in 1993, was made possible by a large donation from its namesake, Albert Timms. In 1998, Gladys Young's $3.5-million donation to the university undergraduate scholarship fund in memory of Roland Young, who graduated from the U of A in 1928, was the largest private donation for undergraduate scholarships in the university's history.|$|E
25|$|First in {{the assault}} was the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, led by Col. Nathaniel P. Richmond. They rode in great {{confusion}} after coming under heavy {{fire from the}} 1st Texas, but {{they were able to}} breach the wall. Hand-to-hand fighting with sabers, rifles and even rocks ensued, but the attack was forced back. Of the 400 Federal cavalrymen in the attack, there were 98 casualties. The second wave came from the 18th Pennsylvania, supported by companies of the 5th New York, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> turned back under heavy rifle fire, with 20 casualties.|$|E

25|$|The other {{strand of}} {{dramatic}} tradition was classical aesthetic theory. This theory was derived ultimately from Aristotle; in Renaissance England, however, the theory was better known through its Roman interpreters and practitioners. At the universities, plays were staged {{in a more}} academic form as Roman closet dramas. These plays, usually performed in Latin, adhered to classical ideas of unity and decorum, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> more static, valuing lengthy speeches over physical action. Shakespeare would have learned this theory at grammar school, where Plautus and especially Terence were key parts of the curriculum and were taught in editions with lengthy theoretical introductions.|$|E
25|$|Some Byzantines {{tried to}} repulse the cavalry charge <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> {{attacked}} by the infantry. Tsar Simeon personally {{took part in the}} fight, his white horse killed {{at the height of the}} battle. The Byzantines were completely routed. Leo Phocas was saved by fleeing to Mesembria (modern Nesebar) in Bulgaria, but in the thick of the battle Constantine Lips, John Grapson and many other commanders (archontes) were cut down along with an enormous number of soldiers and officers. By the end of the day the Bulgarians overwhelmed the defenders of Mesembria and captured the town. Leo Phocas barely escaped by boarding a ship.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Kings of the Picts were derived from a sept of the Eóganachta. If so, then the Eóganacht Locha Léin, and thus the ancestors of the O'Moriartys and others, are the most obvious candidates. Not only were they at one point expansive as the powerful Kingdom of Iarmuman, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>also</b> frustrated by their exclusion and forced isolation by the inner circle. Glaringly, they were said to descend from a Pictish woman, and this was sometimes given as the reason for their isolation. The inner circle exhibited peculiar attitudes {{from time to time and}} so this could have been the real story.|$|E
