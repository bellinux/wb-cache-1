The biocathode was prepared with peroxidase extracted from vegetal tissue of brazilian zucchini, Cucurbirta pepo, via four different methods.

This study examines the determining factors leading to green chemical patent applications in Japan from 1971 to 2010. The novel contribution of the present research is to clarify companies' research and development strategies using log mean Divisia index with a focus on two factors: corporate priority given to green chemical patent inventions and the scale effect of research and development activities. I focus on five green chemical technologies: (1) aqueous solvents, (2) selected white biotechnology, (3) totally chlorine-free bleaching, (4) biodegradable packaging, and (5) biochemical fuel cells. The first three technologies are mainly applied in production processes in manufacturing sectors. I describe two main findings. First, green chemical technologies applied in production processes have increased due to both the scale-up effect and increased research prioritization. This result implies that policies that encourage overall research activity promote the invention of green chemical technologies that can be utilized in production. Second, biodegradable packaging and biochemical fuel cells related to product design and renewable energy increased mainly as a result of increased research prioritization. Therefore, a specific research policy is more important than a policy intended to stimulate overall research activities in encouraging the invention of biodegradable packaging and <b>biochemical</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technologies...|$|E

40|$|Background: Soluble hydrogenases (SH) are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyse}} the oxidation of molecular hydrogen. The SH enzyme from Cupriavidus necator H 16 is relatively oxygen tolerant and makes an attractive target for potential application in <b>biochemical</b> hydrogen <b>fuel</b> <b>cells.</b> Expression of the enzyme can be mediated by derepression of the hox promoter system under heterotrophic conditions. However, the overall impact of hox derepression, from a transcriptomic perspective, {{has never been}} previously reported. Results: Derepression of hydrogenase gene expression upon fructose depletion was confirmed in replicate experiments. Using qRT-PCR, hoxF was 4. 6 -fold up-regulated, hypF 2 was up-regulated in the cells grown 2. 2 -fold and the regulatory gene hoxA was up-regulated by a mean factor of 4. 5. A full transcriptomic evaluation revealed a substantial shift in the global pattern of gene expression. In addition to up-regulation of genes associated with hydrogenase expression, significant changes were observed in genes associated with energy transduction, amino acid metabolism, transcription and translation (and regulation thereof), genes associated with cell stress, lipid and cell wall biogenesis and other functions, including cell motility. Conclusions: We report the first full transcriptome analysis of C. necator H 16 grown heterotrophically on fructose and glycerol in diauxic batch culture, which permits expression of soluble hydrogenase under heterotrophic conditions. The data presented deepens {{our understanding of the}} changes in global gene expression patterns that occur during the switch to growth on glycerol and suggests that energy deficit is a key driver for induction of hydrogenase expression in this organism...|$|R

40|$|The prime {{thrust of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{to advance the}} development of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> dioxygen reduction cathodes that employ some variant of multicopper oxidase enzymes as the catalyst. The low earth-abundance of platinum metal and its correspondingly high market cost has prompted a general search amongst chemists and materials scientists for reasonable alternatives to this metal for facilitating catalytic dioxygen reduction chemistry. The multicopper oxidases (MCOs), which constitute a class of enzyme that naturally catalyze the reaction O 2 + 4 H + + 4 e - → 2 H 2 O, provide a promising set of <b>biochemical</b> contenders for <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> cathode catalysts. In MCOs, a substrate reduces a copper atom at the type 1 site, where charge is then transferred to a trinuclear copper cluster consisting of a mononuclear type 2 or “normal copper” site and a binuclear type 3 copper site. Following the reduction of all four copper atoms in the enzyme, dioxygen is then reduced to water in two two-electron steps, upon binding to the trinuclear copper cluster. We identified an MCO, a laccase from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus strain HB 27, as a promising candidate for cathodic <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> catalysis. This protein demonstrates resilience at high temperatures, exhibiting no denaturing transition at temperatures high as 95 °C, conditions relevant to typical polymer electrolyte <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> operation. In Chapter I of this thesis, we discuss initial efforts to physically characterize the enzyme when operating as a heterogeneous cathode catalyst. Following this, in Chapter II we then outline {{the development of a}} model capable of describing the observed electrochemical behavior of this enzyme when operating on porous carbon electrodes. Developing a rigorous mathematical framework with which to describe this system had the potential to improve our understanding of MCO electrokinetics, while also providing a level of predictive power that might guide any future efforts to fabricate MCO cathodes with optimized electrochemical performance. In Chapter III we detail efforts to reduce electrode overpotentials through site-directed mutagenesis of the inner and outer-sphere ligands of the Cu sites in laccase, using electrochemical methods and electronic spectroscopy to try and understand the resultant behavior of our mutant constructs. Finally, in Chapter IV, we examine future work concerning the fabrication of enhanced MCO cathodes, exploring the possibility of new cathode materials and advanced enzyme deposition techniques. </p...|$|R
