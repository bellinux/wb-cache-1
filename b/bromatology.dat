Finished the degree, the academic title of Doctor of Pharmacy is issued. The graduate can then enroll in the regulatory institution for the Pharmacist profession in Portugal called, [...] "Portuguese Pharmaceutical Society" [...] or, in Portuguese, [...] "Ordem dos Farmacêuticos". After the enrollment, the title of Pharmacist is issued. Afterwards, Pharmacists can start their career in a limitless number of professional areas that range from community pharmacies, drug development, fundamental or applied research, biotechnology to areas such as forensic sciences, toxicology, regulatory affairs, clinical analysis, law enforcement (scientific police), <b>bromatology,</b> drug marketing, regulatory authorities, university teachers, etc. The Pharmacists can also choose to become a specialist in one of following areas of activity: Pharmaceutical Industry, Regulatory Affairs, Hospital Pharmacy, and Clinical Analysis. Each specialization requires an additional 5-year professional study program guided by a tutor in the respective area of knowledge. This training includes regular evaluations by the professional competent authority ("Ordem dos Farmacêuticos"), which also requires an exam {{at the end of the}} 5-year training. After the success at the exam, the Pharmacist then becomes a specialist in its area of expertise.|$|E

For constructing a complex corpus, I apply concepts of the three-body and the fractal dimension theories (POINCARÉ, 1908; MANDELBROT, 1975). First, I register an initial body of text by simply searching via the find key for abbreviations of <b>bromatology</b> and botany already recorded by the citation word in the Calepin. Then, I arbitrarily shorten the Spanish form corresponding to tasty and gather it through the whole dictionary. This way I obtain three bodies of interpretative meaning, lexias (BARTHES, 2002). Second, I establish the second and the third dimensional hypertextual relations between the gleaned words or sentences of text as well as their co-occurrences by using the comprehensive linguistics software, Tropes, a lexical and content analysis mixed tool, which brings up the qualitative and quantitative data pertinent to the research. Third, to bring back the colonial Maya voices of the Calepin, I surf the Internet and add to both written bodies of text a third text composed of beautiful colored images presenting food, drinks and tasty dishes that are still enjoyed by the Maya today and have been appreciated for almost five centuries.

40|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of marine biological pharmaceutical research, high-effective and low-toxic drugs and functional foods isolated from marine organisms have become a new field of pharmacy and <b>bromatology.</b> The pharmacological actions, such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, antitumor, immunological enhancement, and hepatorenal protection of C-phycocyanin (C-PC) from Spirulina platensis, have been reported, and C-PC has important value of development and utilization either as drug or as functional food. There are many researches about the various pharmacological actions and mechanisms of C-PC, but related reports are only to some extent integrated deeply and accurately enough, which put some limitations to the further application of C-PC in medicine. Particularly, with the improvement of living standards and attention to health issues, C-PC being a functional food is preferred by more and more people. C-PC is easy to get, safe, and nontoxic; thus, it has a great potential of research and development as a drug or functional food.

The lack of progress in treatment development, at least in part, {{reflects the fact that}} {{little is known about the}} pathophysiologic mechanisms that account for the development and persistence of eating disorders. The possibility that patients with eating disorders have a dysfunction of the central nervous system has been previously explored; several studies assessing the relationship between cognitive processing and certain eating behaviors have been conducted. These studies aim to achieve a better understanding of the pathophysiology of such diseases. The aim of this study was to review the current state of neuropsychological studies focused on eating disorders. This was done by means of a search process covering three relevant electronic databases, as well as an additional search on references included in the analyzed papers; we also mention other published reviews obtained by handsearching.

40|$|Ignacio Jáuregui-Lobera Department of Nutrition and <b>Bromatology,</b> Pablo de Olavide University, Seville, Spain Abstract: Micronutrient deficiencies, {{especially}} {{those related to}} iodine and iron, are linked to different cognitive impairments, {{as well as to}} potential long-term behavioral changes. Among the cognitive impairments caused by iron deficiency, those referring to attention span, intelligence, and sensory perception functions are mainly cited, as well as those associated with emotions and behavior, often directly related to the presence of iron deficiency anemia. In addition, iron deficiency without anemia may cause cognitive disturbances. At present, the prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is 2 %– 6 % among European children. Given the importance of iron deficiency relative to proper cognitive development and the alterations that can persist through adulthood {{as a result of this}} deficiency, the objective of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about this health problem. The relevance of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, the distinction between the cognitive consequences of iron deficiency and those affecting specifically cognitive development, and the debate about the utility of iron supplements are the most relevant and controversial topics. Despite there being methodological differences among studies, there is some evidence that iron supplementation improves cognitive functions. Nevertheless, this must be confirmed by means of adequate follow-up studies among different groups. Keywords: iron deficiency, anemia, cognitive functions, supplementatio...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the dominance, growth and <b>bromatology</b> of tough lovegrass or 'annoni' grass (Eragrostis plana) in secondary vegetation area. The evaluations were carried out at 23, 45, 64, 86, 111, 132, 153, and 174 days of growth after a mowing. The tough lovegrass was the dominant species on the area, accounting for 76 to 90 % of biomass. There was a linear increase for leaf (9. 8 kg DM ha- 1 day- 1) and total dry mass (16. 9 kg DM ha- 1 day- 1) of the tough lovegrass. During the 111 days of the vegetative stage, the biomass was composed only of leaves, and the flowering started at 132 days. At 174 days, the tough lovegrass accumulated about 4, 000 kg DM ha- 1, 650 kg DM ha- 1 of which was composed of inflorescences. The growth analysis revealed a specific leaf area of 72 cm 2 g- 1 and a maximum leaf area index of 2. 1. The leaf area ratio decreased from 72. 2 to 43. 9 cm 2 g- 1 between the 23 rd and 174 th days. The bromatological analysis showed a high content of neutral detergent fiber (85. 3 - 90. 4 %) and acid detergent fiber (39. 4 - 42. 8 %), as well as low crude protein content (3. 9 - 9. 9 %), indicating the low forage quality of the species...|$|E

Further objectives were to analyze different relationships with key dimensions of psychosocial functioning (ie, self-esteem, presence of psychopathological symptoms, eating and body image-related problems, and perceived stress) and to evaluate differences in body image quality of life due to gender. Patients and methods: The sample comprised 417 students without any psychiatric history, recruited from the Pablo de Olavide University and the University of Seville. There were 140 men (33. 57 %) and 277 women (66. 43 %), and the mean age was 21. 62 years (standard deviation = 5. 12). After obtaining informed consent from all participants, the following questionnaires were administered: BIQLI, Eating Disorder Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R). Results: The BIQLI-SP shows adequate psychometric properties, and it may be useful to determine the body image quality of life in different physical conditions. A more positive body image quality of life is associated with better self-esteem, better psychological wellbeing, and fewer eating-related dysfunctional attitudes, this being more evident among women. Conclusion: The BIQLI-SP may be useful to determine the body image quality of life in different contexts with regard to dermatology, cosmetic and reconstructive surgery, and endocrinology, among others.

We hypothesized that ED patients would show the worst body image quality of life. We also hypothesized that body image quality of life would have a stronger negative association with specific ED-related variables than with other psychological and psychopathological variables, mainly among ED patients. On the basis of previous studies, the influence of gender on the results was explored, too. Patients and methods: The final sample comprised 70 ED patients (mean age 22. 65 &plusmn; 7. 76 years; 59 women and 11 men); 106 were patients with other psychiatric disorders (mean age 28. 20 &plusmn; 6. 52; 67 women and 39 men), and 135 were university students (mean age 21. 57 &plusmn; 2. 58; 81 women and 54 men), with no psychiatric history. After having obtained informed consent, the following questionnaires were administered: Body Image Quality of Life Inventory-Spanish version (BIQLI-SP), Eating Disorders Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R). Results: The ED patients&# 39; ratings on the BIQLI-SP were the lowest and negatively scored (BIQLI-SP means: + 20. 18, + 5. 14, and &mdash; 6. 18, in the student group, the non-ED patient group, and the ED group, respectively). The effect of body image on quality of life was more negative in the ED group in all items of the BIQLI-SP. Body image quality of life was negatively associated with specific ED-related variables, more than with other psychological and psychopathological variables, but not especially among ED patients. Conclusion: Body image quality of life was affected not only by specific pathologies related to body image disturbances, but also by other psychopathological syndromes. Nevertheless, the greatest effect was related to ED, and seemed to be more negative among men. This finding is the opposite of that found in other groups studied previously.

Methods: The sample comprised 85 students (53 females and 32 males, mean age 17. 4 &plusmn; 5. 5 years) with no psychiatric history who were recruited from a high school in &Eacute;cija, Seville. Weight and height were recorded for all participants, who were then classified according to whether they perceived themselves as slightly overweight, very overweight, very underweight, slightly underweight, or about the right weight, using the question &ldquo;How do you think of yourself in terms of weight?&rdquo;. Finally, a series of questionnaires were administered, including the Irrational Food Beliefs Scale, Body Appreciation Scale, Self Esteem Scale, and General Health Questionnaire. Results: Overall, 23. 5 % of participants misperceived their weight. Taking into account only those with a normal BMI (percentile 5 &ndash; 85), there was a significant gender difference with respect to those who perceived themselves as overweight (slightly overweight and very overweight); 13. 9 % of females and 7. 9 % of males perceived themselves as overweight (&chi; 2 = 3. 957, P &lt; 0. 05). There was a significant difference for age, with participants who perceived their weight adequately being of mean age 16. 34 &plusmn; 3. 17 years and those who misperceived their weight being of mean age 18. 50 &plusmn; 4. 02 years (F = 3. 112, P &lt; 0. 05).

In the ecological management systems, the values associated with nitrate as NO 3 -N and phosphorus in the effluent water decreased and increased available oxygen. Regarding the microbiological analysis of soil found in most bacteria counts made for ecological systems being found significant difference (P = 0. 003) compared to the conventional system as well as many fungi although there was no statistical difference between the two systems. The botanical composition of grasslands showed highly significant difference (P = 0. 000) for the amount of grass being higher in organic farms than in conventional and the amount of weed (P = 0. 000) being higher on conventional farms. Forage production per year was higher in conventional farms, enabling higher carrying capacity on them but not significant difference between the systems. The development of silvopastoral systems in the ecological farms, allowed the incorporation of various species in the animal feed, and probably influenced the diversity of arthropods in the meadow, along with other practices that additionally favored an integrated pest management.

It was determined that the number of analyses conducted has been dropping, but the results have been improving. It was also confirmed that the pathogenic microorganisms that were present in the original foodstuffs were destroyed in the final products. In accordance with the results obtained and taking into account all regulations and legal acts, adopted in the period when the analyses checked were conducted, it can be concluded that the quality of the final products has improved significantly...|$|E

Jahrhunderts – das vollständigste und ausführlichste Lexikon, das über die Kultur der Konstrukteure der wunderbaren Maya-Städte Uxmal, Kalakmul und Chichén-Itzá verfasst wurde (ARZÁPALO 1995). Um einen komplexen Korpus zu schaffen, habe ich Konzepte der Drei-Körper-Theorie und der fraktalen Dimension genutzt (POINCARÉ 1908; MANDELBROT 1975). In einem ersten Schritt habe ich den Ausgangstext mittels einer einfachen Suche durchgearbeitet, um Abkürzungen für "Bromatologie" und "Botanik" zu finden. Danach habe ich die korrespondierenden spanischen Begriffe gekürzt und das gesamte Lexikon nach ihnen durchsucht. In einem zweiten Schritt habe ich die zwei- und dreidimensionalen hypertextuellen Beziehungen zwischen den ausfindig gemachten Worten und Sätzen und deren Kookkurrenzen mittels Tropes ermittelt, einer linguistischen Software, die lexikalische und inhaltsanalytische Tools verbindet und für {{qualitative}} und quantitative Analysen eingesetzt werden kann. Dann habe ich drittens im Internet nach Bildern gesucht und so einen dritten Text ("Körper") geschaffen, der Essen, Getränke und Geschirr zeigt, die noch heute (und seit mindestens fünf Jahrhunderten) von den Mayas geschätzt werden. Trotz der zuvor skizzierten Arbeit ist keiner der drei fraktal ineinander verschachtelten "Körper" vollständig. Die Studie der Beziehungen zwischen den "Körpern" kann aber unser Wissen über die komplexe Juxtaposition zwischen dem "Siglo de Oro", dem goldenen Zeitalter Spaniens und Maya-Sprache und -Kultur  auf der Yucatán-Halbinsel vertiefen. URN: [URL] In {{this essay}} on natural language I present a computer-supported study of words, sentences and hypertexts concerning <b>bromatology</b> (the study {{of food and}} drink) in a XVI century Maya-Spanish Calepin—the most complete and extended dictionary ever written on {{the culture of the}} constructors of the wonderful and prestigious Mayan cities of Uxmal, Kalakmul, Chichén-Itzá (ARZÁPALO, 1995). For constructing a complex corpu s, I apply concepts of the three-body and the fractal dimension theories (POINCARÉ, 1908; MANDELBROT, 1975). First, I register an initial body of text by simply searching via the find key for abbreviations of <b>bromatology</b> and botany a lready recorded by the citation word in the Calepin. Then, I arbitrarily shorten the Spanish form corresponding to tasty and gather it through the whole dictionary. This way I obtain three bodies of interpretative meaning, lexias (BARTHES, 2002). Second, I establish the second and the third dimensional hypertextual relations between the gleaned words or sentences of text as well as their co-occurrences by using the comprehensive linguistics software, Tropes, a lexical and content analysis mixed tool, which brings up the qualitative and quantitative data pertinent to the research. Third, to bring back the colonial Maya voices of the Calepin, I surf the Internet and add to both written bodies of text a third text composed of beautiful colored images presenting food, drinks and tasty dishes that are still enjoyed by the Maya today and have been appreciated for almost five centuries. Notwithstanding the above, neither one of the three bodies (corpora) nested fractally one inside the other is exhaustive. Nonetheless, the study of their interrelations could lead to the deepening of our knowledge on the complex juxtaposition between Siglo de Oro and Maya languages and cultures in the Yucatán Peninsula. URN: [URL] En este ensayo sobre lenguaje natural presento un estudio asistido por computadora de palabras, oraciones e hipertextos concernientes a la bromatología (estudio de la comida y las bebidas) en un Calepino Maya-Español del siglo XVI – el diccionario más completo y extenso escrito sobre la cultura de los constructores de las magníficas y prestigiosas ciudades Mayas de Uxmal, Kalakmul, Chichén-Itzá (ARZÁPALO 1995). Para construir un corpus complejo, aplico conceptos de las teorías de los tres-cuerpos y de la dimensión fractal (POINCARÉ 1908; MANDELBROT 1975). Primero, registro un cuerpo inicial de trabajo simplemente al encontrar vía la tecla buscar abreviaturas de bromatología y de botánica registradas junto a la entrada léxica en el Calepino. Luego, recorto arbitrariamente la forma española correspondiente a sabroso y la colecto a través de todo el diccionario. De este modo obtengo tres cuerpos de significado interpretativo, lexias (BARTHES 2002). Segundo, establezco las relaciones hipertextuales de segunda y tercera dimensión entre las palabras u oraciones de texto colectadas, así como sus co-ocurrencias empleando el software lingüístico comprehensivo, Tropes, una herramienta léxica y mixta de análisis de contenido, que despliega los datos cualitativos y cuantitativos pertinentes para la investigación. Tercero, para reavivar las voces coloniales mayas del Calepino, navego por Internet y añado a los dos cuerpos de texto escritos un tercer texto compuesto de bellas imágenes a colores que presentan alimentos, bebidas y sabrosos platillos que los mayas de hoy aún disfrutan y que han sido apreciadas durante casi cinco siglos. Pese a lo anterior, ninguno de los tres cuerpos (corpora) de trabajo anidados fractalmente uno en el otro es exhaustivo. Con todo, el estudio de sus interrelaciones podría llevarnos a profundizar en el conocimiento de la compleja yuxtaposición entre las lenguas y culturas del Siglo de Oro y Maya en la Península de Yucatán.
