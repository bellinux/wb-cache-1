5|$|The ship crosses an ice {{barrier and}} arrives in open sea, {{close to the}} South Pole, albeit with a mild climate. Here the Jane Guy comes upon a mysterious island called Tsalal, {{inhabited}} by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief named Too-Wit. The color white is alien to the island's inhabitants and unnerves them, <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> that color exists there. Even the natives' teeth are black. The island {{is also home to}} many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Even its water is different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.|$|E
25|$|While interned {{after the}} war by the British at CSDIC camp 11, Dornberger was {{recorded}} {{saying that he had}} begged the Führer to stop the V-weapon propaganda, <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> more could be expected from one ton of explosive. To this Hitler had replied that Dornberger might not expect more, but he (Hitler) certainly did.|$|E
25|$|Accounts {{of these}} visits written by Charles Dickens, Harriet Martineau, Lydia Sigourney and Caroline Gilman were {{published}} in magazines and travel books. Sigourney's Scenes in My Native Land (1845) included descriptions of her tour of Niagara Falls and other places of scenic interest with accounts of her visits to prisons and asylums. Many visited these institutions <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> like them had existed before. The buildings which housed them were themselves monumental, often placed on hilltops {{as a symbol of}} accomplishment.|$|E

25|$|Oriskanys post-service history also differs {{considerably}} {{from that of}} her sister ships. Decommissioned in 1976, she was sold for scrap in 1995, but was repossessed in 1997 <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> was being done. In 2004 {{it was decided to}} sink her as an artificial reef off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. After much environmental review and remediation to remove toxic substances, she was carefully sunk in May 2006, settling in an upright position at a depth accessible to recreational divers. As of 2008, Oriskany is the largest vessel ever sunk to make a reef.|$|E
25|$|Diver Down {{performed}} better. The band then {{earned a}} spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5million for a 90-minute set at the 1983 US Festival. Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. Billy Sheehan, after his band Talas completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie Van Halen to replace Michael Anthony. The reasons for this were never clear to Sheehan <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> came of it. During this time, Eddie and Alex Van Halen contributed the score and instrumental songs to the movie The Wild Life, starring Eric Stoltz. The score was heavy on the keyboards, similar to the sound used on the previous two albums and much more like the sound coming in their next album.|$|E
25|$|While the Hasbro case {{considered}} {{a special case}} of the applicability of rule of the shorter term {{in the context of}} the UCC, the case of Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc. (4 N.Y.3d 540, 2nd Cir. 2005) had the occasion to consider the matter under Berne Convention. In this case, Capitol Records claimed copyright on old British sound recordings from the 1930s, on which the copyright in the United Kingdom had expired in the late 1980s. Naxos Records, which also and in competition to Capitol distributed restored versions of these recordings, challenged this copyright claim. Sound recordings are a special case because pre-1972 sound recordings in the United States are not covered by federal law but by state law. The court concluded that since federal law did not apply, and <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> in the Berne Convention (which is inapplicable to sound recordings anyway) or the Rome Convention usurped the State of New York's law, the works were under copyright pursuant to New York common lawwhile the Uruguay Round Agreements Act and US statutes did not, and had never, offered protection to these works; the fact that they were not under copyright in the UK as of 1996 was completely irrelevant.|$|E

500|$|The {{beneficiaries}} of the Dismissal scarcely bothered to defend Kerr {{and in the end}} abandoned him. In the personal sense, Sir John Kerr himself became the real victim of the Dismissal, and history has accorded a brutal if poignant truth to Whitlam's declaration on the steps of Parliament House on 11 November 1975: [...] "Well may we say 'God Save the Queen'– <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> will save the Governor-General." ...|$|E

[...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone felt that [...] "The Quick and the Dead plays like a crazed compilation of highlights from famous westerns. Raimi finds the right look but misses the heartbeat. You leave the film dazed instead of dazzled, as if an expert marksman had drawn his gun only to shoot himself in the foot." ...|$|E

500|$|Once Vig {{learned about}} the analog project, at first he {{considered}} Grohl was joking, but then replied that [...] "You guys have to play really well, <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> is gonna be fixed" [...] since mistakes are not as easily correctable as in a digital recording. With that in mind, the band spent three weeks doing pre-production and rehearsals at Studio 606, where the composition was completed, going [...] "from forty songs to fourteen", and said songs were rehearsed to be recorded live, while in previous records, as put by Mendel, [...] "we'd often come up with parts in the studio, and the songs would evolve". Smear added that the band committed to not change what would end recorded: [...] "Whatever we did, we didn’t change it. If a distorted vocal went through a pedal, that’s what {{it was going to}} be.” ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine Seipp of National Review Online {{described}} it as a [...] "nasty but extremely funny" [...] cartoon. Caryn James of The New York Times called it a show with an [...] "outrageously satirical family" [...] that [...] "includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies". The Sydney Morning Herald named Family Guy the [...] "Show of the Week" [...] on April 21, 2009, hailing it a [...] "pop culture-heavy masterpiece". Frazier Moore from The Seattle Times called it an [...] "endless craving for humor about bodily emissions". He thought it was [...] "breathtakingly smart" [...] and said a [...] "blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal". He summarized it as [...] "rude, crude and deliciously wrong". The New Yorkers Nancy Franklin said that Family Guy is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity. The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after Saturday Night Live. IGN called Family Guy a great show, and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as Family Guy. Empire praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented {{that one of the reasons}} they love the show is <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> is sacred—it makes jokes and gags of almost everything. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic praised the series as [...] "a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do." [...] Family Guy has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed <b>because</b> <b>nothing</b> happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E
