5|$|Inside {{the truck}} Monk sees a broken Turkish figurine and remembers the vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> empty. He deduces that Teresa, while {{cleaning}} Merrigan's office, broke a figurine, which contained heroin. When Merrigan saw the broken figurine {{he realized that}} the vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> filled with heroin. When he found the drug on the vacuum bag, he killed Teresa. He spread the patient files and later he threw a rock at Dr. Kroger's house {{to make it look like}} the killer was one of Dr. Kroger's patients.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth <b>bag)</b> <b>was</b> rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> to have a cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with {{in order to give}} some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5000|$|Reusable {{shopping}} <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> increasingly used, e.g. in E.U. {{countries where}} use of single-use plastic shopping <b>bags</b> <b>is</b> in decline. Reusable <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> often made from jute cloth, {{also known as}} burlap in the U.S., but sometimes they are also made from plastic; however these reusable plastic <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> sturdier than single-use plastic shopping bags. In the U.S., reusable <b>bags</b> <b>are</b> used as a fashion statement or for advertising.|$|R

50|$|Many {{companies}} offer <b>bags</b> to <b>be</b> used for handling prelit trees. The <b>bag</b> can <b>be</b> strapped along a prelit tree. The tree branches are pulled upwards and the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> {{placed under the}} tree.

5|$|Logan and Mac {{continue}} to make progress on his business school report, but Mac has to call Max (Adam Rose) to continue. Desmond goes skinny dipping at his party, while Mac and Max flirt in front of Logan. Veronica discovers that Desmond’s <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> actually switched with another person’s. Veronica and Piz retrieve it, and on the car ride home, they briefly discuss their kiss at the party before playing a CD with some of Desmond’s unreleased newer material. Keith reconnects with Leo D’Amato (Max Greenfield), who presents a case involving the Fitzpatricks to him. They stake out where the Fitzpatricks are, and Keith sees Vinnie Van Lowe helping them. However, they quickly learn that Vinnie is actually investigating the case and has trapped them in the store. Veronica and Piz supposedly get stuck in traffic and tell Desmond to play some of his newer songs until they get there, but they actually are at the concert venue and just want him to expose the audience to his solo material.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
5|$|On December 15, the Mint shipped five kegs {{of the new}} coins, each holding 10,000 pieces, to Chicago. Each keg held five {{bags with}} a {{thousand}} coins each, though in one keg, one <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> intentionally short four coins, as also in that keg was a cigar box containing four envelopes, with coins number 1, 400, 1492, and 1892 {{from the first day}} of production. The kegs were taken to the Chicago Sub-Treasury, and on December 19 at 1:00pm conveyed to Room 404 of the Rand McNally Building, the exposition's headquarters. There, Harlow N. Higinbotham, president of the Exposition Company, took mallet and chisel in hand and opened the keg, removing the cigar box. Placing three of the envelopes in his pocket, he displayed the first coin to the assembled crowd, then exchanged it for a check—Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict (later the Remington Typewriter Company and makers of the official typewriter of the fair), was purchasing the first coin struck for $10,000 as a publicity stunt. That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum (today the Field Museum). The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $1 each, and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them, had ordered them by mail, or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations. No official packaging was provided; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks.|$|E

50|$|A rod {{connecting}} to the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> {{powered by a}} motor. This provides motion to remove caked-on particles. The speed and motion of the shaking depends {{on the design of}} the bag and composition of the particulate matter. Generally shaking is horizontal. The top of the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> closed and the bottom is open. When shaken, the dust collected {{on the inside of the}} <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> freed. During the cleaning process, no dirty gas flows through a bag while the <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> being cleaned. This redirection of air flow illustrates why baghouses must be compartmentalized.|$|R

25|$|There is {{considerable}} variation in physical {{appearance of the}} duda in Hungary, but {{the most common form}} has a chanter stock {{in the form of an}} animal’s head (usually that of a goat-like animal) and a cow horn bell on both the kontra and the drone. Historically the <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> often made from dog skin (leading to a popular song that stated that prospective bagpipers needed to “go to hell because that’s where the big dogs are from which good bagpipes can be made”), but today goat skin is a much more common material.|$|E
25|$|That evening, a Detective Superintendent Chambers {{accompanied}} Peter Jay and Professor David Bowen to Cranley Gardens, {{where the}} plastic bags {{were removed from}} the wardrobe and taken to Hornsey Mortuary. One <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> found to contain two dissected torsos, one of which had been vertically dissected, and a shopping bag containing various internal organs. The second bag contained a human skull almost completely devoid of flesh, a severed head, and a torso with arms attached but hands missing.

25|$|A {{terrorist}} attack was foiled on 18 April 1986 in {{what became known}} as the Hindawi Affair. A pregnant Irishwoman named Anne-Marie Murphy was about to board an El Al flight at London's Heathrow airport when her <b>bag</b> <b>was</b> found to contain three pounds of plastic explosives. These had been planted by her fiancé Nezar Hindawi, who was booked on a different flight. Hindawi was jailed for 45 years, the longest sentence (short of a life setence) ever delivered by a British court. There was evidence that Syrian officials were involved and as a result, Britain cut off diplomatic relations with Syria.|$|E
25|$|A tea <b>bag</b> <b>is</b> a small, porous paper, silk or nylon sealed bag {{containing}} {{tea leaves}} for brewing tea. Tea <b>bags</b> <b>were</b> invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1903.
