5|$|According to the Pakistani foreign ministry, the {{operation}} was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces. Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) {{officials said they were}} present at what they called a joint operation; President Asif Ali Zardari flatly denied this. Pakistan's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F-16s after they <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left.|$|E
5|$|During the Punic Wars, the Romans <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Castro region's rich {{deposits}} {{of gold and}} tin. Viriathus, leading Lusitanian troops, hindered {{the expansion of the}} Roman Republic north of the river Douro. His murder in 138 BC opened the way for the Roman legions. Over the following two years, Decimus Junius Brutus advanced into the Castro region from south of the Douro, crushed the Castro armies, and left Cividade de Terroso, in ruins.|$|E

5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants {{may or may not be}} able to recoup their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a constructive trust would be created when the recipient of the funds <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite {{the recovery of the}} captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E
5|$|A Russian immigrant, Silverman {{arrived in}} the United States before she was a year old. Her family settled in Providence, Rhode Island, where she {{completed}} her schooling, married and had four children. While doing relief work during the First World War, she <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depth of social problems {{and the effects of}} war on refugees. Joining the Zionist movement in the 1900s, within a decade she became a motivational speaker, advocating {{for the establishment of a}} permanent Jewish home in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Air force experts raised {{questions}} and the Malaysian opposition leveled criticisms {{about the state of}} Malaysia's air force and radar capabilities. Many criticized the failure of the Royal Malaysian Air Force to identify and respond to an unidentified aircraft (later determined to be Flight 370) flying through Malaysian airspace. The Malaysian military <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unidentified aircraft only after reviewing radar recordings several hours after the flight's disappearance. The failure to recognise and react to the unidentified aircraft was a security breach, and was also a missed opportunity to intercept Flight 370 and prevent the time-consuming and expensive search operation.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were {{to see him and}} his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to foods like Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E

After a lengthy trial in Minnesota District Court, Menage lost and was ordered to return the land to King along with all proceeds from {{the development of the}} land. Menage appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1886, however the lower court's decision was upheld.|$|E
5|$|In late May 2007, 20th Century Fox {{struck a}} deal with the Franklin Mint to promote the movie by {{altering}} 40,000 U.S. quarters and releasing them into circulation. All of the altered quarters were minted in 2005 and honor the state of California as part of the 50 State Quarters program created by the U.S. Mint. The altered quarters feature the Silver Surfer on the reverse along with a URL to the movie's official website. Once the U.S. Mint <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> promotion, it notified the studio and the Franklin Mint that it was breaking the law by turning government-issued currency into private advertising. The federal mint did not indicate whether a penalty would be effected.|$|E

Most of the horses at the rear were pulled up too, including Stay On Tracks, David's Duky, Direct, Mister Ed and the tailed-off Quirinus.|$|E

5|$|Major-General Suharto, {{the interim}} leader after Yani's death, <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{movement}} {{on the morning of}} 1 October. By evening he had convinced a G30S battalion in Merdeka Square and those occupying the RRI building to surrender, without any bloodshed. Army loyalists under Suharto retook Halim Air Force Base early the following morning. By that time the G30S leadership had escaped, while Sukarno had withdrawn to his palace in Bogor. In the years that followed, the Indonesian Army and general populace undertook a campaign of retribution, killing or capturing registered and suspected PKI members– including most of the G30S leadership.|$|E
5|$|Mihailović was {{the first}} to receive reports of contact between the Germans and Partisans, and passed them on to his British Special Operations Executive liaison officer, Colonel Bill Bailey. When Bailey's report arrived in London on 22 March, it was not taken seriously. Italian {{military}} intelligence also <b>became</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> talks. Tito himself mentioned the prisoner exchanges to the Comintern in Moscow, but when they realised more was being discussed and demanded an explanation, Tito was taken aback. He responded that he was not getting any external support, and needed to look after the interests of captured Partisans and refugees.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios.

Herodotus {{tells us that the}} Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
