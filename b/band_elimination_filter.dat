40|$|Abstract — Brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) is {{a system}} to translate humans thoughts into commands. For Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI, motor imagery is considered {{as one of the}} most effective ways. Different imagery activities can be classified based on the changes in µ and/or β rhythms and their spatial distributions. However, the change in these rhythmic patterns varies from one subject to another. This causes an unavoidable time-consuming fine-tuning process in building a BCI for every subject. To address this issue, we propose a new method called Sub-band Common Spatial Pattern (SBCSP) to solve the problem. First, we decompose the EEG signals into sub-bands using a filter bank. Subsequently, we apply a discriminative analysis to extract SBCSP features. The SBCSP features are then fed into Linear Discriminant Analyzers (LDA) to obtain scores which reflect the classification capability of each frequency band. Finally, the scores are fused to make decision. We evaluate two fusion methods: Recursive <b>Band</b> <b>Elimination</b> (RBE) and Meta-Classifier (MC). We assess our approaches on a standard database from BCI Competition III. We also compare our method with two other approaches that address the same issue. The results show that our method outperforms the other two approaches and achieves similar result as compared to the best one in the literature which was obtained by a time-consuming fine-tuning process.

Oxidation, however, can also induce damage to the tubes and destroy most of the sample. We conducted an in situ Raman spectroscopy study of the oxidation of double- and single-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNT and SWCNT) under isothermal and nonisothermal conditions to identify the temperature range in which the oxidation of amorphous carbon occurs without any changes with respect to the tubes and their structure. In situ Raman spectroscopy analysis of the oxidation of DWCNTs showed a decrease in the intensity of the D band starting around 370 °C, followed by complete D <b>band</b> <b>elimination</b> at 440 °C. Oxidation studies of SWCNTs showed a similar decrease in the D band intensity, but the D band was not completely eliminated. Furthermore, in situ measurements allow us to determine the different contributions to the D band feature and show the relationship between the D band, G band, and RBM Raman modes in the Raman spectra of DWCNT upon heating. Isothermal oxidation provides an efficient purification method for DWCNTs and SWCNTs, which is also selective to tube diameter.

40|$|Malware {{replicates}} {{itself and}} produces offspring {{with the same}} characteristics but different signatures by using code obfuscation techniques. Current generation anti-virus engines employ a signature-template type detection approach where malware can easily evade existing signatures in the database. This reduces the capability of current anti-virus engines in detecting malware. In this paper, we propose a stepwise binary logistic regression-based dimensionality reduction techniques for malware detection using application program interface (API) call statistics. Finding the most significant malware feature using traditional wrapper-based approaches takes an exponential complexity of the dimension (m) of the dataset with a brute-force search strategies and order of (m- 1) complexity with a backward <b>elimination</b> <b>filter</b> heuristics. The novelty of the proposed approach is that it finds the worst case computational complexity which is less than order of (m- 1). The proposed approach uses multi-linear regression and the p-value of each individual API feature for selection of the most uncorrelated and significant features {{in order to reduce}} the dimensionality of the large malware data and to ensure the absence of multi-collinearity. The stepwise logistic regression approach is then employed to test the significance of the individual malware feature based on their corresponding Wald statistic and to construct the binary decision the model. When the selected most significant APIs are used in a decision rule generation systems, this approach not only reduces the tree size but also improves classification performance. Exhaustive experiments on a large malware data set show that the proposed approach clearly exceeds the existing standard decision rule, support vector machine-based template approach with complete data and provides a better statistical fitness...|$|R
