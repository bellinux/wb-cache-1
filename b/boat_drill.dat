From this European staging area {{the members of the}} 20th embarked on [...] and departed for the United Kingdom on 20 August 1943. If the members of the 20th had expected a typical Queen Elizabeth pleasure cruise, they were sorely disappointed. The ship had been refitted to accommodate over 19,000 men. Staterooms designed for two or three people had 20 to 30 bunks double and triple stacked for officers and enlisted men. In addition to these conditions, enlisted personnel also served shifts of 24 hours on deck, followed by 24 hours below deck. This doubled the number of personnel the cramped quarters could accommodate. Due to her high speed, the ship traveled unescorted, despite the ever-present threat posed by German U-Boats. The five-day trip across the Atlantic was reported as uneventful, except for long chow lines (two meals per day) and frequent <b>boat</b> <b>drills.</b> HMS Queen Elizabeth dropped anchor on 25 August and the men of the 20th disembarked at the Firth of Clyde.

50|$|A muster drill, {{sometimes}} referred to as a lifeboat drill or a <b>boat</b> <b>drill,</b> is an exercise that is conducted by the crew of a ship prior to embarking on a voyage. A muster drill prepares passengers for safe evacuation, {{in the event of an}} emergency on board the ship, and familiarizes the crew and the passengers with escape routes. In a muster drill, the use of life vests and the escape routes from the ship are explained to the passengers.It is typically conducted approximately 30 minutes prior to the ship's scheduled departure time, and all guests must remain silent during the drill so that everyone will be able to hear the safety announcements from the captain. To alert that the drill is in progress, a general emergency alarm is sounded, and the captain then explains what the passengers need to do.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{specific}} {{issues have been}} highlighted {{with respect to the}} environmental impact of oil exploration in the area. Noise disturbance from seismic surveys may have negative effects on the marine mammal and fish populations. This can lead to detrimental effects on fisheries, including the crab fishery, the most lucrative fishery for the province of Newfoundland. A large area of exploration in the basin is in deep-water, where delicate deep-sea corals and chemosynthetic organisms may reside. The pulses from seismic surveys and airguns involved in the exploration process may alter swimming patterns of fish and interfere with the underwater communication of certain species of marine life. Diving sea birds may also be affected. High levels of noise from other related anthropogenic sources such as <b>boats</b> and <b>drilling</b> operations may mask the detection of weaker biologically important sounds of marine mammals.|$|R
