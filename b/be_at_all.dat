Command of the first division of gunboats was given to Captain Theodorus Bailey, who was also appointed second in overall command, to take over if Farragut himself were to become incapacitated. Command of the second division of gunboats was given to Captain Henry H. Bell. Farragut retained divisional command of the ships for himself.|$|E

25|$|In Section II, Kant {{starts from}} scratch and {{attempts}} to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the Groundwork by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves {{when it comes to}} evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, the German Army High Command (OKH) {{commissioned}} Krupp of Essen {{to design}} a gun to destroy the forts of the French Maginot Line that were nearing completion. The gun's shells had to punch through seven metres of reinforced concrete or one full metre of steel armour plate, from beyond the range of French artillery. Krupp engineer Erich Müller calculated that the task would require a weapon with a calibre of around 80cm, firing a projectile weighing 7 tonnes from a barrel 30 metres long. The weapon would have a weight of over 1000 tonnes. The size and weight meant that to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> movable it {{would need to be}} supported on twin sets of railway tracks. In common with smaller railway guns, the only barrel movement on the mount itself would be elevation, traverse being managed by moving the weapon along a curved section of {{what turned out to be}} a dual-track railway line. Krupp prepared plans for calibres of 70cm, 80cm, 85cm, and 1m.|$|E

With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing {{completion}} in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be [...] "very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore {{there will probably be}} no artistic merits in it." [...] He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that [...] "I shan't <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts."

500|$|According to Mathijs, {{critical}} reception {{is important}} to a film's perception as cult, through topicality and controversy. [...] Topicality, which can be regional (such as objection to government funding of the film) or critical (such as philosophical objections to the themes), enables attention and a contextual response. [...] Cultural topics make the film relevant {{and can lead to}} controversy, such as a moral panic, which provides opposition. [...] Cultural values transgressed in the film, such as sexual promiscuity, can be attacked by proxy, through attacks on the film. [...] These concerns can vary from culture to culture, and they need not <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> similar. [...] However, Mathijs says the film must invoke metacommentary for it to be more than simply culturally important. [...] While referencing previous arguments, critics may attack its choice of genre or its very right to exist. [...] Taking stances on these varied issues, critics assure their own relevance while helping to elevate the film to cult status. [...] Perceived racist and reductive remarks by critics can rally fans and raise the profile of cult films, an example of which would be Rex Reed's comments about Korean culture in his review of Oldboy (2003). [...] Critics can also polarize audiences and lead debates, such as how Joe Bob Briggs and Roger Ebert dueled over I Spit On Your Grave (1978). [...] Briggs would later contribute a commentary track to the DVD release in which he describes it as a feminist film. [...] Films which do not attract enough controversy may be ridiculed and rejected when suggested as cult films.|$|E
500|$|Watchmen {{features}} a story within {{a story in}} the form of Tales of the Black Freighter, a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three, five, eight, ten, and eleven. The fictional comic's story, [...] "Marooned", is read by a youth in New York City. Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of Watchmen experience superheroes in real life, [...] "they probably wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> interested in superhero comics." [...] Gibbons suggested a pirate theme, and Moore agreed in part because he is [...] "a big Bertolt Brecht fan": the Black Freighter alludes to the song [...] "Seeräuberjenny" [...] ("Pirate Jenny") from Brecht's Threepenny Opera. Moore theorized that since superheroes existed, and existed as [...] "objects of fear, loathing, and scorn, the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books, as we suggest. Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent—with EC riding the crest of the wave." [...] Moore felt [...] "the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of Watchmen". The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presentation in the story would add subtext and allegory. The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of Tales of the Black Freighter at the end of issue five credits real-life artist Joe Orlando as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the Watchmen universe that DC editor Julius Schwartz might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed {{as if it were a}} page from the fake title to the supplemental piece.|$|E
