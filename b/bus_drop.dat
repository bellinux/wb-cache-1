5000|$|A stop at Holyoke was {{originally}} planned to open with Northampton and Greenfield but later delayed. The city considered reactivating the former station building, but instead {{decided that a}} site at Dwight Street a block west provided {{a better place for}} a modern station design. The new Depot Square Railroad Station, which cost approximately $3.2 million, includes a 400 foot m-long high level platform, 170-foot-long canopy, and a waiting area and staircase facing Dwight Street. The station has a 25-space parking lot and loop for <b>bus</b> <b>drop</b> off and is fully handicapped accessible. The city first planned a one-car-length [...] "mini-high" [...] platform with a longer stretch of low platform, but changed to the longer high-level platform in 2014. The construction of the new station was funded by a $2 million MassWorks Infrastructure grant from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.|$|E

ABSTRACT/EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Diesel exhaust {{is a major}} source of combustion particles that contribute to poor air quality nationwide. Since almost all school buses are operated with diesel engines, diesel engine exhaust can thus also be a source of concern, specifically with regard to exposure to children. Diesel particulate matter (DPM) is a complex and unhealthy mixture of inorganic and organic carbon particles with adhered toxic substances and metals. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the causes of school bus self-pollution and to document in-cabin diesel particulate matter exposures in buses retrofit with a variety of available particulate matter emissions control combinations. 1 This is one of the first studies to report on the in-cabin benefits of retrofit technology. 2 To date, our testing has been conducted on school bus fleets in three U.

30|$|The {{discrimination}} {{between a}} fault and unbalanced loading {{can be performed}} by computing the negative sequence components of all the current phasors in all lines of the system. If the maximum magnitude of the negative sequence current phasor is greater than a threshold (τi), this indicates {{the presence of a}} fault. The value of τi is experimentally computed to be 0.3 p.u for the three-bus system considered for demonstrating the algorithm. If this condition is not satisfied, it indicates unbalanced loading in the system. (If there is a presence of unbalanced loading, it is indicated by the algorithm but is not considered as a fault). In case of a fault indication, the bus with the least value of positive sequence voltage phasor magnitude is termed as the faulted bus. In this paper, the faulted bus is one of the buses which is connected to the faulty branch. It is the bus which has the least value of positive sequence voltage phasor magnitude among all buses in the system. When a fault occurs in a transmission line system, the voltages at the buses connected to the faulted line drop, which leads to large currents flowing through the other phases, and even neighboring lines. Hence, this large voltage drop requires the circuit breakers to act quickly to remove the faulted line to restore the stability of the system. For no other transient events does the voltage of the <b>bus</b> <b>drop</b> very low permanently; else the entire system would become unstable. Once the faulted bus is identified according to our algorithm, the faulty branch is then identified.|$|E

Since the optimal solution necessarily produces footprints between 0 and 2, there is just one residual graph and the augmenting paths are all minimal cost flows. Thus, we can efficiently augment the minimal cost network flow that solves the model given by Eqs. (13) to (18) into the three minimal cost sub-itineraries corresponding to the pickup stage (the bus picks up the tourists), the PoI visiting stage (the bus brings the tourists to visit all the PoI) and the drop-off stage (the <b>bus</b> <b>drops</b> off the tourists at their destinations).|$|R

This paper investigates the influence of nonideal voltage measurements on the parameter estimation of permanentmagnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). The influence of nonideal voltage measurements, such as the dc <b>bus</b> voltage <b>drop,</b> zero shift in the amplifier, and voltage source inverter nonlinearities, on the estimation of different machine parameters is investigated by theoretical and experimental analysis. For analysis, a model-reference-adaptive-system-based estimator is first described for the parameter estimation of the q-axis inductance, stator winding resistance, and rotor flux linkage. The estimator is then applied to a prototype surface-mounted PMSM to investigate the influence of nonideal voltage measurement on the estimation of various machine parameter values. It shows that, at low speed, the inverter nonlinearity compensation has significant influence on both the rotor flux linkage and winding resistance estimations while, at high speed, it has significant influence only on the winding resistance estimation and has negligible influence on the rotor flux linkage estimation. In addition, the inverter nonlinearity compensation will not influence the q-axis inductance estimation when it is under id = 0 control. However, the dc <b>bus</b> voltage <b>drop</b> due to the load variation and zero shift in the amplifier will significantly influence the q-axis inductance estimation. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
