5|$|Pigs are {{not one of}} {{the main}} forms of {{livestock}} on Welsh farms though there are some specialised units. They used to be kept in small numbers on farms and by rural and urban cottagers. In the twentieth century, many miners in the South Wales valleys still kept a pig in a backyard sty, to be killed for production of fresh and salt pork, bacon, faggots and <b>black</b> <b>pudding.</b> In 2011 there were 25,600 pigs in Wales, less than half the number that were present a decade earlier.|$|E

The Scottish oatmeal used in Stornoway <b>Black</b> <b>Puddings</b> {{is responsible for}} its good, rough texture. Stornoway <b>Black</b> <b>Puddings</b> may be cooked in, {{or out of the}} skin, they maintain their shape well throughout the cooking process. Once cooked, they appear almost black and break apart very easily when cut, yet do not significantly crumble.

25|$|Iceland offers wide {{varieties}} of traditional cuisine. Þorramatur (food of the þorri) is the Icelandic national food. Nowadays þorramatur is mostly eaten during the ancient Nordic month of þorri, in January and February, {{as a tribute}} to old culture. Þorramatur consists of many different types of food. These are mostly offal dishes like pickled ram's testicles, putrefied shark, singed sheep heads, singed sheep head jam, <b>black</b> <b>pudding,</b> liver sausage (similar to Scottish haggis) and dried fish (often cod or haddock) with or without butter.|$|E
25|$|Much of Iceland's cuisine {{is based}} on fish, lamb, and dairy products, with little to no {{utilization}} of herbs or spices. Due to the island's climate, fruits and vegetables are not generally a component of traditional dishes, although the use of greenhouses has made them more common in contemporary food. Þorramatur is a selection of traditional cuisine consisting of many dishes, and is usually consumed around the month of Þorri, which begins on the first Friday after 19 January. Traditional dishes also include skyr, hákarl (cured shark), cured ram, singed sheep heads, and <b>black</b> <b>pudding,</b> Flatkaka (flat bread), dried fish and dark rye bread traditionally baked in the ground in geothermal areas. Puffin is considered a local delicacy that is often prepared through broiling.|$|E

500|$|The English cafe is a small, {{inexpensive}} eating place. A working men's cafe serves mainly fried or grilled food, such as fried eggs, bacon, bangers and mash‚ <b>black</b> <b>pudding,</b> {{bubble and}} squeak, burgers, sausages, mushrooms and chips. These may {{be accompanied by}} baked beans, cooked tomatoes, and fried bread. These {{are referred to as}} [...] "breakfast" [...] even if they are available all day. Traditional cafes have declined with the rise of fast-food chains, but remain numerous all over the UK.|$|E
500|$|For this reason, {{pork and}} white meat were {{more common than}} beef and thick fatty strips of salted bacon (or rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages. The {{practice}} of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike {{the practice of the}} Maasai) was common and <b>black</b> <b>pudding,</b> made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the [...] "breakfast roll".|$|E
500|$|Impressions of Northern English cuisine {{are still}} {{shaped by the}} working-class diet of the early twentieth century, which was heavy on offal, high in {{calories}} and often not particularly healthy. Dishes such as <b>black</b> <b>pudding,</b> tripe, mushy peas and meat pie remain stereotypical Northern English foods in the national imagination. As a result, there is a concerted effort among Northern chefs to improve the region's image. Some Northern dishes, such as Yorkshire pudding and Lancashire hotpot have spread across the UK, and only their names now hint at their origin. Among the Northern delicacies that have achieved Protected Geographical Status are traditional Cumberland sausage, traditional Grimsby smoked fish, Swaledale cheese, Yorkshire forced rhubarb and Yorkshire Wensleydale.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Budget briefcase {{was first}} used by William Ewart Gladstone in 1853 and continued in use until 1965 when James Callaghan was the first Chancellor to break with tradition when he used a newer box.
