5|$|The film's {{script was}} written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996 and <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> Bayona in 2004. Bayona asked his long-time friend, {{director}} Guillermo del Toro, to help produce the film and to double its budget and filming time. Bayona wanted the film to capture the feel of 1970s Spanish cinema; he cast Geraldine Chaplin and Belén Rueda, who were later praised for their roles in the film.|$|E
5|$|Composed of a torso, the Maxberg Specimen (S5) was {{discovered}} in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> professor Florian Heller in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although {{the rest of the}} skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it {{was discovered}} that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.|$|E

5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might be thinking and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> some senior American officials.|$|E
5|$|Edington's {{parents were}} Roger and Amice of Edington near Westbury, Wiltshire. Though {{it has been}} claimed that he was educated at Oxford, {{there seems to be}} no support for this. His first patron, however, was the Oxford {{chancellor}} Gilbert Middleton, who was also a royal counsellor. When Middleton died in 1331, Edington entered the service of Middleton's friend, Adam Orleton, Bishop of Winchester. Through Orleton, Edington's abilities were <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> King Edward III, and in 1341 the King named him keeper of the wardrobe. The position was an important one; the wardrobe functioned as the treasury while the King was on campaign, and Edward strongly resisted any attempts to limit this royal prerogative.|$|E

The commune of Bavay, the Bellignies quarry (SECAB) and a third owner sold her the property in 2003. The CPIE Bocage de l'Avesnois became the owner / operator of 85 percent of the site. The association implemented the first environmental resources management actions at the site and developed its first environmental management scheme In 2009, the association obtained the agreement establishing the regional nature reserve at the site {{for a period of}} 20 years.|$|E

5|$|Ralph and Vanellope build a kart, {{and they}} flee to Diet Cola Mountain, an {{unfinished}} race track. Learning that Vanellope cannot drive, Ralph helps teach her. King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers {{to him in}} exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches would be <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> players, their game would be unplugged and Vanellope would die, unable to leave the game {{because she is a}} glitch. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his own game, but notices Vanellope's image {{on the side of the}} Sugar Rush cabinet, and realizes she was meant to be a playable character.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the site was first <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> Professor Richard Daugherty in 1952 by a rancher named John McGregor. Excavations at the site were started by Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, a geologist, {{under the auspices of}} Washington State University (WSU)and the National Park Service in 1962, and continued until 1964. In 1965, Fryxell returned to the site along with Professor Carl Gustafson and students from WSU, and had Roland Marmes dig a trench in front of the rockshelter with his bulldozer, which turned up human and elk bones. Radiocarbon dating indicated that the human remains were about 10,000 years old. In 1968, Fryxell returned, this time with several WSU professors (including a visiting professor from Poland) and members of the United States Geological Survey, and found more human and animal remains, along with bone tools. April 29 of that year, Washington Senator Warren Magnuson made a public announcement of the finds.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{in one of}} Eorzea's {{three main}} states, the player {{character}} awakes to the Echo, a power granting them {{the ability to see}} the past. The Adventurers are initially involved in both conflicts within the nations provoked by the Garlean pretense, led by the Garlean Legatus Gaius Van Baelsar, and the Beastmen's attempts to summon their Primals and their consequent hoarding of crystal supplies. Eventually, a greater threat is <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the nations by the Sharlayan scholar Louisoix Leveilleur: another Garlean Legatus named Nael Van Darnus is using arcane magic and technology to summon Dalamud, the planet's second moon, down on Eorzea to purge the Beastmen and Primals. With the aid of Garlean defector Cid nan Garlond, the Adventurers discover that Nael has set up a beacon for summoning Dalamud in the new fortress of Castrum Novum. While each nation makes individual attempts to storm the fortress, they are repelled. Faced with this, their leaders form a pact and unite the nations under the banner of the Eorzean Alliance.|$|E

5|$|Neuroscientist and {{psychologist}} Pascal Wallisch {{states that}} while inherently ambiguous stimuli {{have been known}} to vision science for many years, this is the first such stimulus in the colour domain that was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> science by social media. He attributes differential perceptions to differences in illumination and fabric priors, but also notes that the stimulus is highly unusual insofar as the perception of most people does not switch. If it does, it does so only on very long time scales, which is highly unusual for bistable stimuli, so perceptual learning might be at play. In addition, he says that discussions of this stimulus are not frivolous, as the stimulus is both of interest to science and a paradigmatic case of how different people can sincerely see the world differently, an acknowledgement of which is a precondition for world peace. Daniel Hardiman-McCartney of the College of Optometrists stated that the picture was ambiguous, suggesting that the illusion was caused by a strong yellow light shining onto the dress, and human perception of the colours of the dress and light source by comparing them with other colours and objects in the picture. The philosopher Barry C. Smith compared the phenomenon with Ludwig Wittgenstein and the rabbit–duck illusion.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bulk}} of the French Navy {{confined}} to port, the British were able to strike directly at French colonies, although their reach was limited by the significant resources required in blockading the French coast and so the size and quality of operations varied widely. In 1804, Haiti fell to a nationalist uprising supported by the Royal Navy, and in 1806 British forces secured most of the northern coast of South America from its Dutch owners. In 1807 the Danish West Indies were invaded and in 1808 Spain changed sides and allied with Britain, while Cayenne fell to an improvised force under Captain James Lucas Yeo in January 1809. The damage done to the Martinique economy during this period was severe, as British frigates raided coastal towns and shipping, and merchant vessels were prevented from trading Martinique's produce with France or allied islands. Disaffection grew on the island, especially among the recently emancipated black majority, and during the summer of 1808 the island's governor, Vice-amiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, sent urgent messages back to France requesting supplies and reinforcements. Some of these messages were intercepted by British ships and the low morale on Martinique was <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>attention</b> <b>of</b> the Admiralty, who ordered their commander on the West Indian Station, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, to raise an expeditionary force from the ships and garrisons available to him and invade the island.|$|E
