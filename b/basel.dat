5|$|<b>Basel</b> had {{remained}} studiously neutral {{throughout the whole}} war. Although allied with some cantons of the Swiss Confederacy, it also had strong economic ties in the Alsace and further down along the Rhine. But {{the events of the}} war had strengthened the pro-confederate party in the city council, and the Swiss recognized the city's strategic position as a bridgehead on the Rhine (like Schaffhausen, too). On June 9, 1501, a delegation from <b>Basel</b> and the Swiss cantons' representatives signed the alliance contract, which the city council of <b>Basel</b> ratified on July 13, 1501.|$|E
5|$|Countries {{sought to}} improve the {{sustainability}} and transparency of the global financial system in response to crises in the 1980s and 1990s. The <b>Basel</b> Committee on Banking Supervision was formed in 1974 by the G-10 members' central bank governors to facilitate cooperation on the supervision and regulation of banking practices. It is headquartered at the Bank for International Settlements in <b>Basel,</b> Switzerland. The committee has held several rounds of deliberation known collectively as the <b>Basel</b> Accords. The first of these accords, known as <b>Basel</b> I, took place in 1988 and emphasized credit risk and the assessment of different asset classes. <b>Basel</b> I was motivated by concerns over whether large multinational banks were appropriately regulated, stemming from observations during the 1980s Latin American debt crisis. Following <b>Basel</b> I, the committee published recommendations on new capital requirements for banks, which the G-10 nations implemented four years later. In 1999, the G-10 established the Financial Stability Forum (reconstituted by the G-20 in 2009 as the Financial Stability Board) to facilitate cooperation among regulatory agencies and promote stability in the global financial system. The Forum was charged with developing and codifying twelve international standards and implementation thereof. The <b>Basel</b> II accord was set in 2004 and again emphasized capital requirements as a safeguard against systemic risk {{as well as the}} need for global consistency in banking regulations so as not to competitively disadvantage banks operating internationally. It was motivated by what were seen as inadequacies of the first accord such as insufficient public disclosure of banks' risk profiles and oversight by regulatory bodies. Members were slow to implement it, with major efforts by the European Union and United States taking place as late as 2007 and 2008. In 2010, the <b>Basel</b> Committee revised the capital requirements in a set of enhancements to <b>Basel</b> II known as <b>Basel</b> III, which centered on a leverage ratio requirement aimed at restricting excessive leveraging by banks. In addition to strengthening the ratio, <b>Basel</b> III modified the formulas used to weight risk and compute the capital thresholds necessary to mitigate the risks of bank holdings, concluding the capital threshold should be set at 7% of the value of a bank's risk-weighted assets.|$|E

5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates <b>Basel,</b> a giant air purification module controlled by the Zenith System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding <b>Basel,</b> the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While <b>Basel</b> and the Zenith System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. <b>Basel</b> evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying the Zenith System.|$|E

5|$|Burgmeier's first {{role with}} <b>Basel</b> {{was to play}} in the Uhrencup as they {{defeated}} German-side FC Köln 2–1, to share the trophy with Zürich. <b>Basel</b> had finished the previous season as runners-up in the league to Zürich on goal difference and so qualified for the following season's UEFA Cup. Burgmeier made his <b>Basel</b> debut in the competition as they defeated Kazakhstan's Tobol 3–1 on 13 July, before he was replaced by Scott Chipperfield. The second leg ended in a draw, sending <b>Basel</b> through. The second qualifying round draw gave Burgmeier a chance to return to Vaduz. He was a substitute in both games as his new team won on away goals. They went on to qualify for the group stages, in which they finished bottom of their division, with two points from four games. Burgmeier scored his first goal for his new club in a 4–2 away defeat against Sion, but again the side only ranked in the Championship behind Zürich, this time by one point. Their disappointment was offset by an extra time victory over Luzern in the final of the Swiss Cup.|$|E
