Lean steer handcycles can work well for lower-level injuries; although, some athletes with high-level disability use them as well.

Glazed details draw attention to the regular friezes, pinnacles, traceries {{on the one hand and}} the geometric pattern thread embedded in the wall on the other hand.The richness of ceramics detail, wrought iron decorative elements are also remarkable.|$|R
