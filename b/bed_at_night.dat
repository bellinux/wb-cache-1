5|$|The Mounties {{convince}} Kripik {{to come to}} {{the post}} to answer questions, and Kripik agrees. Several months pass. Hunt and Balk give Kripik the freedom of the post, and Hunt learns about the horrors the white traders visited on the Eskimo. When the Eskimo village moves on to new hunting rounds, Kripik's family stays behind to wait for him. They begin to starve, and Kripik learns of their plight. However, the rigid and rule-bound Inspector White has arrived at the RCMP outpost, and he demands that Kripik not only no longer be allowed to hunt during the day but also be chained down in his <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> Hunt tries to dissuade White, but White insists — and Hunt is forced to break his word that Kripik will not be chained.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{societies}} {{were one}} of the features of kibbutz life that most interested outsiders. In the heyday of children's societies, parents would only spend two hours a day, typically in the afternoon, with their children. In Kibbutz Artzi parents were explicitly forbidden to put their children to <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> As children got older, parents could go for days on end without seeing their offspring, other than through chance encounters somewhere in the grounds.|$|E

500|$|LeHand's {{importance}} {{as an adviser}} and gatekeeper to FDR grew during the second term. Following Howe's death in 1936, she became the de facto White House chief of staff, and was seen {{as one of the}} most powerful people in the administration. She [...] met with the other members of the secretariat around FDR's bedside every morning, vetted his mail, provided a [...] "back door" [...] entrance to the Oval Office—which adjoined hers alone—and spent many evenings with the president in his upstairs study, as well as accompanying him on weekend cruises on the presidential yachts, the Sequoia and its successor, the Potomac. Because FDR could not be awakened after he went to <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> without LeHand's permission, she was the first person to learn by telephone that Hitler had invaded Poland in September 1939, setting off World War II. [...] Samuel I. Rosenman, a close FDR adviser and speechwriter, called her [...] "one of the most important people of the Roosevelt era." ...|$|E
500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Steiger {{suffered}} from depression {{throughout much of}} his life. He described himself as [...] "incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression" [...] before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night. His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity, though certain roles, such as Napoleon, required him to intentionally gain weight. After the decline of his third marriage in 1979, a deep depression, partly {{a side effect of}} his surgery, during the 1980s negatively affected his career. He became increasingly reclusive during this period, often confining himself to his apartment, watching American football for several hours. He said of the experience: [...] "You begin to lose self-esteem. You don't walk, you don't shave and if no one was watching you'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting". He would lie in <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> thinking [...] "You'll never act again. Why bother? You're no good". Despite these challenges, Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s. In one of his final interviews, he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance, not a mental disease. He commented: [...] "Pain must never be a source of shame. It's a part of life, it's part of humanity." ...|$|E

50|$|For minor offenses, {{prisoners were}} punished with the bastonnade, lashed {{on the back}} with a leather whip. Prisoners who had {{committed}} more serious crimes were chained together with another prisoner, and were chained to their <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> If a prisoner killed a guard or another prisoner, the penalty was death. For those and other most serious offenses, the Bagne had its own guillotine, {{and one of the}} prisoners served as the executioner. All of the bagnards were summoned to attend executions, on their knees and with their heads uncovered.|$|R
5000|$|By the 1880s {{the handful}} of {{competing}} oyster companies began consolidating into a single monopoly. [...] Their harvest of a private commodity from a public space, the San Francisco Bay, led to an opportunity for oyster pirates. Pirates raided the oyster <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> and sold their take in the Oakland markets in the morning. The public disliked the Southern Pacific and the oyster growers, and liked cheap oysters. As a result, the oyster pirates had considerable public sympathy and police were reluctant {{to take action against}} them.|$|R

40|$|Mangroves and {{seagrass}} {{beds are}} important daytime shelter habitats for juvenile Caribbean reef fish species, but {{little is known}} about their relative importance as feeding grounds. In the present study, we tested the degree to which these 2 habitats are used as a feeding ground for 4 nocturnally active fish species on Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. Stable isotope analysis was used as a technique to distinguish between feeding in mangroves and seagrass beds. Individuals of the 4 species which were sheltering during the daytime in permanently inundated fringing mangroves subject to low tidal exchange showed a stable carbon isotope signature indicative of a mixed diet composed of crustaceans from mangroves as well as seagrass beds, with the contribution from mangrove food items lying between 57 and 92 %. However, individuals of the same species sheltering on adjacent (< 50 m distance) seagrass beds during the daytime showed a carbon signature indicative of almost exclusive feeding on seagrass beds. This indicates that 2 different subpopulations probably exist for the 4 species studied: a population of fishes sheltering in mangroves during the daytime and feeding primarily in the mangroves and secondarily in the seagrass <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> and a population of fishes of the same species sheltering in adjacent seagrass beds during the daytime and feeding primarily in seagrass <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>night...</b>|$|R

The doorway was generally closed by a wattle secured by a bar. When this was closed light only found its way into the room through the chinks of the wattle and the hole in the roof. In winter, for extra warmth, a skin was hung before the door. Beyond piles of hides, which served as seats by day and <b>beds</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> there was no furniture whatever in the rooms, save a few earthen cooking pots.|$|R
2500|$|To {{build his}} character, Day-Lewis {{started with the}} voice. Anderson sent him {{recordings}} from the late 19th century to 1927 {{and a copy of}} the 1948 film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, including documentaries on its director, John Huston, an important influence on Anderson's film. According to Anderson, he was inspired by the fact that Sierra Madre is [...] "about greed and ambition and paranoia and looking at the worst parts of yourself". While writing the script, he would put the film on before he went to <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night.</b> To research for the role, Day-Lewis read letters from laborers and studied photographs from the time period. He also read up on oil tycoon Edward Doheny, upon whom Sinclair's book is loosely based.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of indoor toilets, it was common to use the chamber pot under one's <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> and then to dispose of its contents in the morning. During the Victorian era, British housemaids collected all of the household's chamber pots and carried them to a room known as the housemaids' cupboard. [...] This room contained a [...] "slop sink", made of wood with a lead lining to prevent chipping china chamber pots, for washing the [...] "bedroom ware" [...] or [...] "chamber utensils". Once running water and flush toilets were plumbed into British houses, servants were sometimes given their own lavatory downstairs, separate from the family lavatory. The practice of emptying one's own chamber pot, known as Slopping out, continued in British prisons until recently and is still in use in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said I wanted to leave. I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E

Room temperature <b>at</b> <b>night</b> {{was significantly related to}} outside temperature and duration of heating. Total insulation was significantly related to outside temperature and to minimum room temperature, but there was wide variation in insulation at the same room temperature. High levels of insulation for a given room temperature were found particularly <b>at</b> <b>night</b> and in winter, and were {{associated with the use of}} thick or doubled duvets and with swaddling. At least half the babies threw off some or all of their <b>bedding</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> and <b>at</b> least a quarter sweated.
