6000|$|For the first, THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> LAW, OR <b>UNDER</b> <b>THE</b> COVENANT OF WORKS, see, I pray you, that Scripture in the Third of the Romans, {{where the}} Apostle, {{speaking}} before of sins against the law, {{and of the}} denunciations thereof against those that are in that condition, he saith, [...] "What things soever the law saith, it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law"; mark, [...] "it saith to them who <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world become guilty before God" [...] (Rom 3:19). That is, all those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law as a Covenant of Works, that are yet in their sins, and unconverted, as I told you before. Again he saith, [...] "But if ye be led by the Spirit, ye <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law" [...] (Gal 5:18). Implying again, that those which are for sinning against the law, or {{the works of the}} law, either as it is the old covenant, these <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, and not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace. Again he saith, [...] "For as many as are of the works of <b>the</b> law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse" [...] (Gal 3:10). That is, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse; for mark, they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Covenant of Grace <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse. Now, there are but two covenants, therefore, it must needs be that they that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law, seeing those that <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> other covenant <b>are</b> not <b>under</b> <b>the</b> curse, but <b>under</b> <b>the</b> blessing. [...] "So, then, they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham," [...] but <b>the</b> rest <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> law (Gal 3:9).|$|R

The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E

5|$|Gaza {{experienced}} destructive earthquakes in 1903 and 1914. In 1917, during World War I, British forces {{captured the}} city. Gaza grew {{significantly in the}} first half of the 20th century under Mandatory rule. The population of the city swelled as a result of the Palestinian exodus during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Gaza came under Egyptian rule until it was occupied by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War. Gaza became a center of political resistance during the First Intifada, and under the Oslo Accords of 1993, it was assigned to <b>be</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> direct control of the newly established Palestinian Authority. Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza in 2005. By 2007, Hamas emerged both as the victor in Palestinian elections and in factional fighting with rival Fatah in the city and in the wider Gaza Strip and has since been the sole governing authority. Israel subsequently blockaded the Strip and launched assaults against it in 2008–2009, 2012 and 2014, as a response to rocket attacks.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Mendizabal {{had retreated}} to the Portuguese border after sending two battalions to {{reinforce}} the garrison at Badajoz. Weakened by the defeat at Olivenza and by Ballesteros' continued absence, he sent to La Romana for reinforcements, receiving on 14 January 1,800 men sent from Abrantes {{under the command of}} Carlos de España. Additionally, about 6,000 troops were sent forward from the Lines of Torres Vedras on 19 January, arriving at Elvas ten days later. When these forces joined with Mendizabal's remaining 3,000 men, a Spanish cavalry division and a brigade of Portuguese horse, the Allies had an army almost 15,000 strong—intended to <b>be</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> command of La Romana—with which to hold Soult in check.

5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan. Sultan Ali's claims to sovereignty were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was {{quick to point out that}} the Sultan's late father, Sultan Hussein had never pursued active claims to his sovereignty rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was under the control of the Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to <b>be</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of a monarch, de jure sovereignty would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, {{even before}} the British column began to form up for the march to Fort Edward, the Indians renewed attacks on the largely defenceless British. At 5 am, Indians entered huts in the fort housing wounded British who were {{supposed}} to <b>be</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> care of French doctors, and killed and scalped them. Monro complained that the terms of capitulation had been violated, but his contingent was forced to surrender some of its baggage {{in order to be able}} even to begin the march. As they marched off, they were harassed by the swarming Indians, who snatched at them, grabbing for weapons and clothing, and pulling away with force those that resisted their actions, including many of the women, children, servants and slaves. As the last of the men left the encampment, a war whoop sounded, and a contingent of Abenaki warriors seized several men at the rear of the column.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Protestant German Basel Mission of 1834 in Mangalore brought many {{handicraft}} industries, such as cotton weaving and tile-manufacturing, to the region {{and led to a}} large-scale rise in employment. In 1836–37, the political situation in Portugal was in turmoil. Antonio Feliciano de Santa Rita Carvalho, a Portuguese priest, was appointed Archbishop-elect of Goa in September 1836 without authorisation from the then Pope, Gregory XVI. Many Mangalorean Catholics did not accept the leadership of Carvalho but instead submitted to the Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly in Travancore, while some of them continued to <b>be</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and Daman. The parishes in South Canara were divided into two groups—one under Goa and the other under Verapoly.|$|E
30|$|Tirumandiram {{goes further}} {{and says that}} even <b>the</b> popular deities <b>are</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> {{influence}} of the innate impurities (v 2183). Brahma <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of the five mala, Vishnu <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of four, Hara <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of three, Isa <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of two and Sadāsiva <b>is</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of ānava mala. Thus, the mala-free states begin only from Sakthi. Tirumūlar describes the ānava, kanmam and maya as the inner covering, husk and awn that encase a paddy grain. Thus, the mala do not change the soul but cover it like a shell (v 2192). Paul Murphy (1986 : 27) quotes verse 57 from Abhnivagupta’s Paramartasara which uses an identical imagery of a husk, awn and chaff and says that without these coating the seed will be “freed” from growth.|$|R
