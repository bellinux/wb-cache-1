40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and the variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> as an indication of the energy balance in dairy cows. For this reason 11, 055 cows of ten herds were investigated at regular intervals from 18 to 42 days by ultrasound scan. From this data collection results 85, 049 measures. These values were subsequently related to production variables to set limits usable in dairy herd management. The difference between net energy intake and net energy output is determining the energy balance. Therefore the energy balance is influenced by parity, dairy mass intake, time in lactation and milk yield. To avoid postpartal depression in performance the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> at dry off should be between 22 and 24 mm in herd average. With starting the lactation, the cows are in negative energy balance. This affects a decrease of <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> down to 5 mm in some cows. The mean value of the herd should not be lower than 14 mm in early lactation. With the increase of the DMI and the decrease in milk yield in later lactation the fat reserve will be restored. This could be a reason for adiposis in herds with low production. Optimal conditions should be prepared until the beginning of dry period. Therefore the adequate feeding should be focused in the later lactation. The variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> is estimated from two ultrasonographic measures and the days in between. An interval of 26 to 30 days is the best period between two measures. Shorter periods lead to unacceptable findings in work. Longer intervals result in an inaccurate estimation of the mean value. During the dry period the daily variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> should be between 0. 0 and 0. 05 mm. Higher rates of anabolism in fat are connected with an increase of milk yield in early lactation but should be critically treated together with the backfat thickness. This should not be about 35 mm. Because of the reduced DMI and the increase of energy demand heifers start to lose condition 40 to 30 days before calving. The postpartal nadir affects a daily change in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> of about 0. 16 mm in herd average. A higher rise in lipolyses causes a decrease of reproductiveness. The nadir of the negative energy balance is between day 30 and 40 after parturition. After 110 days in milk the restore of fat depots should be started to prepare for the next lactation period. There are strong correlations between milk yield and change in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness.</b> A high milk yield in early lactation causes a high energy deficit. High producing cows catabolism can use up 0. 2 mm of back fat per day. A higher rise in lipolyses leads to a significantly reduced reproductiveness. The increase of the daily change in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> from - 0. 15 to - 0. 2 mm doubles the interval to first insemination. Likewise the intercalving periods degrades as well as the number of inseminations till the pregnancy. Despite of high milk yield an efficient herd management can offset depression in fertility. Milk solids secretion is strongly related to energy balance. Especially the milk protein content in early lactation has a significant correlation to the variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness.</b> An average of milk protein below 3, 1 % is an indicator of an extreme energy deficit. These cows can lose up to 0. 2 mm of their <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> a day. The milk fat content is not strongly related to energy balance. The ultrasound scan of the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> can be an useful method to observe the condition in dairy cows. To solve problems in dairy herd management the variation in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> is more suitable. For this purpose standard curves throughout lactation of this experiment can be used...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the prolactin receptor 3 (PRLR 3) gene and the retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP 4) gene on the production traits of swine, genotyping was performed on 156 and 141 Berkshire pigs, respectively, that were carefully selected for economic traits. The frequencies of allele A in the PRLR 3 locus and allele B in the RBP 4 locus were 0. 50 and 0. 42, respectively. Neither locus was in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. After a genotype was assigned to the individuals whose parents had the homozygous genotype, a statistical analysis was conducted for 291 pigs. The animals with the PRLR 3 and RBP 4 genotypes included 182 and 227 head, respectively. Even though the genotypic effects of PRLR 3 (p< 0. 05) and RBP 4 (p< 0. 01) had a significant influence on the pigs’ <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the interaction of both genes was not highly significant in terms of the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> (p = 0. 1235). While the estimated epistasis effects of aaBB and aaBb decreased the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and reduced the growth rate, the effects of AAbb and aabb increased the growth rate. Despite the insignificant difference in the PRLR genotypes in terms of the days to 90 kg and the average daily gain, the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> showed a significant difference (p< 0. 05), and the additive effect of allele A and the dominant effect of the hetero-genotype were − 0. 377 and 1. 206 mm, respectively. The RBP 4 genotypes had a very significant effect (p< 0. 01) on the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the days to 90 kg, and the average daily gain. The additive effects of allele B of the RBP 4 locus on the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the days to 90 kg, and the average daily gain were 0. 70 mm, − 1. 3 days and 6. 2 g, respectively. Moreover, the dominant effects of the heterozygote for those traits were 0. 63 mm, 9. 9 days and − 45. 0 g, respectively. Allele A of the PRLR 3 locus favorably influenced the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness,</b> the days to 90 kg of the body weight, and the average daily gain and its dominant effect unfavorably influenced those traits. Allele B of RBP 4 showed an incremental growth rate and <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness,</b> which could lower the lean meat percentage in the carcass. The RBP 4 hetero-genotype negatively affected the pork production. These results strongly imply that the selection of allele A of PRLR 3 and allele B of RBP 4 would produce highly productive pigs in the Berkshire breed. Careful selection of allele B of RBP 4 is required because of the increase in the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness...</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the ratio of ham and loin in half-carcasses and the tissue composition of these cuts. The research material consisted of 140 pig carcasses. The experimental materials were derived from the Polish commercial population of fattener pigs. Genetic material representing the most commonly slaughtered fatteners in Poland. Fatteners for the study came from several suppliers. All fatteners were kept in similar farms complying with principles of animal welfare. The right half-carcasses were divided into different groups, regardless of sex, half-carcass mass, <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and lean meat content class. Ham and loin obtained from carcasses were subjected to a detailed dissection, and the percentage of ham and loin in the carcass and the overall percentage of of the cuts in relation to the entire half-carcass were calculated. Gilts were characterized by a higher content of ham in half-carcasses than barrows (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). The increase in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> reduced the content of ham in half-carcasses and increased the content of loin (P ≤ 0. 01). A similar trend was shown for the lean meat content class parameter. Additionally, interaction (P [*]≤ 0. 01) between <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and meat content with respect to the percentage content of loin in carcasses was noted. Gilts were characterised by about a 1. 38  % higher proportion of muscles in the ham (P [*] ≤ 0. 05) and a 0. 47  % lower proportion of intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01). An average increase of five point in <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> increases the amount of subcutaneous fat with skin (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and intermuscular fat (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and reduces muscle (P [*] ≤ 0. 01) and bone (P [*]≤ 0. 05 and P [*] ≤ 0. 01) levels. The interaction of percentage content of muscles in ham was observed (P [*]=[*] 0. 04). The meat content class of carcasses did not only affect the level of bones in ham.

The correlations between pH and pork quality traits directly related to carcass grade, and consumer’s preference were also evaluated. The pH and meat grading scores for cold carcasses of 215 purebred pigs (Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire) from four different farms were obtained. Meat quality parameters of the pork loin were analyzed. Duroc and female animals were more affected compared to other breeds and male pigs. Duroc animals had the highest ultimate pH, carcass <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness,</b> marbling scores, yellowness, and fat content (p< 0. 05). Landrace pigs had the highest color lightness and cooking loss values (p< 0. 05). Among all trait parameters, marbling scores showed the highest significant differences when evaluating the impact of breed and gender on meat quality characteristics (p< 0. 001). Ultimate pH was positively correlated with carcass weight (0. 20), <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> (0. 19), marbling score (0. 17), and color score (0. 16) while negatively correlated with cooking loss (− 0. 24) and shear force (− 0. 20).

As medidas {{realizadas}} foram área de olho-de-lombo, espessura de gordura subcutânea do dorso e espessura de gordura da garupa, mensuradas por ultrassonografia quando os búfalos atingiram o tempo de abate e na carcaça, após o abate. A espessura de gordura subcutânea da carcaça foi avaliada utilizando-se paquímetro e a área de olho-de-lombo da carcaça, régua do quadrante de pontos. O período de confinamento apresentou efeito linear crescente na área de olho-de-lombo e nas espessuras de gordura do dorso e da garupa avaliadas por ultrassom e na carcaça. O efeito linear positivo entre 75 e 150 dias de confinamento, tanto para a área de olho-de-lombo como para espessura de gordura medidas no dorso e na garupa, comprovou que os animais ainda não haviam atingido a maturidade. As correlações entre as medidas obtidas por ultrassom e na carcaça foram 0, 82 para área de olho-de-lombo e 0, 85 para espessura de gordura subcutânea no dorso. As características de carcaça medidas por ultrassom em bubalinos apresentam boas correlações com as medidas realizadas na carcaça no momento do abate, o que permite, em bubalinos da raça Murrah castrados e oriundos de rebanho leiteiro, acompanhar as alterações dessas características durante o desenvolvimento. The {{objective of}} this study was to evaluate the correlations between the measurements obtained by ultrasound and from the carcass and follow the development of the ribeye and fat thickness in buffaloes at different feedlot stages. Twenty castrated, hornless Murrah buffaloes were used. The buffaloes were separated into four groups that were slaughtered at 75, 100, 125, 150 days of feedlot. The measurements taken by ultrasound when the buffaloes reached the slaughter point and from the carcass after the slaughter were ribeye, <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and rump fat thickness. The fat thickness was evaluated using a paquimeter and the ribeye was evaluated by using a quadrant grade ruler. The ribeye, <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and rump fat thickness presented a linear increase effect in function of the feedlot stages. The linear increase from 75 to 150 days of feedlot for ribeye, <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> and rump fat thickness showed that the buffaloes had not reached maturity.

The investigation covered the following parameters: calcium, phosphate, magnesium, aspartate- aminotransferase, glutamate- dehydrogenase, creat-inkinase, ß- hydroxybutyrate, bilirubin, urea and cholesterin. Also directly after calving an evaluation of the colostrums quality and udder size was made. Further the milk yield, milk content and fertility parameters were entered.

The thickness of the outer, middle and inner layers progressively increased over the study period. Throughout the experimental period, the differences between two successive scans of the M.  longissimus area did not differ significantly, obtaining the lowest value at the third scan and the highest at the fifth scan. The ultrasound back fat depth was affected by sex, being greater in females and in animals with a high-oleic diet. Positive significant correlations were observed for measurements assessed. The R 2 values for the regression equations to estimate M.  longissimus area were lower than the values found for the prediction of fat measurements, and they differed between sex and diet. The relative back fat growth was higher than M.  longissimus area, not permitting {{the establishment of a}} similar growth pattern for fat and muscle. The sex and diet was taken into account in the predictive models. The subcutaneous adipose layers in Iberian pigs grow at different rates during the last 6  months before slaughter; with the ultrasound serial scan, it is possible to show these changes. The change in diet and the sex affect the adipose tissue development, being more noticeable in the middle layer of back fat at 10 th rib level and the inner layer at 14 th rib level. However, the sex and the use of an enriched oleic acid diet do not affect to loin development.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the relation between indicators of energy balance and postpartum reproductive functions in case of high yielding dairy cows, with special attention to the re-initiation of the cyclic ovarian function during the first 100 days after calving. The investigations were accomplished during the course of one year on 361 high performace dairy cows of German Holstein breed (black and coloured skin). The average 305 -day-yield amounted to 10091 kg. As indicators of the energy balance the body mass index (BMI), the body condition score (BCS) and the <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> (BFT) were selected. Additionally protein, fat and urea concentrations in the milk were also determined. The reproductive performance of the animals was established on the basis of data on oestrus, progesterone concentration in milk and fertility characteristics such as rest period, intercalving period, delayed period, pregnancy rate after first A. I. and insemination index. In order to establish a possible relationship of leptin to the energy balance and the re-initiation of ovarian cycle post-partum, the leptin concentration in the blood plasma was determined in 24 selected animals. The milk fat content of first milk yield control averaged 4. 8 % and the protein content of the 100 -day-yield averaged 3. 2 %. The fat-protein-quotient (FPQ) at the onset of lactation stood at 1. 5. The <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> values of the animals of the herd were clearly below the reference curve of STAUFENBIEL and SCHROEDER (2004). In 38. 4 % of the cases, the results of the visual oestrous control were in accordance with the results of the milk progesterone concentration. More ovarian cycles could be captured with the help of the progesterone analysis than with the visual oestrus control. In 17. 7 % of the experimental animals a first progesterone increase was determined after more than 50 days post partum. However, in only 51. 2 % of the experimental animals the first progesterone rise occurred within the first 45 days p. p. which was also followed by regular cycles. All other animals showed disturbances of the ovarian cycle. Animals with comparatively high milk protein content during the 100 -day-performance showed an earlier onset of the cyclic ovarian function with few disturbances of the ovarian cycle than animals with low protein content. Frequent disturbances of the cyclic ovarian function and a delayed onset of ovarian cycle post partum were observed in cows yielding > 12000 kg milk as compared to animals with < 8000 kg milk production. In the presented study a correlation between indicators of the energy balance and the interval from calving up to the first ovarian activity could be observed. Animals with an optimal <b>back</b> <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> during the lactation period only rarely showed a delayed onset of the cyclic ovarian function or disturbances of the ovarian cycle post partum.

40|$|Epicardial fat {{plays a role}} in {{cardiovascular}} diseases. Because of its anatomic {{and functional}} proximity to the myocardium and its intense metabolic activity, some interactions between the heart and its visceral fat depot have been suggested. Epicardial fat can be visualized and measured using standard two-dimensional echocardiography. Standard parasternal long-axis and short-axis views permit the most accurate measurement of epicardial <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> overlying the right ventricle. Epicardial <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> is generally identified as the echofree space between the outer wall of the myocardium and the visceral layer of pericardium and is measured perpendicularly on the free wall of the right ventricle at end-systole. Echocardiographic epicardial <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> ranges from a minimum of 1 mm to a maximum of almost 23 mm. Echocardiographic epicardial <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> clearly reflects visceral adiposity rather than general obesity. It correlates with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, coronary artery disease, and subclinical atherosclerosis, and therefore it might serve as a simple tool for cardiometabolic risk prediction. Substantial changes in echocardiographic epicardial <b>fat</b> <b>thickness</b> during weight-loss strategies may also suggest its use as a marker of therapeutic effect. Echocardiographic epicardial fat measurement in both clinical and research scenarios has several advantages, including its low cost, easy accessibility, rapid applicability, and good reproducibility.
