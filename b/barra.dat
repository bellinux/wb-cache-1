5|$|The <b>Barra</b> Head Lighthouse, {{built by}} Robert Stevenson, has {{operated}} since 1833. From 1931 to 1980 <b>Barra</b> Head was inhabited {{only by the}} lighthouse keepers and their wives but the lighthouse is now automated and the island completely uninhabited. The rough seas that surround the island {{have been used to}} test prototype lifeboats.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Barra</b> estates of MacNeil (including all the <b>Barra</b> Isles) {{were sold}} to Colonel John Gordon of Cluny Aberdeenshire in 1840 whose lack of {{consideration}} for his tenants during the potato famines was matched by his zeal for evictions to create sheep farms. However, the Highland Clearances {{seemed to have the}} effect of increasing Mingulay’s population as families evicted from <b>Barra</b> sometimes chose to re-settle there rather than take the emigrant ships to Nova Scotia. In this regard Mingulay's remoteness was probably an advantage and rents were actually reduced from 1840–45. In 1878 Lady Gordon Cathcart inherited the estate and visited but once during her fifty-four year period of tenure.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{has deep}} roots in the Western Isles, but owing mainly to the {{different}} allegiances of the clans in the past, {{the people in the}} northern islands (Lewis, Harris, North Uist) have historically been predominantly Presbyterian, and those of the southern islands (Benbecula, South Uist, <b>Barra)</b> predominantly Roman Catholic.|$|E
5000|$|Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de <b>Barras,</b> {{a member}} of a minor noble family from Provence, <b>Barras</b> had been a revolutionary envoy to Toulon, where he met the young Bonaparte, and {{arranged}} his promotion to captain. <b>Barras</b> had been removed from the Committee of Public Safety by Robespierre. Fearing for his life, <b>Barras</b> had helped organize the downfall of Robespierre. An expert at political intrigue, <b>Barras</b> became the dominant figure in the Directory.

50|$|The medieval {{community}} in <b>Barras</b> {{was characterized by}} scattered settlements. It had 37 fires in 1315. It was heavily depopulated by the crises of the 14th century (the Black Death and the Hundred Years War) and the population was completely eliminated in 1471. The smaller fief of <b>Barras</b> belonged to the counts of Provence until 1297 when Charles II of Naples gave it to a noble family which took {{the name of the}} fief (the <b>Barras</b> family). This family lasted until the 19th century and provided many officers such as Jean-Antoine <b>Barras</b> de la Penne (1650-1730) and Jacques Melchior <b>Barras</b> de Saint-Laurent (1719 to 1793).|$|R

Ike Clanton's account of the game (the only one that exists) gives the participants as John Behan, Virgil Earp, Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, and a fifth man Ike did not recognize, while <b>Barra</b> wrote that Holliday had attended the game.|$|E

5|$|There are iron age remains, and {{the culture}} of the island was {{influenced}} by early Christianity and the Vikings. Between the 15th and 19th centuries Mingulay was part of the lands of Clan MacNeil of <b>Barra,</b> but subsequently suffered at the hands of absentee landlords.|$|E
5|$|After {{the island}} was {{evacuated}} it was first tenanted and then purchased in 1919 by Jonathan MacLean from <b>Barra.</b> In 1930 it was sold to John Russell who had experience as a sheep farmer in both Australia and Montana. Russell was clearly a man who liked his own company, choosing {{to live on the}} island alone all autumn and winter with his pet ferrets and cats, and joined by two shepherds for the spring and summer only. After seven years he sold up to Peggy Greer, a farmer from Essex who visited only rarely and let the grazings out to local farmers. In 1951 she attempted to sell the island herself, but without success until 1955 when a local crofters' syndicate called the <b>Barra</b> Head Isles Sheepstock Company completed the purchase. The advent of motor boats made stocking the islands considerably easier and the company’s ownership continued for the next forty years.|$|E

5|$|As the Norse era {{drew to a}} {{close the}} Norse-speaking princes were {{gradually}} replaced by Gaelic-speaking clan chiefs including the MacLeods of Lewis and Harris, the MacDonalds of the Uists and MacNeil of <b>Barra.</b> This transition did little to relieve the islands of internecine strife although by the early 14th century the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, based on Islay, were in theory these chiefs' feudal superiors and managed to exert some control.|$|E
