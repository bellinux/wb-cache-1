In 1997, unhappy with the roles they were being offered, Williams and several actor friends wrote a script entitled Blink. It was sold, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>happened</b> with it.|$|E

At 3:20 pm, Friesenhahn made the last connections to the detonator and twisted the handle, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>happened.</b> He tried again and all they heard {{was the sound of}} American shells hitting the area around them.

25|$|Scarlett, {{notoriously}} short-sighted, remained {{unaware that}} the Russians were there. However, once he had negotiated a vineyard and the sprawling tented camp of the Light Brigade, he was notified by his ADC, Lieutenant Elliot, of {{the proximity of the}} Russian cavalry on their left flank. Scarlett gave the order 'Left wheel into line' which turned the two advanced regiments into line to face the enemy; these were shortly followed by the other two regiments forming a second line. Had the Russians charged at this moment they would have caught Scarlett's men completely disorganised, yet Ryzhov let the chance slip. Lucan, who had also seen the Russians, rode across with his staff from the Light Brigade to join the Heavies. So impatient was he to attack that he ordered his duty trumpeter, Trumpet Major Joy, to sound the charge – <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>happened.</b> An attempt to attack before his men were in perfect alignment was contrary to every precept that the officers had learnt back in England, and it was only when the dressing had been completed to his satisfaction did Scarlett order his trumpeter, Trumpet Major Monks, to sound the charge. The Heavy Brigade began to move against the Russian cavalrymen.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 Waitetuna {{residents}} {{agreed to}} build a school, but an 1872 flood washed away the timber for the scheme. A half-time school and a private school ran for a while. Waitetuna School District was gazetted in 1873, but the Education Rate proved insufficient to pay {{the teacher and the}} school closed in 1875. A new school on donated land opened, with a teacher's residence added in 1877 and an adjacent 11 acres added by the Waste Lands Board in 1878. As early as 1882 a petition requested the school be moved away from the damp hollow, <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>happened</b> until the main road was diverted through the grounds in 1906. On 24 August 1903 Waitetuna School changed its name to Te Uku. In August 1908 the present school was established about 800 metres to the east, with one room on another 2 acres of donated land. Inadvertently, an acre of Church land was taken by the school until sold for a post office and store in 1923. A second classroom was added in 1935, a teacher's house in 1941, a concrete play area in 1948, a football paddock leased from 1951, a prefab added in 1954, a lavatory block in 1957, a school pool in 1961 and the Aramiro School building moved here in 1965. Ohautira Maori School closed in 1969, shortly after the timber mill, and in 1975 another classroom was added.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the best}} {{understanding}} of historians {{is that the}} story originated weeks earlier when Admiral Joel T. Boone, Hoover's physician, was exploring trails in the surrounding mountains and came upon an eleven-year-old boy named Ray Burraker. Boone learned that Burraker and his eight brothers and sisters had never attended school. The area in which they lived, known as Dark Hollow, had no school. [...] When the President heard of Burraker, he said [...] "Tell that boy if he will bring me an opossum down here I'll give him five dollars."

2500|$|The P-38 {{ended up}} being the [...] "sweetheart of Kelsey's flying career", {{according}} to author Jeff Ethell. Kelsey stayed {{in close contact with}} the twin-engine fighter during every phase of its development and implementation, flying extended long-range ferry missions, combat missions and potentially dangerous equipment tests. One such flight took place on April 9, 1943 when Kelsey performed a flight test on a modified P-38G to see if Lockheed's newly developed dive flap could be engaged after terminal velocity was reached in a dive. After climbing to 35,000ft, Kelsey initiated a dive. At maximum speed, he pulled the lever to engage the new flaps <b>but</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>happened.</b> Pulling harder, the handle came off in his hand. Kelsey applied full rudder and aileron at the same time, and suddenly the aircraft lost one wing and the whole tail, and entered an inverted flat spin. Kelsey bailed out and suffered a broken ankle upon landing. The P-38 crashed upside down into a hillside near Calabasas, California.|$|E
