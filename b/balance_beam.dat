5|$|After {{several months}} of conditioning, training, {{revamping}} routines and showing readiness at summer training camp, Liukin petitioned for a spot at the Visa National Championships. In order for the petition to be granted, she had to show readiness by scoring at least a 14.0 on one apparatus at a qualifying event (the U.S. Secret Classic) on May 26. She did so, scoring a 14.9 on <b>balance</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E

5|$|Liukin {{decided that}} she was not done with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on <b>balance</b> <b>beam.</b> She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once again just perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she felt {{that she was not}} quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{ankle injury}} {{required}} surgery, and the recovery period kept {{her out of}} both national and international competition {{for much of the}} year. In July 2007, although she was still recovering from her injury, she returned to competition {{as a member of the}} American team for the Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro. She competed only on bars and beam, contributing to the team's gold-medal finish and winning individual silver medals in the uneven bars and <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> finals.|$|E
5|$|Salma El-Said and Sherine El-Zeiny {{qualified}} for the Olympics as the second and third-ranked Africans at the 2011 World Championships, with El-Zeiny having been offered a spot after the highest-placed African, Nicole Szabo of South Africa, turned down the invitation due to injury. El-Said had taken a break from active competition while recovering from an injury of her own and came back shortly before the World Championships. Since then she had taken the individual all-around title at the 2011 Arab Games and the 2012 African Championships. El-Zeiny was {{a veteran of the}} 2008 tournament and both had been a part of Egypt's victorious all-around team at the 2012 African Championships. In London, El-Said's best event was the <b>balance</b> <b>beam,</b> in which she placed 42nd. She was also 63rd in the uneven bars, 69th in the floor exercise, and was ranked 41st overall in the individual all-around. El-Zeiny was 53rd on the <b>balance</b> <b>beam,</b> but finished 82nd and last in the floor exercise after suffering an injury. Yasmine Rostom, the rhythmic gymnast, qualified by being the top performer from Africa at the 2011 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships. In London she was 23rd in the ball and the hoop, 20th in the clubs, and last in the ribbon to finish 23rd out of 24 competitors overall.|$|E
50|$|<b>Balance</b> <b>beams</b> used in {{international}} gymnastics competitions must {{conform to the}} guidelines and specifications set forth by the International Gymnastics Federation Apparatus Norms brochure. Several companies manufacture and sell beams, including AAI (USA), Janssen Fritsen (Europe) and Acromat (Australia). Most gymnastics schools purchase and use <b>balance</b> <b>beams</b> that meet the FIG's standards, but some may also use beams with carpeted surfaces for practice situations. While learning new skills, gymnasts often work on low beams that have the same dimensions and surface of regulation apparatus, but are set a very short distance from the ground. They may also work on practice beams, mini beams, road beams, or even lines on a mat.|$|R
50|$|Immunity Challenge: In {{the first}} round, the castaways would race across {{a series of}} <b>balance</b> <b>beams</b> {{carrying}} a bag of puzzle blocks. The first six castaways to bring their bags {{would go to the}} second round in which each player must face a series of tricky <b>balance</b> <b>beams.</b> Half of the castaways move to the final round where each player has to stack all of their pieces like a line of domino tiles. Once all of the blocks were properly stacked, the castaway would start a chain reaction which would release a ball into a bucket and, hence, releasing their flag. The first castaway to raise their flag would win.|$|R
50|$|The lock was {{designated}} a Grade II listed structure in 1990, and its bottom gates have rare cast iron <b>balance</b> <b>beams.</b> One of the adjacent cottages (No 3 Lock Cottages) {{is also a}} Grade II listed building.|$|R
5|$|In {{the event}} finals, Liukin {{displayed}} a beautiful routine {{to earn a}} surprising bronze medal on floor exercise with a score of 15.425, behind Shawn Johnson, with 15.500, and Romanian Sandra Izbasa, with 15.650. On uneven bars, Liukin and China's He Kexin both posted final marks of 16.725 and earned identical A- and B-panel scores of 7.70 and 9.025, respectively. However, He Kexin won the gold medal, and Liukin was awarded the silver, after a tie-breaking calculation that took into account individual marks given by judges on the B-panel. In the <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> final, Liukin scored 16.025 to claim silver behind Shawn Johnson's 16.225. With her fifth Beijing medal, Liukin tied Mary Lou Retton and Shannon Miller for the most gymnastics medals won by an American in a single Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{competed in}} her first National Championships as a junior in 2002, {{at the age of}} 12 and a half. In {{contrast}} to her WOGA teammates Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise, who finished first and second, respectively, Liukin suffered a fall on the uneven bars that rendered her unable to finish the routine. She continued {{through the rest of the}} competition and, despite the incomplete bars set, finished 15th, which landed her one of the final spots on the U.S. National Team. She was chosen to compete with the U.S. team at the 2002 Junior Pan American Championships, where she contributed to the team gold medal and placed second on the uneven bars and <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> and in the all-around.|$|E
5|$|Liukin's {{first meet}} of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City, where she {{defeated}} 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title. She posted the highest {{score of the}} meet, a 16.600 on the uneven bars. In March, Nastia competed at the Pacific Rim (formerly Pacific Alliance) Championships in San Jose, where she led the American team to a gold medal and won the all-around and <b>balance</b> <b>beam</b> titles. In the team competition, Liukin posted an all-time high score of 16.650 on the uneven bars, but in event finals, she fell on her Gienger release move {{and took a step}} on her dismount, earning a 15.225 and taking second place.|$|E
50|$|Contestants must cross a set {{of three}} <b>balance</b> <b>beams,</b> each only 7 inches wide, while a wind machine blows at 55 mph against them {{in an attempt to}} throw them off <b>balance.</b> The first <b>beam</b> is {{positioned}} directly against the wind machine, thus creating a headwind; the second beam is at a 45-degree angle against the fan, and the third beam runs alongside the wind machine, resulting in a crosswind.|$|R
