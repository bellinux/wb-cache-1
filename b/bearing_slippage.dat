40|$|The study {{presents}} a detailed seismic performance {{assessment of a}} complex office-designed bridge using state-of-the-art assessment tools and metrics. The impact of design assumptions on the capacity estimates and dynamic characteristics of a multi-span curved bridge are investigated. A single nine-span bridge is studied whilst the level of attention to detail is significantly higher than can be achieved in a mass parametric study of a population of bridges. The objective is achieved by in-depth investigation of the bridge representing the ???as-designed??? (including features assumed in the design process) and that representing the ???as-built??? (actual expected characteristics) structure. Three-dimensional detailed dynamic response simulations of the investigated bridge including soil-structure interaction effects are undertaken. The behavior of the ???as-designed??? bridge is investigated on two different analytical platforms for elastic and inelastic analysis. A third idealization is adopted to investigate the ???as-built??? behavior by realistically modeling bridge bearings, structural gaps and materials. A comprehensive list of local and global, action and deformation, performance indicators are selected to monitor the response to earthquake action, including <b>bearing</b> <b>slippage</b> and segment collision. The adopted methodology and results of elastic and inelastic analyses are discussed. The comparative study has indicated that the lateral capacity and dynamic characteristics of the as-designed bridge are significantly different than the as-built behavior. The potential of pushover analysis in identifying structural deficiencies, estimation of capacities and providing insight into the pertinent limit state criteria are demonstrated. The conclusions from this study are important for designers and assessors of the seismic response of complex bridges since it highlights potentially non-conservative assumptions that are frequently used in the design office.

40|$|Bearings {{have been}} inevitably used in broad {{applications}} of rotating machines. To increase the efficiency, reliability {{and safety of}} machines, condition monitoring of bearings is significant during the operation. However, due {{to the influence of}} high background noise and <b>bearing</b> component <b>slippages,</b> incipient faults are difficult to detect. With the continuous research on the bearing system, the modulation effects have been well known and the demodulation based on optimal frequency bands is approved as a promising method in condition monitoring. For the purpose of enhancing the performance of demodulation analysis, a robust method, ensemble average autocorrelation based stochastic subspace identification (SSI), is introduced to determine the optimal frequency bands. Furthermore, considering that both the average and autocorrelation functions can reduce noise, auto-correlated envelope ensemble average (AEEA) is proposed to suppress noise and highlight the localised fault signature. In order to examine the performance of this method, the <b>slippage</b> of <b>bearing</b> signals is modelled as a Markov process in the simulation study. Based on the analysis results of simulated bearing fault signals with white noise and slippage and an experimental signal from a planetary gearbox test bench, the proposed method is robust to determine the optimal frequency bands, suppress noise and extract the fault characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Automation {{has played}} {{a big role in}} the {{development}} of the industry in the last century. Despite the desire to automate the tedious and repetitive work in greenhouses by robots, the automation level in the horticulture is still far from desired. However, the last decade shows a lot of progress in the horticulture automation and more is expected due to the increasing need for automated processes in this area. Priva B. V. started the Tomation project in 2002 to automate the task of cutting off the leaves of tomato plants. Cutting off the leaves of tomato plants is one of the crop handling tasks done on a regular basis to ensure optimal growth and ripening of the tomatoes. This report presents research concerning the Tomation Project of Priva B. V., aimed at solving the problem of autonomous movement of the leaf-cutting robot in the greenhouse. The robot has to move autonomously in the path and periodically change from path to path. The focus in this report is on the path-to-path movement in the greenhouse. This is a movement where the vehicle rides off the rail, moves to the next path and finally drives back on the rail again to continue with the leaf cutting process. The robot platform is a vehicle equipped with omni-directional mecanum wheels and powered by stepper motors from NanotecÂ®. These mecanum wheels are omnidirectional wheels and are able to move the vehicle in a lateral direction. The vehicle will move with mecanum wheels on the concrete path and with flanged wheels on the rail. The vehicle with the mecanum wheels encountered difficulties driving sideways at a critical weight on the platform. Undesired movements occur at these weights, because the stepper motor is not performing all the steps. The scope of the project includes the autonomous path-to-path movement of the robot. The vision system for navigational purposes is not installed yet on the platform. Hence, the inputs from the system are entered manually in this project. It has to be taken into account that the vision system can only look at the front. The path-to-path movement should meet requirements on accuracy, time, speed and the payload of the vehicle. Furthermore, the vehicle has to be able to cope with cracks and obstructions on the road during the movement. Finally, it has to deal with rails that are shifted, because they are not fixed properly on the concrete path. Using the positional feedback of the encoders of the available stepper motor and inputs of a vision system a proper control system is required. To get a good starting point to develop the autonomous movement of the platform, it was important to have a good understanding of the stepper motor and a clear view on the possibilities and modes of use of the motor. The working principle of the stepper motor is explained by describing the common step modes: the full step, the half step and the micro step mode. The difference between the stepper motor and a servo motor is explained. Based on the differences between these motors, the choice on the stepper motor has been reasoned. The technical specifications and the Software Development Kit of the motors are presented. These were needed to learn the possibilities in controlling and using the motors. The mecanum wheels of the vehicle of the Tomation Project serve for omnidirectional purposes. The possibility to move in a lateral direction with these wheels was the main reason for using them. The wheels offer a way to do compact movements on the path, without obstructing the path more than necessary to avoid possible conflicts with other (moving) objects. The omnidirectional movement is realized by appropriately controlling the angular velocity of each wheel separately. Depending on each individual wheel rotation direction and velocity, the resulting combination of the wheels produces a total movement in the desired direction without changing the orientation of the wheels. The navigational purposes of the Tomation project required a proper kinematic model of the vehicle. The equations of motion are used to derive the ideal kinematic model to reach a desired position and orientation. The measured position errors are dealt with by adjusting the kinematic model with experiments. The sources of these errors were <b>slippage,</b> <b>bearing</b> friction and point contact friction. A comprehensive research on rollers of the wheels during omnidirectional movements is performed. This was needed to understand the motion of the rollers and its contribution to the omnidirectional movements. The analyses have shown that as the movement with the vehicle gets more lateral, the rollers will contribute more to the movement. This was also observed during movements of the vehicle. These observations and analyses on the rollers are used to explain the dynamics of the wheels. To understand why the lateral movement of the vehicle needs more phase current than the forward movement, the dynamics of the mecanum wheels are investigated. A misconception in the literature on the dynamic model is explained. The literature neglects the force perpendicular to the rollers without a proper reasoning. The aspect of motion in the rollers is not taken into account. Hence, it is decided to reject the theory in the literature on the dynamics of these vehicles. With observations and analyses on the wheels a new dynamic model has been developed. This model takes also the friction in the rollers into account. This friction causes the main difference between the required force for the forward and lateral movement. It is seen that as the movement gets more lateral, the rollers will have more contribution, so the movement will be more affected by friction. Hence, the lateral movement needs more force to overcome the friction compared to a forward movement. The vehicle of the Tomation project encountered practical problems related to the navigational features of the vehicle. The effects of these problems are analysed and solutions are presented when needed. To navigate properly in the greenhouse a function is developed that provides the number of steps needed per wheel for a given omnidirectional movement. Furthermore, the undesired effects, caused by rounding the target speed of the motor, are dealt with by looking for the nearest movement without these errors. Next, the asynchronous start of the motors caused by the serial connection is solved with an Arduino board that generates a signal to start all the motors simultaneously. Finally, an ultrasonic proximity sensor is used to detect the concrete path when riding off the rail backwards. The vision system could not be used here, since the cameras are facing forward. These functions and additions improve the reliability and robustness of the movement in the greenhouse. With the aforementioned functions and findings from the analyses a reliable and proper path to path movement in the greenhouse is ensured. The movement is split into three separate movements: riding off the rail, moving across to the next path and driving on the rail of the new path. After analysing alternatives for these movements, it has been decided that the vehicle will move just with two motors in the area where transition from the mecanum wheels to the flanged wheels occurs. A lateral movement with the current setup was not feasible for the required payload. If we disregard the payload of the robot, the remaining conditions did meet the requirements of the movement. The research in this project has contributed to the autonomous movement for the vehicle of the Tomation Project of Priva. The path-to-path movement of the vehicle is realized in a reliable way, provided that the motors are strong enough to deliver the required force for the movements. The results will be used for further steps in the project. Mechanical EngineeringDelft Center for Systems and ControlMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
