Indeed, last publications tend to prove that the "nitrogen vacancy" theory is not confirmed by the experimental ground available. To find new answers, we first made electrical characterizations on some Al/Ti/n+-GaN contacts with different annealing conditions. Then, we performed SIMS depth profiles of annealed TiN/Ti/n+-GaN samples. Results developed in this paper tend to demonstrate that the ohmic behavior of Ti/Al <b>based</b> <b>contact</b> is mainly due to an increase of the doping concentration.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the last}} years, {{there is a}} clear trend in c-Si solar cell {{fabrication}} to place both emitter and <b>base</b> <b>contacts</b> on the back side leading to the so-called Interdigitated Back Contacted (IBC) solar cell structure. This solar cell architecture requires excellent front and rear surface passivation as well as a very low recombination emitter. Moreover, laser doping may be an attractive technique to create both selective emitter and <b>base</b> <b>contacts</b> using appropriate dielectric layers as dopant sources, i. e. Al 2 O 3 and a-SiCx(n) stacks for the p+ and n+ regions respectively. In this study, we report on a simplified fabrication process for IBC n-type c-Si solar cells combining laser doping and a conventional boron emitter passivated by Al 2 O 3 films. Results show very low emitter recombination currents in the ∼ 10 - 50 fA/cm 2 range before laser processing. In addition, selective emitter contacts can be created by laser doping with recombination current densities at each contact point around 4. 4 pA/cm 2 in relatively low and shallow doped boron doped profiles (sheet resistance ∼ 400 Ω/sq). Finally, IBC solar cells, 3 x 3 cm 2 device area, were fabricated combining selective laser-doped emitter and <b>base</b> <b>contacts</b> reaching efficiencies up to 20. 8 %...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Unmatched {{combination}} of emitter and <b>base</b> <b>contact</b> resistance will influence the total {{performance of the}} solar cell. To optimize this combination, single crystalline silicon solar cell was analyzed using quasi-one-dimensional transport of electrons and holes in crystalline semiconductor, PC 1 D. Approach: Effects of {{the resistance of the}} emitter and <b>base</b> <b>contact</b> have been investigated with a view to find the best resistive combinations. A range of contact resistance of emitter and base were applied to PC 1 D software for evaluation. Results: The short circuit current Isc, the open circuit voltage Voc, the maximum power Pm and the fill factor are the observed parameters due to the variations of the resistance on the emitter and <b>base</b> <b>contact.</b> As the two variable factors that take into the account, while evaluating one factor, the other was set to constant value. It is found that as the contact resistance goes higher, the values of the parameters deceased. Conclusion/Recommendations: From the evaluation, the lowest emitter resistance that will give highest value of parameter in the selected ranged is 1 m&# 937; while for the <b>base</b> <b>contact</b> will be 15 m&# 937;. The overall investigation on single crystalline silicon solar cell base and emitter contact were done, gives potential parametric suggestion that may assist in the fabrication of high efficiency single crystalline silicon solar cells.

We used a set of devices with four different separations (δ) between the emitter and the isolated region. We demonstrate that decreasing the separation δ gives rise to periphery base currents and causes a significant drop in device lifetime. For the <b>base</b> <b>contact,</b> we show that degradation in semiconductor surface quality beneath the deposited p-ohmic metal can cause collector leakage currents, which we relate to localized spikes through the collector layer...|$|E
40|$|The murine {{developmental}} control gene product, Hoxa- 7, {{was shown}} {{to function as a}} DNA-binding transactivator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The importance of the ATTA core, the preference for antp class flanking nucleotides, the importance of Asn- 51 of the homeodomain (HD), and the synergism of multiple binding sites all reflect properties that have previously been described for HOM or Hox proteins in tissue culture systems. A comparison of contact positions among genes of paralog groups and classes of mammalian HDs points to a lack of diversity in positions that make <b>base</b> <b>contact,</b> suggesting that besides the combination of HD amino acid-base pair contacts, another means of recognizing differences between targets must exist if Hox genes select different targets. The HD of antennapedia is identical to the Hoxa- 7 HD. The interaction of Hoxa- 7 with the exact sequence used in the nuclear magnetic resonance three-dimensional structural analysis on the antennapedia HD was studied. Hoxa- 7 binding and transactivation was influenced by sequences outside of the known <b>base</b> <b>contact</b> zone of this site. We conclude that Hoxa- 7 protein has a second means to interact with DNA or/and that the sequences flanking the <b>base</b> <b>contact</b> zone influence HD interactions by distorting DNA within the contact zone (base or backbone).

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{impacts of}} surface geometry on {{the stability of}} wetting states, and the transitions between them are elucidated for square posts and reentrant structures in three dimensions. We identify three principal outcomes of particular importance for future surface design of liquid-repellent surfaces. Firstly, we demonstrate and quantify how capillary condensation and vapour cavitation affect wetting state stabilities. At high contact angles, cavitation is enhanced about wide, closely-spaced square posts, leading {{to the existence of}} suspended states without an associated collapsed state. At low contact angles, narrow reentrant pillars suppress condensation and enable the suspension of even highly wetting liquids. Secondly, two distinct collapse mechanisms are observed for 3 D reentrant geometries, <b>base</b> <b>contact</b> and pillar contact, which are operative at different pillar heights. As well as morphological differences in the interface of the penetrating liquid, each mechanism is affected differently by changes in the contact angle with the solid.

Face-to-face and telecommunication <b>based</b> <b>contact</b> is considered. Regression analysis of survey data collected in the Netherlands was performed and results suggest that face-to-face contact was significantly associated with work and commute duration, car ownership, car commuting and distance.
