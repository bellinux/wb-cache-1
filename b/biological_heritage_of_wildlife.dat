50|$|The rich <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> {{came down}} to us through the ages {{mainly because of the}} deep-rooted Indian {{tradition}} of compassion for all life in general. Moreover, animals have been closely associated with our folklore and legends.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{argues that}} an {{evolutionary}} approach to policy-making, which emphasizes openness {{to change and}} political variety, is particularly compatible with the central tenets of classical liberalism. The chief reasons are that classical liberalism acknowledges the ubiquity of uncertainty, as well as heterogeneity in preferences and beliefs, and generally embraces gradual social and economic change that arises from accidental variation rather than deliberate, large-scale planning. In contrast, our arguments cast doubt on a different claim, namely that classical liberalism is particularly compatible with the evolutionary <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> humans...|$|R

Additional legislative and management frameworks, coupled with dedicated funding sources, {{will be required to}} protect the region's native biodiversity and the human activities that depend on it. This review explores how more comprehensive biosecurity initiatives might be implemented through the adoption of robust pre-border and border quarantine practices, the use of emerging technologies to improve border and post-border biosurveillance and monitoring, and the integration of multiple social, economic and ecological objectives into a more holistic management paradigm. This review also discusses the need for a multidisciplinary approach to biosecurity, driven by improved co-operation across government agencies, industry, community and scientific stakeholders, in order to safeguard the unique <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> the Australasia region. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Current {{methods of}} forest {{management}} are often unsatisfactory {{in terms of}} ecology. In the context of biodiversity conservation {{it is necessary to}} develop and apply alternative methods of forestry. Ecological forestry has been established as a response to criticism of the logging process, within which there is no emphasis on environmental functions. It is a collective term for methods and practices that replicate the natural ecosystem processes. Three basic principles of ecological forestry has been described and justified - conservation <b>of</b> <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> natural disturbances; diverse interventions that maintain or create heterogeneity; enough time for the regeneration of vegetation. Further models were characterized by specific practical application and their application in the world. Finally, the possibilities of ecological forestry were summarized into a number of possible practical applications. It is rather general recommendations, in which inappropriate methods of practices are replaced with more ekological options, and the impact of these methods on the forest ecosystem has been explained...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} {{the range of}} genetic disorders in the Indian population of South Africa, assess relevant historical and demographic factors, and discuss the implications for medical and genetic care. METHODS: WSW reviewed the archived data pertaining to patients seen in his paediatric practice in Durban during the past 45 years. Likewise, PB reviewed case details of persons encountered since 1972 in Cape Town, at outreach clinics, and in special institutions for the handicapped throughout South Africa. Additional information was accessed through the Cape Genetic Heritage archive. RESULTS: In addition to the common ubiquitous worldwide genetic disorders, several rare heritable conditions {{are present in the}} Indian community of South Africa. These disorders are the consequence of the founder effect and reflect the <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> the early immigrants. Demographic factors (notably endogamy) are also relevant in this respect. As a result of these processes, thalassaemia {{is by far the most}} common and important genetic disorder in the Indian population in the country. CONCLUSION: Awareness of the presence of specific genetic conditions in the Indian community of South Africa is important in the diagnostic process. In turn, diagnostic precision facilitates accurate prognostication and optimal medical and genetic management...|$|R

40|$|In Sweden, the {{environmental}} quality goal 13 for A Varied Agricultural Landscape, that combines environment, food production and rurality and aims at keeping the agricultural landscape open, was considered as not achieved in 2016. One {{of the reasons}} for this non-achievementis the agricultural intensification and specialisation and in turn the decrease in number of pastures during the 20 th century, threating thus habitats, diversity and values resulting from a continuous, traditional use of the land commonly called ‘biological heritage’. This study focuses on the traditional and sustainable animal husbandry using pastures, contributing to both the preservation <b>of</b> <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> and the production of high-quality food. It relies upon the assumption that the link between artisan food production and <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> is not well understood nor highlighted by the different actors taking part into the process of producing, selling, buying and consuming artisan food products in the rural areas of mid-northern Scandinavia, and therefore the study attempts to contribute with knowledge about how <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> is understood, described and communicated within this context. For such purposes the study takes a phenomenographic approach with <b>biological</b> <b>heritage,</b> pastures and artisan food products as the conceptions to be tested, and consists of semi-structured interviews of three agencies and surveys of artisan food producers and consumers. It adopts an environmental communication theoretical framework where a model is suggested for investigating actors’ learning process <b>of</b> <b>biological</b> <b>heritage,</b> from agencies to producers to consumers. The results reveal three phenomenographic categories showing that agencies and producers understand <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> in terms <b>of</b> (1) cared habitat and cared species, (2) historical and cultural know-how and (3) animals and their tasteful diet, and it is showed that the necessity of a continuous, traditional human use was less put forward than the cultural dimension <b>of</b> <b>biological</b> <b>heritage.</b> Also producers communicate about <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> to consumers through both their products and their actions. Furthermore the results show that consumers’ understandings <b>of</b> <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> are similar to the agencies’ and producers’ phenomenographic categories and that they could make a link between artisan food production and <b>biological</b> <b>heritage,</b> but only to some extent. Finally, in order to create an economic value for such products, a sense of place for pastures is argued to be a basis for people’s willingness to take care of and safeguard pastures. This study can be the starting point for further research, especially for investigating how producers actually interact with consumers about <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> when selling their products...|$|R
40|$|The Brazilian Atlantic Forest hosts {{one of the}} world’s {{most diverse}} and {{threatened}} tropical forest biota. In many ways, its history of degradation describes the fate experienced by tropical forests around the world. After five centuries of human expansion, most Atlantic Forest landscapes are archipelagos of small forest fragments surrounded by open-habitat matrices. This ‘natural laboratory’ has contributed {{to a better understanding}} of the evolutionary history and ecology of tropical forests and to determining the extent to which this irreplaceable biota is susceptible to major human disturbances. We share some of the major findings with respect to the responses of tropical forests to human disturbances across multiple biological levels and spatial scales and discuss some of the conservation initiatives adopted in the past decade. First, we provide a short description of the Atlantic Forest biota and its historical degradation. Secondly, we offer conceptual models describing major shifts experienced by tree assemblages at local scales and discuss landscape ecological processes that can help to maintain this biota at larger scales. We also examine potential plant responses to climate change. Finally, we propose a research agenda to improve the conservation value of human-modified landscapes and safeguard the <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> tropical forests. C. A.

40|$|Objective of this {{research}} was to establish carcass composition in Turopolje pig breed by analyzing the percentage of muscle (M), fat (F) and bone (B) tissue, percentage of these tissues in different parts of carcass (ham, loin, back, neck, belly-rib part. BRP), as well as share of the parts in carcass. Animals were divided into two groups of different age and slaughtering weight (TI 584 ± 20 days and 81, 9 kg; TII 679 ± 20 days and 100, 3 kg ± 4, 9 kg). Purpose of this investigation was to define the standards for traits mentioned {{for the remainder of the}} population of Turopolje pig and to set the selection and production programs, as this breed has been under protection since 1993 and re-establishment since 1996 as cultural and <b>biological</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> Croatia and the World. In order to define Turopolje pig in production sense, we presented characteristics of the old breeds Mongolitza and Black Slavonian and some selected breeds. Pigs were fattened in the outdoor system of flood forests and marsh meadows biocenosis (Quercus robur. Deschampsietum caespitosae), according to traditional Croatian technology of low input (Ðikić et al., 2002). Slaughtering weight and weight of warm and cold carcass were measured on the slaughtering line. The halves were separately weight and dissected (tissues and parts) according to Weninger et al., 1963 and by total dissection. Data were processed by statistical-mathematical procedure GSM and SAS software package (1996) and results were compared within and between the groups (t-test). In groups TI and TII the percentages tissues in carcass were established to be as follows: M 38. 2 % and 40. 5 %, B 10. 6 % and 9. 7 %, respectively, and were significantly different (P< 0. 05), while share of F, 34. 2 % and 33. 8 % were not significantly different. Fattened pigs in group TI, in relation to TII, had lower relative share of muscle tissue in the carcass of loin, back, neck and BRP and higher share of fat tissue of neck and BRP, as well as bone tissue of leg and loin. Muscle : fat tissue relation established for groups TI i TII (1. 02 : 1 and 1. 07 : 1) are higher than in Mongolitza, but lower than in Black Slavonian pig and selected breed...|$|R

40|$|Biodiversity {{research}} {{is becoming increasingly}} dependent on genomics, which allows the unprecedented digitization and understanding <b>of</b> the planet's <b>biological</b> <b>heritage.</b> The use <b>of</b> genetic markers i. e. DNA barcoding, {{has proved to be}} a powerful tool in species identification. However, full exploitation of this approach is hampered by the high sequencing costs and the absence of equipped facilities in biodiversity-rich countries. In the present work, we developed a portable sequencing laboratory based on the portable DNA sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, the MinION. Complementary laboratory equipment and reagents were selected to be used in remote and tough environmental conditions. The performance of the MinION sequencer and the portable laboratory was tested for DNA barcoding in a mimicking tropical environment, as well as in a remote rainforest of Tanzania lacking electricity. Despite the relatively high sequencing error-rate of the MinION, the development of a suitable pipeline for data analysis allowed the accurate identification of different species of vertebrates including amphibians, reptiles and mammals. In situ sequencing of a wild frog allowed us to rapidly identify the species captured, thus confirming that effective DNA barcoding in the field is possible. These results open new perspectives for real-time-on-site DNA sequencing thus potentially increasing opportunities for the understanding of biodiversity in areas lacking conventional laboratory facilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how a select group of adults <b>of</b> African-American/Euro-American <b>heritage</b> came to choose or develop a sense of racial identity. The seven {{participants}} were women and men who ranged in age from twenty-one to fifty-nine, and who had chosen Black, White, or Mixed racial identities. Utilizing in-depth phenomenological interviewing, participants were asked how their life experiences had led them to choose a particular racial identity, how they experienced the world in light of their chosen identity, and the meaning which they made of their choice of identity given their actual <b>biological</b> racial <b>heritage.</b> ^ The data was presented as in-depth profiles taken from transcripts of the interviews for each participant. In addition, themes which emerged when participants were compared within and across chosen racial identity groups, gender groups, and age groups were highlighted. The factors which were seen as having the most influence on choice of racial identity were past and current cultural affiliations, early experiences and socialization, and physical appearance. Additional factors which played a lesser role in racial identity development included the nature and extent of individual political experiences or orientation, the nature of social values within a given historical period, the <b>biological</b> racial <b>heritage</b> <b>of</b> the individual, and a participant 2 ̆ 7 s sense of spirituality and connection to other social identities such as gender, religion, age, and ethnic identity. An individual 2 ̆ 7 s awareness of him or herself in relation to race and racism as outlined in existing racial identity development literature was described as another factor which could be utilized to understand choice of racial identity. Each of these individual factors was defined and arranged into a conceptual framework. The interconnections between some of the factors, such as culture and early socialization, were also explored. ^ The experiences of participants were compared with the processes of identity development outlined in select works on Black, White, and Bi-racial populations. The dissertation also presented a number of recommendations for individuals who worked with bi-racial people. ...|$|R

40|$|The South African government, {{as part of}} {{its efforts}} to {{mitigate}} the effects of the ongoing energy crisis, has proposed that biofuels should form {{an important part of the}} country’s energy supply. The contribution of liquid biofuels to the national fuel supply is expected to be at least 2 % by 2013. The Biofuels Industrial Strategy of the Republic of South Africa of 2007 outlines key incentives for reaching this target and promoting the development of a sustainable biofuels industry. This paper discusses issues relating to this strategy as well as key drivers in biofuel processing with reference to potential impacts on South Africa’s rich <b>biological</b> <b>heritage.</b> Our understanding <b>of</b> many of the broader aspects of biofuels needs to be enhanced. We identify key areas where challenges exist, such as the link between technology, conversion processes and feedstock selection. The available and proposed processing technologies have important implications for land use and the use of different non-native plant species as desired feedstocks. South Africa has a long history of planting non-native plant species for commercial purposes, notably for commercial forestry. Valuable lessons can be drawn from this experience on mitigation against potential impacts by considering plausible scenarios and the appropriate management framework and policies. We conceptualise key issues embodied in the biofuels strategy, adapting a framework developed for assessing and quantifying impacts of invasive alien species. In so doing, we provide guidelines for minimising the potential impacts of biofuel projects on biodiversity. ...|$|R
