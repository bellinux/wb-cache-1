5|$|The Cat in the Hat is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Theodor Geisel under the pen name Dr. Seuss and first published in 1957. The story centers on a tall anthropomorphic cat, who wears a red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat shows up at the house of Sally and her unnamed brother one rainy day when their mother is away. Ignoring repeated objections from the children's fish, the Cat shows the children a few of his tricks in an attempt to entertain them. In the process he and his companions, Thing One and Thing Two, wreck the house. The children and the fish <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more alarmed until the Cat produces a machine that he uses to clean everything up. He then says his goodbyes and disappears just before the children's mother walks in.|$|E

25|$|Group practices, {{which are}} {{restricted}} {{to the members of}} a kaula (family), include rituals, festivities, initiations and the secretive tantric sexual union.

25|$|Though {{there was}} a {{postmark}} which marked {{the release of the}} Nasik Overprints (1947), the first special (pictorial) postmark of Pakistan was the one issued on 9 July 1948.

25|$|The {{symptoms}} of mania are the following: heightened mood (either euphoric or irritable); flight {{of ideas and}} pressure of speech; and increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and hyperactivity. They are most plainly evident in fully developed hypomanic states; in full-blown mania, however, they undergo progressively severe exacerbations and <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more obscured by other signs and symptoms, such as delusions and fragmentation of behavior.|$|E
25|$|Sour {{and salt}} tastes can be {{pleasant}} in small quantities, but in larger quantities <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more unpleasant to taste. For sour taste this is presumably because the sour taste can signal under-ripe fruit, rotten meat, and other spoiled foods, {{which can be}} dangerous to the body because of bacteria which grow in such media. Additionally, sour taste signals acids, which can cause serious tissue damage.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1980s, Zhan Zhuang had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> {{more popular}} in other martial arts; many of whom, such as some schools of Chen style Taiji, {{borrowed}} these methods from Xing Yi schools.

25|$|Biosafety {{cabinets}} {{are used}} {{on a daily basis}} for hours. Besides protection of user and sample material, the human design factors (ergonomics) of the work <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more important. This includes reduction of the noise level (for a more convenient working atmosphere), a height adjustable stand or stool (for optimized sitting position), panorama side windows (more light within cabinet), 10°angled front sash (enables better sitting position) as well as strong light sources (better view within cabinet) to improve the working conditions.|$|E
25|$|Early {{acquisition}} of relative pitch allows for accelerated learning of scales and intervals. Musical training assists with the attentional and executive functioning necessary to interpret and efficiently encode music. In conjunction with brain plasticity, these processes <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more stable. However, this process expresses {{a degree of}} circular logic in that the more learning that takes place, the greater {{the stability of the}} processes, ultimately decreasing overall brain plasticity. This could possibly explain the discrepancy in amount of effort both children and adults have to put into mastering new tasks.|$|E
25|$|The musical {{notation}} (melekket) {{used for the}} chants, is not a typical notational system since it does not represent pitch or melody. Rather, it is as a mnemonic. Most studies conclude {{that there has been}} impressive consistency since the 1500s. It is likely that Ethiopian liturgical chants have undergone an evolution similar to that of European liturgical chants. It can be assumed that the notations have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more complex as time has passed. Regional varieties may have become standardized over time, and more symbols and segments of music have become available for composers.|$|E

50|$|The other monarchies of Europe looked {{with concern}} upon the {{developments}} in France, and considered {{whether they should}} intervene, either in support of Louis or {{to take advantage of}} the chaos in France.

There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.|$|E

25|$|The persecuted Christians fled to Roman territory, {{and were}} welcomed by {{the bishop of}} Constantinople, Atticus, who {{informed}} the Emperor of the persecution. The Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II {{was at the time}} deeply influenced by his religious sister Pulcheria, and had <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more interested in Christianity. The Roman-Sasanian relationship already had some friction. The Sasanians had hired some Roman gold-diggers, but now refused to send them back; furthermore, the Sasanians seized the properties of Roman merchants. So, when Sasanian ambassadors reached the Roman court to ask for the fugitives, Theodosius choose to break the peace and declare war, rather than giving them back.|$|E
