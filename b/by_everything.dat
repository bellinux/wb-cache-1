5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can be swayed <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E
5|$|American trumpeter Chet Baker {{recorded}} the tune in 1987 for the documentary Let's Get Lost (1989) {{and it was}} released on the soundtrack album. He also covered it in concert on June 14, 1987, in Tokyo, creating an extended version totaling seven minutes and fifty-three seconds. After his death in 1988, it was released on his posthumous album Chet Baker in Tokyo (1988). At a 1998 benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project in Concord, Massachusetts, ska musician Gwen Stefani sang it alongside a jazz orchestra. It was later included on the accompanying promotional CD for AT customers, titled Stormy Weather (1998). Other renditions were made by Kate Dimbleby and Jimmy Scott for their 1998 albums, Good Vibrations and Holding Back the Years, respectively. The Reputation featured it on their eponymous debut album in 2002, followed with covers performed <b>by</b> <b>Everything</b> but the Girl and Alison Moyet in 2003 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{originally}} considered reviving CBS's long-lost {{quiz show}} The $64,000 Question {{for a new}} era, with a new home on ABC. However, this effort's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British Millionaire {{was about to make}} its debut, he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show, and subsequently ended up receiving about eight FedEx packages from different family members, each containing a copy of Millionaires first episode. Davies was so captivated <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> that he had seen and heard, from host Chris Tarrant's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the $64,000 Question revival in favor of introducing Millionaire to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.|$|E

5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have any interest in auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

25|$|Ogre, Key, and Goettel later {{signed a}} {{contract}} with American Recordings and moved to Malibu, California to record The Process, a concept album inspired by 1960s cult The Process Church of The Final Judgment, with Roli Mosimann producing. The recording sessions were beset <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> from fires and floods to the Northridge earthquake, and Mosimann was eventually replaced with Martin Atkins. Atkins' presence exacerbated the rift that was forming between Ogre on the one hand, and Key and Goettel on the other. The band's bickering and excessive drug use made the recording process so long and costly that American reduced Skinny Puppy's contract from three albums to one. In 1994, Key and Goettel returned to Vancouver with the master tapes, but Ogre remained in Los Angeles and quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995. Goettel was found dead of a heroin overdose in his parents' home two months later.|$|E

Louis Joachim Gaudibert, an art collector, became Monet's first patron. Gaudibert helped Monet rent a house in Étretat for Doncieux and Jean in late 1868. Recovering from an episode of depression, Monet joined Doncieux and Jean at the house in Étretat in October, with Doncieux {{in the role of}} muse and life model.

500|$|Smith {{has said}} of his character: [...] "The Doctor is excited and fascinated by the tiniest of things. <b>By</b> <b>everything.</b> By every single thing. That's what's {{wonderful}} about him as a character. It's why children like him, I think. Because he doesn't dismiss anything. He's not cynical. He's open to every single facet of the universe." [...] In June 2010, Smith appeared on stage with Orbital, and performed with them {{a version of the}} Doctor Who theme, at the Glastonbury Festival. Smith hosted the Doctor Who Prom at the Royal Albert Hall on 24–25 July 2010. On the morning of 26 May 2012, Smith carried the Olympic torch in Cardiff, an activity which was noted by Doctor Who fans for its resemblance to a 2006 episode of the show in which the Doctor carried the torch. On 1 June 2013, the BBC announced that Smith would be leaving Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} 2013 Christmas special.|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Jean Bentley of MTV {{described}} [...] "Home" [...] as [...] "an hour {{of television}} {{better suited for}} Internet surfing than actually paying attention." [...] She criticized the songs as being unrecognizable to younger viewers, and called the main plots [...] "emotional doozies, with not much comic relief in between." [...] Bentley felt that Chenoweth was overused, and called her appearance in the episode [...] "nonsensical and unnecessary". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded the episode [...] "C". He felt that the three main plot strands were poorly balanced, resulting in an episode with [...] "powerful moments that drown as they're nearly subsumed <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> else going on." [...] VanDerWerff criticized Mercedes' storyline as being too abrupt, and deemed her performance of [...] "Beautiful": [...] "so forced that it loses any power it might have from what's a genuinely nice arrangement of the song." [...] Finally, he expressed his concern that the prevalence of songs in Glee may detract from {{the quality of the}} show. Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle also criticized the episode, deeming it the weakest of the series so far, and one that left him underwhelmed.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} <b>by</b> <b>everything.</b> By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it}} is very important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only influenced by music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right.

500|$|In 2001, McAdams {{made her}} {{television}} {{debut in the}} MTV pilot Shotgun Love Dolls as Beth Swanson, which was filmed during spring break from York University. She also made her Canadian film debut that year in the comedy My Name is Tanino. The Italian-Canadian co-production was filmed in Sicily when McAdams was 22 years old, and it marked her first time on an airplane. McAdams later earned a Genie Award nomination in her native Canada {{for her role in}} the drama Perfect Pie. In 2002, she made her Hollywood film debut with Rob Schneider and Anna Faris in the comedy The Hot Chick, which McAdams has described as a [...] "huge milestone" [...] in her career. She played a catty high school student who swaps bodies with Schneider's character, a small-time criminal. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times felt she [...] "emerges as a young actress of much promise" [...] while Christopher Tookey of the Daily Mail described McAdams and Faris as [...] "talents to watch, but they are let down <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> around them". The film grossed $54 million worldwide. Afterwards, McAdams returned to Canada to star as Kate McNab in Slings and Arrows, a comedy mini-series about backstage theatre life at the fictional New Burbage Shakespearean Festival. She was written out of the second season of the program following her success in the United States. She received two Gemini Award nominations for her work on the program, with one win.|$|E
500|$|Jay Park's {{music is}} {{generally}} contemporary R and hip hop, {{but he also}} incorporates pop, dance, soul, electronic and acoustic into his songs. Prior to debuting with 2PM, Park was coached vocally by former SOLID member and renowned R artist Kim Jo-han, also known to be the vocal coach of many idols in the industry. Kim {{went on to say}} that [...] " [...] has an appealing and unique voice" [...] and [...] "definitely stood out amongst the rest". Park began to write rap lyrics since eighth grade. Since becoming a solo artist, he has complete creative control over his music : he writes and composes his own songs, produces his albums, chooses the people he wants to work with, and participates in the mastering and mixing of his songs, something almost unheard-of for a singer in the Korean music industry. More than making hit songs, Park says he wants people to hear to his style of music, to make them listen to [...] "Jay Park-sounding" [...] music. Being fluent in both English and Korean, Park writes songs in these two languages. He admits that he is more at ease when writing songs in English than in Korean, as he started learning Korean in his late teens. Having grown up listening to music of American artists, he admits his music sounds more [...] "American" [...] than K-Pop, saying it is the style of music he wants to make, while still being recognized as K-Pop. His musical process starts by listening to a lot of beats sent by various producers, while thinking of what kind of song he wants to write, and eventually short-listing a selection of potential beats to work with. Then, Park works on the melody of the song, along with ideas and lyrics. He writes the hook of the song first, and finally the verses. Park is inspired <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> when writing songs : [...] "just listening to good songs, seeing a good live performance, having good conversations with people. Just everyday life". Some songs Park wrote are influenced by songs from other artists, for example, his song [...] "Turn Off Your Phone" [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: Jeonhwagireur Kkeonwa) from his album New Breed was inspired by Leessang's hit single [...] "Turn Off the TV ..." [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: TV Reurkkeotne) from their 7th album Asura Balbalta.|$|E

2500|$|Herzen was {{disillusioned with}} the Revolutions of 1848 but not disillusioned with revolutionary thought. He became {{critical}} of those 1848 revolutionaries who were [...] "so revolted by the Reaction after 1848, so exasperated <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> European, that they hastened on to Kansas or California". Herzen had always admired the French Revolution and broadly adopted its values. In his early writings, he viewed the French Revolution {{as the end}} of history, the final stage in social development of a society based on humanism and harmony. Throughout his early life, Herzen saw himself as a revolutionary radical called to fight the political oppression of Nicholas I of Russia. Essentially, Herzen fought against the ruling elites in Europe, against Christian hypocrisy and for individual freedom and self-expression.|$|E

He received a $2million deal plus a $700,000 signing bonus, compared to the $750,000 salary he had received from the Sox. Driven by the memory of an elementary-school report that he had written about Japan, he felt {{it was time for a}} change. [...] "I tend to make emotional decisions," [...] he said. [...] "I did it more for the life experience than anything else. And ever since I wrote that report, I’ve been fascinated <b>by</b> <b>everything</b> that an 8-year-old associates with a country far, far away."
