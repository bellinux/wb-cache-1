5|$|Caelum is a faint constellation: It has no star <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> magnitude4 {{and only}} two stars <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> magnitude5.|$|E
5|$|Coma Berenices is not {{particularly}} bright, as none of its stars are <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> fourth magnitude, although there are 66 stars <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars {{visible to the naked}} eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.|$|E

5|$|There {{are only}} three stars in the {{constellation}} <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> magnitude 4.5, and 37stars with a magnitude <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> 6.5. Leo Minor {{does not have a}} star designated Alpha because Baily erred and allocated a Greek letter to only one star, Beta. It is unclear whether he intended to give 46Leonis Minoris a Bayer designation, as he recognized Beta and 46Leonis Minoris as of the appropriate brightness in his catalogue. He died before revising his proofs, which might explain this star's omission.|$|E

5|$|English {{astronomer}} Francis Baily gave {{a single}} star a Bayer designation—Alpha Lyncis—while Flamsteed numbered 44 stars, though several lie across the boundary in Ursa Major. Overall, there are 97 stars within the constellation's borders <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> {{or equal to}} apparent magnitude 6.5.|$|E
5|$|In September 2017, NASA {{reported}} radiation {{levels on}} the surface of the planet Mars were temporarily doubled, and were associated with an aurora 25-times <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> any observed earlier, due to a massive, and unexpected, solar storm in the middle of the month.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{comprises}} about 99.86% {{of the mass}} of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.|$|E

50|$|In the {{traditional}} color wheel used by painters, violet and purple are both placed between red and blue. Purple occupies the space closer to red, between crimson and violet. Violet {{is closer to}} blue, and usually less intense and <b>bright</b> <b>than</b> purple.|$|R

5|$|There are 37 stars <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> {{apparent}} magnitude6.5 in the constellation; {{three are}} <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> magnitude4.5. 46Leonis Minoris, an orange giant of magnitude3.8, is located some 95light-years from Earth. At magnitude4.4, Beta Leonis Minoris is the second-brightest star {{and the only}} one in the constellation with a Bayer designation. It is a binary star, the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white main sequence star. The third-brightest star is 21Leonis Minoris, a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star of average magnitude4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with planetary systems, two pairs of interacting galaxies, and the unique deep-sky object Hanny's Voorwerp.|$|E
50|$|Its body is silver, {{somewhat}} darker dorsally; its colour is less <b>bright</b> <b>than</b> in Squalius valentinus.

Its scales are not deciduous.|$|R

5|$|While not {{a bright}} constellation, Corona Australis is {{nonetheless}} distinctive {{due to its}} easily identifiable pattern of stars, which {{has been described as}} horseshoe- or oval-shaped. Though it has no stars <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> 4th magnitude, it still has 21 stars visible to the unaided eye (<b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> magnitude 5.5). Nicolas Louis de Lacaille used the Greek letters Alpha through to Lambda to label the most prominent eleven stars in the constellation, designating two stars as Eta and omitting Iota altogether. Mu Coronae Australis, a yellow star of spectral type G5.5III and apparent magnitude 5.21, was labelled by Johann Elert Bode and retained by Benjamin Gould, who deemed it bright enough to warrant naming.|$|E
5|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{provides}} {{a rare opportunity}} to observe the corona (the outer layer of the Sun's atmosphere). Normally this is not visible because the photosphere is much <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> the corona. According to the point reached in the solar cycle, the corona may appear small and symmetric, or large and fuzzy. It is very hard to predict this in advance.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the {{farthest}} comet {{from the}} Sun discovered by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured cometary nucleus known after 95P/Chiron, and it was {{visible to the naked}} eye for twice as long as the previous record-holder. It was also <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> magnitude0 for eightweeks, longer than any other recorded comet.|$|E

50|$|WR 9 is {{a binary}} with two {{components}} {{in a circular}} 14 day orbit. The Wolf-Rayet component is often identified as the primary because it dominates the spectrum with its broad emission lines, although it is less massive, less luminous, and less visually <b>bright</b> <b>than</b> its companion. The companion is an approximately O7 star.|$|R
5|$|It {{was noted}} that the naming process would remain stalled without such rules, and that even with them, few of these bodies can be imaged with {{sufficient}} resolution to determine their shapes. Therefore, the IAU announced in 2008 that for naming purposes, a trans-Neptunian object will be {{assumed to be a}} plutoid if it has an absolute magnitude <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> H = +1 magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave nine stars Bayer designations, {{labelling}} them Alpha {{through to}} Theta, including two stars {{next to each}} other as Zeta. Gould later added a tenth, Iota Antliae. Beta and Gamma Antliae (now HR 4339 and HD 90156) ended up in the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930. Within the constellation's borders, there are 42 stars <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|The German {{cartographer}} Johann Bayer {{used the}} Greek letters Alpha through Eta to label {{the most prominent}} stars in the constellation. John Flamsteed gave nine stars Flamsteed designations, while one star he designated in the neighbouring constellation Crater—31 Crateris—lay within Corvus once the constellation boundaries were established in 1930. Within the constellation's borders, there are 29 stars <b>brighter</b> <b>than</b> or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{the nature}} of {{polarized}} 3-D projection {{requires the use of}} interposed filters, and the overall image is consequently less <b>bright</b> <b>than</b> if it were being normally projected. Silver lenticular screens help compensate by reflecting more light back than a [...] "modern" [...] screen would - the same purpose they originally served {{in the early days of}} motion pictures.|$|R
