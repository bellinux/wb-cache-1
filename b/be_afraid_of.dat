5|$|Dale {{has also}} made several film appearances. He {{appeared}} as the Romulan Praetor Hiren in Star Trek Nemesis, a part he got after the actor originally cast fell ill, and had small parts in films such as Hollywood Homicide, After the Sunset, and the minor part of General Ross in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Dale said his script for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was printed on tin foil so {{it was impossible to}} replicate, {{in order to keep the}} film's plot a secret. He appeared in four films released in 2011: A Little Bit of Heaven, Priest, Don't <b>Be</b> <b>Afraid</b> <b>of</b> the Dark, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, having joined late in the film's production.|$|E
5|$|The cast {{consisted}} {{mostly of}} unknowns, though Isabel Bigley, {{who had just}} originated Sister Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls, was given the leading role of chorus girl Jeanie. For Larry, the assistant stage manager {{who falls in love}} with Jeanie, they cast Bill Hayes, a well-known stage and television actor. William Tabbert, the original Lt. Joe Cable in South Pacific was considered for the part of Larry, but lost out because he was thought to be too tall to <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Mark Dawson, hired as the towering bully Bob.|$|E

25|$|Hengist {{was struck}} by terror at the news of Vortigern's death and fled with his army beyond the Humber. He took courage at the {{approach}} of Aurelius and selected the bravest among his men to defend. Hengist told these chosen men not to <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Aurelius, for he had brought less than 10,000 Armorican Britons (the native Britons were hardly worth taking into account), while there were 200,000 Saxons. Hengist and his men advanced towards Aurelius in a field called Maisbeli (probably Ballifield, near Sheffield), intending to take the Britons by surprise, but Aurelius anticipated them.|$|E
25|$|In {{basically}} {{all major}} primate taxa, aggression {{is used by}} the dominant males when herding females and keeping them away from other males. In hamadryas baboons, the males often bite the females’ necks and threaten them. Wild chimpanzees can charge at females, shake branches, hit, slap, kick, pound, drag, and bite them. Orangutans are among the most forceful of mammals. Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) exhibited aggression in almost 90 percent of their copulations, including when the females were not resisting. A possible explanation for aggressive behaviors in primates {{is that it is a}} way for males to train females to <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> them and be more likely to surrender to future sexual advances.|$|E

60|$|Men <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> dying, principally, I believe, {{because they}} fear the unknown. It {{is not that they}} <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the pain of dying. It is not that they <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> going to hell. Neither is it that they <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> not going to heaven. But when they think of {{actually}} dying, they feel as if to go into the next world was to be turned out into the dark night, into an unknown land, away from house and home, and all they have known and loved; and so they shrink from death.|$|R

25|$|On {{the first}} Friday after the siege, Uthman {{addressed}} the congregation in the mosque. After praising God and blessing and wishing peace on Muhammad, Uthman invited {{the attention of}} the people to the commandment in the Quran requiring the people to obey God, His Apostle, and those in authority among them. He observed that the Muslims had been enjoined to settle all matters by mutual consultation. He said that he had kept the doors of consultation wide open. All the allegations that had been levelled against him had been duly explained by him and shown to be false. He had expressed his readiness to solve the legitimate grievances of the people, if any. He observed that under the circumstances it was uncharitable {{on the part of some}} persons to create disturbances in Mecca. He said that he was not afraid of death, but he did not want the Muslims to be guilty of bloodshed. To him the solidarity of the Muslim community was very dear and in order to prevent dissension among the Muslims he had instructed his supporters to refrain from violence. He wanted the people to <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> God and not to indulge in activities subversive of Islam. He pointed out that the foreign powers smarting under their defeat inflicted by the Muslim arms had sponsored some conspiracies to subvert Islam. He warned the people not to play in the hands of the enemies of Islam. He appealed to the rebels to retire from Madina. He wanted the people of Madina to support the cause of truth and justice and withhold their support from the rebels bent on mischief.|$|E

500|$|The defense {{attorneys}} appealed their contempt sentences, which were handed out by Judge Medina under Rule 42 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The attorneys raised {{a variety of}} issues on appeal, including the purported misconduct of the judge, and the claim that they were deprived of due process because there was no hearing to evaluate the merits of the contempt charge. They argued that the contempt charges would prevent future CPUSA defendants from obtaining counsel, because attorneys would <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> judicial retaliation. The initial appeal to the federal appeals court was not successful: The court reviewed Medina's actions, and reversed some specifications of contempt, but affirmed the convictions.|$|E

500|$|According to Pelé, indoor {{football}} presented difficult challenges; {{he said it}} was a lot {{quicker than}} football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé accredits indoor football for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, indoor football allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14-years-old. In one of the tournaments he participated, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with fourteen or fifteen goals.
