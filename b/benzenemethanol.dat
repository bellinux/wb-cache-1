40|$|Zeolites are a {{well-known}} class of crystalline oxide materials with tunable compositions and nanoporous structures, {{and have been}} used extensively in catalysis, adsorption, and ion exchange. The zeolite MFI {{is one of the}} well-studied zeolites because it has a pore size and structure suitable for separation or chemical conversion of many industrially important molecules. Modification of zeolite structures with organic groups offers a potential new way to change their properties of zeolites, beyond the manipulation of the zeolite framework structure and composition. The main goals of this thesis research are to study the organic-modification of the MFI pore structure, and to assess the effects of such modification on the adsorption and transport properties of zeolite MFI sorbents and membranes. In this work, the internal pore structure of MFI zeolite particles and membranes has been modified by direct covalent condensation or chemical complexation of different organic molecules with the silanol defect sites existing in the MFI structure. The organic molecules used for pore modification are 1 -butanol, 1 -hexanol, 3 -amino- 1 -propanol, 1 -propaneamine, 1, 3 -diaminopropane, 2 -[(2 -aminoethyl) amino]ethanol, and <b>benzenemethanol.</b> TGA/DSC and 13 C/ 29 Si NMR characterizations indicated that the functional groups were chemically bound to the zeolite framework, and that the loading was commensurate with the concentration of internal silanol defects. Gas adsorption isotherms of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 on the modified zeolite materials show a range of properties {{different from that of the}} bare MFI zeolite. The MFI/ 3 -amino- 1 -propanol, MFI/ 2 -[(2 -aminoethyl) amino]ethanol, and MFI/benzenemethanol materials showed the largest differences from bare MFI. These properties were qualitatively explained by the known affinity of amino- and hydroxyl groups for CO 2, and of the phenyl group for CH 4. The combined influence of adsorption and diffusion changes due to modification can be studied by measuring permeation of different gases on modified MFI membranes. To study these effects, I synthesized MFI membranes with [h 0 h] out-of-plane orientation on α-alumina supports. The membranes were modified by the same procedures as used for MFI particles and with 1 -butanol, 3 -amino- 1 -propanol, 2 -[(2 -aminoethyl) amino]ethanol, and <b>benzenemethanol.</b> The existence of functional groups in the pores of the zeolite was confirmed by PA-FTIR measurements. Permeation measurements of H 2, N 2, CO 2, CH 4, and SF 6, were performed at room temperature before and after modification. Permeation of n-butane, and i-butane were measured before and after modification with 1 -butanol. For all of the studied gases, gas permeances decreased by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared to bare MFI membranes for modified membranes. This is a strong indication that the organic species in the MFI framework are interacting with or blocking the gas molecule transport through the MFI pores. A detailed fundamental study of the CO 2 adsorption mechanism in modified zeolites is necessary to gain a better understating of the adsorption and permeation behavior of such materials. Towards this end, an in situ FTIR study was performe. For the organic molecules with only one functional group (1 -butanol, <b>benzenemethanol,</b> and 1 -propaneamine), physical adsorption was found - as intuitively expected - to be the only observed mode of attachment of CO 2 to the modified zeolite material. Even in the case of MFI modified with 1, 3 -diaminopropane, only physical adsorption is seen. This is explained by the isolated nature of the amine groups in the material, due to which only a single amine group can interact with a CO 2 molecule. On the other hand, chemisorbed CO 2 species are clearly observed on bare MFI, and on MFI modified with 3 -amino- 1 -propanol or 2 -[(2 -aminoethyl) amino]ethanol. Specifically, these are carbonate-like species that arise from the chemisorption of CO 2 to the silanol group in bare MFI and the alcohol groups of the modifying molecule. The possibility of significant contributions from external surface silanol groups in adsorbing CO 2 chemisorbed species was ruled out by a comparative examination of the FTIR spectra of 10 μm and 900 nm MFI particles modified with 2 -[(2 -aminoethyl) amino]ethanol.

(Rose root or Arctic root or Golden root or Shrolo), {{belonging}} to the family Crassulaceae, is an important food crop and medicinal plant in the Indian trans-Himalayan cold desert. Chemometric profile of the n-hexane, chloroform, dichloroethane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and 60 % ethanol root extracts of R. imbricata were performed by hyphenated gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) technique. GC/MS analysis was carried out using Thermo Finnigan PolarisQ Ion Trap GC/MS MS system comprising of an AS 2000 liquid autosampler. Interpretation on mass spectrum of GC/MS was done using the NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Database, with NIST MS search program v. 2. 0 g. Chemometric profile of root extracts revealed the presence of 63 phyto-chemotypes, among them, 1 -pentacosanol; stigmast- 5 -en- 3 -ol, (3 β, 24 S); 1 -teracosanol; 1 -henteracontanol; 17 -pentatriacontene; 13 -tetradecen- 1 -ol acetate; methyl tri-butyl ammonium chloride; bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate; 7, 8 -dimethylbenzocyclooctene; ethyl linoleate; 3 -methoxy- 5 -methylphenol; hexadecanoic acid; camphor; 1, 3 -dimethoxybenzene; thujone; 1, 3 -benzenediol, 5 -pentadecyl; <b>benzenemethanol,</b> 3 -hydroxy, 5 -methoxy; cholest- 4 -ene- 3, 6 -dione; dodecanoic acid, 3 -hydroxy; octadecane, 1 -chloro; ethanone, 1 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl); α-tocopherol; ascaridole; campesterol; 1 -dotriacontane; heptadecane, 9 -hexyl {{were found to be}} present in major amount. Eventually, in the present study we have found phytosterols, terpenoids, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, alkyl halides, phenols, alcohols, ethers, alkanes, and alkenes as the major group of phyto-chemotypes in the different root extracts of R. imbricata. All these compounds identified by GC/MS analysis were further investigated for their biological activities and it was found that they possess a diverse range of positive pharmacological actions. In future, isolation of individual phyto-chemotypes and subjecting them to biological activity will definitely prove fruitful results in designing a novel drug...|$|E
40|$|Intravital {{microscopy}} {{technique was}} used to determine the distribution of a fluorescent plasma marker (fluorescein-isothiocyanate-dextran, 150 [*]kD; FD- 150) into venular and interstitial compartments of dorsal skin fold preparations in conscious hamsters. One mg[*]kg− 1 histamine (i. v.) caused a biphasic decrease in venular fluorescence due to FD- 150 extravasation in all organs (general extravasation). Immediately after injection, the venular fluorescence decreased and plateaued in 60 [*]min. Ninety minutes after histamine injection, venular fluorescence further decreased until 180 [*]min. Prior treatment with indomethacin (0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) did not modify the time-course of general extravasation but prevented histamine-induced venule dilatation. Prior treatment with the 5 -lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP) inhibitor, 3 -[1 -(p-chlorobenzyl) - 5 -(isopropyl) - 3 -t-butylthioindol- 2 -yl]- 2, 2 -dimethyl-propanoic acid sodium (MK- 886) (10 [*]μg[*]kg− 1, i. v.), the leukotriene receptor antagonist, <b>benzenemethanol</b> a-pentyl- 3 -(2 -quinolinylmethoxy) (REV- 5901) (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.), or the glutathione-S-transferase inhibitor, ethacrynic acid (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.), delayed by 60 [*]min the onset of general extravasation caused by 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 histamine. Prior treatment with lipoxygenase pathway inhibitors and NG-nitro-L-arginine-methylester (L-NAME) (100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) abolished the general extravasation and venule dilatation induced by 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 histamine. Injection of 1 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 (i. v.), of leukotriene-C 4 (LTC 4) or -D 4 (LTD 4) induced immediate and sustained general extravasation and reduction in venule diameter, these effects being blocked by REV- 5901. Histamine (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) induced biphasic decline in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). An initial phase (from 0 to 60 [*]min) was followed by a late phase beginning 90 [*]min after histamine injection. L-NAME (100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) and aminoguanidine (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) prevented the late phase of histamine-induced hypotension. Thus, plasma histamine can trigger both an immediate cysteinyl-leukotriene (Cys-LT) -dependent and a late nitric oxide (NO) -mediated inflammatory cascade. Although the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) pathway might account for histamine-induced venule dilatation, it would not influence histamine-induced extravasation...|$|E
