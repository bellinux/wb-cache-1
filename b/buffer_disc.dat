40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{for salmon}} prolactin (PRL) is described. This assay {{which is based}} on the sodium-retaining action of PRL in the hypophysectomized killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, has proved to be rapid, sensitive (250 pg PRL per gram of fish), and specific. The procedure has been used to characterize the biological activity of a highly purified PRL from the pituitaries of the chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tschawytscha, and a similar PRL isolated (by acid <b>buffer</b> polyacrylamide <b>disc</b> gel electrophoresis) from pituitaries of coho salmon (O. kisutch) (MW ca. 22, 000; isoelectric point greater than 9...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} ursolic acid alone/with {{colistin}} in perturbing membrane potential was evaluated using DiSc 3, a cationic membrane permeabilizing dye. Intact bacterial cells accumulate the dye in the lipid bilayer, resulting in quenching of fluorescence. When the membrane gets depolarized, dye gets {{released to the}} surrounding aqueous phase and fluorescence gets enhanced (Te Winkel et al. 2016). The fluorescent intensity (Ex 610 [*]±[*] 5  nm and Em 660 [*]±[*] 5  nm) of <b>buffer</b> with <b>DiSc</b> 3 (1  μM) was measured initially. Mid log cells were added, which reduces the fluorescent intensity due to accumulation of dye in cells. Colistin, ursolic acid and colistin with ursolic acid treatments were given and the resulting variation in fluorescence intensity due to various treatments was quantified using spectrofluorimeter (JASCO FP- 8500, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the formation and properties of magnesium (Mg) -substituted tricalcium phosphate, b-TCMP, its properties and potential as biomaterial for bone repair. b-TCMPs were prepared and characterized using x-ray diffraction, FT-IR and SEM. Dissolution properties were determined in acidic <b>buffer.</b> b-TCMP <b>discs</b> were implanted in surgically created holes in femoral and tibial diaphyses of rabbits. Results demonstrated that the formation of b-TCMP and Mg incorporation in b-TCMP were dependent on reaction pH, temperature and solution Mg/Ca ratios. Sintered b-TCMP was significantly less soluble than b-TCP. Implanted unsintered b-TCMP showed osteoconductive properties associated with new bone formation. This study suggests that b-TCMP (sintered or unsintered), alone or {{in combination with other}} calcium phosphates, may be useful as biomaterials for bone repair and maybe useful in cases where slower biodegradation than that of b-TCP is desired...|$|R

50|$|Mechanical noise: Hi-MD {{units are}} {{mechanical}} devices, and as such, emit a noise intermittently. A disc is read (or written to) in bursts. This {{means that when}} recording (for example), the audio data {{is fed to a}} memory buffer first, then written to disc as that memory buffer is filled. The audible manifestation of this is that a spinning motor noise is heard for a short period, followed by a far longer period of silence. Then some spinning whir again, then silence. The cycle is repeated. The same applies to playback, only differently: a disc is spun faster than required for normal playback (to fill the memory buffer), then stops spinning and the audio information is emptied (played back) from memory normally. As the memory <b>buffer</b> depletes, the <b>disc</b> spins up again, maintaining the fill of the memory buffer, only to spin down the disc again (into silence). The buffer memory allows the disc to spin down completely most of the time, conserving battery life. However, during live recording operations with a microphone, this can be a problem. If the microphone is directly connected to the unit (i.e. directly connected to the MIC jack without a wire), or simply close enough with a fairly quiet background, this intermittent motor noise can be audibly present in the recording—if some basic precautions are not taken. This contrasts with flash-based recorders with no moving parts for recording, which are able to record in silence with no self-noise.|$|R
5000|$|Most protein separations are {{performed}} using a [...] "discontinuous" [...] (or <b>DISC)</b> <b>buffer</b> system that significantly enhances {{the sharpness of}} the bands within the gel. During electrophoresis in a discontinuous gel system, an ion gradient is formed in the early stage of electrophoresis that causes all of the proteins to focus into a single sharp band. The formation of the ion gradient is achieved by choosing a pH value at which the ions of the buffer are only moderately charged compared to the SDS-coated proteins. These conditions provide {{an environment in which}} Kohlrausch's reactions determine the molar conductivity. As a result, SDS-coated proteins are concentrated to several fold in a thin zone of the order of 19 μm within a few minutes. At this stage all proteins migrate at the same migration speed by isotachophoresis. This occurs in a region of the gel that has larger pores so that the gel matrix does not retard the migration during the focusing or [...] "stacking" [...] event. Separation of the proteins by size is achieved in the lower, [...] "resolving" [...] region of the gel. The resolving gel typically has a much smaller pore size, which leads to a sieving effect that now determines the electrophoretic mobility of the proteins. At the same time, the separating part of the gel also has a pH value in which the buffer ions on average carry a greater charge, causing them to [...] "outrun" [...] the SDS-covered proteins and eliminate the ion gradient and thereby the stacking effect.|$|R
