In this paper is presented a numerical model by which the <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> can be predicted on the basis of known mechanical {{properties of}} tension and pressure. Determining the relationship between these properties is justified having in mind the mechanics of fracture during bending, where the fracture takes place on the outer layer which is subjected to bending while the break ends on the layer subjected to pressure. The paper gives the values of tension, pressure and <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> obtained by the corresponding mechanical test. A comparison of the numerical results of <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> obtained {{on the basis of the}} model with the experimental ones, shows their satisfactory agreement. Therefore, this model can be used for some future research to predict <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> without experiments...|$|E

Experimental sandwich panels (tnom= 29 mm) were made of two three-ply plywood panels and a rigid PVC core between them.

For this purpose, knot and MOE data were investigated for all pieces of lumber that were prepared for glulam manufacturing, and statistical distributions of knot size, knot number in one lumber, and MOE of each laminate were optimized as distribution functions. These knot and MOE data were used as input variables in the prediction model for <b>bending</b> <b>properties,</b> and were also used in generating virtual glulam using the inverse transform method. Prediction of <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> for glulam was carried out using the transformed section method, which is partially provided in ASTM D 3737 (Annex A 4). Predicted values were compared with those from full-scale four-point bending tests for 60 six-layered glulams with 10 different laminar combinations. Finally, the allowable <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> of glulam for each specific laminate combination were determined by calculating the fifth percentile of the modulus of rupture and the average modulus of elasticity from virtual test results of more than 1000 virtual glulams.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 It is {{difficult}} to treat the heartwood of many wood species with liquid preservatives using conventional liquid processes. Supercritical fluids (SCF) used as carriers of preservatives to impregnate refractory wood species may be an attractive alternative to conventional liquid carriers. While SCF impregnation has many potential advantages, some wood species exposed to elevated pressures can be subjected to excessive pressure gradients during treatment. These gradients can lead to treatment defects, such as collapse and splitting, and may also result in significant losses in <b>bending</b> <b>properties.</b> This study {{examined the effects of}} three treatment parameters on the <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> and the development of treatment defects in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), yellow poplar (Liriodendron tuhpifera), western redcedar (Thuja phcata), and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). Two rates of pressurization (0. 34, 3. 44 MPa/min.), two treatment pressures (10. 34, 20. 69 MPa) and two rates of venting (0. 34, 3. 44 MPa/min.) were examined on small clear specimens of each species using one treatment temperature (60 °C) and one treatment time (30 min.). SCF treatment of yellow poplar produced no significant reduction in <b>bending</b> <b>properties,</b> while <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> increased in Douglas-fir.

40|$|Abstract. The bending {{deformation}} of thermoplastic prepregs {{is one of}} the key deformation modes in the thermoforming due to its crucial role in the wrinkling occurrence. The influence of temperature is of main importance because the viscous effect of resin is temperature dependent and prepregs thermoforming is usually performed closed to resin’s melting point. The currently available bending test devices are not adapted for thermoplastic prepregs since these devices can only be operated at room temperature. To solve this problem, a new cantilever test with an optical measuring performed in an environmental chamber is proposed. The <b>bending</b> <b>properties</b> of PPS-carbon satin prepregs are measured at a series of high temperatures. It’s shown that the bending stiffness of the fore-mentioned pepregs is strongly affected by the temperature and shows a non-linear bending behaviour.
