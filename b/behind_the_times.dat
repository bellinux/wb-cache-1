25|$|Shielded by the Trust, Biograph {{had been}} slow to enter feature film production. It {{contracted}} with the theatrical firm of Klaw & Erlanger in 1913 to produce movie versions of the latter’s plays. Its first released feature, Classmates, came out in February 1914, after 69 other American features had been released in 1912–13. Distribution was hampered by Biograph using a special perforation pattern on the Klaw & Erlanger features that was incompatible with standard projectors, forcing exhibitors to lease specialized equipment from Biograph {{in order to show}} the films. With the exodus of the studio’s best actors to Griffith, Biograph was unable to develop a marketable star system as the independent companies were doing, and after the Trust’s fall, Biograph found itself <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>times.</b> The Biograph Co. released its last new feature-length films in 1915 and its last new short films in 1916. Biograph spent the remainder of the silent era reissuing its old films, and leasing its Bronx studio to other producers.|$|E

This changed in 1902, when Linotype lead-setting machines were brought in to set type mechanically. A landslide victory for the Liberal Party followed at the 1906 General Election, which heralded a new era for the Echo.

With increasing rents and criticisms from Giorgio Armani of falling <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> the number of tailors in Savile Row had declined to 19 in 2006, from approximately 40 in the 1950s. However, tailoring businesses have increased since 2006; as of October 2014, a local online directory listed 44 tailoring and clothing businesses on and around Savile Row. Some tailors had expressed concern in 2005 that an increase in commercial development in the area {{could lead to the}} death of the business locally, as tailors, many of whom traditionally manufacture their suits in their premises, in basement studios, could be priced out of the local property market. [...] The Savile Row Bespoke Association was founded in 2004 to protect and develop bespoke tailoring as practised in Savile Row and the surrounding streets. The member tailors are typically required to put at least 50 hours of hand labour into each two-piece suit. The Association, along with the owners, the Pollen Estate, is working in partnership with Westminster Council to protect the street's tailoring heritage under the Savile Row SPA (Special Policy Area).|$|E

These indicators modify the original inflation information.

The theory of linear filtration and its representation in the frequency domain is used. Under particular assumptions, in <b>the</b> <b>time</b> series of yearly inflation rate there can be spurious cycles and high-frequency motions. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> series of yearly inflation rate lags <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> series of instantaneous inflation rate about six months in low frequencies and <b>the</b> <b>time</b> series of monthly inflation rate lags <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> series of instantaneous inflation rate about half of the month in all frequencies. consumer price index, inflation rate, linear filtration, frequency analysis, spectrum, phase lag...|$|R

2500|$|The {{presidency}} banks dominated banking in India {{but there}} were also some exchange banks and a number of Indian joint stock banks.

2500|$|Early in his administration, Morrison {{supported}} {{the construction of}} a suburban-style black neighborhood named Pontchartrain Park, built public housing for low-income blacks, and spent money on street and infrastructure improvements in black neighborhoods. NORD built playgrounds, swimming pools, and recreational centers for African Americans. These actions earned him the enmity of hard-line segregationists. In 1950, he oversaw the NOPD's hiring of its first black policeman since the advent of the Jim Crow era in the late 19th century. These measures aside, Morrison remained committed to segregation and was known to use racial slurs in private conversations. The facilities he built in black neighborhoods were segregated and received inferior funding compared to civic projects in white neighborhoods. Historian Adam Fairclough interprets Morrison's building programs for blacks as a way of [...] "shoring up segregation" [...] by defusing dissatisfaction with inferior facilities. Many black leaders found him sympathetic but unwilling to take more meaningful action to address their concerns. Morrison's approach to race relations increasingly fell <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> as the Civil Rights Movement gained momentum.|$|E
