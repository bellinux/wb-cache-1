25|$|Drug-facilitated {{sexual assault}} (DFSA), {{also known as}} {{predator}} rape, is a sexual assault carried out after the victim has become incapacitated due to having consumed alcoholic beverages or other drugs. Alcohol {{has been shown to}} play a disinhibiting role in certain types of sexual assault, as have some other drugs, notably cocaine. Alcohol has a psychopharmacological effect of reducing inhibitions, clouding judgements and impairing the ability to interpret cues. The biological links between alcohol and violence are, however, complex. Research on the social anthropology of alcohol consumption suggests that connections between violence, drinking and drunkenness are socially learnt rather than universal. Some researchers have noted that alcohol may act as a cultural <b>break</b> <b>time,</b> providing the opportunity for antisocial behavior. Thus {{people are more likely to}} act violently when drunk because they do not consider that they will be held accountable for their behavior. Some forms of group sexual violence are also associated with drinking. In these settings, consuming alcohol is an act of group bonding, where inhibitions are collectively reduced and individual judgement ceded in favor of the group.|$|E

They must never trip at one-half of the nominal current rating, but must trip within 200 milliseconds for rated current, and within 40 milliseconds at five times rated current. [...] S (selective) or T (time-delayed) RCDs have a short time delay. They are typically used at the origin of an installation for fire protection to discriminate withGdevices at the loads, and in circuits containing surge suppressors.

40|$|Abstract]: Evidence from {{epidemiological}} {{research suggests that}} childhood exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is an important causative factor {{in the formation of}} skin cancer. A mathematical model was employed to investigate the effect of meal <b>break</b> <b>times</b> on solar UV radiation exposure to schoolchildren in Southeast Queensland for the month of February. The model incorporates UV irradiances measured continuously during daylight hours for a summer month in Toowoomba (27. 5 o S latitude) along with the anatomical distribution of UV to specific body sites measured with polysulphone UV dosimeters. The polysulphone dosimeters have a UV response approximating that of human skin and are calibrated for UV exposure against a calibrated spectroradiometer. This paper presents the results of the UV exposures to the nose, chin, forehead and forearm for different meal <b>break</b> <b>times</b> in schools. These UV exposures were reduced by a factor of up to 0. 8 by varying the school meal <b>break</b> <b>times</b> alone. Optimisation of the existing morning and lunch <b>break</b> <b>times</b> reduced the UV exposures in the school day by a factor of up to 0. 45.

2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or <b>break</b> <b>time</b> for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E

U-KISS promoted the album in the Philippines {{through a series of}} mall shows, wherein they sold more than 1,000 copies in one day which breaks the record of the highest sales in a launch, earning them a million pesos. Due to the said success, the group had their first major concert in the Philippines dubbed as U-KISS First Kiss Tour in Manila.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed The research question of whether there are any influences in the scattered or diffuse erythemal UV exposures to a horizontal plane over a five month period due to the change from standard time to daylight saving time, has been investigated by using physical measurements and applying them to both standard time and daylight saving time. The diffuse erythemal UV was considered for fixed lunch <b>break</b> <b>times</b> and fixed morning and afternoon <b>break</b> <b>times.</b> The cases considered were for groups of the population who are predominantly indoors and who spend their <b>break</b> <b>times</b> outdoors in shade. The biggest influence on the diffuse UV exposures of changing to daylight saving time is {{the timing of the}} outdoor meal and <b>break</b> <b>times.</b> The change causes a reduction in diffuse erythemal exposure for early or morning breaks and an increase in the diffuse erythemal exposure for late or afternoon breaks. Similarly, for the lunch <b>break</b> <b>times,</b> the changes in exposure are influenced by the timing of the break with respect to solar noon. Indoor workers who take their breaks outside in a shaded area may have a change in their exposure to diffuse UV due to a shift to daylight saving time, however the magnitude of this change and whether it is a positive or negative change in exposure will depend on the timing of the break. The increase in diffuse UV exposure due to the afternoon break may be negated by the decrease in exposure due to the morning break. In this case, the effect on diffuse UV exposures due to changing to daylight saving time will be minimal...|$|R
