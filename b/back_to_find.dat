Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up.

All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E

25|$|The show's opening credit {{sequence}} {{shows the}} Arthur Daley and Terry McCann characters negotiating over {{the sale of}} the white Ford Capri interspersed with still photos of the two main characters, highlighting Terry's credentials as a retired boxer and ex-convict, this presumably symbolising the characters' first meeting and the terms of their partnership. During the Dennis Waterman era, the closing credits consisted of a number of black and white (with blue tint) still photographs of Arthur and Terry together outside famous London landmarks, and a few hinting of (unseen) previous escapades typical of a standard episode plot. In the later Gary Webster series, this changed to Arthur and Ray walking along Southend Pier, over a mile long: at the end Arthur realises he has left his lighter {{at the other end of}} the pier and they start to walk <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> it.|$|E
25|$|Although outnumbered and {{occasionally}} checked by the stand of some Union brigades, the three Confederate brigades in action first drove the four Union brigades, three from Ayres's division {{and one from}} Crawford's, back across Gravelly Run. Then Stansel's brigade drove back Union Brigadier General Henry Baxter's brigade and a reformed part of Colonel James Gwyn's brigade still forward of Gravelly Run. The forward Union regiments of Baxter's brigade fell <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the remainder of the}} brigade had retreated. In an effort to rally Crawford's division, since {{it was too late to}} stop Ayres's division's retreat, Warren himself also came forward, grabbed a regimental flag and tried unsuccessfully to rally the retreating Union men. Warren's heroic effort was to no avail and he retreated across the creek, stopped the panic and had the scattered regiments reform behind Griffin's division. The last organized resistance across Gravelly Run was Colonel John A. Kellogg's brigade of Crawford's division which was driven back after a fighting retreat. Four Confederate brigades, only three of which saw any real action against V Corps divisions, had thrown back two Union divisions of over 5,000 men.|$|E

25|$|The Tidone River runs {{north into}} the Po west of Piacenza. With steep banks 2 to 3 metres high and a width of about , the stream has some {{defensive}} value. Like the Tidone, {{the bed of}} the Trebbia is filled with white stones. On 17 June at 8:00 am the French opened their attack against Ott's positions behind the Tidone. On hand were a total of 18,700 soldiers including Salme's Advance Guard. The French divisions were deployed with Victor on the right, Rusca in the center and Dombrowski on the left. Because of the wounds he sustained at Modena, MacDonald was bedridden in the village of Borgo San Antonio to the west of Piacenza. As senior officer Victor should have assumed tactical control of the fight, but he stayed in Piacenza, resulting in poor coordination of the French effort. Nevertheless, the determined initial assault ousted the D'Aspre Jägers from their west-bank positions in the hamlets of Agazzino, Pontetidone and Veratto di Sopra. As Dombrowski's troops mounted a flank attack to the south, the troops of Victor's division fought their way to the village of Sarmato where they were held up by an Austrian artillery battery and two battalions of the Nádasdy Regiment. Chasteler was with Ott when the French attack started. He urged Ott to hold as long as possible and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that his task force was hurrying on its way. At 1:00 pm Chasteler's men arrived and were thrown into the fight. Nevertheless, at 3:00 pm the French overran both Sarmato and its defending battery, forcing Ott's troops back to a position in front of Castel San Giovanni.|$|E
25|$|The protagonists {{make their}} way to Firsthome and the Court, but are treated there with {{relative}} indifference. They pick up a new friend, Roofshadow, and go northwest. They are captured by a group of evil cats called the Clawguard, and taken to Vastnir, an enormous mound far to the north, where the evil cat-god Grizraz Hearteater enslaves cats to take over the world, swollen in size and sitting upon a mound of dead and dying creatures. Tailchaser needs to alert the outside world and especially the court about his evil doings. Soon, Roofshadow creates a hole from above ground, and Tailchaser manages to escape, and races to Ratleaf Forest, where he asks a clan of squirrels to alert them for him in repayment for a debt contracted with their lord's brother. He feels guilty with Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow trapped in Vastnir because of him. He returns to the dreadful mound, where Quiverclaw and Prince Fencewalker, whom he had met at the court, come to the rescue. Lord Hearteater creates the Fikos, a dog-like monster of terrible power, out of the mound of dying creatures he had been sitting on. Tailchaser takes advantage of the chaos to rescue Pouncequick, Eatbugs, and Roofshadow. They go through the havoc of Vastnir, and lose Eatbugs, the mad cat, on the way. Roofshadow and Pouncequick escape while Tailchaser goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Eatbugs. He goes into a crevice and sees Eatbugs in a near-deathlike state, and feels dazed and confused. Upon Tailchaser's uttering a prayer to Lord Tangaloor Firefoot, Hearteater's brother, Eatbugs awakens, revealing himself to actually be Firefoot incognito. Tailchaser runs out of Vastnir at Firefoot's urging, and meets his friends, while Firefoot goes to deal with Hearteater, resulting in the destruction of Vastnir.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell’s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't let her in. Yet, she went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the door open and walked right in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E

Soon after arriving at the final objective, the rain stopped and in the better visibility, German machine-guns and field artillery began to fire from the right flank. At midday both flanks of the brigade were swung <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> neighbouring units, which the troops in the centre followed, {{under the impression that}} it was a general withdrawal and all the brigade ended up at the red line.
