5|$|A finite {{field is}} a set of numbers with four {{generalized}} operations. The operations are called addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and have their usual properties, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity. An example of a finite field is the set of 13 numbers {0,1,2,…,12} using modular arithmetic. In this field, the results of any mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) is reduced modulo 13; that is, multiples of 13 are added or subtracted until the result is brought within the range 0–12. For example, the result of 5×7=35mod13=9. Such finite fields can <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> for any prime p; using more sophisticated definitions, they can also <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> for any power m of a prime p'm. Finite fields are often called Galois fields, and are abbreviated as GF(p) or GF(p'm).|$|E
