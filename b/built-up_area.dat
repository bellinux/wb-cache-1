40|$|As an {{important}} anthropogenic indicator and human ecological foot print,built-up areas and its change {{is an essential}} information for environmental change analysis, geo-conditional monitoring and sustainable development. In the past, <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> and its change studies were mainly focused on a city, regional or nation scale, {{and it has not}} been possible to conduct a global <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> and its change analysis yet. This paper presented the methodology and results of the first global analysis of <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> and its ten year's change(2000 - 2010) using GlobeLand 30, China's 30 meter resolution global land cover data sets-. <b>Built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> change rate and increase proportion were the major statistical variables used for the statistical analysis. The result shows that the total area of the global <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> is 1. 1875 million km 2, covering 0. 88 % of the total area of the global land surface; the <b>area</b> of global <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> increased 57400 km 2 with the variation rate of 5. 08 % from 2000 to 2010;and China and United Sates are the top two countries having the largest increased <b>built-up</b> <b>areas,</b> i. e., accounting over 50 % of that of the global total; 50. 26 % of the total increased <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> comes from the arable land. These results provide reliable spatio-temporal information to the study of human domination of Earth's ecosystems and global monitoring...|$|R
5|$|The present-day {{northern}} border of Somerset (adjoining {{the counties of}} Bristol and Gloucestershire) runs along the southern bank of the Avon from the Bristol Channel, then follows around {{the southern edge of}} the Bristol <b>built-up</b> <b>area,</b> before continuing upstream along the Avon, and then diverges from the river to include Bath and its historic hinterland {{to the north of the}} Avon, before meeting Wiltshire at the Three Shire Stones on the Fosse Way at Batheaston.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} develop {{building}} inventory data for building damage assessment in Lima, Peru, distribution of urban growth is estimated by time-series analysis of satellite Landsat images. Spectral indices calculated from the images are used to evaluate changed areas from vegetated and bare ground <b>areas</b> to <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> Threshold analysis is performed to difference of the indices between the multi-temporal images to identify the spatial distribution of {{the expansion of the}} <b>built-up</b> <b>areas.</b> The result shows that the older <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> are widely distributed in the central part of Lima and the newer <b>built-up</b> <b>areas</b> are expanded to the northern, southern and eastern suburban areas...|$|R

It {{passes through the}} Woolhampton Reed Bed, another SSSI which consists of dense reed bed with smaller areas of tall fen vegetation and carr woodland. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting passerine bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.|$|E
5|$|Henry's burial at Reading Abbey {{is marked}} by a local cross, but Reading Abbey was slowly {{demolished}} during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. The exact location is uncertain, but the most likely location of the tomb itself is now in a <b>built-up</b> <b>area</b> of central Reading, {{on the site of the}} former abbey choir. A plan to locate his remains was announced in March 2015, with support from English Heritage and Philippa Langley, who aided with the successful exhumation of Richard III.|$|E
5|$|Melcombe Regis {{is thought}} to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, {{possibly}} either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the <b>built-up</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E

5|$|Weymouth is {{the largest}} town in the area, larger than the county town of Dorchester, which lies just to the north, and hence is a centre of {{activity}} for the nearby population. A steep ridge of chalk called the South Dorset Downs, locally known as The Ridgeway, separates Dorchester and Weymouth; they are less agricultural than the valleys in the centre and north of Dorset, but have dairy and arable farms. The nearest villages to Weymouth {{are part of the}} <b>built-up</b> <b>area,</b> including Wyke Regis, Chickerell and Preston.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opposite}} {{each other}} across the River Thames, Fulham on the north bank and Wandsworth on the south bank were historically isolated from each other; the nearest crossing points were at Putney Bridge to the west and Battersea Bridge to the east, both over a mile from Wandsworth. The fast flowing but narrow River Wandle at Wandsworth was well-situated for driving watermills, leading to the rapid spread of industry in the area during the 19th century. Nearby Battersea Railway Bridge opened in 1863, but as the local population grew and London's <b>built-up</b> <b>area</b> began to encroach during the 19th century, pressure from local residents and businesses for a road bridge to be built increased.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's <b>built-up</b> <b>area,</b> within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on one side, and the Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E

5|$|The London–Brighton turnpike {{ran through}} the centre of Crawley, forming the High Street and Station Road. When Britain's major roads were {{classified}} by the British government's Ministry of Transport between 1919 and 1923, it was given the number A23. It was bypassed by a new dual carriageway in 1938 (which forms the A23's current route through the town), and then later to {{the east side of}} the town by the M23 motorway, which was opened in 1975. This connects London's orbital motorway, the M25, to the A23 at Pease Pottage, at the southern edge of Crawley's <b>built-up</b> <b>area.</b> The original single-carriageway A23 became the A2219.|$|E
5|$|The Muntz Street ground, then {{situated}} on Birmingham's eastern edge and bordered {{on two sides}} by farmland, opened in 1877. It was a field with terracing round it which provided standing accommodation for roughly 10,000 spectators. A wooden stand was built and the terracing raised to expand the capacity to around 30,000, but eventually it proved {{too small for the}} football club's needs. They built a new stadium nearer the city centre, St Andrew's, which hosted its first game in December 1906. Muntz Street, by then in a heavily <b>built-up</b> <b>area,</b> was demolished in 1907 and the land used for housing. The street of the same name remains.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester spans , which roughly {{covers the}} {{territory}} of the Greater Manchester <b>Built-up</b> <b>Area,</b> the second most populous urban area in the UK. It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of high-density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but land use is mostly urban — the product of concentric urbanisation and industrialisation which occurred mostly during the 19th century when the region flourished as the global centre of the cotton industry. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs.|$|E

5|$|In 1837 Euston {{railway station}} opened, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself, {{and thus the}} station was built on {{what was then the}} northern boundary of the city. Other main line termini north of London soon followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were built outside the <b>built-up</b> <b>area</b> of the city, making them inconvenient to reach. Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had proposed the idea of an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant London main line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 to promote the scheme he commissioned the first ever traffic survey, determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City of London, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 travelled in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes.|$|E
5|$|Later in the year, the SER {{secretary}} Samuel Smiles {{looked for}} potential routes and decided the best location {{would be on}} the site of the former Hungerford Market adjacent to The Strand, and that the line should be directly connected to Waterloo, allowing a link with London and South Western Railway services. The Charing Cross Railway Company was formed in 1859 in order to build the extension, and the SER paid £300,000 (now £) in capital to help build this. The line towards Charing Cross was expensive to build as it traversed a heavily <b>built-up</b> <b>area,</b> which was exacerbated in 1862 when the company chose to upgrade the two running lines to three, and doubled the capacity over the bridge to four tracks. The bridge replaced the original suspension bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel which opened in 1845. Work began in June 1860 and took around three years. The old suspension bridge remained open until the new bridge was suitable to carry foot traffic. A trial run over the new line took place on 1 December 1863.|$|E
5|$|M-185 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan that circles Mackinac Island, a popular tourist destination on the Lake Huron side of the Straits of Mackinac, along the island's shoreline. A narrow paved road of , it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the Upper and the Lower peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and Michigan. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The City of Mackinac Island, which shares jurisdiction over the island with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission (MISPC), calls the highway Main Street within the <b>built-up</b> <b>area</b> on the island's southeast quadrant, and Lake Shore Road elsewhere. M-185 passes by several important sites within Mackinac Island State Park, including Fort Mackinac, Arch Rock, British Landing, and Devil's Kitchen. Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water's edge and woodlands outside the downtown area.|$|E
