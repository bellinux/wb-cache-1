5|$|I. valdensis, a {{renaming}} of Vectisaurus valdensis by Ernst van den Broeck in 1900. Originally {{named by}} Hulke {{as a distinct}} genus in 1879 based on vertebral and pelvic remains, {{it was from the}} <b>Barremian</b> stage of the Isle of Wight. It was considered a juvenile specimen of Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis, or an undetermined species of Mantellisaurus, but is indeterminate beyond Iguanodontia.|$|E
5|$|Spinosaurids {{appear to}} have been {{widespread}} from the <b>Barremian</b> to the Cenomanian ages of the Cretaceous, about 130 to 95 million years ago. They shared features such as long, narrow, crocodile-like skulls; sub-circular teeth, with fine to no serrations; the snout rosette, and a secondary palate which made them more resistant to torsion. In contrast, the primitive and typical condition for theropods was a tall, narrow snout with blade-like teeth serrated front and back. The skull adaptations of spinosaurids converged with those of crocodilians; early members of the latter group had skulls similar to typical theropods, later developing elongated snouts, conical teeth, and secondary palates. These adaptations may have been the result of a dietary change from terrestrial prey to fish. Unlike crocodiles, the post-cranial skeletons of most spinosaurids (except Spinosaurus) do not {{appear to have}} aquatic adaptations. Sereno and colleagues proposed that the large thumb-claw and robust forelimbs of spinosaurids evolved in the Middle Jurassic, before the elongation of the skull and other adaptations related to fish-eating, since the former features are shared with their megalosaurid relatives. They also suggested that the spinosaurines and baryonychines diverged before the <b>Barremian</b> age of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{is known}} from {{hundreds}} of individual specimens, of which over 75 have been assigned to the type species, P. mongoliensis. All Psittacosaurus fossils discovered {{so far have been}} found in Early Cretaceous sediments in Asia, from southern Siberia to northern China, and possibly as far south as Thailand. The most common age of geologic formations bearing Psittacosaurus fossils is from the late <b>Barremian</b> through Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or approximately 126 to 101mya (million years ago). Many terrestrial sedimentary formations of this age in Mongolia and northern China have produced fossils of Psittacosaurus, leading to the definition of this time period in the region as the Psittacosaurus biochron.|$|E
5|$|Three {{specimens}} {{have been}} assigned to Sinosauropteryx prima: the holotype GMV2123 (and its counter slab , NIGP127586), NIGP127587, and D2141. Another specimen, IVPPV14202, {{was assigned to the}} genus but not to the only species by Zhang and colleagues. The assignment of an additional larger specimen to S. prima, GMV2124, was later found to be in error. All of the fossils were found in the Jianshangou or Dawangzhangzi Beds of the Yixian Formation in the Beipiao and Lingyuan regions of Liaoning, China. These fossil beds have been dated to 124.6–122million years ago, during the late <b>Barremian</b> to early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|The Weald Clay {{formation}} {{consists of}} sediments of Hauterivian (Lower Weald Clay) to <b>Barremian</b> (Upper Weald Clay) in age, about 130–125 million years old. The B.walkeri holotype {{was found in}} the latter, in clay representing non-marine still water, which has been interpreted as a fluvial or mudflat environment with shallow water, lagoons, and marsh. During the Early Cretaceous, the Weald area of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent was partly covered by the large, fresh-to-brackish water Wealden Lake. Two large rivers drained the northern area (where London now stands), flowing into the lake through a river delta; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its climate was sub-tropical, similar to the present Mediterranean region. Since the Smokejacks Pit consists of different stratigraphic levels, fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the locality include the ornithopods Mantellisaurus, Iguanodon, and small sauropods. Other vertebrates include sharks (such as Hybodus), bony fishes (including Scheenstia), crocodiles, and pterosaurs. Members of ten orders of insects have been identified, including Valditermes, Archisphex, and Pterinoblattina. Other invertebrates include ostracods, isopods, conchostracans, and bivalves. The plants Weichselia and the aquatic, herbaceous Bevhalstia were common. Other plants found include ferns, horsetails, club mosses, and conifers.|$|E
5|$|P. lujiatunensis, {{named in}} 2006 by Chinese {{paleontologist}} Zhou Chang-Fu and three Chinese colleagues, {{is one of}} the oldest known species, based on four skulls from the lower beds of Yixian Formation, near the village of Lujiatun. While this bed has been dated differently by different authors, from 128Ma in the <b>Barremian</b> stage, to 125Ma in the earliest Aptian, revised dating methods have shown them to be about 123 million years old. P. lujiatunensis was contemporaneous with another psittacosaurid species, Hongshanosaurus houi, which was found in the same beds. It is potentially synonymous with H. houi; Sereno (2010), who proposed that Hongshanosaurus is a synonym of Psittacosaurus, opted to leave P. lujiatunensis and H. houi separate species due to the inadequacies of the latter's type specimen. One nearly complete skeleton of P. lujiatunensis from the same lower beds of the Yixian Formation had previously been classified in its own species, Psittacosaurus major, named for the large size of its skull by Sereno, Zhao and two colleagues in 2007. You and colleagues described an additional specimen and concurred that it was distinct from P. lujiatunensis. P. major was originally characterised by a proportionately large skull, which was 39% of the length of its torso, compared to 30% in P. mongoliensis, and other features. However, a 2013 study utilising morphometric analysis showed that the supposed differences between P. lujiatunensis and P. major were due to differences in preservation and crushing. The study concluded that both represented a single species.|$|E
5|$|Xu Xing, another Chinese paleontologist, named a {{new species}} of Psittacosaurus in 1997, based on a {{complete}} skull with associated vertebrae and a forelimb. This material was recovered in Gansu Province, near the border with Inner Mongolia. This species is named P. mazongshanensis after the nearby mountain called Mazongshan (Horse Mane Mountain) and has been described in a preliminary manner. Unfortunately, the skull was damaged while {{in the care of}} the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), and several fragments have been lost, including all of the teeth. The remains were found in the Lower Xinminbao Formation, which have not been precisely dated, although {{there is some evidence that}} they were deposited in the late <b>Barremian</b> through Aptian stages. Sereno suggested in 2000 that P. mazongshanensis was a nomen dubium, with no unique features that separate it from any other species of Psittacosaurus. However, more recent authors have noted that it can be distinguished by its proportionally long snout compared to other species of Psittacosaurus, as well as a prominent bony protuberance, pointing outwards and downwards, on the maxilla of the upper jaw. The maxillary protuberance is also now missing. Other features originally used to distinguish the species have been recognised as the results of the deformation of the skull after fossilisation. Sereno (2010) remained unconvinced of its validity.|$|E
25|$|Located {{in water}} depths of 50 to 75m, oil was {{discovered}} in <b>Barremian</b> deposits in 1971, then the Cenomanian section in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The Yellow Cat Member {{is named}} for {{exposures}} near the Yellow Cat mining area north of Arches National Park. It {{is limited to the}} eastern portions of the formation and is thickest near Arches National Monument. The member is composed of drab greyish mudstones and some lenses of sandstone. The mudstones were deposited on flood plains, and show evidence of ancient soil development called paleosols. The mudstones originated as flood deposits from river channels that are marked by the sandstone lenses. Radiometric dating places the Yellow Cat Member at 126 ± 2.5 Ma (<b>Barremian).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} Afrovenator were {{discovered}} in 1993 in the Tiourarén Formation {{of the department of}} Agadez in Niger. The Tiourarén was originally thought to represent the Hauterivian to <b>Barremian</b> stages of the early Cretaceous Period, or approximately 132 to 125 million years ago (Sereno et al. 1994). However, re-interpretation of the sediments showed that they are probably mid-Jurassic in age, dating Afrovenator to the Bathonian to Oxfordian stages, between 167 and 161 mya. The sauropod Jobaria, whose remains were first mentioned in the same paper which named Afrovenator, is also known from this formation.|$|E
25|$|The type {{specimen}} is STM1–3, a nearly complete and fully articulated skeleton {{that is only}} missing the extreme distal end of the tail. A total of 25 fully articulated caudal vertebrae are preserved {{and at the end}} three at most are estimated to be missing. The fossil was discovered in the Dawangzhangzi Bed of the Yixian Formation (Jehol Group), located in Lingyuan in western Liaoning, China. The Yixian Formation is an Early Cretaceous rock unit, dated to between approximately 129.7 and 122.1million years old, in the <b>Barremian</b> and Aptian faunal stages. The Dawangzhangzi Bed specifically has been dated to about 122 million years ago. STM1–3 is believed to be a sub-adult, with features including the incomplete fusion of skeletal parts during ontogeny. The holotype of Tianyuraptor preserves no soft tissues, unlike many other theropod specimens from the Jehol Group.|$|E
25|$|The {{oldest of}} these assemblages {{is from the}} Yellow Cat, Poison Strip and basal Ruby Ranch members. The small, Ornitholestes-like {{theropod}} Nedcolbertia and the brachiosaurid sauropod Cedarosaurus may be considered as relics, with their closest relatives in the Morrison Formation. In contrast, the polacanthid ankylosaur Gastonia and a yet unnamed iguanodontid are similar to related forms from the Lower Cretaceous of southern England. These dinosaurs show that the connection between North America and Europe still existed during the <b>Barremian.</b> All of this changes, however, with the upper dinosaur assemblage {{from the top of}} the Ruby Ranch and Mussentuchit members. This upper assemblage shows greater similarities with Asian dinosaur assemblages from the same time. For example, the primitive ankylosaurid Cedarpelta is related to Gobisaurus and Shamosaurus from Mongolia, but is more primitive than either because it has teeth in the premaxilla. The upper assemblage also has a tyrannosaurid, a ceratopsian, and a pachycephalosaur. Although not a dinosaur, the primitive mammal Gobiconodon is known from both Mongolia and the Mussentuchit Member. Evidence for a middle dinosaur assemblage between the older and younger ones is controversial because the evidence mostly depends on a single specimen of the ornithopod Tenontosaurus from high in the Ruby Ranch Member and the sauropod Astrodon from low in the Ruby Ranch. Regardless, the upper and lower dinosaur assemblages in the Cedar Mountain Formation document the separation of North America and Europe, the westward drift of North America, and its connection with Asia 10 to 15 million years later.|$|E
500|$|Mont Aiguille is a {{limestone}} mesa, previously {{connected to}} {{the main body of}} the high plateau of the Vercors Massif. [...] The summit is made up of lower <b>Barremian</b> strata, deposited during the Cretaceous period. This is the same as the plateau to the west, but not as the immediate environs: the lower slopes are composed of older Hauterivian strata. As easily observed, the bedding planes are all roughly level, although there is some inclination down to the north-east.|$|E
500|$|Baryonyx (...) is a genus of {{theropod}} dinosaur which {{lived in}} the <b>Barremian</b> stage of the early Cretaceous Period, about 130–125 million years ago. The holotype specimen was discovered in 1983 in Surrey, England, and the animal was named B. walkeri in 1986. The genus name, Baryonyx, means [...] "heavy claw" [...] and alludes to the animal's very large claw on the first finger; the specific name (walkeri) refers to its discoverer, amateur fossil hunter William J. Walker. Fragmentary specimens were later discovered {{in other parts of}} the United Kingdom and Iberia. The holotype specimen is one of the most complete theropod skeletons from the UK, and its discovery attracted media attention.|$|E
500|$|Amargasaurus was {{discovered}} in sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation, which {{dates back to the}} <b>Barremian</b> and late Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous. A herbivore, it shared its environment with at least three other sauropod genera, which might have exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition. Amargasaurus probably fed at mid-height, as shown by the orientation of its inner ear and the articulation of its neck vertebrae, which suggest a habitual position of the snout [...] above the ground and a maximum height of [...] Within the Sauropoda, Amargasaurus is most closely related to the Late Jurassic genera Dicraeosaurus, Brachytrachelopan and Suuwassea. Together, these genera form the family Dicraeosauridae, which differs from other sauropods in showing shorter necks and smaller body sizes.|$|E
500|$|Iguanodon ( [...] meaning [...] "iguana-tooth") is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur {{that existed}} roughly {{halfway between the}} first of the swift bipedal hypsilophodontids of the mid-Jurassic and the duck-billed dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous. While many species have been {{classified}} in the genus Iguanodon, dating from the late Jurassic Period to the early Cretaceous Period of Asia, Europe, and North America, research {{in the first decade of}} the 21st century suggests that there is only one well-substantiated species: I. bernissartensis, which lived from the late <b>Barremian</b> to the earliest Aptian ages (Early Cretaceous) in Belgium, Spain, and possibly elsewhere in Europe, between about 126 and 125million years ago. Iguanodon were large, bulky herbivores. Distinctive features include large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for defense against predators, combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food.|$|E
500|$|The {{only known}} {{skeleton}} (specimen number MACN-N 15) {{was discovered in}} February 1984 by Guillermo Rougier during an expedition led by the famous Argentine paleontologist José Bonaparte. This was the eighth expedition of the project [...] "Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America", which {{was supported by the}} National Geographic Society and initiated in 1975 to improve on the sparse knowledge of the Jurassic and Cretaceous tetrapod life of South America. The same excursion uncovered the nearly complete skeleton of the horned theropod Carnotaurus. The discovery site is located in the La Amarga arroyo in the Picún Leufú Department of Neuquén Province in northern Patagonia, [...] south of Zapala. The skeleton stems from sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation, which dates to the <b>Barremian</b> through early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or around 130 to 120 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|Amargasaurus {{stems from}} {{sedimentary}} rocks of the La Amarga Formation, {{which is part}} of the Neuquén Basin and dates to the <b>Barremian</b> and late Aptian of the Early Cretaceous. Most vertebrate fossils, including Amargasaurus, have been found in the lowermost (oldest) part of the formation, the Puesto Antigual Member. This member is approximately [...] in thickness and mainly composed of sandstones deposited by braided rivers. The Amargasaurus skeleton itself was recovered from a layer composed of sandy conglomerates. The sauropod fauna of the La Amarga Formation was diverse and included the basal rebbachisaurid Zapalasaurus, the dicraeosaurid Amargatitanis, and unnamed remains of basal titanosauriforms. The high diversity suggests that different sauropod species exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition. Basal Titanosauriforms showed proportionally longer necks, longer forelimbs, and broader tooth crowns than Dicraeosaurids and Rebbachisaurids, suggesting greater feeding heights. Amargasaurus probably fed above ground level at heights of up to , as evidenced by the anatomy of its neck and inner ear. Rebbachisaurids like Zapalasaurus presumably fed at ground-level, while basal Titanosauriforms exploited food sources at higher levels.|$|E
500|$|Istiodactylus {{is known}} from the Wessex Formation and the younger, {{overlying}} Vectis Formation of the Wealden Group on the Isle of Wight. These formations date from the <b>Barremian</b> to the lower Aptian ages of the Early Cretaceous, about 120 million years ago. It is uncertain from which of these formations the first known specimen was collected, but {{it may have been}} the Wessex Formation, where isolated Istiodactylus teeth have been found. The Wessex Formation consists of fluvial (associated with rivers) strata, and was deposited in a meander-belt river system which flowed from west to east and occupied the Wessex Basin. Hooley's specimens were from the Vectis Formation; these specimens are encrusted in pyrite, which is typical for fossils there. The Vectis Formation consists of coastal and near-shore deposits, which were deposited in an environment dominated by tides. During the Early Cretaceous, southern England would have had a mean temperature in the range of [...] The Wessex Formation would have had a semi-arid climate similar to the modern Mediterranean region.|$|E
2500|$|Fossils {{were found}} in 2010 in the Ifezouane Formation of Morocco. Fossil teeth from [...] the area of Nalut in northwestern Libya, {{possibly}} Hauterivian to <b>Barremian</b> in age, might be referable to S. imperator.|$|E

2500|$|The ever {{so popular}} and famous Iguanodon, {{at least the}} well-substantiated species I. bernissartenesis, would live from the late <b>Barremian</b> to the {{earliest}} Aptian ages in Belgium. As {{one of the more}} derived ankylopollexians, Iguandons would live in primarily Europe. [...] While their clade would die out around 125 million years ago, Hadrosauroidae are thought to originate in Asia around 122 million years ago. They would spread throughout Europe, Asia, and North America where they would live until 65.5 million years ago with the mass extinction of dinosaurs.|$|E
2500|$|The Itapema Formation {{is several}} {{hundreds}} of metres thick {{and consists of}} calcirudites (limestones) and dark shales. The calcirudite limestones consist of fragmented bivalve shells, frequently dolomitized and silicified. In more distal sections, the formation consists of dark organic matter rich shales. In the well 1-RSJ-625, the formation includes [...] of radioactive shales interbedded with carbonates. Theses facies are thought to represent a lacustrine environment. The organic matter-rich shales {{are one of the}} main source rocks of the Santos Basin. This formation is correlative with the Coqueiros Formation in the Campos Basin. The age of the Itapema Formation is <b>Barremian</b> to Aptian.|$|E
2500|$|The Poison Strip Sandstone {{was named}} for prominent, cliff-forming {{sandstones}} in the Poison Strip uranium district north of Arches National Monument. It is actually a series of sandstones that were deposited in river channels, and lesser amounts of mudstones and limestones that were deposited on the flood plain and small ponds. The [...] Poison Strip Sandstone may represent a meandering river complex. Based on {{the position of the}} Poison Strip between the Yellow Cat and Ruby Ranch members, it probably was latest <b>Barremian</b> to earliest Aptian. Carbonate growths appear on bones in the quarry from which Venenosaurus was extracted.|$|E
2500|$|By the <b>Barremian</b> (125-129.4 mya), {{there was}} already a pan-Laurasian {{distribution}} of Therizinosaurians. Since Laurasia was beginning to break apart during the Cretaceous, two theories have arisen to explain how therizinosaurians could have spanned across Laurasia. [...] One theory is that basal therizinosaurians were present on both Asia and North America before it began to drift apart, suggesting an emergence for Therizinosaurians of at least the Late Triassic. However, one obstacle to this theory is that it contradicts the current emergence date for therizinosaurians, which dates them to the Mid-Jurassic. A second {{theory is that the}} group dispersed between Asia and North America via a European land bridge during the Berriasian-Valanginian.|$|E
2500|$|The Barra Velha Formation is {{approximately}} [...] thick. In the proximal sections, the formation comprises limestones of stromatolites and laminated microbialites. In the distal sections, it {{is composed of}} shales. Interbedded with the laminated microbialites there are limestones with packstone and grainstone textures made up of algal clasts and bioclasts (fragmented ostracods). The carbonates frequently are partly or completely dolomitized. These facies represent a transitional continental and shallow marine environment. The age of this formation has been estimated to be Late <b>Barremian</b> to Aptian. It is correlative with the Macabu Formation in the Campos Basin, as both are typified by laminated microbialites and stromatolites. These limestones {{are one of the}} sub-salt reservoirs in the Santos Basin.|$|E

Within the basin, several highs are located. The Outer High, in the distal part of the Santos Basin, is the most prominent and extensive intra-basinal high with an approximate area of [...] The Outer High is likely a segmented series of rift fault-block shoulders which were uplifted and eroded during the Late <b>Barremian.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Found in Wyoming, {{the type}} species of Ankylopollexia, Camptosaurus dispar, dates from {{possibly}} around the Callovian-Oxfordian, about 156-157 million years ago. [...] While the clade clearly starts in North America, {{the rest of}} the members of Ankylopollexia spreads quickly to Europe and Asia. [...] Until about the Valangnian era of the Lower Cretaceous, it appears that only North America had ankypollexians. [...] But in the early 2000s, an styracostern iguanodont called Lanzhousaurus was found in the north-central Gansu Province of China. [...] Thought to have lived around 130 million years ago, the genus Lanzhousaurus has the characteristic larger lower jaw of ankylopollexians. But even before the <b>Barremian</b> age, there is an even more derived member of the clade Ankylopollexia found in England.

2500|$|Non-vertebrate fossils {{are more}} widely {{distributed}} in the Cedar Mountain Formation. These include the distinctive reproductive structures of fresh water algae that are called charophytes. Charophytes are so distinctive that {{they are used to}} correlate strata of similar age, and thus were used to show that the Yellow Cat Member was time equivalent to <b>Barremian</b> age strata in England. Ostracods, small crustaceans with clam-like shells, also occur in fresh water deposits, along with [...] "finger-clams" [...] or chonchostracans. Pollen have been found in the Mussentuchit Member and are important for reconstructing the environment. In a few places, large petrified logs are known, especially from the Poison Strip. These conifer logs are over a meter in diameter and indicate the presence of trees over 30 m (100feet). The distinct wood of the tree fern Tempskya is occasional found as well.|$|E
2500|$|... 4D Basin {{analysis}} of the Santos Basin has revealed insights about the interplay among the elements and processes of the petroleum system to assess source rock potential (vertical and horizontal distribution), thermal evolution of the source rocks, transformation ratio, hydrocarbon generation and charge, timing of migration, oil origin, quality, and volume of petroleum in the main reservoirs. In a basin modeling study performed in 2008 and 2009, a detailed facies model from the pre-salt section was built based on well data and conceptual models from seismic interpretation associated with previous knowledge of the tectono-sedimentary sequences of the Santos Basin. The predicted vitrinite map, integrated with all data, indicates that the Coquinas source rock {{in most of the}} eastern half area is in the main oil window, whereas the western half is in the late oil/wet gas generation window. In terms of transformation ratio, the <b>Barremian</b> and Aptian source rock systems in the area reached 70% to 80% today where the main depocentres are.
