40|$|Abstract. In {{this chapter}} we will present {{selected}} central {{elements in the}} theory of Duration Calculus and we will give examples of applications. The chapter will cover syntax, semantics and proof system for the basic logic. Furthermore, results on decidability, undecidability and model-checking will be presented. A few extensions of the basic calculus will be described, in particular, Hybrid Duration Calculus and Duration Calculus with iterations. Furthermore, a case study: the <b>bi-phase</b> <b>mark</b> protocol, is presented. We will not attempt to be exhaustive in our coverage of topics; but we will provide references for further study. Keywords: Real-time systems, metric-time temporal logic, duration calculus, decidability, model-checking, application 1 Introduction to Duration Calculus In this chapter we will introduce Durations Calculus (abbreviated DC) [72], present central elements of the theory, and show examples of applications. The aim is not to make a comprehensive presentation of the logic; but rather to cove...|$|E
40|$|The on-{{detector}} {{optical link}} of the ATLAS pixel detector contains radiation-hard receiver chips to decode <b>bi-phase</b> <b>marked</b> signals received on PIN arrays and data transmitter chips to drive VCSEL arrays. The components are mounted on hybrid boards (opto-boards). We present {{results from the}} irradiation studies with 24 GeV protons up to 32 Mrad (1. 2 x 10 ^ 15 p/cm^ 2) and the experience from the production.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{a way to}} verify {{real-time}} systems using untimed model checking tools through an industrial case study with standard SPIN. We introduce a class of DC whose formulas correspond to regular expressions over the set of special symbols, {{each of which is}} a state occurrence for one time unit or for less than one time unit. The length of a string reects a time constraints. These regular expressions can easily be translated into untimed automata or a SPIN model. Then, we can verify real-time systems {{in the same way as}} for untimed system with standard SPIN. The case study used in this paper is the well-known <b>Bi-phase</b> <b>Mark</b> Protocol.

40|$|We have {{developed}} two radiation-hard ASICs for optical data transmission in the ATLAS pixel detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The first circuit is a driver chip for a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) diode {{to be used}} for 80 Mbit/s data transmission from the detector. The second circuit is a <b>Bi-Phase</b> <b>Mark,</b> decoder chip to recover the control data and 40 MHz clock received optically by a PIN diode on the detector side. During ten years of operation at the LHC, the ATLAS optical link circuitry will be exposed to a maximum total fluence of 10 /sup 15 / 1 -MeV-equivalent neutrons per cm/sup 2 /. We have successfully implemented both ASICs in a commercial 0. 25 mu m CMOS technology using standard layout techniques to enhance the radiation tolerance. Both chips are four- channel devices compatible with common cathode PIN and VCSEL arrays. We present results from final prototype circuits and from irradiation studies of both circuits with 24 GeV protons up to a total dose of 57 Mrad. (3 refs) ...|$|E
