40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to systematically evaluate the accuracy of abdominal CT performed at different radiation dose levels for the detection of <b>body</b> <b>packs</b> in human cadavers, in comparison with the accuracy of abdominal radiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, differing numbers of <b>body</b> <b>packs</b> (range, 0 - 20) were placed in the alimentary tract of human cadavers and then underwent imaging with abdominal radiography and with CT performed at different radiation dose levels (ranging from the standard abdominal CT dose to the technical minimum dose). Depiction of <b>body</b> <b>packs</b> on abdominal radiographs and on each CT scan was assessed by two independent blinded radiologists, and the accuracy of detection of <b>body</b> <b>packs</b> was calculated. The radiation dose associated with abdominal radiography was measured, and the effective radiation dose associated with CT was estimated. RESULTS: The mean (± SD) effective radiation dose for abdominal radiography was 1. 4 ± 0. 3 mSv, whereas the mean effective dose of CT ranged from 0. 1 to 9. 6 mSv. Interobserver agreement for <b>body</b> <b>pack</b> detection was moderate (κ = 0. 51) for abdominal radiography and good (κ = 0. 72 - 0. 85) for CT.

Postmortem MR imaging displayed the rarely described hypointense appearance of the <b>body</b> <b>packs</b> in T 1 - and T 2 -weighted sequences.

She was being held because her abdomen was noticeably swollen (she claimed to be pregnant), and a search of her body had revealed that she was wearing two pairs of elastic underpants and had lined her crotch area with paper towels.

50|$|Cocaine can be snorted, swallowed, injected, or smoked. Most deaths due {{to cocaine}} are {{accidental}} {{but may also}} be the result of <b>body</b> <b>packing</b> or stuffing with rupture in the gastrointestinal tract. Use of cocaine causes tachyarrhythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure (hypertension), which can be life-threatening. This can lead to death from acute myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, or heart failure. Cocaine overdose may result in hyperthermia as stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is also inhibited by the cocaine-induced vasoconstriction. Cocaine and/or associated hyperthermia may cause muscle cell destruction (rhabdomyolysis) and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Individuals with cocaine overdose should be transported immediately to the nearest emergency department, preferably by ambulance in case cardiac arrest occurs en route. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, approximately 5000 deaths occur annually in the US due to cocaine overdose.|$|E

40|$|<b>Body</b> <b>packing</b> {{is a way}} {{to deliver}} packets of drugs across {{international}} borders by ingestion. The aim {{of the study was to}} provide an estimate of the medical risks of <b>body</b> <b>packing,</b> describe predictors for hospital referral in detained body packers and provide an estimate for the prevalence of <b>body</b> <b>packing</b> in the Amsterdam area. From May 2007 to December 2008, we studied medical records of body packers immediately detained after arrival at Amsterdam Schiphol airport, hospital records of both detained body packers and self-referrers at two emergency departments of hospitals in Amsterdam and records kept by forensic physicians in charge of post-mortem examinations of all unnatural deaths in the area (years 2005 - 2009). In airport detainees, the hospital referral rate was 4. 2 % (30 out of 707 detained body packers), the surgery rate was 1. 3 %. Significant predictors of hospital referral were delayed production of drug packets after arrest, cigarette smoking and country of departure. The surgery rate in self-referrers was comparable to the rate observed in those referred from the detention centre to hospital (30 % vs. 31 %). In addition, from 2005 to 2009, 20 proven cases of lethal <b>body</b> <b>packing</b> were identified. Based on our data, it is estimated that minimally 38 % of all incoming body packers were missed by airport controls. The risk for lethal complications due to <b>body</b> <b>packing</b> is low on a population basis and comparable to other studies. This also applies for the hospital referral and surgery rates found in this study. Cigarette smoking has not yet been described in the literature as a potential predictor for hospital referral in detained body packers and therefore deserves attention in future research.

40|$|Background: <b>Body</b> <b>packing</b> is {{used for}} {{international}} drug transport, immediate drug concealment during a police searching or introducing drugs inside prisons. Despite {{the high level of}} specialization of dealers who have started to manufacture more complex packs, up to 5 % of patients could develop intoxication due to pack rupture. Bowel obstruction is another acute complication. Case presentation: A 27 -year-old black male patient was sent to the hospital by court order for clinical evaluation and toxicological examination. The patient was conscious, oriented, had good color, normal arterial pressure and heart rate, and no signs of acute intoxication. Abdominal examination revealed discrete pain upon deep palpation and a small mass in the left iliac fossa. A plain abdominal radiograph revealed several oval structures located in the rectum and sigmoid. Fasting and a 50 g dose of activated charcoal every six hours were prescribed.

40|$|Background: During {{the last}} decade, {{increased}} rates of drug traffic {{have led the}} smugglers to use various methods. One of these methods of illicit drug smuggling is <b>body</b> <b>packing.</b> Smuggling by intra-abdominal concealment is called "body packing". In this research, mortality rate was investigated due to <b>body</b> <b>packing</b> in Tehran. Methods: A descriptive study (case series) was designed on all corpses referred to the Forensic Medicine Organization of Tehran between April 1999 - December 2000. Demographic data such as sex, age, marital status, addiction, job, education level, type of opioid and the weight, number of packets, and results of blood and urine morphine tests by thin-layer chromatographic method were investigated. Results: Continental system of law is used in Iran and 0. 06 % of the referred corpses to Forensic Medicine Organization of Tehran were body packers. There were 12 cases, {{all of them were}} men. The mean age of body packers was 43 years (range 20 – 62). The minimum weight of the packets was 20 g and the maximum weight was 1400 g (mean = 501 g). The minimum number of the packets was one and the maximum number of the packets was 48. Twenty five percent of the corps were putrefied and one corpse was mummified. None of the body packers had academic education nor were employed. Nine of them lived in cities. Twenty five percent of them were intravenous addicts. The corpses were found mostly in terminals (17 %), roads (58 %), and cities (25 %). Conclusion: Hospital physicians may neglect this type of gastrointestinal foreign body if they are not aware of the body packer syndrome. <b>Body</b> <b>packing</b> should be suspected in anyone with signs of drug-induced toxic effects after a recent arrival on city terminals or when there is no history of recreational drug use...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Body</b> <b>packing</b> is a {{distinct}} method of drug smuggling. Surgeons and intensive care specialists will be confronted with body packers when packets do not pass spontaneously and rupture, causing drug toxicity. CASE REPORT: We report of a 32 -year-old Liberian male who presented with abdominal complaints and anxiety after having ingested 50 cocaine-containing packets of which 49 had passed the natural route in the previous days. X-ray of his abdomen showed a structure possibly compatible with a packet in or projected over the stomach. We decided to transfer the patient to the operation theatre for surgical removal via gastrotomy. However, no packet was found. During his first day {{in the intensive care}} unit he did not regain consciousness. Repeated urine analyses for cocaine were negative. After one day he deteriorated: he needed circulatory support because of hypotension, without signs of sepsis. Repeated surgery revealed no packet. In the end he turned out not to be suffering from cocaine intoxication. CONCLUSIONS: When confronted with a case of <b>body</b> <b>packing</b> in which packets do not pass spontaneously and produce bowel obstruction or in which badly wrapped packets rupture, causing drug toxicity, it is of utmost importance to establish the nature of the packet's conten...|$|E
