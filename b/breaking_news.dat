5|$|A {{practical}} use for Twitter's real-time functionality is {{as an effective}} de facto emergency communication system for <b>breaking</b> <b>news.</b> It was neither intended nor designed for high-performance communication, {{but the idea that}} it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of the fifth day, the Pokémon News Flash reports on a <b>breaking</b> <b>news</b> story: a disc {{containing}} the unaired fifth episode of Pichu Bros. was dropped and lost by the delivery Magnemite {{on their way to the}} show's broadcasting studio. After obtaining a lamp from a friendly Duskull in the front lawn, the player takes a bus back to Mt. Snowfall, where the disc was presumed lost. Eastward are the Ruins of Truth, where the stubborn Ghost-type Pokémon Gengar blocks the player's path until it is scared away by the lamp. Inside the Ruins, Pikachu gets stuck inside a statue of the bat-like Pokémon Golbat. Upon being shaken free, the missing disc pops out. The player hands it back to Magnemite, who is waiting sheepishly outside, and heads home to watch the last episode, along with a video called Meowth's Party.|$|E
5|$|Quite often {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered <b>breaking</b> <b>news,</b> and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding {{the breaking of the}} record. Sports collectible dealers and buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia associated with such milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive {{to the way in which}} their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria that special balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E

40|$|Research on <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news</b> has {{extensively}} utilized undergraduates medical students, and physicians. No {{studies have}} examined how, or whether, psychologists are trained to <b>break</b> bad <b>news</b> and their current practice of <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news.</b> The purpose of this mixed method {{study was to explore}} the training and practices of psychologists in <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news.</b> Particular attention was paid to whether theory related to the “MUM effect” could explain the findings, and whether psychologists are being taught practical skills related to <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news.</b> ^ Results suggested that psychologists are more reluctant to <b>break</b> bad <b>news</b> than good news and support the existence of the “MUM” effect in a sample of psychologists. Anxiety was shown to moderate the <b>breaking</b> of bad <b>news,</b> with more anxious respondents being more reluctant, due to their concern for self/other and norms. Half the sample broke bad news at least monthly, indicated that they break diverse types of bad news, and that they received little training in <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news.</b> Psychologists also indicated that <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news</b> was an important skill to have and a need for training in this area. ^ The qualitative portion of the study examined the reluctancy of respondents in more detail. Reluctant respondents most frequently cited concern for self/others, context, and norms as the reasons. In contrast, respondents who were not reluctant to <b>break</b> bad <b>news</b> most frequently cited their concern for the recipient and experience as reasons. Both groups were asked about the positive/negative effects of <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news</b> and most indicated that it leads to intervention (+), positive coping (+), emotional distress (+) and it changes the therapeutic relationship (+ and −). Alternatively, the positive/negative effects of not <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news</b> were that the recipient is better off/keeps them safe (+), endangers the recipient/communicator (−), maintains denial (−), maintains unrealistic expectations (−), and changes the therapeutic relationship (−). Implications and suggestions for training and practices for <b>breaking</b> bad <b>news</b> are discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|The BBC {{and other}} DAB {{broadcasters}} have been encouraging DAB take up by promoting {{a number of}} features which are either new or improve upon former technology in their sales literature.

Broadcasters also state that DAB offers better reception, without the problems of interference that are more noticeable through analogue radio.

5|$|Sandy, Patrick, and Squidward {{arrive at}} a gas station and from reading a {{newspaper}} article, discover SpongeBob's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City. But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him, SpongeBob cannot remember who they are. Squidward hi-jinks SpongeBob's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor. Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again, Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob's head, which causes his memory to come back. Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs apologize to SpongeBob for selfishly running him out of Bikini Bottom and are happy to have him back. But even so, SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City. He changes his mind after a <b>breaking</b> <b>news</b> report comes on, saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens, and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back. SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again, much to his friends' delight. With a sigh of happiness, SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom. Upon hearing this, Squidward takes out his brain and drops it in a trash can.|$|E
