5|$|Many players {{prefer to}} play the Hammond through a {{rotating}} speaker cabinet known, after several name changes, as a Leslie speaker, after its inventor Donald J. Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating horn over a stationary treble compression driver, and a rotating <b>baffle</b> beneath a stationary bass woofer. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources.|$|E

NICMOS contained a heat sink of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the heat sink coming into contact with an optical <b>baffle.</b> This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E

Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E

In order to simplify the manufacture and improve the heat transfer performance, we have invented a combined multiple shell-pass shell-and-tube heat exchanger. The novel combined multiple shell-pass shell-and-tube heat exchanger (CM-STHXs) with continuous helical <b>baffles</b> in the outer shell-pass and other different <b>baffles</b> in the inner shell-pass was compared with conventional STHX with segmental <b>baffles</b> by Computational Fluid Dynamics method. The numerical results show that, under the same mass flow rate M and the same overall heat transfer rate Qm in the shell side, the CM-STHX with discontinuous helical <b>baffles</b> in the inner shell-pass has the lowest overall pressure drop DP, which was 13 % {{lower than that of}} the segmental <b>baffled</b> STHX; The heat transfer rate Qm of the CM-STHX with discontinuous helical <b>baffles</b> in the inner shell-pass is about 2 % and 12 % higher than those of the CM-STHX with segmental <b>baffles</b> and disk-and-doughnut <b>baffles</b> in the inner shell-pass. The CM-STHX with discontinuous helical <b>baffles</b> in the inner shell-pass has a much better heat transfer performance and can be used to replace the conventional STHX with segmental <b>baffles</b> in industrial applications to save energy, reduce cost and prolong the service life. vk 201...|$|R
25|$|<b>Baffle</b> Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} <b>baffle</b> is the segmental <b>baffle.</b> The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. <b>Baffle</b> spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of <b>baffle</b> is the disc and doughnut <b>baffle,</b> which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider <b>baffle</b> looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner <b>baffle</b> is shaped like a disk. This type of <b>baffle</b> forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut <b>baffle</b> generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

50|$|During {{the last}} three decades, the {{ecological}} impact of culverts on natural streams and rivers has been recognised. <b>Baffles</b> may be installed along the barrel invert to provide some fish-friendly alternative.

40|$|ObjectivesThe Fontan-type {{procedure}} {{has undergone}} 2 major modifications, including intra-atrial <b>baffling</b> and extracardiac conduit. To clarify {{the effect of}} these modifications on arrhythmia propensity, we analyzed chronologic changes in P-wave characteristics after atriopulmonary connection, intra-atrial <b>baffling,</b> or extracardiac conduit. MethodsA retrospective analysis was conducted on electrocardiographic data from 40 patients with tricuspid atresia who underwent the Fontan-type procedure and follow-up for greater than 5 years: 18 had atriopulmonary connection, 13 had intra-atrial <b>baffling,</b> and 9 had extracardiac conduit. The mean follow-up period in years was 19. 8 for atriopulmonary connection, 13. 3 for intra-atrial <b>baffling,</b> and 8. 0 for extracardiac conduit. We analyzed chronologic changes in P-wave duration, dispersion, and amplitude and prevalence of sinus node dysfunction. ResultsAtrial tachyarrhythmia was documented in 9 patients with atriopulmonary connection but not in any patients with extracardiac conduit or intra-atrial <b>baffling.</b> Both P-wave maximum duration and dispersion decreased slightly over time with extracardiac conduit but increased progressively in the intra-atrial <b>baffling</b> and atriopulmonary connection groups. Intra-atrial <b>baffling</b> resulted in significantly shorter P-wave duration than atriopulmonary connection, whereas extracardiac conduit had significantly shorter P-wave duration and smaller dispersion than atriopulmonary connection and intra-atrial <b>baffling.</b> P-wave amplitude decreased markedly immediately after surgical intervention with intra-atrial <b>baffling</b> and extracardiac conduit but remained unchanged in patients undergoing atriopulmonary connection. Sinus node dysfunction was found commonly in all 3 groups. ConclusionAfter intra-atrial <b>baffling,</b> patients increasingly had prolonged P-wave duration and larger dispersion associated with sinus node dysfunction, suggesting a propensity to arrhythmia, although less progressive than seen in those undergoing atriopulmonary connection. In contrast, despite an equal prevalence of sinus node dysfunction after extracardiac conduit, the lack of important changes in P-wave characteristics over time suggests that the extracardiac conduit procedure is the preferred option for optimal rhythm prognosis...|$|R
