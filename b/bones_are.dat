5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Excess calcium in {{the urine}} (hypercalciuria) occurs due to {{increased}} bone demineralisation with acidosis. <b>Bones</b> <b>are</b> mainly composed of calcium phosphate. The phosphate reacts with the acid, and the calcium is excreted by the kidneys.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the effect of preconditioning on bone breaking strength. Fresh, frozen, and oven dried <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> compared. Since the left and right tibias from chickens have a correlation coefficient of. 90 or greater for breaking strength of fresh bones, tagged paired <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> used. One <b>bone</b> <b>was</b> broken at one treatment and the other <b>bone</b> <b>was</b> broken at the other treatment, so each pair represented two of the three treatments and all possible combinations of treatments were compared. Only minor differences in strength between fresh and frozen were detected when fresh <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> used, but drying bones decreased their strength approximately 50 %. Male and female <b>bone</b> strength <b>were</b> the same after drying but significantly different before drying, so consideration must be given to the way <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> handled prior to testing...|$|R
50|$|The hyoid <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} included. The ethmoid bone (or {{a part of}} it) {{and also}} the sphenoid <b>bone</b> <b>are</b> sometimes included, but otherwise {{considered part of the}} neurocranium.Some sources describe the maxilla's left and right parts as two bones. Likewise, the palatine <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes described as two bones.|$|R
50|$|Dry <b>Bones</b> <b>is</b> an Israeli {{political}} cartoon strip {{published in}} the English-language newspaper The Jerusalem Post since 1973. Dry <b>Bones</b> <b>is</b> the work of Yaakov Kirschen.|$|R
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on which}} <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms. When available, the pelvis is extremely useful in the determination of sex and when properly examined can achieve sex determination with a great level of accuracy. The examination of the pubic arch {{and the location of}} the sacrum can help determine sex.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{several other}} bones, {{including}} a jawless skull, {{were found in}} a sealed closet in the Cathedral of Turku. These are {{also referred to as}} Henry's relics in popular media and even by the church, even though that designation remains speculative and the bones may have belonged to some other saint. The <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> currently stored in the Cathedral of Turku.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bone</b> Hill <b>was</b> named {{from the}} belief Indian <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> interred there.|$|R
30|$|Chicken bone powder (40 – 60 mesh): {{the meat}} residue, fat, and {{connective}} tissue on fresh <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> removed after cleaning with clear water. The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> soaked with gasoline {{for a period}} of time, then the grease was taken out by extraction solvent. The treated <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> washed again and dried. Finally, they were cut up to small pieces about 3  cm long and 1  cm in width, which the <b>bone</b> marrow <b>was</b> removed. <b>Bone</b> powder <b>was</b> obtained by smashing about 5  min with a high-speed multi-purpose pulverizer.|$|R
50|$|In May 1941, a human {{skull and}} some <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> discovered. On 21 May, the find was {{reported}} to the Fyns Stiftsmuseum. The museum staff were able to reconstruct the original position of the bones only because the blocks of peat containing the <b>bones</b> could <b>be</b> matched to the holes where they {{were removed from the}} bog. The skull and two <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> found at a depth of 2.5 m, but the majority of the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> found in a depth of 3 to 3.5 m, at a distance of 7 to 8 m from the other bones. A thigh <b>bone</b> <b>was</b> found a further 2 m to the southeast.|$|R
5|$|In {{comparison}} {{to those of}} Tachyoryctes audax, the nasal <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> larger and have angles at the sides. T.annectens, which is nearly as large, has smaller teeth and nasals; in T.rex, the basioccipital is broader, and the back part of the mandible (lower jaw) is better developed and has the capsule of the incisor placed further to the front.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow. The frontal <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> slightly rounded and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, not flat as in M.aelleni and M.manavi. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, {{pterosaur}} <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> {{discovered in}} Xinjiang by Chris Sloan. The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> first identified {{as those of}} a theropod; palaeontologist James Clark later recognized their pterosaurian nature.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> {{removed and}} {{examined}} in 1933, by the archivist of Westminster Abbey, Lawrence Tanner; a leading anatomist, Professor William Wright; {{and the president}} of the Dental Association, George Northcroft. By measuring certain bones and teeth, they concluded the bones belonged to two children around the correct ages for the princes. The <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> found to have been interred carelessly along with chicken and other animal <b>bones.</b> There <b>were</b> also three very rusty nails. One skeleton was larger than the other, but many of the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> missing, including part of the smaller jawbone and all of the teeth from the larger one. Many of the <b>bones</b> had <b>been</b> broken by the original workmen. The examination has been criticised, on the grounds that it was conducted under the presumption that the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> those of the princes and concentrated only on whether the bones showed evidence of suffocation. Thus no attempt was even made to determine whether the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> male or female.|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} is relatively narrow. The frontal <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> inflated and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is poorly developed. The middle part of the palate is flat, not concave as in M.brachytragos, M.griveaudi, and M.mahafaliensis. At the palate's back margin is a short, thick posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans may {{be killed}} for the {{bushmeat}} trade, crop protection, or for use for traditional medicine. Orangutan <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> secretly traded in souvenir shops in several cities in Kalimantan, Indonesia. Mother orangutans are killed so their infants {{can be sold}} as pets, {{and many of these}} infants die without the help of their mother. Since 2004, several pet orangutans were confiscated by local authorities and sent to rehabilitation centres.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon dated {{samples from}} the cromlech show the tomb was {{accessed}} by many generations {{over a period of}} 300–800years, and that the human <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> the disarticulated remains (i.e., not complete skeletons) of at least 40individuals: male and female adults, adolescents, children, and infants. One of the red deer bones has been radiocarbon dated to between 2750BP and 2150BP, showing {{that at least some of}} the bones entered long after the site had been deserted.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s William Royal and other scuba divers found {{artifacts}} and human bones {{from at least}} seven individuals in Warm Mineral Springs. A partially burned log found in association {{with some of the}} human <b>bones</b> <b>was</b> radiocarbon dated to about 10,000 years ago. If the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> the same age as the log, then the <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> the oldest known evidence of human occupation in Florida at the time. Bone artifacts recovered in association with the human <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> described as of [...] "Archaic period in the Americas-type". The <b>bones</b> and artifacts <b>were</b> apparently deposited above the water level in the sinkhole at the time.|$|R
5000|$|Bone tools. Deer, sheep, {{rabbit and}} other animal <b>bones</b> <b>were</b> also shaped for tools, such as {{stitching}} awls for making clothing, working hides and weaving. <b>Bones</b> <b>were</b> {{also used for}} scrapers and fleshers.|$|R
50|$|The first {{metatarsal}} <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> the <b>bone</b> in {{the foot}} just behind the big toe. The first metatarsal <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> the shortest of the metatarsal bones and by far the thickest and strongest of them.|$|R
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It has {{been attributed to}} adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although it was probably visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, and would not have caused a hunchback. The <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> those of a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E
5|$|The Plateosaurus skeletons in a {{clay pit}} of the Tonwerke Keller AG in Frick, Switzerland, were first noticed in 1976. While the <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> often {{significantly}} deformed by taphonomic processes, Frick yields skeletons of P.engelhardti comparable in completeness and position {{to those of}} Trossingen and Halberstadt.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{generally}} {{resembles that}} of the brown-tailed mongoose, but the rostrum (front part) is broad and deep, the nasal <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> broad and short, and {{the region of the}} palate is broad. The mandible (lower jaw) is robust and shows a high, steeply rising coronoid process (a projection {{at the back of the}} bone). Statistical analysis of measurements of the skulls and teeth strongly separates S.durrelli from specimens of the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5000|$|Donor bone or {{autologous}} bone (harvested {{from the}} same person undergoing the surgery) {{is used as a}} stimulus to bone healing. The presence of the <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> thought to cause stem cells in the circulation and marrow to form cartilage, which then turns to bone, instead of a fibrous scar that forms to heal all other tissues of the body. <b>Bone</b> <b>is</b> the only tissue that can heal without a fibrous scar. Autologus <b>bone</b> graft <b>is</b> the [...] "gold standard" [...] treatment of the non union the <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> obtained from the iliac crest [...]|$|R
40|$|The main {{function}} of <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> to promote locomotion {{and protection of}} vital organs. <b>Bone</b> <b>is</b> also an important mineral ions reservoir, essential to maintain phosphocalcic homeostasis. <b>Bone</b> mineral <b>is</b> a calcium phosphate named “apatite”, which form naturally in the Earth’s crust (Wopenka & Pasteris 2005).

50|$|The {{occipital}} plane 3 of the squamous {{part of the}} occipital <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> {{developed in}} membrane, and may remain separate throughout life when it constitutes the interparietal bone; {{the rest of the}} <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> developed in cartilage.|$|R
5|$|The skull is {{somewhat}} {{smaller than that}} of N.matroka and the braincase and palate are narrower. Compared to N.somalica, the skull is broader. The ridge on the lacrimal bone is better developed, the palate is broader, the frontal bones contain a depression and are swollen at the sides, the mastoid <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> smaller, and the coronoid and angular processes of the mandible (lower jaw) are more prominent.|$|E
5|$|The {{stock is}} {{typically}} made by boiling meat, bones, or both. Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame. Marrow <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> considered best for the bone stock. Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours, whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare. Meat and <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock. Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat, while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute forest mushroom broth for the stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{three small}} {{bones in the}} middle ear of mammals {{including}} humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The malleus and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the articular) in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these <b>bones</b> <b>are</b> homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
5000|$|Two of his sons, Henry Pierce Bone and Robert Trewick <b>Bone,</b> <b>were</b> also notable enamellists. Another son, Thomas <b>Bone,</b> <b>was</b> a {{midshipman}} who was wrecked {{and drowned}} in a sloop called [...] "Racehorse" [...] off the Isle of Man, while yet another, Peter <b>Bone,</b> <b>was</b> a {{lieutenant in the}} 36th Regiment, who was wounded at the Battle of Toulouse and died soon after returning to England. A fifth son was called to the bar.|$|R
40|$|What would life <b>be</b> without <b>bone?</b> <b>Bone</b> (greek “osteo”) <b>is</b> a dense {{connective}} tissue, {{which enables}} locomotion, gives shape to a body, protects vital organs and harbours hematopoietic stem cells, which continuously produce new blood cells. Additionally, <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> used as reservoir for calcium and phosphates {{and helps to}} maintain stable blood levels of those ions. Bone consists of two tissues: cortical bone (80 %) and trabecular bone (20 %). The cortical <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> a compact tissue with a porosity of 5 - 30 %. Within the cavity of cortical bone the <b>bone</b> marrow <b>is</b> located. Those cavities are partially supported by a spongy-like network of trabecular bone. The porosity of trabecular <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> 30 - 90 %, depending on the location. By having a strong sponge-like inner network of trabecular bone {{the strength of the}} cortical <b>bone</b> <b>is</b> maximized...|$|R
