40|$|BACKGROUND: Natural {{surfactant}} {{combined with}} <b>beclomethasone</b> decreases pulmonary oxidative stress in preterm lambs with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). OBJECTIVES: To test {{the hypothesis that}} this occurs through a decrease in pulmonary inflammation. METHODS: Preterm lambs received 200 mg/kg of natural surfactant or 200 mg/kg of natural surfactant combined with 400 or 800 μg/kg of <b>beclomethasone.</b> Interleukin 8 (IL- 8) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were assayed in bronchial aspirate samples and lung mechanics were evaluated. RESULTS: IL- 8 increased in all the groups, but the increase was lower in the groups treated with surfactant plus 400 and 800 μg/kg of <b>beclomethasone.</b> MIF decreased in the surfactant group, did not vary in the surfactant plus 400 μg/kg <b>beclomethasone</b> group, and decreased in the surfactant plus 800 μg/kg <b>beclomethasone</b> group. MIF concentration was higher in the surfactant plus 800 μg/kg <b>beclomethasone</b> group than in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Natural surfactant combined with <b>beclomethasone</b> at 800 μg/kg is effective in reducing lung inflammation in an animal model of RDS, thus explaining the associated decrease in lung oxidative stress. The increase in MIF in animals treated with surfactant plus 800 μg/kg of <b>beclomethasone</b> might be an important maturative and protective factor for neonatal lungs...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLung {{deposition}} {{is crucial}} for asthma treatment. However, there is no study comparing the potential role of lung co-deposition of combination therapy (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β 2 agonist) in the same inhaler. In moderate to severe asthmatics, an extra-fine hydrofluoroalkane combination of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate and formoterol given via a single pressurised metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) was compared with <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) pMDI and formoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) given via separate inhalers. MethodsIn a double-blind, double-dummy, 24 -week randomised clinical trial, 645 patients with moderate to severe asthma uncontrolled by regular treatment with inhaled corticosteroids received regular treatment with extra-fine fixed combination <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 200 μg/formoterol 12 μg bid, or <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate (500 μg bid) via CFC pMDI and formoterol (12 μg bid) via DPI, or <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate (500 μg bid) via CFC pMDI. The primary outcome was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF). Secondary outcomes included lung function measured at clinic, asthma symptoms and control, exacerbations. ResultsBeclomethasone dipropionate/formoterol combination via single inhaler or via separate inhalers improved morning PEF. However, the combination via single inhaler was more effective than given via separate inhalers for asthma control. Both combination treatments were superior to <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate alone in improving lung function and asthma control. All treatments were well tolerated. InterpretationIn patients with moderate to severe asthma, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate/formoterol in a single inhaler was as effective as <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate plus formoterol and superior to <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate alone in improving lung function.

Methods: We conducted a 6 -month, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, parallel-group trial. After a 4 -week run-in, patients with mild asthma were randomly assigned to receive one of four inhaled treatments: placebo twice daily plus 250 microg of <b>beclomethasone</b> and 100 microg of albuterol in a single inhaler as needed (as-needed combination therapy); placebo twice daily plus 100 microg of albuterol as needed (as-needed albuterol therapy); 250 microg of <b>beclomethasone</b> twice daily and 100 microg of albuterol as needed (regular <b>beclomethasone</b> therapy); or 250 microg of <b>beclomethasone</b> and 100 microg of albuterol in a single inhaler twice daily plus 100 microg of albuterol as needed (regular combination therapy). The primary outcome was the morning peak expiratory flow rate. Results: In 455 patients with mild asthma who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 2. 96 liters (88. 36 % of the predicted value), the morning peak expiratory flow rate during the last 2 weeks of the 6 -month treatment was higher (P= 0. 04) and the number of exacerbations during the 6 -month treatment was lower (P= 0. 002) in the as-needed combination therapy group than in the as-needed albuterol therapy group, but the values in the as-needed combination therapy group were not significantly different from those in the groups receiving regular <b>beclomethasone</b> therapy or regular combination therapy.

To evaluate potential effects of residual drugs on fish, we conducted a 14 day flow-through exposure experiment with BDP and <b>beclomethasone</b> using rainbow trout, and analyzed effects on plasma glucose, hepatic glutathione and catalase activity together with water and body concentrations of the BDP, BMP and <b>beclomethasone.</b> We also analyzed hepatic gene expression in BDP-exposed fish by microarray and quantitative PCR. <b>Beclomethasone</b> (up to 0. 65 μg/L) was not taken up in the fish while BDP (0. 65 and 0. 07 μg/L) resulted in accumulation of both <b>beclomethasone,</b> BMP and BDP in plasma, reaching levels up {{to those found in}} humans during therapy. Accordingly, exposure to 0. 65 μg/L of BDP significantly increased blood glucose as well as oxidized glutathione levels and catalase activity in the liver. Exposure to <b>beclomethasone</b> or the low concentration of BDP had no effect on these endpoints. Both exposure concentrations of BDP resulted in significantly higher transcript abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase involved in gluconeogenesis, and of genes involved in immune responses. As only the rapidly metabolized prodrug was potent in fish, the environmental risks {{associated with the use of}} BDP are probably small. However, the observed physiological effects in fish of BDP at plasma concentrations known to affect human physiology provides valuable input to the development of read-across approaches in the identification of pharmaceuticals of environmental concern...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the efficacy and safety of a new inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate at a total daily dose of 200 micrograms, with <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 400 micrograms/day in childhood asthma. A total of 398 asthmatic children (aged 4 - 19 years) were randomised to receive either fluticasone propionate 200 micrograms daily or <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 400 micrograms daily for six weeks inhaled via a spacer device from a metered dose inhaler. During the study the patients recorded morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), symptom scores, and use of beta 2 agonist rescue medication. In addition, clinic visit PEFR and forced expiratory volume in one second were measured. Safety was assessed by recording all adverse events and by performing routine biochemistry and haematology screens including plasma cortisol concentration before and after treatment. For the purposes of analysis the diary card data were grouped into three periods: week 3 (days 15 - 21), week 6 (days 36 - 42), and weeks 1 - 6 (days 1 - 42). The results showed no significant difference between treatments on most efficacy parameters. However, there were significant differences in changes from baseline in favour of fluticasone propionate for % predicted morning PEFR both at week 3 (fluticasone propionate 6. 1 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 3. 9 %) and at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 8. 3 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 5. 9 %) and % predicted evening PEFR at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 7. 3 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 4. 9 % and over weeks 1 - 6 (fluticasone propionate 5. 5 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 3. 6 %. Comparison between groups showed that the group receiving fluticasone propionate had a lower % of days with symptom-free exercise at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 87 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 81 %) and % days without rescue medication at week 6 (fluticasone propionate 87 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 80 %) and over weeks 1 - 6 (fluticasone propionate 80 %, <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 73 %). Except for a higher incidence of sore throat in the fluticasone propionate group, the two treatments did not differ with regard to safety. There was no evidence of adrenal suppression with either treatment. In conclusion, fluticasone propionate 200 microgram daily ws at least as effective and as well tolerated as <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate 400 microgram daily in childhood asthma...|$|E
40|$|Background: Steroids, the {{mainstay}} of Crohn's disease treatment, {{have been associated with}} systemic side effects. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate for maintaining remission induced by a short course of systemic steroids in patients with Crohn's ileitis with or without right colonic involvement. Methods: Patients (n = 84) with active Crohn's disease who achieved remission during a 2 -week prednisone run-in period were randomised to receive <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate for 24 weeks or continue prednisone for a further 2 weeks followed by placebo for 22 weeks. The primary outcome was relapse rate (Crohn's Disease Activity Index score > 150 and an increase of >= 60 points from baseline) or withdrawal due to disease deterioration. Results: The relapse rate was 23. 3 % and 53. 8 % in <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0. 027). According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the cumulative relapse rate was 38. 0 % in the <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate group and 56. 0 % in the placebo group (p = 0. 025). Six percent and 1. 7 % of all adverse events in the <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate and placebo groups, respectively, were endocrine-related. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate significantly reduces the relapse rate in post-active Crohn's ileitis patients compared with placebo after induction of remission with a short course of systemic steroids, and is well tolerate...|$|E
40|$|To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} and {{adverse effects of}} fluticasone propionate with that of budesonide and <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate in mild persistent cases of bronchial asthma. Methods: This was an open label, randomized parallel group study done in Government General and Chest Hospital, Hyderabad {{for a period of}} 12 weeks. Each group had 20 patients. The group I was given fluticasone propionate inhalation therapy 100 µg twice daily. Group II was given budesonide inhalation therapy 200 µg twice daily. Group III was given <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate inhalation therapy 200 µg twice daily. Results: Symptomatic improvement was observed in all three groups. At end point, mean FEV 1 in fluticasone propionate treatment group improved by 22. 04 % compared with 14. 53 % in budesonide and 12. 02 % in <b>beclomethasone</b> treatment groups. At end point, mean FVC value of the fluticasone propionate treatment group improved by 8. 04 % compared with 5. 29 % in budesonide and 4. 27 % in <b>beclomethasone</b> groups. Mean FEV 1 / FVC also improved by 12. 76 % in the fluticasone propionate group compared with 8. 63 % in budesonide and 7. 45 % in <b>beclomethasone</b> groups. No adverse effects were reported in any of the treatment groups. Conclusion: This study showed that fluticasone propionate is superior to budesonide and <b>beclomethasone</b> in improving lung function, decreasing symptoms and need for rescue medication in mild persistent asthm...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] It {{is common}} for inhaled steroids to be {{delivered}} through a large volume spacer device. Comparatively {{little is known about}} how this practice affects the dose of drug received by patients compared with drug delivered directly from a metered dose inhaler. METHODS [...] The amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate, contained in particles of various size, available for inhalation from a 750 ml polycarbonate spacer (Volumatic) was determined by impinger measurement and high performance liquid chromatography. Three strengths of metered dose inhalers were studied (50 micrograms, 100 micrograms, and 250 micrograms/actuation). The effect of multiple actuations of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate into a Volumatic spacer, and increasing residence times of drug within the spacer before inhalation, on the amount of drug available to the patient for inhalation was determined. RESULTS [...] The amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate in particles < 5 microns when delivered by a spacer device or directly from a metered dose inhaler was similar. The total amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate available for inhalation per actuation decreased by 20 micrograms with the 50 micrograms inhaler, 48 micrograms with the 100 micrograms inhaler, and 161 micrograms with the 250 micrograms inhaler, when given via the spacer compared with delivery directly from a metered dose inhaler. There was a progressive decrease in drug available for inhalation per actuation as the number of actuations into the spacer increased, for all strengths of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate tested. A progressive decrease in drug recovered per actuation was also seen with increasing residence times of drug within the spacer before inhalation. CONCLUSIONS [...] Use of the spacer device significantly reduced the amount of nonrespirable <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate available for inhalation. The amount of <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate within respirable particles decreased considerably following multiple actuations into the spacer and with increasing residence times within the spacer before inhalation. When given via a spacer device <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate should be inhaled immediately after actuation and multiple actuations into the device should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|Inhaled {{glucocorticoids}} such as <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate, {{which are}} used in the treatment of asthma, may be associated with systemic adverse effects. To determine whether any systemic absorption following the inhalation of <b>beclomethasone</b> was a result of drug being absorbed from the lung (inhaled fraction) or the gastrointestinal tract (swallowed fraction), we studied normal subjects after the inhalation or swallowing of 2 mg <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate. Systemic activity was assessed using early morning cortisol suppression. Both inhaled and swallowed fractions produced significant systemic activity, the degree of which depended on the inhaler device used. Systemic activity was greater using a dry powder inhaler (52 %) than using a metered dose inhaler with a large volume spacer (28 %). These findings suggest that to limit potential adverse effects from high-dose <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate it is better to use a metered dose aerosol with large volume spacer than a dry powder...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{in adults}} {{revealed}} that addition of salmeterol to a moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroid resulted in better symptom control and higher PEF compared with doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid. The {{aim of this}} three group study was to compare {{the effects of a}} moderate dose of <b>beclomethasone,</b> the same dose of <b>beclomethasone</b> with salmeterol, and a doubling dose of <b>beclomethasone</b> on lung function and symptoms in children with moderate asthma. A total of 177 children already treated with inhaled corticosteroids, were randomized in a double-blind parallel study either to salmeterol 50 microg twice daily (BDP 400 +salm), <b>beclomethasone</b> 200 microg twice daily (BDP 800), or placebo (BDP 400) in addition to <b>beclomethasone</b> 200 microg twice daily. No significant differences between groups were found in FEV 1, PD 20 methacholine, symptom scores, and exacerbation rates after 1 yr. Salmeterol resulted in slightly better PEF in the first months of treatment. FEV 1, and PD 20 methacholine significantly improved in all groups. After 1 yr mean changes in FEV 1, percent predicted were 4. 3 % (95 % CI 1. 3; 7. 2), 5. 8 % (95 % CI 2. 9; 8. 7), and 4. 3 % (95 % CI 2. 1; 6. 5) for BDP 400 +salm, BDP 800, and BDP 400, respectively. Changes in airway responsiveness were 0. 60 (95 % CI 0. 05; 1. 14), 1. 30 (95 % CI 0. 73; 1. 87), and 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 33; 1. 27) doubling doses. Growth was significantly slower in the BDP 800 group. We conclude that no additional benefit was found of adding either salmeterol or more <b>beclomethasone</b> to a daily dose of 400 microg <b>beclomethasone</b> in this group of children with excellent compliance of medication...|$|E
40|$|A dose {{dependent}} {{suppression of}} daily cortisol excretion {{was shown in}} 25 children with asthma being treated with <b>beclomethasone</b> dipropionate. Cortisol metabolites tended to occur below the normal range when doses of <b>beclomethasone</b> of more than 400 micrograms/m 2 /day were given. Androgen excretion below the normal range was apparent in asthmatic children aged 8 - 13 years {{regardless of whether they}} were receiving inhaled steroids. This may be the reason for growth delay often seen in asthmatic children. These side effects of <b>beclomethasone</b> are not enough reason to discourage its prescription for the treatment of asthma, but endocrine assessment is desirable when the dose exceeds 400 micrograms/m 2 /day...|$|E
