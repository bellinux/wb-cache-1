Yggdrasil licensed an X emulator from Pearl Software to port Arena to Windows, although these builds were never released. Yggdrasil didn't provide any official binaries at this time, because they didn't want to expand the community with alpha-quality software. Although users would be able to run Arena by compiling it from the published source code, volunteers created unofficial finished binaries.

40|$|The <b>Bookmark</b> {{standard}} setting procedure {{was developed to}} address the perceived problems with the most popular method for setting cutscores, the Angoff procedure (Angoff, 1971).

Finally, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the <b>Bookmark</b> procedure are critically examined and discussed. In conclusion, the strengths of the <b>Bookmark</b> method are that it (a) accommodates constructedresponse as well as selected-response test items; (b) efficiently accommodates multiple cutscores and multiple test forms; and (c) reduces cognitive complexity for panelists.

In this paper, we analyze over two years of data from CiteULike, a social <b>bookmarking</b> system for tagging academic papers. We propose six tag metrics—tag growth, tag reuse, tag non-obviousness, tag discrimination, tag frequency, and tag patterns—to understand the characteristics of a social <b>bookmarking</b> system. Using these metrics, we suggest possible design heuristics to implement a social <b>bookmarking</b> system for CiteSeer, a popular online scholarly digital library for computer science.

25|$|In {{the context}} of the World Wide Web, a {{bookmark}} is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include bookmark features. <b>Bookmarks</b> are called favorites or Internet shortcuts in Internet Explorer, and by virtue of that browser's large market share, these terms have been synonymous with bookmark since the first browser war. <b>Bookmarks</b> are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to bookmarking methods within most browsers, many external applications offer bookmark management.|$|E

40|$|Web browser <b>bookmark</b> {{files are}} used to retain and organise records of web sites that the user would like to revisit. However, <b>bookmark</b> files tend to be under-utilised, as time and effort is needed to keep them organised. We use two methods to index and {{automatically}} classify documents referred to in 80 <b>bookmark</b> files, based on document title-only and full-text indexing, respectively. We evaluate the indexing methods by selecting a <b>bookmark</b> entry to classify from a <b>bookmark</b> file, and recreating the <b>bookmark</b> file so that it contains only entries created before the selected <b>bookmark</b> entry. Classification based on full-text indexing generally outperforms that based on document title only indexing. The ability to recommend the correct category at rank 1 using full-text indexing ranges from 20 % to 41 %, depending {{on the number of}} category members. However, combining the approaches results in a increase to 37 % — 59 %, but we would need to recommend up to two categories to users.

40|$|Social <b>bookmarking</b> is an {{emerging}} {{type of a}} Web service that helps users share, classify, and discover interesting resources. In this paper, we explore {{the concept of an}} enhanced search, in which data from social <b>bookmarking</b> systems is exploited for enhancing search in the Web. We propose combining the widely used link-based ranking metric with the one derived using social <b>bookmarking</b> data. First, this increases the precision of a standard link-based search by incorporating popularity estimates from aggregated data of <b>bookmarking</b> users. Second, it provides an opportunity for extending the search capabilities of existing search engines. Individual contributions of <b>bookmarking</b> users as well as the general statistics of their activities are used here for a new kind of a complex search where contextual, temporal or sentiment-related information is used. We investigate the usefulness of social <b>bookmarking</b> systems for the purpose of enhancing Web search through a series of experiments done on datasets obtained from social <b>bookmarking</b> systems. Next, we show the prototype system that implements the proposed approach and we present some preliminary results...|$|R

40|$|No Child Left Behind has {{increased}} the importance of properly classifying students into performance level categories due to the ramifications associated with not making Annual Yearly Progress (AYP). States {{have the opportunity to}} create their own standards and conduct their own standard setting sessions. Two of the more popular methods used are the Angoff method and the <b>Bookmark</b> method. Reckase (2005) simulated both methods and found that the <b>Bookmark</b> method had negative bias associated with the method while the Angoff method did not produce any bias. This study simulated the Angoff and <b>Bookmark</b> methods similarly to Reckase 2 ̆ 7 s (2005) article and also added a different simulated <b>bookmark</b> method, which was used to simulate the <b>Bookmark</b> method more accurately. The study included six independent variables: standard setting method, cutscores, central tendency, number of panelists, item density, and <b>bookmark</b> placement. The second part of the study applied the results of the simulations to real data to determine the impact on student classification, based on the different conditions. ^ Overall, the results of the simulation study indicated the Angoff simulated method was able to recover the parameters extremely well, while the second <b>Bookmark</b> simulated method recovered the item parameters better than the original <b>Bookmark</b> simulated method. However, in certain conditions, the second <b>Bookmark</b> simulated method was able to recover the item parameters as well as the Angoff method. ^ The simulated cutscores were then used to place students into performance level categories based on students 2 ̆ 7 ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and interactions. The results indicated that the simulated Angoff method and the second <b>Bookmark</b> simulated method were most similar when the median was used as the central tendency for the <b>Bookmark</b> method and the panelists 2 ̆ 7 error was large. ^ The simulated Angoff method was the most robust method compared to the two simulated <b>Bookmark</b> methods.
