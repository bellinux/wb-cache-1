5|$|If Curie's work helped {{overturn}} established {{ideas in}} physics and chemistry, {{it has had}} an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> woman. This aspect {{of her life and}} career is highlighted in Françoise Giroud's Marie Curie: A Life, which emphasizes Marie's role as a feminist precursor.|$|E
5|$|Imelda {{knew that}} her husband Ferdinand Marcos had dreamed of {{becoming}} {{the president of the}} Philippines ever since he was a congressman. One reason why Marcos married Imelda, aside from her physical charms, was <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Romualdez—an aristocrat. Imelda's beauty, as well as her background, was appreciated to a great extent by Marcos and Marcos believed she would not only add light to his daily life but also to his political career.|$|E

5|$|Himmler and Potthast confessed {{their love}} for each other at Christmastime in 1938. At first they tried to keep it platonic, but they fell into an adulterous {{relationship}}. Himmler's wife since 1928 and mother of their daughter, Margarete Himmler, found out about Himmler's relationship with Potthast at some time in February 1941. She felt humiliated and bitter, and Potthast's parents rejected the extramarital relationship. Potthast first took up residence in Grunewald and from 1943 she lived in Brückentin, near the estate of Oswald Pohl, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> friend of his wife, Eleonore. Lina Heydrich, wife of Himmler's right-hand man Reinhard Heydrich, and Gerda Bormann, spouse of Martin Bormann, were also counted among her friends. Later she lived in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria.|$|E
5|$|When she was {{ten years}} old, Maria began {{attending}} the boarding school of J. Sikorska; next she attended a gymnasium for girls, from which she graduated on 12 June 1883 with a gold medal. After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, {{and the next year}} with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> woman, she and her sister Bronisława became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.|$|E
5|$|Cisneros and Martínez {{were arrested}} and charged with capital murder, which in Texas is {{punishable}} with a life sentence or death by lethal injection. Cisneros was taken to the Cameron County jail. On her way there, reporters asked if she was responsible for Fischer's murder, and she shook her head. Cisneros' husband also refused to comment. The police denied her bail, but her attorney said that she was a respected member of the Brownsville community and deserved bail. Cisneros's attorney told the press that the arrest was a mistake, and that he was confident the police had no solid evidence against her. Police responded by saying they were content with her arrest, but still needed to go after other people involved in the murder plot. Martínez' family also said they were shocked by the arrest, saying they hoped it was a mistake, and {{that they did not know}} the Fischers or Cisneros. On April 13, Cisneros was released from prison on a $300,000 bond, refusing to comment as she left. According to court documents, Cisneros did not go before a judge to obtain a bond. Her attorney reached an agreement with the Cameron County Court District after her bond was denied the week before. Martínez remained in prison, and her bond was set at the same amount the next day. Her lawyer stated that she deserved a bond as well <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> senior citizen and had a clean criminal record.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think they would ask her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E

Representing Bradwell, Carpenter argued that no class of people could be excluded from practicing the legal profession. The federal court disagreed, questioning the propriety of ruling on a state's qualifications for admission to the bar.|$|E

Inferno was injured in early 1997 and he took some time off before returning in September.

25|$|Her {{emotional}} overacting prompted Wallis to send Shumlin numerous memos {{urging the}} director {{to tone down}} her performance. Shumlin threatened to quit because he was unhappy with cinematographer Merritt B. Gerstad, who eventually was replaced by Hal Mohr in order to appease the director. Meanwhile, Davis also was at odds with Lucile Watson, who was reprising {{the role of the}} mother she had portrayed on stage, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Republican whose political views sharply contrasted with those of the Democratic Davis. She and Lukas, however, got along quite well.|$|E

In a 2011 interview, Nadia's mother Ștefania said that she enrolled her daughter into gymnastics classes simply <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child who was so full of energy and active that she was difficult to manage. Comăneci graduated from Politehnica University of Bucharest with a degree in sports education that qualified her to coach gymnastics.|$|E
25|$|In season 21, Bindi Irwin had her {{payments}} withheld by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> minor, which therefore required {{her parents}} to sign-off on the contract.

The judge later validated the contract once Steve Irwin's death certificate {{was presented to the}} court, resulting in Bindi receiving a $350,000 paycheck from the show.|$|E

As a woman, she never believed gender schema and always fought for herself. She believed that in the science field, women and men are equal, and that the reason why women are fewer in this field is because women are more easily distracted by other things such as gossip, so women have to memorize more unrelated things and cannot focus on work.|$|E

25|$|As {{with her}} predecessor, Beth Israel was Gottlieb's first pulpit, {{though she had}} {{previously}} done a two-year internship at a synagogue in Rye, New York. Her father, Daniel Gottlieb, was also a rabbi. Though the younger Rabbi Gottlieb was supposed to start at Beth Israel on July 1, she was delayed in taking up the role <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> native of Toronto, Canada. Recent regulatory changes made the application process for foreign clergy {{to work in the}} United States lengthy, and she wasn't able to enter the country until mid-August. Gottlieb served as rabbi until 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{college is}} the first American {{institution}} of higher education to have granted a bachelor's degree to an African-American, graduating Alexander Twilight {{in the class of}} 1823. Middlebury {{was also one of the}} first formerly all-male liberal arts colleges in New England to become a coeducational institution, following the trustees' decision in 1883 to accept women. In 1886, May Belle Chellis was the first woman to graduate and she was the valedictorian (although she was not allowed to address the graduating class <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> woman). Middlebury was listed as tied for the sixth-best liberal arts college in the U.S. in the 2018 U.S. News & World Report rankings.|$|E

Chillings also felt that Henry was unfit to be Punky's legal guardian {{in the long term}} - due to his health, age, and uncertain financial future.
