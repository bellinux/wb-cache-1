5|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding mirror symmetry was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996. According to their conjecture, {{now known as}} the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> dividing a Calabi–Yau manifold into simpler pieces and then transforming them to get the mirror Calabi–Yau.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> examining its similarities {{with and}} departures from classical physics. The {{first step is}} the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it would be something that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E
5|$|Mainframe {{computers}} are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older computers were discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E

5|$|The {{relation}} {{of church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best represented in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and a}} sword in the other. For him, the church and state are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>by</b> examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E
