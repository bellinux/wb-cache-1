The mining activities are affecting a larger {{area around the}} orebodies and the secondary stresses can affect the normal stress over a joint orstructure {{in a negative way}} and may cause a sliding that also radiates seismicenergy. The seismic event can be divided into two main groups, compressive stressinduced events and slippages. The first category includes different types ofrock bursts and the second category includes different types of shear failures. To monitor seismic events in the rock mass, the same instrumentation as forearthquake monitoring is used. The monitoring system consists of a number ofgeophones, connected in a network, which detects movements in the rockmass. This study includes an analysis of seismic events located in the vicinity of theFabian ore body. The first part of the study focuses on differences in theseismic signature between different mining levels and periods. In {{the second part of the}} analysis the events are related to blasting and muckingin the production process. The purpose with this part was to find correlationsbetween the used amount of explosives, <b>blasted</b> <b>volume,</b> area and muckingwith seismic events. The result shows that localization of seismic events follows the active miningareas, but also areas with higher stresses in the numerical analysis. There areonly a few events in the southern part of the Fabian ore body which so far is anarea with no production. There are much more seismic events in the hours aftermidnight when LKAB have their production blasts. The analysis also shows that the energy tends to increase with deeper miningwhile the seismic moment tends to decrease. The different seismic indicators do not show a clear source mechanism. Hudyma & Potvin (2010) says that several indicators should give the samemechanism to classify the seismic events. The recommendation is to have a daily check of the seismic events.

40|$|Abstract In {{open pit}} mining operations, blast induced rock mass {{displacement}} can {{have a significant impact}} on ore recovery and downstream productivity. A comprehensive review of the literature has shown that quantifying displacement on a regular basis has generally been limited by the complexity involved in measuring the process. As a result, various empirical and numerical modelling approaches have been developed to estimate the magnitude of displacement for given blast design inputs. Advanced three-dimensional numerical approaches are limited by their computational requirements and are yet to be routinely applied to full scale conditions. The use of simpler numerical approaches have shown potential but previous attempts have been limited by the oversimplification of boundary conditions, disregard for key processes such as inter-particle collisions and are generally two dimensional in nature. The implementation of these models within the production environment has been onerous as a result of the numerous calibration parameters required to generate reliable results. The recent development of the Blast Movement Monitoring (BMM) system and advances in software and hardware dedicated to computational rigid body dynamics, have facilitated new avenues in which blast induced rock mass displacement can be studied and modelled. The main objective of this thesis is to improve our knowledge of the key factors that influence rock mass displacement through: • the analysis of direct physical measurements of full scale production blasts; • and the development of a practical three dimensional blast movement modelling framework aimed at the production stages of operating mines. To gain a better understanding of the main factors which control rock mass displacement in open pit production blasting environments, a comprehensive analysis of physically measured displacement data has been conducted using a combination of advanced data mining and classical statistical techniques. Three main data sets were used for this analysis, including existing data published as part of two Masters thesis from the Mackay School of Mines; data collected during the development of the BMM system at the University of Queensland’s Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC), and new data collected as part of this thesis to supplement the sparse areas within the Mackay and JKMRC data sets. This new data set was gathered at the Mogalakwena Platinum Mine in the Republic of South Africa. Results from the analysis of the three data sets has shown that the main parameters controlling rock mass displacement in open pit production blasting include the three dimensional explosive energy distribution, the orientation of timing contours and confinement effects such as the distance from the free face and stemming influence. These parameters provide the basis from which displacement outcomes such as the magnitude and direction of movement can be estimated and allowed the development of a novel framework to model blast induced rock mass displacement in three dimensions. The proposed modelling framework takes a mechanistic approach by combining rigid body dynamics with established empirical relations and material properties to simulate the displacement of the rock mass under specified blasting conditions. To improve on the current limitations of existing models, the framework addresses six major requirements. These are: 1. the ability to model displacement in three dimensional space while taking into account particle interaction, 2. the ability to incorporate input parameters available to engineers onsite, 3. the ability to model the transition from unconfined to confined blasting conditions, 4. the ability to run within a reasonable time frame, 5. the ability to be calibrated to production blasting conditions using existing technology, and 6. the ability to build models that can be linked directly to block modelling techniques found in geological and mine planning software. The modelling framework consists of a discretised block model of the <b>blast</b> <b>volume</b> that can be described by the positions and orientations of the blocks at each time step during the simulation. All blocks are assigned two initial conditions based on spatial energy distribution and timing contour analysis. These initial conditions define the blocks initial displacement vector prior to the rigid body dynamics program’s particle collision algorithms taking over. To account for the loss of shock and ineffective energy during the breakage process, an energy loss weighting factor is applied to the calculated energy values. Results from three case studies of full scale production blasts have shown that the model generally responds well to the horizontal component of the three-dimensional displacement vector but is less accurate in the vertical displacement direction. This is the first time that a three dimensional displacement model has been evaluated against actual sub-surface displacement data. The model evaluation has indicated that the introduced energy loss factor can be successfully used as a calibration parameter. For all three case studies, the model ran within a reasonable time frame, the longest averaging 45 minutes to simulate a <b>blast</b> <b>volume</b> in the order of 125, 000 m 3.

40|$|A {{number of}} the major metalliferous mining {{companies}} with interest in caving mining methods are currently {{at different stages of}} design and planning of what could arguably be classed as a new generation of much larger scale block and panel cave operations referred to by some as Supercaves. Some of these future operations, expected to be producing in the next 5 to 10 years, are in deposits or geological systems which are located at much greater depths than current, in even more challenging geotechnical and therefore mining environments characterised by strong rock masses i. e. primary rocks, and in higher stress regimes. These conditions, combined, are likely to impose greater technical and mining challenges and therefore risks in terms of the caving processes (caving mechanics including seismicity), cave establishment (ramp-up time) and subsequent production (fragmentation and stability issues). In order to mitigate such potential risks, rock mass preconditioning techniques are increasingly being integrated by some companies into mine design and planning even for current “conventional” cave mining geometries. To date preconditioning using hydraulic fracturing in particular has been implemented and reported to produce measurable and positive outcomes even though there is still on-going debate on the real impact of preconditioning with respect to cave mining performance. This paper describes a proposed methodology for evaluation of the preconditioning by blasting exercise at the Newcrest Mining Limited’s Cadia East (CE) panel cave mine. This was part of a full scale “blasting” preconditioning trial conducted as {{the first of a series}} of planned panel caves in the Cadia East (CE) mining complex in New South Wales, Australia. The full scale trials formed part of a technology exchange agreement between Newcrest Mining Ltd. and Codelco-Chile. This paper describes a proposed methodology for evaluation of the preconditioning by blasting. The methodology uses a numerical model of the blasting process designated as the Hybrid Stress Blasting Model or HSBM which in its current form of development is best described as an advanced research tool. However the HSBM has unique features which qualify it as an effective tool to quantify the level and extent of damage around blastholes detonated in a fully confined environment (rock mass). The in-situ stress state of the <b>blast</b> <b>volume</b> is taken into account including the actual blasthole timing and initiation uses. The trials incorporated the use of acoustic televiewer (ATV) images of borehole walls, tri-axial accelerometers, cross-hole seismic tomography and acoustic emission tri-axial tests of core samples collected pre and post blasting. This was to also provide data to quantify the effect of the confined blasting preconditioning. This paper only focuses on the application of the HSBM model as a viable pathway for the quantification of preconditioning by blasting. The actual data to quantify the impacts of the preconditioning were not available at the time of submission of this paper...|$|E

More specifically, this term is added as an extra term to the Navier-Stokes equation to describe the particle-particle interactions. This extra term in behave as a breaking force when the particles are sliding down in the furnace. During the descending movement in the furnace it is shown that the particles change their profile from a V-shape to a Wshape, due to the characteristics of the deadman. Moreover, the velocity magnitude is higher at the outer surface of the deadman for higher grid-slabs in this region than the near-wall cells. However, the situation changes as solid particles moving to even lower levels of the grid-slabs at the outer surface of the deadman in comparison to near-wall cells. It has also been shown that an increase in the magnitude of the effective pressure reduces the velocity magnitude of descending particles. Furthermore, since different phases co-exist in a <b>blast</b> furnace, the <b>volume</b> fraction {{plays an important role in}} the blast furnace. Therefore, the influence of three different packing densities (0. 68, 0. 71 and 0. 74 respectively) on the profile of the flow through the upper part of the blast furnace from the throat to the tuyeres level has been studied. It is shown that an increase in the volume fraction of the solid phase lead to a decrease in the velocity magnitude. This decrease is due to an increase in the solid volume fraction, which will increase the resident time of the particles inside a blast furnace. In addition, it is shown that the velocity magnitude of the solid phase decreases from the throat to the belly of the furnace, for the studied conditions. However, after belly the velocity magnitude increases again. QC 20121204 </p...|$|R
40|$|Online Realtime Dynamic Analysis of the Blast Furnace Process {{has been}} {{investigated}} to include the concurrent application of Aerodynamics, Thermodynamics and Metallurgical fundamentals applied to the Iron Formation Processes. The {{aim of this study}} is to establish a Process Control System to control the Instantaneous Iron Production Rate for the Blast Furnace. The system depends upon the ability to continuously monitor, control, and locate the various Iron forming reactions throughout the Process. Three methods for control are outlined beginning with the simple Isotherm based version through to the more refined method with five classes of identification of the Zone Volume Interface boundaries based on streamline Gas and Particulate knowledge. Experiments using Instrumented Mt. Newman Iron Ore Particles subjected to heating patterns which simulate Burden descent Streamline flow paths, provide a method of classification of the various <b>Blast</b> Furnace Zone <b>Volumes</b> and Iron Production Rates in terms of the Iron forming reactions that occur in the various Zone types. Specially designed equipment to provide a controlled environment to simulate Blast Furnace conditions also allowed Visual observations and Video recordings of Instrumented Iron Ore Particles to be made as they were reduced to Liquid Iron. These Visual observations added a new dimension to the Aerodynamic and Metallurgical Knowledge of the Process, namely the suddenness with which the Liquidus mechanisms occur in only a few seconds, and secondly the accompaning Volumetric change effects that also occur. The importance of these Process mechanisms were not previously appreciated or even evident using Instrumented recording methods. Using a combination of Visual observations, Isotherm recordings and Quenched sample Ore Metalography, a number of Aerodynamic, Thermodynamic, and Metallurgical concept were developed and then used to more accurately designate the various Zone Volume Boundaries. The concept of a Flame Front Reduction Characteristic (Ffrench Zone) was the first Visualised Reaction mechanism developed in line with the Aerodynamic viewpoint of the reaction observations applied to a uniformly distributed packed bed, as for example in a Sintering bed. This Ffrench zone concept was further refined by applying concurrently Aerodynamic and Thermodynamic Knowledge to the Ore Layers of the Burden. This introduced the concept of the Ore Layer Stratification effects where reactions occur on individual particles in and around the Iron Liquidus Isotherms (where liquid Iron first forms) as particles are affected by the characteristic flow streamline contours resulting from the preferential gaseous flow pathways through the alternate burden layers of Coke and Ore. Additionally, Individual particle Stratification effects also apply within the proximity of each particle where the Iron Liquidus Isotherm condition exists. The Rate of available Heat also determines the Metallurgical nature of the reactions that occur. A further gaseous flow induced effect results from the interparticle Gas jetting impingement (Gas Lithology) onto the successive particles and produces localised forced reactions on the particle surface from the concentrated Heat in the jet stream. These combined effects provide key dynamic components for a more accurate location of Zone interface boundaries and Iron formation mechanisms, and all of which contribute to providing more accurate knowledge for Online Realtime Process Control and Process Simulation Systems. Instantaneous Iron Production Rate for the Blast Furnace Process trialed at No. 5 Blast Furnace Port Kembla was visualised initially in relation to zone volumes classified by 2 ̆ 2 S 2 ̆ 2 Curve direct reduction zone profiles based on the Ffrench Zone concept. Various other Blast Furnace Process Control Systems were also developed to take advantage of the technological advancement that occurred during the period of this study including Online Operator Visualisation and programming concepts. Inherent technological shortcomings of these systems led to the development of the Knowledge based Visualisation concept design which is considered necessary to concurrently utilise the voluminous Streamline based Process knowledge for Online Realtime Process Control use. Future Process control systems providing Online Realtime Process Control are envisaged as using streamline based analogue Instrumentation sensors,with neural data array processing of gas and Particulate streamline flow concepts to provide the desired operation of the Blast Furnace Process, thus yielding the quality and quantity of saleable product required. A theoretical internal fluid motion physical property designated Harmonology was developed as a fundamental Process Unit Dynamic mechanism responsible for 2 ̆ 2 creating 2 ̆ 2 matter motion of fluids at the atomic level, and subsequently are manifested as Visible flow patterns. This concept evolved as a result of concurrently reconciling the matter migration at high temperature as observed in Metalography studies of Iron Ore reduced samples when internal voids are formed (Newman Effervescent Voids). In future systems, Process Visualisation in terms of 2 ̆ 2 Aurora 2 ̆ 2 displays modelled on human visual and Knowledge concepts (Humanoids) are envisaged to provide 2 ̆ 2 multi-personality 2 ̆ 2 dynamic insights of the 2 ̆ 2 moods 2 ̆ 2 of the Process to meet the challenge of providing concurrent knowledge Visualisation for the indispensable human operator comprehension and mood 2 ̆ 2 matching 2 ̆ 2 for Online Process Control purposes. The Humanoid Visualisation incorporates complementary mood and comprehension 2 ̆ 2 matching 2 ̆ 2 personality traits designed to maintain Human involvement and motivation with the dynamic behaviour of the Visualisation Aurora Imagery. In an overall sense theoretical Process considerations suggest that Particulate matter can inherently be more accurately blended and flow rate controlled as a single continuous flow stream of Powder. Subsequently this powder is Transformed to Liquid Product in a Blended Powder Direct Reduction Transformer. The single most important outcome of this thesis was the reinforcement of the concept that concurrency of knowledge and knowledge crosspollination is needed in a dynamic reasoning and visualised fashion. This approach is considered necessary to both understand, and online predictively control the quantity and quality of the Process and its Production Products in terms of the raw materials from which they are produced...|$|R
