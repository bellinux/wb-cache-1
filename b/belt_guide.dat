5000|$|Breyfogle {{was awarded}} the ASQ Crosby Medal in 2004 in {{recognition}} of his book, Implementing Six Sigma, 2nd edition, in which he used a [...] "cutting-edge approach to traditional Six Sigma methodologies." [...] The book was written to aid organizations in utilizing statistical tools to identify and implement process improvements and is an ASQ-recognized body of knowledge. It includes {{the history of the}} Six Sigma program and theories of Quality Management pioneer Edward Deming. It also includes examples of implementation guides used by Motorola.Implementing Six Sigma, 2nd edition, along with another book authored by Breyfogle (Integrated Enterprise Excellence: Improvement Project Execution: A Management and Black <b>Belt</b> <b>Guide</b> for Going Beyond Lean Six Sigma and the Balanced Scorecard), is referenced in the Lean Six Sigma Body of Knowledge and is noted as a source for further information for the Six Sigma Black Best Certification. Lean & Six Sigma World Organization includes Breyfogle on its list of the Top-Twenty authorities on Lean & Six Sigma.Breyfogle has observed and made note of some limitations with Lean Six Sigma. For example, as part of the certification process, people may do a process improvement project, yet the projects that are undertaken are often based on goals that are created without fully understanding how, or if, they will benefit the business’s overall performance. The focus is given to project (and certification) completion. Breyfogle has stated, [...] "with this deployment style, sight of the big picture can be lost." [...] Lean should benefit the enterprise as a whole.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child belt fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic belt geometries and belt fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to static belt fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap belt tension, belt configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap belt guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder belt and lap belt geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder belt with fixed anchorages. Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap belt tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap belt from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap <b>belt</b> <b>guide</b> can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor lap belt geometry. Shoulder <b>belt</b> <b>guide</b> designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder <b>belt</b> <b>guide</b> does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap belt angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap belt angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap belt angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap belt anchorages leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and lower belt anchorage locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap belt geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static belt fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper anchorage locations on belt restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|E
50|$|Hermann Göring, {{who flew}} both the Fokker Dr.I and Fokker D.VII was so annoyed {{with the case}} {{tumbling}} {{out in front of}} him that he had deflectors made on his aircraft to ensure the empty cartridge cases did not find their way into his cockpit.

40|$|Belt-positioning booster {{seats are}} {{recommended}} {{for children who}} use vehicle seat belts as primary restraints but who {{are too small to}} obtain good belt fit. Previous research has shown that belt-positioning boosters reduce injury risk, but the belt fit produced by the wide range of boosters in the US market has not previously been assessed. The present study describes the development of a method for quantifying belt fit with a Hybrid-III 6 -year-old test dummy. The measurement method was applied in a laboratory seat mockup to 31 boosters (10 in both backless and highback modes) across a range of belt geometries obtained from in-vehicle measurements. Belt fit varied widely across boosters. Backless boosters generally produced better lap belt fit than highback boosters, largely because adding the back component moved the dummy forward with respect to the lap belt routing guides. However, highback boosters produced more consistent shoulder belt fit {{because of the presence of}} belt routing guides near the shoulder. Some boosters performed well on both lap belt and shoulder belt fit. Lap belt fit in dedicated boosters was generally better than in combination restraints that also can be used with an integrated harness. Results demonstrate that certain booster design features produce better belt fit across a wide range of belt geometries.

40|$|Abstract. Navigation in {{unfamiliar}} {{places is}} difficult, even if signposts are available they are located at fixed points, may be overseen when {{the area is}} crowded, and are impossible to use by blind people. Visual navigation devices make guidance information available at any place but are neither hands-free nor a solution for blind people.

40|$|ABSTRACT The diglossic {{principles}} implanted into sociolinguistic {{discourse in}} the late 1950 's afforded a conceptual frame where traditional paradigms and novel parameters for theorizing language within multilingual management coincide and interpenetrate. To Nigeria's multilingual situation, the principles of triglossia have been introduced on two coneeptuallevels: policy management and public response (0 policy. However, dimorphous symbiosis between policy guidelines and the attendant applicatory dispositions has attracted inconsistencies in public response to language management strategies and goals. Rendered inadequate, are the adopted triglossic principles which stand in variance with the linguistic realities {{they are designed to}} explain. This paper examines first the constructs where con-tradiction and inconsistency on the levels of policy management and theory stem. Given the confiictual relation between language policy and public response. this paper also examines conditions that intervene to dictate the patterns of language behavior. The tenet that the character of the contemporary language management in Nigeria encourages linguistic be-haviors autonomous of policy dictates is affirmed. Particularly in the Middle <b>Belt,</b> language behavior <b>guided</b> by minority group-based social benefit (utility) rather than policy goal is privileged...|$|R
50|$|The P-11 was {{designed}} by Swedish-born George Kellgren, the designer of many earlier Husqvarna (Sweden), Intratec, and Grendel brand firearms. The P-11 uses an aluminum receiver inside a polymer grip housing held on with polymer pins. The slide, barrel, and magazine are steel. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds, or 12 rounds in states not limited to 10-round magazines. Both fit flush {{to the bottom of}} the pistol. At 17.1 oz unloaded, the handgun itself is comparatively light. The P-11 lacks an external manual safety, relying instead on a long and heavy double action only (DAO) trigger pull, which requires 9 pounds of pressure, to prevent accidental discharge. A firing pin spring and low-mass hammer prevent discharge if the gun is dropped. The P-11 will also accept some Smith & Wesson 59 series magazines. An available adapter wraps around the base of 15-round Smith & Wesson model 59-style magazines. Smith & Wesson series 69 compact 12-round magazines will also work, with a matching short adapter sleeve, as well. Accessories such as trigger shoes, finger-rests, <b>belt</b> clips, steel <b>guide</b> rods to replace the factory installed polymer guide rod, gray- and OD green-colored polymer grip housings, night sights, and other accessories are also available from the manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{exploration}} {{activities in}} the Giyani greenstone <b>belt</b> (GGB) were <b>guided</b> by the availability of outcrops, particularly iron formation, as this rock {{was considered to be}} the main host rock for gold mineralisation in the belt, although the majority of the known prospects/deposits are hosted by mafic rocks. However, there is no reliable lithological map available for the GGB, because most of it is covered by regolith, and thus in the early 1990 s most mining and exploration companies in the GGB have abandoned their work as they were discouraged by the scarcity of outcrops, the small sizes of existing deposits and the low gold prices at that time. In the present study, major and trace element geochemical data from a high-density soil geochemical survey (1 sample/km 2) have been subjected to statistical and spatial analyses to support bedrock mapping and gold exploration. Maps are presented for major oxides, trace elements and selected respective ratio maps, and principal components (PC). The PC analysis was performed on clr-transformed data of selected trace elements known to be associated with gold mineralisation. The first six PCs explain about 78 % of the total variance. PC 4 representing Sb–As–Te–Cr–Au association best reflects the known gold mineralisation and was, therefore, used as a thematic layer. The information provided by various composite maps of different major/trace element data, as well as PC maps, has been used to produce an interpretive bedrock map outlining major lithological units in the study area. As gold mineralisation in the Giyani greenstone belt is hosted by certain known lithologies, the map is useful in indicating potential gold bearing areas...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMapping the {{geometries}} (structure and lithology) of a buried basement {{is a key}} for targeting {{resources and}} for improving the regional geological knowledge. The Paris basin is a Mesozoic to Cenozoic intraplate basin set up on a Variscan substratum, which crops out in the surrounding massifs. We focus our study on the southwestern part of the Paris basin at its junction with the Aquitaine basin. This Mezo-Cenozoic cover separates the Armorican Massif and the Massif Central which compose of several litho-tectonic units bounded by crustal-scale shear zones. In spite of several lithological and structural correlations between various domains of the two massifs, their geological connection, hidden below the Paris basin sedimentary cover, is still largely debated. Potential field geophysics have proven effective for mapping buried basin/basement interfaces. In order to enhance the cartographic interpretation of these data, we {{have set up a}} detailed petrophysical library (field magnetic susceptibility data and density measurements on rock samples) of the Paleozoic rocks outcropping in the Variscan massifs. The combination of aeromagnetic and gravity data supported by the petrophysical signatures and field/borehole geological information, is carried out to propose a new map of the architecture of the Variscan substratum. The new synthetic map of geophysical signature of the Paris basin basement combines: i) the magnetic anomaly reduced to the pole, ii) the vertical gradient of the Bouguer anomaly and iii) the tilt derivative of the magnetic anomaly reduced to the pole. Based on this information, the Eastern extension of the major shear zones below the sedimentary cover is assessed. The petrophysical signatures were classified in three classes of magnetic susceptibility and density: low, intermediate and high. Basic rocks have high magnetization and density values whereas granite, migmatite and orthogneiss show low magnetization and density values, Proterozoic and Paleozoic sediments, micaschists and metagrauwackes have intermediate to low magnetization and density values. Detailed lithological attribution of geophysical anomalies was achieved separately for each geological sub-domain (in between 2 major structures). This methodology will be generalized at the scale of the entire Paris basin in order to propose a tectonic reconstruction of this segment of the Variscan <b>belt,</b> and provide <b>guides</b> for the exploration of hidden resources...|$|R
