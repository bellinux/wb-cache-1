40|$|In the United States historically, <b>births</b> <b>to</b> older {{mothers have}} been {{more likely to be}} planned than <b>births</b> <b>to</b> younger mothers, and <b>births</b> <b>to</b> {{unmarried}} women have been less likely to be planned than <b>births</b> <b>to</b> married women. As the average age of mothers has increased and more births have occurred outside of marriage in the United States, the intersection of these trends may have weakened the traditional linkage between age and birth planning status. In this article, we examine differences by maternal age in planning status of births using The 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. We find that age is strongly associated with planning status, but the association is reduced in magnitude when controlling for relationship status and is stronger for first and second births than for higher-parity births. Further, the association between union status and the planning status of births varies by race-ethnicity. cohabitation, fertility intentions, fertility plans, fertility timing, marriage, nonmarital fertility...|$|R
40|$|Background: Since {{the early}} 21 st century, period total {{fertility}} has been recovering from (very) low levels in many European countries. This trend is partly {{attributable to the}} end of the postponement of childbearing. The question has risen, however, to what extent this recovery is also related to the changing ethnic composition of European populations. Objective: In this paper, we investigate to what extent the population of foreign origin contributed to the recent (2001 / 2008) recovery of period fertility in the Belgian region of Flanders. Methods: We use data from the Flemish Family and Child Care Agency for calculating time trends in the share of <b>births</b> <b>to</b> foreign origin groups. We furthermore propose a counterfactual method that allows us to assess indirectly the role played by <b>births</b> <b>to</b> women of foreign origin in the recent recovery of fertility. Results: Overall, we find that <b>births</b> <b>to</b> women of foreign origin have made increasingly important contributions to the number of children born in the Flemish region: between 2001 and 2008, the share of <b>births</b> <b>to</b> women of foreign origin grew from 16 % to 20 %. Nevertheless, the results from our counterfactual fertility analysis indicate that the recovery of fertility in Flanders would have occurred even in the absence of any <b>births</b> <b>to</b> women of foreign origin.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} the effects of poor local access to obstetric care on the risks of having a neonate diagnosed as non-normal, a long hospital stay, and/or high hospital charges. METHODS: Washington State birth certificates linked with hospital discharge abstracts of mothers and neonates were used <b>to</b> study 29809 <b>births</b> <b>to</b> residents of rural areas. <b>Births</b> <b>to</b> women from rural areas where more than {{two thirds of the}} women left for care were compared with <b>births</b> <b>to</b> women from rural areas where fewer than one third left for care. RESULTS: Poor local access to providers of obstetric care was associated with a significantly greater risk of having a non-normal neonate for both Medicaid and privately insured patients. However, poor local access to care was consistently associated with higher charges and increased hospital length of stay only if the patient was privately insured. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that local maternity services may help prevent non-normal <b>births</b> <b>to</b> rural women and, among privately insured women, might decrease use of neonatal resources...|$|R
