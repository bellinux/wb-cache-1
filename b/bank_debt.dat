In February 2010, GIP sold minority stakes in the airport of 12% and 15% to the South Korean National Pension Service and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) for £100million and £125million, respectively.

The Californian state pension fund CalPERS acquired a 12.7% stake in Gatwick Airport for about $155million (£104.8million) in June 2010. On 21 December 2010, the A$69billion (£44billion) Future Fund, a sovereign wealth fund established by the Australian government in 2006, agreed to purchase a 17.2% stake in Gatwick Airport from GIP for £145million.

60|$|DEAR WILLIAM:--Your letter, advising me of {{the receipt}} of our fee in the bank case, is just received, and I don't expect to hear another as good a piece of news from Springfield while I am away. I am under no {{obligations}} to the bank; and I therefore wish you to buy bank certificates, and pay my debt there, so as to pay it with the least money possible. I would as soon you should buy them of Mr. Ridgely, or any other person at the bank, as of any one else, provided {{you can get them}} as cheaply. I suppose, after the <b>bank</b> <b>debt</b> shall be paid, there will be some money left, out of which I would like to have you pay Lavely and Stout twenty dollars, and Priest and somebody (oil-makers) ten dollars, for materials got for house-painting. If there shall still be any left, keep it till you see or hear from me.|$|E
40|$|Until recently, Croatia's {{economic}} performance was {{the envy of}} many countries in transition: a successful stabilization effort in late 1993 was followed by virtual price stability and real GDP growth of 6 percent a year during 1994 – 97. Monetary tightening, the weak economy, and a drying-up of repatriated foreign savings exposed the underlying insolvency {{of a group of}} rapidly growing banks. Executive Directors emphasized that the task of restoring fiscal balance could not be accomplished without redressing the finances of the pension and health care systems.

40|$|The {{staff report}} for the 2005 Article IV Consultation on the People’s Republic of China {{highlights}} economic developments, policy discussions, and structural reforms. A larger external current account surplus, together with strong capital inflows, led to a further sizable increase in gross official reserves. A disorderly unwinding of global current account imbalances would also threaten China’s growth, as economic activity in all countries would likely suffer lingering adverse effects. Executive Directors commended the authorities for the success in sustaining high economic growth rates and for their efforts to guide the economy.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the Islamic Republic of Mauritania’s Sixth Review Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and a Request for Waiver of Performance Criterion. Performance under the PRGF-supported program {{remained}} strong in 2002. All the quantitative and structural performance criteria and benchmarks were met except for {{the publication of the}} audit of the central bank accounts, which was delayed for technical reasons. The IMF staff commends the authorities for bringing to a successful conclusion the current PRGF Arrangement and for their impressive record on macroeconomic stability and structural reforms.
