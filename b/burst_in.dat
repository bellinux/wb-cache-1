5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was barely holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief <b>burst</b> <b>in</b> convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Dry air began {{impacting}} Nadine on September17, though outflow {{from the}} storm prevented significant weakening. Despite a large flare of deep convection over the northern semicircle, Nadine weakened slightly later that day. Further weakening occurred on the following day, after the <b>burst</b> <b>in</b> deep convection on September17 deteriorated. Later on September18, most of the deep convection dissipated, with the strongest of the remaining shower and thunderstorm activity being located within a band located west and northwest of the center.|$|E

30|$|Second, we {{demonstrated}} that the torus canard explosions in these systems play central roles in the transitions between the spiking and <b>bursting</b> regimes. <b>In</b> the HR system, the torus canards occur precisely in the transition region from spiking to sub-Hopf/fold cycle <b>bursting,</b> <b>in</b> which the active phase of the burst initiates when the trajectory passes a subcritical Hopf bifurcation point and terminates when it passes the fold of limit cycles. The transitions from spiking to <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> the MLT and WCI models are, respectively, to circle/fold cycle <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> which the active phase initiates in a saddle-node bifurcation on an invariant circle (a.k.a. SNIC), and to fold/fold cycle <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> which the active phase initiates as the trajectory passes a fold of fixed points.|$|R

Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to <b>burst.</b> <b>In</b> the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E

5|$|Early on July8, another brief <b>burst</b> <b>in</b> {{convection}} {{near the}} center of Blanca occurred. In this area, satellites found sustained winds around 40mph (65km/h). However, the convection quickly dissipated and the winds were not considered to be representative of the storm's true intensity. By later that day, convection had not reformed around the center of circulation and Blanca degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure system, corresponding with the final public advisory from the NHC. Although no longer a tropical cyclone, the remnants of Blanca maintained a well-defined low pressure center as it continued its northwesterly movement. Early on July11, the system turned northward and gradually weakened. The following day, the remnants of Blanca dissipated over open waters.|$|E

Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star formation. Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because star formation ceases after the initial <b>burst.</b> <b>In</b> this sense they have some similarity to the much smaller globular clusters.|$|E

40|$|The {{statistical}} characterization and {{prediction of}} <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> solar activity {{and in the}} solar wind {{is a problem of}} great practical relevance in space weather physics. Here, we show that many of the apparent qualitative and quantitative differences <b>in</b> <b>burst</b> statistics between solar activity and solar wind variation during solar maximum can be resolved by considering extreme bursts. These are defined as peak-over-threshold events over the range of high thresholds for which their number decays as a power law. We find that the duration time and energy distributions of extreme <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> the solar wind epsilon parameter are both threshold-independent. The distribution of times between extreme <b>bursts</b> <b>in</b> epsilon, however, depends markedly on threshold. Our results indicate that a signature of the solar activity appears <b>in</b> extreme <b>bursts</b> of the solar wind, while other features are likely governed by local plasma turbulence.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September12. The wave moved westward across the Atlantic basin with minimal deep convection. By September23, it reached the eastern Pacific Ocean and began increasing in shower and thunderstorm activity over the next few days. While located near Acapulco another <b>burst</b> <b>in</b> convection occurred on September25, likely due to interaction with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Around that time, the National Hurricane Center began Tropical Weather Outlooks (TWOs) on the system, which is information issued every six hours on significant areas of disturbed weather and their potential for development out to 48hours. The tropical wave split on September26, with the northern portion moving northwestward near the southwestern coast of Mexico. By September27, the system had organized deep convection and was producing tropical storm force winds, but data from scatterometers indicated that it lacked a closed circulation. Although TWOs issued on September27 predicted a high probability for development, the chances for tropical cyclogenesis was decreased later that day, due to the system's close proximity to land.|$|E

5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it <b>burst</b> <b>in</b> his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
40|$|SummaryExtinction of {{conditioned}} fear is {{an active}} learning process requiring N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), but the timing, location, and neural mechanisms of NMDAR-mediated processing in extinction are a matter of debate. Here we show that infusion of the NMDAR antagonist CPP into the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) prior to, or immediately after, extinction training impaired 24 hr recall of extinction. These findings indicate that consolidation of extinction requires posttraining activation of NMDARs within the vmPFC. Using multichannel unit recording, we observed that CPP selectively reduced <b>burst</b> firing <b>in</b> vmPFC neurons, suggesting that <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> vmPFC is necessary for consolidation of extinction. In support of this, {{we found that the}} degree of <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> infralimbic vmPFC neurons shortly after extinction predicted subsequent recall of extinction. We suggest that NMDAR-dependent <b>bursting</b> <b>in</b> the infralimbic vmPFC initiates calcium-dependent molecular cascades that stabilize extinction memory, thereby allowing for successful recall of extinction...|$|R
