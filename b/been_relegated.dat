5|$|Although {{the club}} has had notable defeats from 2000–01 onwards, crowds have {{continued}} to be healthy. During the 2005–06 season, home attendances (that is, given attendances minus away support) increased slightly on the season before, helped by a 10,006 crowd against Carlisle {{on the final day}} of the season. That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at Edgeley Park. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> from the Football League for the first time, an embarrassment as the team has competed continuously in the Football League since 1900. Stockport eventually drew the game with Carlisle and survived the drop, while Carlisle themselves gained the league championship.|$|E

During this second spell at Ipswich, Wark was close to being an ever-present in the side: he missed just two games in two seasons. He was the club's equal top-scorer in the 1988–89 season, sharing the {{achievement}} with forwards Dalian Atkinson and Jason Dozzell.|$|E

5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. He {{said in his}} autobiography that there was greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some good players had been transferred before he arrived. But Shankly believed he still had good players {{to work with and}} was able to buy some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991. Arsenal's opponents Wrexham had finished {{bottom of the}} entire Football League the previous season. In normal circumstances this meant the club would have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> to the Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season meant there was to be no demotion.|$|E

During the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops ashore in North Africa. By the outbreak of the First World War, Giovanni Bausan had <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> to secondary duties, first as a distilling ship, and later as a depot ship for seaplanes. The ship was disarmed during the conflict and ultimately was sold to ship-breakers in March 1920.|$|E

5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, women have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> to a {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends {{to blur the}} boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|Tatuidris tatusia is {{the only}} species in Tatuidris, a {{monotypic}} genus and {{one of only two}} extant genera in the subfamily Agroecomyrmecinae. A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> to a junior synonym under T. tatusia based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range. Analysis of DNA barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation.|$|E
5|$|The 1947–48 season brought Max Bentley to Toronto from Chicago in {{what has}} been called the biggest trade in NHL history as the Leafs gave up five regular players for the league's scoring leader. Evincing the depth of the team at centre, Bentley played on the team's third line, behind Apps and Kennedy. Decades later, Hap Day argued that this team was the strongest NHL team ever and Globe and Mail {{reporter}} Dick Beddoes also stirred up controversy by saying Wayne Gretzky would have <b>been</b> <b>relegated</b> to the fourth line on this Leaf team.|$|E
