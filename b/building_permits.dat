5|$|Tubas {{has been}} {{governed by a}} {{municipal}} council since 1953, when it was granted permission {{to do so by}} Jordanian authorities who controlled the West Bank at the time. The council is made up of 15 members including the mayor, and is headquartered in the municipal hall {{in the center of the}} town. The municipality has over 60 employees. Responsibilities of the municipality include civil administration, urban planning and development, social development services, distribution of social services, the issuing of <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> and infrastructural maintenance: water, electricity and solid waste collection.|$|E
5|$|Government in the San Francisco Bay Area {{consists}} of multiple actors, including 101 city and nine county governments, a dozen regional agencies, {{and a large}} number of single-purpose special districts such as municipal utility districts and transit districts. Incorporated cities are responsible for providing police service, zoning, issuing <b>building</b> <b>permits,</b> and maintaining public streets among other duties. County governments are responsible for elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, agricultural regulations, and building inspections, among other duties. Public education is provided by independent school districts, which may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts, and are managed by an elected school board. A variety of special districts also exist and provide a single purpose, such as delivering public transit {{in the case of the}} Bay Area Rapid Transit District, or monitoring air quality levels in the case of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.|$|E
5|$|Having recovered, {{the company}} worked to expand {{geographically}} into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., {{and by the}} end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29million acquisition of Fresh Samantha, a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha brand names for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla-brand juice.|$|E

50|$|However, {{local council}} bylaws {{required}} that a <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> be first {{issued by the}} council before building commenced, although for small jobs, the council practice was to allow the <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> to be issued after building had started.|$|R

5|$|Though Houston is {{the largest}} city in the United States without formal zoning regulations, it has {{developed}} similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role. Regulations include mandatory lot size for single-family houses and requirements that parking be available to tenants and customers. Such restrictions have had mixed results. Though some have blamed the city's low density, urban sprawl, and lack of pedestrian-friendliness on these policies, the city's land use has also been credited with having significant affordable housing, sparing Houston the worst effects of the 2008 real estate crisis. The city issued 42,697 <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> in 2008 and was ranked first {{in the list of}} healthiest housing markets for 2009.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church wanted for the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, <b>building</b> <b>permits</b> had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E
5|$|Stabæk's {{director}} of sports, Inge André Olsen, stated that returning to Nadderud {{was not an}} option, as it had too little capacity and insufficient facilities. Should Nadderud be used, {{it would have to}} be rebuilt, with new grandstands under roofs, VIP seating, a new parking house and new change room, which would cost NOK100 million. Because of <b>building</b> <b>permits,</b> construction would take two to three years. Nadderud is also not approved to host games in the Premier League, so Stabæk would have to either play their games at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo or Marienlyst Stadion in Drammen. Telenor stated that if Stabæk moved, they would have to re-negotiate the naming rights agreement for the arena, as the value of the contract was largely based on the naming exposure of Stabæk playing in the Premier League. The company also stated that they had difficulty understanding the argumentation from the holding company, as there was no football being played October and March, but that the venue, which has the largest capacity for indoor concerts in the Oslo area, failed to attract large artists, such as Rihanna, during the winter months.|$|E
40|$|Building {{regulations}} set {{minimum requirements}} for safe, healthy, energy-efficient and accessible buildings. To guarantee that these requirements are applied, a building control system is indispensable. The trend towards a common market for construction {{products and services}} justifies gaining a better insight into the building control systems in the European Union (EU). This paper presents {{a comparison of the}} <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> procedures adopted in the 27 EU countries. To collect the necessary information, a questionnaire on building regulatory systems was distributed to national experts in each country and the major legal documents were reviewed. The information was organized in thematic tables containing all the countries. The main conclusion is that the organization of a regular <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> procedure is similar in the EU countries. No major differences were found concerning the several steps it takes to get a <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> and to carry out a construction work: pre-consultation, possibility of phasing, submission demands, checks carried out and maximum procedure time for plan approval, possibility and moment to object to a <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> being issued, start of construction works, frequency and moment of site inspections, fees, and completion of construction works. The main differences concern detail aspects in several of these steps. There is one basic type of <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> procedure in countries from continental Europe. The United Kingdom countries are those presenting more deviations from the common pattern. These deviations aim to reduce the burden of administrative aspects, while ensuring good levels of compliance. In the last 10 to 15 years, the dominant trends identified in the <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> procedure were a decrease in the types of construction works submitted to building authorities’ control during plan approval, and the reduction in the maximum <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> procedure times. <b>Building</b> authorities’ control during the construction phase has remained unchanged. Altogether, there is a movement towards simpler and faster <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> procedures. For the near future, no major changes are expected in the <b>building</b> <b>permit</b> procedures. OTB ResearchOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|R
