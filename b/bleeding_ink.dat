40|$|To <b>Bleed</b> <b>Ink</b> – {{about the}} fascination {{and the quality}} of Jussi Adler-Olsen’s book,”The Keeper of Lost Causes” is a thesis in the Master Degree, Danish at Roskilde University. The thesis is written with the {{intention}} to give an insight of the fascination of the thriller genre together with the quality of it. With the choice of Jussi Adler-Olsen’s first novel about Division Q, ”The Keeper of Lost Causes”, an image of the reader’s fascination of the thriller novel is given, and furthermore how it is possible to talk about literary quality as related to the novel. With the help from three reader-response-criticism theories, a light is shed on the lin-guistic elements, which yields the reader’s interest of the novel. Amongst others, Wolfgang Iser’s theory about the empty spaces relative to the reader’s role in the reading are defined and in extension to this, Peter Brooks theory about plot and plotting is described respectively as the foundation of the thriller and the activation of the reader in the reading process. Further-more, Sigmund Freud, Julia Kristeva and Michael Clasen are involved with focus on the frightening element in the thriller. Henceforth, the theory about quality is described. With help from Erik Bjerck Hagen et al, a methodically approach to literary quality is explained which results in a debate about who sets the norms for literary quality. Thus the analysis of ”The Keeper of Lost Causes” will have its theoretical background from these theories. With an analysis of the plot, the reception and the frightening, the ques-tion of why the reader finds the thriller novel interesting will be brought to focus. Henceforth an analysis of the quality within the novel and also the reviewer’s valuation of it portrays a more concerning literary way to evaluate the quality of ”The Keeper of Lost Causes”. Thus it results in a discussion about who sets the norms for literary quality and if it is even still rele-vant to discuss the literary quality. Therefore, the thesis focuses on portraying an already ex-isting debate of the literary quality...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Revamping {{of ancient}} {{degraded}} document images is a grueling task due their foreground text and background which is degraded due to uneven illumination, dust, water marks, smear, strain, <b>ink</b> <b>bleed</b> and low contrast etc. The proposed Binarization technique addresses {{this problem by}} using adaptive image contrast which {{is a combination of}} the local image gradient and local image contrast that is stoic to text and background variation. In the proposed technique, for an input ancient degraded document image an adaptive contrast map is first constructed. The contrast map is then binarized and combined with Canny’s edge map to recognize the text stroke edge pixels. The text of document is further segmented by a local threshold that is concluded based on the intensities of detected text stroke edge pixels within a local window. Dataset of different languages like Modi, Marathi and English are used as input in handwritten and printed form. Modi, Marathi, English database are from year 1908, 1957, 1922.

40|$|When {{documents}} are written on both sides, quite often <b>ink</b> <b>bleeds</b> through the paper. This {{is a common}} phenomenon with old documents and low quality paper. With the presence of increased bleed-through, reading and deciphering the text becomes tedious. This thesis implements algorithms for reducing bleed-through distortion using techniques in digital image processing. A comparative study of three methods has been performed with the first being basic enhancement through thresholding. The next two methods are founded on a registration process which aims at working on both the recto and verso sides simultaneously. Firstly, {{both sides of the}} {{documents are}} digitized. The verso is then flipped and corrected so as to correspond to the coordinates of one side exactly with the coordinates of the original writing on the other which is done using an affine transformation of six parameters. The parameters are found by optimizing the alignment process. A restoration algorithm is then applied to remove bleed though areas on the desired side page. The third method proposes the use of cross correlation to handle the registration process. The accuracy of bleed-through correction is found to be largely dependent on the accuracy of alignment of the documents...|$|R
40|$|Printing {{using more}} than four ink {{channels}} visually improves the reproduction. Nevertheless, if the ink layer thickness at any given point exceeds a certain limit, <b>ink</b> <b>bleeding</b> and colour accuracy problems would occur. Halftoning algorithms that process channels dependently are one {{way of dealing with}} this shortcoming of multi-channel printing. A multilevel halftoning algorithm that processes a channel so that it is printed with multiple inks of same chromatic value was introduced in our research group. Here we implement this multilevel algorithm using three achromatic inks – photo grey, grey, black – in a real paper-ink setup. The challenges lay in determining the thresholds for ink separation and in dot gain compensation. Dot gain results in a darker reproduction and since it originates from the interaction between a specific ink and paper, compensating the original image for multilevel halftone means expressing dot gain of three inks in terms of the nominal coverage of a single ink. Results prove a successful multilevel halftone implementation workflow using multiple inks while avoiding dot-on-dot placement and accounting for dot gain. Results show the multilevel halftoned image is visually improved in terms of graininess and detail enhancement when compared to the bi-level halftoned image...|$|R
40|$|Binarization methods play {{a central}} role in {{document}} image processing. It is usually performed in the preprocessing stage and is important for document image processing tasks such as optical character recognition (OCR). Segmentation of text from badly degraded document images is a challenging task because of the high inter/intra-variation between the document background and foreground text of different document images. So method for segmenting the foreground text from the background is presented here. In this method first of all an image having high contrast has been constructed. For this a rough estimation of background is to be made. Then a hybrid algorithm for thresholding has been used. It consists of both global and local thresholding methods. The Global thresholding step has been modified such that the output will not be a binarized image but an intermediate gray level image. It is helpful as most of the background gets eliminated. Local thresholding will be applied on the result given by global thresholding step. This method is simple, robust and effective. The proposed method works better than most of the existing local and global thresholding algorithms and is able to deal with degradations which occur due to strain, <b>ink</b> <b>bleed</b> through, low contrast, water marks, dust, smear and uneven illumination etc. This method has been tested on three public datasets that are used in recent document image binarization contest (DIBCO) 2009 and 2011 and handwritten-DIBCO 2011 and achieves the results which are significantly higher than or close to the best performing methods reported in three contests.

The surface of the print was dry cleaned with powdered eraser crumbs to remove dirt and grime. The tape adhesive stains visible in the upper center section of the print recto were tested for solubility and reduced using solvents (toluene and ethanol) applied locally to the stains while the print was on the vacuum suction table. The staining in this area was no longer visible after solvent treatment. A variety of solvents were tested on the adhesive impregnated edges of the paper {{but none of the}} solvents successfully solubilized or reduced the staining in this area. The printing inks as well as the numerous ink inscription verso were tested for water solubility prior to water washing of the print. These small tests indicated that a faint orange-red component in the black ink was susceptible to water and might <b>bleed</b> from the <b>ink</b> mix if the print was water washed. The edge tears were repaired with kozo fiber tissue and wheat starch paste. The triangular-shaped loss in the top edge of the paper near the center was filled with a paper of comparable weight and texture and toned with watercolors. Another triangular-shaped loss in the left margin of the paper, larger than others, was also filled with a paper of comparable weight and texture. Smaller edge losses were not filled, as the print would be over matted following treatment. The print was humidified in a chamber for 1 hour and then placed between rag boards and under weights.
