50|$|Blow {{lived in}} a flat in South Kensington, London, since the 1960s but was forced to move due to rising rents. In 1994, she moved to St Ives, Cornwall, {{and there have been}} retrospectives of her work at the Royal Academy and Tate St Ives. Blow never had children, which had been a {{purposeful}} decision in her twenties, but she later regretted it. <b>Blow</b> <b>died</b> at the Royal Cornwall Hospital after a heart valve replacement operation resulted in a cerebral haemorrhage.|$|R

Blow's funeral service lasted two hours and a special train was {{commissioned}} to take mourners from St. Louis {{to his home in}} Carondelet. The funeral procession was a mile long and spanned twenty-five miles to his final resting place. He was interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri, and was survived by six of his children.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePolymer {{processing}} involves three thermo-mechanical stages: Plastication {{of solid}} polymer granules or powder to an homogeneous fluid which is shaped under pressure in moulds or dies and finally cooled and eventually drawn {{to obtain the}} final plastic part. Physical properties of polymers (high viscosity, non-linear rheology, low thermal diffusivity) {{as well as the}} complex shape of most plastic parts make modelling a challenge. Several examples (film <b>blowing</b> extrusion <b>dies,</b> injection moulding, <b>blow</b> moulding) are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Melt blowing is {{a typical}} {{nonwoven}} process for producing superfine fibers. In this process, the high velocity hot air jets attenuate the polymer melt into superfine fibers. Therefore, the fiber diameter is strongly affected by the air flow field. Dual slot die {{is one of the}} widely used melt <b>blowing</b> <b>dies.</b> Hot air emits from the two slots symmetrically. What will happen to the polymer drawing if the air jets are unsymmetrical? In this paper, the unsymmetrical air flow field of the dual slot <b>die</b> in melt <b>blowing</b> process is simulated numerically. The distributions of air velocity and air temperature are obtained. The polymer drawing model is then solved with the aid of the simulation results of air velocity and air temperature. The diameter and transverse displacement of the threadline along the spinline is achieved. The result shows that the threadline diameter of unsymmetrical air flow field is larger than that of the symmetrical air flow field and the threadline tends to deflect because of the unsymmetrical air jets. This paper helps to indicate the research direction for further decreasing the fiber diameter of melt blown nonwoven fabrics...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{remarkable}} {{battle with}} the white men he saw was the Wagon Box Fight in 1866. Wooden Leg {{was too young to}} take part in the battle, but during the fight, his eldest brother Strong Wind <b>Blowing</b> <b>died.</b> So, in spite of the final victory of the Cheyenne, that was a mourning day for all his family. At 14, he was invited by Left Hand Shooter to become part of the warrior society of the Elkhorn Scrapers, one of the three warrior societies (the other being the group of the Crazy Dog and the group of the Fox) in which the men of the tribe were divided. At 17, he went on retreat to thank the Great Spirit. He spent four days closed in a tepee, meditating and contemplating, visited only once a day. After the trial, his face was painted with a black circle enclosing his forehead, chin, and cheeks; the internal area of the circle was yellow. This facial picture, together with his best suit, his shield, and his flute made from the wing bone of an eagle, became part of his war equipment for the rest of his life ...|$|R

While he wasn’t required to criticize his earlier thinking in terms of Marxism, and he even received government funding in publishing some of his writings after 1949, he was still subjected to physical abuse {{at the beginning of the}} Cultural Revolution.

By his own desire he was buried under the altar of the parish church, with as little pomp as possible. Of his five sons the eldest, Robert Auriol, succeeded his uncle, Thomas Hay, as 10th earl of Kinnoull, 1787. A portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds was engraved by Watson.

5000|$|Circa 1799, Dred Scott {{was born}} into slavery in Southampton County, Virginia. It {{is not clear whether}} Dred was his given name or a {{shortened}} form of Etheldred. In 1818, Peter Blow and his family took their six slaves to Alabama, where the family ran an unsuccessful farm in a location near Huntsville that is now occupied by Oakwood University. The Blows gave up farming in 1830 and moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where they ran a boarding house. Dred Scott was sold to Dr. John Emerson, a surgeon serving in the United States Army. After Scott learned he would be sold to Dr. Emerson and relocated to Rock Island, Illinois, he attempted to run away. His decision to do so was spurred by a distaste he had previously developed for Dr. Emerson. Scott was temporarily successful in his escape as he, much like many other runaway slaves during this time period, [...] "never tried to distance his pursuers, but dodged around among his fellow slaves as long as possible." [...] Eventually, he was captured in the [...] "Lucas Swamps" [...] of Missouri and taken back. <b>Blow</b> <b>died</b> in 1832, and historians debate whether Scott was sold to Emerson before or after Blow's death. Some believe that Scott was sold in 1831, while others point to a number of slaves in Blow's estate after his death were sold to Emerson, among them was one with a name given as Sam, who may be the same person as Scott.|$|R

50|$|For {{mid-range}} weapons, the Spartan's spear {{was tested}} against the Ninja's black egg. The dory spear was first tested on a dummy while its thrusting force was measured; Geoff Desmoulin {{claimed that the}} measured force of the thrust was equivalent to a two-story fall onto the same spear {{if it were to}} be held up vertically. The dory was next thrust at a gel torso where it proved to be a devastating blow, breaking ribs, piercing the heart and a lung, and exiting the back. Dr. Armand Dorian claimed that a person struck with such a <b>blow</b> would <b>die</b> within 30 seconds. Black eggs containing both crushed glass and pepper juice were thrown at a Spartan helmet where it was proved to be blindingly effective. The spear got the edge since it could kill the opponent, whereas the egg was only a distraction tactic.|$|R

50|$|Ripples {{appear on}} smooth water {{when the wind}} <b>blows,</b> but will <b>die</b> quickly if the wind stops. The {{restoring}} force {{that allows them to}} propagate is surface tension. Sea waves are larger-scale, often irregular motions that form under sustained winds. These waves tend to last much longer, even after the wind has died, and the restoring force that allows them to propagate is gravity. As waves propagate away from their area of origin, they naturally separate into groups of common direction and wavelength. The sets of waves formed in this way are known as swells.|$|R
