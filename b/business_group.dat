Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a corporate strategy that he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer. For example, he saw a missed opportunity in Millicent, the micropayment system for buying and selling Web content for fractions of a U.S. cent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Business</b> <b>groups</b> {{played an}} {{important}} role in the economic development of East Asian countries. Yet <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> in East Asia face an uncertain future. Following the Asian Crisis, foreign creditors and investors have demanded that <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> have more transparent operations and stronger corporate governance. At the same time, as governments in East Asia have loosened trade barriers, <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> have become subject to intense competition in domestic markets. This paper argues that <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> can survive or even prosper by taking initiatives in corporate restructuring.

Upon attempting to return to Madagascar in October 2014 he was arrested, having been sentenced in absentia to lifelong hard labour for abuses of power by the Rajoelina administration.

Rajoelina complied; however, when Ravalomanana's wife Lalao submitted her candidacy several months later, Rajoelina resubmitted his candidacy, declaring that Marc Ravalomanana sought to govern by proxy through his wife. In August 2013, a special electoral court invalidated the candidacy of Lalao Ravalomanana, as well as her chief competitors Rajoelina and Ratsiraka.

40|$|AbstractThe {{phenomenon}} of related guarantee is widely {{exists in the}} operation of <b>business</b> <b>groups.</b> This related guarantee complicates the credit risk of <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> in one hand and makes the risk control more difficult of commercial banks in the other hand. In this paper it proposed a theoretical model to describe the basic mechanism of credit risk in <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> based on structure model. Then it also analyzed the effect on credit risk of <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> of related guarantee empirically. The research results show that the relationship between amount of guarantee and intensity of credit risk contagion is nonlinear and the different structure of guarantee will bring different influence for credit risk of <b>business</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Business</b> <b>groups</b> in all {{of their}} manifestations are informational {{mechanisms}} for coordinating complementary activities [...] for "gap filling. " This {{is well known in}} the literature on <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> outside the Anglo-American sphere. Especially in developing economies, where markets are thin and institutions (including both political institutions and what I call market-supporting institutions) are weak or non-existent, coordination is often more cheaply undertaken within the boundaries of <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> organized as financial pyramids, typically under family control. These organizations are intimately linked to the coalition of territorial rulers that North and his coauthors (2009) call a natural state; and, indeed, such <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> are arguably themselves examples of a natural state, in that they represent a self-enforcing coalition with its own rules, norms, and mechanisms of enforcement. But even in developed economies, novelty and change create the sorts of gaps that call for <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> in the widest sense, including less-formal sets of "intermediate" relationships, as, for example, in industrial districts. In this sense, the economics of organization generally has perhaps more to learn from the literature on <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> than the other way around. <b>business</b> <b>groups,</b> vertical integration, transaction costs, institutional economics, business history. ...|$|R

5|$|The game's second case, Turnabout Airlines, {{takes place}} in the present, and has Edgeworth {{becoming}} involved with the smuggling ring during a trip aboard an airliner. An Interpol agent investigating the smuggling is murdered during the trip, and Edgeworth and a flight attendant become the main suspects. Another prosecutor, Franziska von Karma, works with Interpol to expose the smuggling ring; she and Edgeworth discover the murderer to be another flight attendant, who is working with the smuggling ring. In the third case, The Kidnapped Turnabout, Edgeworth is called by Ernest Amano, whose son Lance has been kidnapped and is held at an amusement park. While attempting to exchange the ransom money, Edgeworth is also kidnapped, but is freed by Kay, who calls herself the true Yatagarasu. They release Lance, and find the dead body of Oliver Deacon, who Lance identifies as one of the kidnappers. As Edgeworth investigates the mystery, he meets Interpol agents Shi-Long Lang and Shih-na, who believe that Amano's <b>business</b> <b>group</b> is involved with the smuggling ring; the ring's counterfeit money has ruined the economy of their home country Zheng Fa, so they seek {{to bring an end to}} the ring. Edgeworth learns that the kidnapping was a ploy by Lance to get money from his father, and that Lance had killed Deacon after the latter tried to back out of the plan. Evidence is found tying Amano to the smuggling ring, and Lang brings Amano in for questioning.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} {{compared}} the big <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> in China with both nongroup firms in China and big <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> in Korea, chaebols.

This is some contrast to the Korean case that Chaebols tend to be more heavily indebted, to pursue faster growth at the expense of profitability, compared to non-chaebol firms. Compared to Korean chaebols, Chinese <b>business</b> <b>groups</b> are smaller both in absolute asset size and relative to Chinese GDP, less diversified, are of simply hierarchical ownership structure, are less heavily indebted, and are less growth-oriented.
