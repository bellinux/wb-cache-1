40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test whether behaviorally {{mediated}} effects of gray wolf (Canis lupus) presence were visible in terms of <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> by moose (Alces alces) on tree saplings in recently planted clear-cut areas in Sweden. The study involved two different spatial scales; the clear-cut scale and tree scale. At the clear-cut scale the influence of wolf predation risk, tree density and tree height on moose <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> was evaluated. At the individual tree scale, the factor distance to the nearest forest edge was also included. <b>Browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> was measured as apical shoot browsing and lateral shoot browsing in 24 different recently planted clear-cuts. Due to differences in preference between tree species and qualitative differences between plant parts, the same analyses were conducted for the five main tree species and for apical and lateral shoot browsing separately. Based on pellet group counts, moose is most likely the main browser in this study. Further, I found that both tree density and tree height were lower in the wolf core areas, suggesting multicollinearity between wolf utilization, tree density and tree height at the clear-cut scale, the effect of these factors could not be separated in the multivariate models. At the clear-cut scale <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> decreased with tree density. At the tree scale, although wolf utilization was an important factor explaining the variation in <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity,</b> the browsing probability decreased with tree height. Overall, this suggests that moose foraging and thus its <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> was more influenced by tree density and tree height than predation risk by wolves. It also seemed that moose browse through a clear-cut area irrespectively of distance to the closest forest edge...|$|E
40|$|Canada yew (Taxus canadensis) is a clonal shrub {{that forms}} {{discrete}} patches and was formerly {{an important component}} of forest understories in much of northeastern North America. Following Euro-American settlement, Canada yew has been extirpated or reduced in abundance throughout much of its former range, particularly in the USA; winter browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has been implicated as responsible for much of its decline. Little is known about the factors affecting deer <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> on Canada yew. We examined factors related to <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> on Canada yew across three spatial scales in 29 forest stands in Michigan, USA. <b>Browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> on stems was related principally to two factors acting simultaneously across multiple spatial scales. <b>Browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> was negatively related to amount of Canada yew at the scale of the forest stand and negatively related to distance from the edge of Canada yew patches, effectively creating refugia from browsing. The browsing patterns we observed suggest that yew exists in two alternate stable states: (1) as loose aggregations of small stems or (2) large, dense patches of large stems. The implications of changes in deer density or snow cover to the probability of local persistence of Canada yew are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Elephant are {{considered}} major drivers of ecosystems, but their effects within small-scale landscape features {{and on other}} herbivores still remain unclear. Elephant impact on vegeta-tion has been widely studied in areas where elephant have been present for many years. We therefore examined the combined effect of short-term elephant presence (< 4 years) and hillslope position on tree species assemblages, resource availability, <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> and soil properties. Short-term elephant presence did not affect woody species assem-blages, but did affect height distribution, with greater sapling densities in elephant access areas. Overall tree and stem densities were also not affected by elephant. By contrast, slope position affected woody species assemblages, but not height distributions and densi-ties. Variation in species assemblages was statistically best explained by levels of total cat-ions, Zinc, sand and clay. Although elephant and mesoherbivore browsing intensities were unaffected by slope position, we found lower mesoherbivore <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> on crests with high elephant <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity.</b> Thus, elephant appear to indirectly facilitate the sur-vival of saplings, via the displacement of mesoherbivores, providing a window of opportunit...|$|E

Consequently, {{ecological}} studies relying on modern observations or historical records may have difficulty assessing natural vegetation dynamics under current and future climate. We combined a sedimentary pollen record from Lago di Massacciucoli, Tuscany, Italy with simulations from the LandClim dynamic vegetation model to determine what vegetation preceded intense human disturbance, how past changes in vegetation relate to fire and browsing, and the potential of an extinct vegetation type under present climate. We simulated vegetation dynamics near Lago di Massaciucoli for the last 7, 000 years using a local chironomid-inferred temperature reconstruction with combinations of three fire regimes (small infrequent, large infrequent, small frequent) and three <b>browsing</b> <b>intensities</b> (no <b>browsing,</b> light browsing, and moderate browsing), and compared model output to pollen data. Simulations with low disturbance support pollen-inferred evidence for a mixed forest dominated by Quercus ilex (a Mediterranean species) and Abies alba (a montane species). Whereas pollen data record the collapse of A. alba after 6000 cal yr bp, simulated populations expanded with declining summer temperatures during the late Holocene. Simulations with increased fire and browsing are consistent with evidence for expansion by deciduous species after A. alba collapsed. According to our combined paleo-environmental and modeling evidence, mixed Q. ilex and A. alba forests remain possible with current climate and limited disturbance, and provide a viable management objective for ecosystems near the Mediterranean coast and in regions {{that are expected to}} experience a mediterranean-type climate in the future...|$|R

Abundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) present a significant management problem in forested landscapes of North America. Conserving vulnerable communities requires quantifying herbivory levels and {{the density of}} the herbivore populations. The current study was conducted in 2006 to investigate the status of white-tailed deer throughout Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and their impacts on forest communities as well as Canada yew (Taxus canadensis) populations. Deer densities were estimated using fecal pellet surveys across islands of known deer occupancy. Using a defecation rate of 34. 4 pellet groups deer- 1 day- 1, population estimates on Sand (8. 23 deer km 2) and York (7. 68 deer km 2) islands were considerably greater than Basswood (1. 82 deer km 2) and Oak (1. 56 deer km 2) islands. The variation in deer density reflects measurable differences in forage availability and browse quality between islands. <b>Browse</b> <b>intensity</b> and electivity indices revealed that northern white cedar or hemlock were selected for browsing by deer on Basswood and Oak islands, yet when Canada yew was abundant (on other islands) they were selected against. Dimensional analyses of browsed and unbrowsed stems were used to assess annual browse biomass production and utilization of Canada yew by white-tailed deer. A species-specific allometric relationship of stem diameter and shoot biomass was developed for Canada yew and used to predict the total browse biomass consumed at the stem level. Estimates of annual browse production and utilization from York and Sand islands revealed that deer herbivory accounted for 53 % and 74 %, respectively, of new browse biomass losses. Deer populations and herbivory levels on Sand and York islands are not sustainable for continued growth and reproduction of Canada yew populations, which are regionally uncommon. Landscape composition and species susceptibility to herbivory should be important considerations in the management of deer populations across Apostle Islands National Lakeshore...|$|R
40|$|Browsing of tree saplings by deer hampers forest {{regeneration}} in mixed forests across Europe and North America. It {{is well known}} that tree species are differentially affected by deer browsing, but little is known about how different facets of diversity, such as species richness, identity, and composition, affect <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> at different spatial scales. Using forest inventory data from the Hainich National Park, a mixed deciduous forest in central Germany, we applied a hierarchical approach to model the browsing probability of patches (regional scale) as well as the species-specific proportion of saplings browsed within patches (patch scale). We found that, at the regional scale, the probability that a patch was browsed increased with certain species composition, namely with low abundance of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and high abundance of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), whereas at the patch scale, the proportion of saplings browsed per species was mainly determined by the species’ identity, providing a “preference ranking” of the 11 tree species under study. Interestingly, at the regional scale, species-rich patches {{were more likely to be}} browsed; however, at the patch scale, species-rich patches showed a lower proportion of saplings per species browsed. Presumably, diverse patches attract deer, but satisfy nutritional needs faster, such that fewer saplings need to be browsed. Some forest stand parameters, such as more open canopies, increased the <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> at either scale. By showing the effects that various facets of diversity, as well as environmental parameters, exerted on <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> at the regional as well as patch scale, our study advances the understanding of mammalian herbivore–plant interactions across scales.

We focused on (1) short-term browsing effects on reproductive and morphological traits of a dominant-palatable woody species, Acacia nigrescens, Miller, (2) the relationship between browsing–grazing intensity and soil parameters, (3) the effects of herbivore–soil interactions on woody species richness and composition, and (4) browser-induced effects on the representation of woody plant functional traits. We show {{that the number of}} pods carried by A. nigrescens trees as well as the internode length of external tree branches both decreased significantly at high <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity.</b> Moreover, we found that total soil nitrogen (N) and soil cation (Ca, Na, Mg, and K) concentrations varied significantly according to grazing rather than <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> with soil nutrients decreasing at heavily grazed sites. Although herbivory and soil properties together explained ∼ 79 % of the total variability in woody species composition, neither herbivory intensity nor soil properties taken separately could explain variation in woody species richness across sites. <b>Browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> could also not account for variation in the mix of evergreen, spinescent and preferred browse plants across sites. Ordination analysis showed that the palatable but spinescent A. nigrescens had the lowest fit on the first two ordination axes and was distributed across study sites irrespective of herbivory intensity and soil properties. We suggest that community-level interactions between browsers and woody plants are different in arid eutrophic African savannas where the dominance by spinescent trees might prevent shifts in species composition under high <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity,</b> which is contrary to what has been observed in woodlands at higher latitudes...|$|E
40|$|White-tailed deer. Decades {{of chronic}} {{browsing}} by overabundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) has strongly influenced forest pattern and process on the Allegheny High Plateau Ecoregion of northwestern Pennsylvania, USA. Previous {{research has found}} that riparian forests contain the greatest herbaceous plant species richness of regional plant communities but {{little is known about the}} impacts of deer browsing on the structure and composition of the herbaceous layer (all vascular plants < 1 m tall) of Allegheny High Plateau riparian forests. We examined browse preference and <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> by white-tailed deer on the herbaceous layer of five riparian forest study sites in the Allegheny National Forest during the summer growing season (July, September). <b>Browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> was low to moderate and differed significantly among sites and sample periods.

We found that plant species richness and composition, and <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> by white-tailed deer, are highly variable across riparian forests of the region.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that wolves are reducing local <b>browse</b> <b>intensity</b> by white-tailed deer, thus indirectly mitigating the biotic impoverishment of understorey plant communities in northern Wisconsin. To assess the potential for such a top-down trophic cascade response, we developed a spatially and temporally explicit model of wolf territory occupancy based on three decades of wolf monitoring data. Using a nested multiscale vegetation survey protocol, we compared the understorey plant communities of northern white cedar wetlands found in high wolf areas with control sites found in low wolf areas. We fit species–area curves for plant species grouped by vegetation growth form (based on their predicted response to release from herbivory, i. e. tree, seedling, shrub, forb, grass, sedge or fern) and duration of wolf territory occupancy. As predicted for a trophic cascade response, forb species richness at local scales (10 m 2) was significantly higher in high wolf areas (high wolf areas: 10. 7 ± 0. 9, N = 16, low wolf areas: 7. 5 ± 0. 9, N = 16, P 3 ̆c 0. 001), as was shrub species richness (high wolf areas: 4. 4 ± 0. 4, N = 16, low wolf areas: 3. 2 ± 0. 5, N = 16, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Also as predicted, percentage cover of ferns was lower in high wolf areas (high wolf areas: 6. 2 ± 2. 1, N = 16, low wolf areas: 11. 6 ± 5. 3, N = 16, P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Beta richness was similar {{between high and low}} wolf areas, supporting earlier assumptions that deer herbivory impacts plant species richness primarily at local scales. Sampling at multiple spatial scales revealed that changes in species richness were not consistent across scales nor among vegetation growth forms: forbs showed a stronger response at finer scales (1 – 100 m 2), while shrubs showed a response across relatively broader scales (10 – 1000 m 2). Synthesis. Our results are consistent with hypothesized trophic effects on understorey plant communities triggered by a keystone predator recovering from regional extinction. In addition, we identified the response variables and spatial scales appropriate for detecting such differences in plant species composition.

40|$|In {{some regions}} of the West, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) has been declining {{after more than a}} century of {{changing}} human land-use patterns associated with urbanization, fire suppression, predator extirpation, and agriculture. More recently, episodes of large-scale decline, such as Sudden Aspen Decline (SAD), have been identified in association with drought and other inciting and predisposing factors. Although in many instances decline has been overstated, aspen ecosystems are expected to continue to be vulnerable to climate change and perturbing trends in human land-use patterns. Restoring processes and structures associated with resilience to aspen communities would aid in making them more resilient to future SAD-inciting factors. In this thesis I review the literature on aspen decline, explore the current use of rapid assessment tools in aspen research, identify key indicators of resilience in aspen, and propose a Community-level Aspen Resilience Assessment Tool (CARAT). Aspen decline is a complex and context-dependent phenomenon with multiple inciting and predisposing factors. Climate change-induced drought is a major factor in aspen decline, in addition to chronic ungulate herbivory, habitat fragmentation, fire suppression, and other alterations to stand ecology. Future increases in environmental stressors, such as climate change-induced drought (Worrall et al. 2013) and human land-use patterns associated with urban development and agricultural expansion (Hilty et al. 2006), may require efforts aimed at the conservation and restoration of processes, functions, and structures that will maintain the resilience of aspen communities. An aspen conservation approach that focuses on restoring resilience may prove to be the most robust strategy to maintain aspen communities in the face of uncertain future environmental stressors. Restoring fire regimes and taking action to ease the stress of herbivory on aspen can be instituted through a number of management strategies in both wilderness areas and working landscapes. I present recommendations, such as restoring ecologically effective populations of wolves (Canis lupus) where possible, and implementing prescribed burns, coppicing, and strategically placed exclosures. A rapid assessment tool of resilience in aspen communities would be valuable to conservation and restoration work. Landscape-level, coarse-scale assessments are commonly used to assess cover changes in aspen research to identify decline. I present {{a review of the literature}} pertaining to the use of satellite imaging, aerial photography and surveys, and repeat photography in aspen research. While these are ideal tools for detecting cover changes over large areas, they are limited in scale and to documenting exterior stand structures (i. e., canopy and vertical edge structures), and may be inadequate to assess aspen resilience. In order to develop a community-level rapid assessment tool for aspen resilience, I review 6 factors associated with aspen resilience: climate, disturbance, predation, ecophysiology, genetics, and connectivity. These factors are synergistic and interactive. The criteria I use to determine whether they are suitable resilience indicators for use in a rapid assessment tool are 1) is it feasible to rapidly assess the indicator at the community-level? and 2) is the indicator manageable in the context of conservation or restoration goals? I found that the most feasible and effective indicators were predation, disturbance, and connectivity. However, due to the importance of climate, it is essential that it be taken into account in both the application and interpretation of the results of this tool. I propose a resilience index that measures resilience on a 3 -point scale, where 1 is the least resilient and 3 is the most. For each indicator, I identify a set of measurable variables. For predation I propose to use wolf population, elk (Cervus elaphus) population density, and <b>browse</b> <b>intensity.</b> For disturbance, I propose to use fire history. I propose to measure connectivity using road density. Finally, I propose to measure general aspen ecology using aspen recruitment ratio, aspen regeneration, and conifer canopy cover. I was unable to validate my rapid assessment tool within the scope of this thesis. Validation of this tool would be the subject of further research, in the form of PhD studies, to determine its effectiveness in measuring resilience. If effective, this tool could be valuable in guiding conservation actions to help make aspen communities more resilient to stressors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Browsing by {{introduced}} brushtail possums {{is linked}} to major declines in mistletoe abundance in New Zealand, yet in some areas mistletoes persist, apparently unaffected {{by the presence of}} possums. To determine the cause of this spatial variation in impact I investigated the abundance and condition (crown dieback and extent of possum browse cover) of two mistletoes (Alepis flavida, Peraxilla tetrapetala) and abundance and diet of possums in two mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) forests in the central-eastern South Island of New Zealand. Mistletoe is common and there are long-established uncontrolled possum populations in both forests. Mistletoes were abundant (216 – 1359 per hectare) and important in possum diet (41 – 59 % of total diet), but possum density was low (c. 2 per hectare) in both areas. Possum impacts were slight with low <b>browse</b> frequencies and <b>intensities</b> over much of the study sites. However, impacts were significantly greater at a forest margin, where possum abundance was highest, and at a high-altitude site where mistletoe density was lowest. Mistletoe crown dieback was inversely proportional to <b>intensity</b> of possum <b>browsing.</b> These results suggest that the persistence of abundant mistletoe populations at these sites is due to mistletoe productivity matching or exceeding consumption by possums in these forests of low possum-carrying capacity, rather than low possum preference for the local mistletoe populations. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R

This study investigated the antecedents of trust motivation; the predictors of participation, browsing, f-commerce usage intensity; and their influence on urge to impulsively purchase and impulse purchase from the context of f-commerce. The effect of urgency towards urge to impulsively purchase and impulse purchase were also determined.

40|$|Plant–plant {{interactions}} {{have been}} indicated {{as a potential}} means to facilitate oak seedling establishment and reduce herbivory when restoring oak forests. The aim of this thesis was to investigate mechanisms and outcomes of competitive and indirectly facilitative interactions between oak (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) seedlings and neighboring plants, primarily shrubs. The associational resistance of planted oak seedlings to larger herbivores provided by naturally occurring shrubs was tested in ten temperate broadleaved forests across southern Sweden. The results showed that shrubs reduced ungulate <b>browsing</b> frequency and <b>intensity</b> by concealing the oak seedlings and by sharing enemies (i. e. ungulate herbivores) with surrounding and more preferred shrub species, thus providing numeric dilution and associational plant refuges. The occurrence of naturally regenerated oak seedlings, five years after a conservation-oriented thinning, was negatively influenced {{by the presence of}} tall ground vegetation and positively influenced by high soil moisture. For oak seedlings planted in an open field, shrubs indirectly facilitated biomass accumulation by reducing competition from herbaceous vegetation. However, shrubs became net competitors three years after planting. The oak seedling response, in terms of biomass accumulation, transpiration and photosynthesis, to competition from shrubs was proportional to resource availability. Aboveground competition for light had a greater effect on oak seedling growth than belowground competition. Nevertheless, oak seedlings were able to produce a second shoot flush, over-topping the shrub canopy. This periodic flushing enabled light-acclimation in a stratified light environment. In conclusion, management of shrubs has the potential to reduce browsing and herbaceous competitors during oak regeneration, particularly during the first years after planting. Although shrubs alone may not replace fences as an effective means of reducing browsing on oaks, they provide a complement to improve the growth of seedlings during the early stages of establishment...|$|R

40|$|The {{yield of}} sugar beet is {{directly}} affected by LAI (leaf area index) and values of LAD (leaf area duration). The integral leaf area plays, except for other factors, an important role during the damage or reduction of leaf apparatus. There are many sources of leaf damage: natural disasters (hailstorm), diseases, pests (including game <b>browsing)</b> etc. The <b>intensity</b> of the root production and quality differs {{in relation to the}} growth stage of the damage plant. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the extent of losses in the root yield and the quality of sugar beet upon gradual reduction of the leaf area. Two diploid varieties Monza and Compact were used in the small-plot trials conducted in years 2004 to 2006 (in the experimental station Žabčice – maize production region, zone K 2, average altitude 184 m, soil type was classified as gley fluvisoil, soil is medium heavy to heavy, clay-loam to loam type). The leaf area was manually reduced by 25 % and 50 % at BBCH 18 – 19 growth phase (8 – 9 leaves unfolded). The results were statistically evaluated by analysis of variance and testing by Tukey test (at the significance level α = 5 %). Reduction of the leaf area was reflected on the decrease of the root yield by 1 to 10 % depending on the year of harvest. In addition, the stressful state of the plants after defoliation resulted in the decrease of the yield of polarization sugar per hectare, namely by 0. 45 to 1. 66 t. ha– 1. In 2005, the leaf area reduction caused a rise of the α-amino nitrogen content. The rise in the potassium and sodium cations content caused by the leaf area reduction also increased the sugar content in the treacle (by 0. 1 to 0. 16 %).

40|$|Disturbances such as {{fire and}} grazing can degrade landscapes, {{but they can}} also {{rejuvenate}} them. I evaluated: 1) the practicality of strategically timed (fall), high <b>intensity</b> <b>browsing</b> of sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. tridentata, ssp. wyomingensis) by cattle; 2) the foraging behavior and body weights of cattle with varying levels of experience browsing sagebrush; and 3) the ensuing responses of grasses, forbs, and sagebrush to cattle grazing. In spatially and temporally replicated trials from 2007 to 2009, fall grazing by cattle reduced the abundance of sagebrush and promoted production of grasses and forbs. The cattle used in these trials were challenged to learn to eat sagebrush in the unfamiliar circumstance of confinement in small pastures. Throughout the trials from 2007 to 2009, pregnant cows with calves (2007), bred yearling heifers (2008), and first-calf heifer/calf pairs (2009) supplemented with protein and energy – to mitigate the effects of terpenes in big sagebrush – learned to select sagebrush as a significant portion of their diet. In virtually every case, experienced animals consistently used more sagebrush and lost less weight, or actually gained more weight, than naive animals in 2008 and 2009. My research suggests grazing by cattle during fall can be effective, biologically and economically, and can lead to habitat renovation and resilience. Moreover, grazing can create locally adapted systems in ways that landscape manipulations with chemical and mechanical treatments and prescribed fire cannot. These “technological fixes” are increasingly impractical due to environmental concerns, the high costs of fossil fuels, and the need to repeat outcome-based treatments rather than incorporating process-based approaches into managing landscapes. Rather than attempting to convert sagebrush steppe landscapes to grass at extravagant costs, as we have done historically, we must now consider ways to create locally adapted herds of livestock and complementary management practices to ensure long-term health of sagebrush steppe. As many ranchers already feed hay to cows during winter, using sagebrush steppe vegetation as an additional forage resource would allow ranchers to feed roughly half the hay, which would greatly reduce winter feed costs. In addition to financial savings in hay, the secondary benefits from improving sagebrush steppe condition and productivity would result in habitat improvements for both livestock and wildlife...|$|R
40|$|Bowman, Jacob L. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are overabundant in {{many areas}} of the country and {{increased}} deer numbers have caused damage to agronomic crops to increase. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a commonly grown crop and food source for white-tailed deer on the Delmarva Peninsula. The effect of deer browsing on corn and soybean yields has been documented, but research is lacking on the effect of deer browsing on wheat yield. In 2007 - 2009, I investigated the effect of browse timing and wheat type (bearded and unbearded) on wheat yield in Delaware. I placed 1680, 4. 4 m 2 plots in the middle of 10 m distance classes starting from the forested edge out to 60 m. In 2007, I systematically assigned 1 of 2 treatments (i. e., no protection or protected at planting) to the plots. In 2008 - 2009, I added a third treatment: protected prior to heading. After head emergence, I conducted weekly browse surveys on all unprotected plots to determine browse rates. I collected weekly biomass samples to estimate the amount of wheat biomass removed by deer. I harvested a 1 m 2 area in the middle of each plot to determine the deer impact on yield. I also tested if browsing affects the test weight of wheat during 2008 and 2009. <b>Browsing</b> increased in <b>intensity</b> as head development progressed with most browsing occurring on the unbearded wheat. I found no interaction between wheat and treatment (P > 0. 10) during the study. Unprotected plots yielded 195 kg/ha more wheat then protected plots in 2007 (P = 0. 08). I found no difference between treatments for 2008 and 2009 (P = 0. 38). Bearded wheat yielded 379 kg/ha higher in 2007 and 399 kg/ha higher in 2008 and 2009 than unbearded wheat (P < 0. 001). I found no difference in test weight among treatments (P = 0. 42) or between wheat types (P = 0. 997) in 2008 and 2009. My browse surveys demonstrated avoidance of bearding but the overall browsing was not intense enough to reduce yield. My results differed from past research documenting a reduction in yield but the lower deer density (~ 15 deer/km 2) on my study area was the likely cause of the difference.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{objective of}} management in strictly protected areas, such as national parks, {{is to reduce}} human intervention {{as much as possible}} to secure natural assemblages and processes. As wildlife management in many national parks has to deal with increased ungulate populations and a broad lack of predators, park managers need to know how their wildlife management, including feeding and hunting, disturbs ungulate behaviour, which in turn might affect natural processes. One measure for this effect is the spatial distribution of browsing pressure in the landscape. Here we measured the browsing activity of ungulates on 5841 vegetation plots in the montane Bavarian Forest National Park to test the hypothesis that browsing in the landscape is mostly influenced by environmental covariables not related to park management. The survey revealed a <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> that allows regrowth of tree species most palatable for ungulates. A comparison of different predictor sets in our spatial additive logistic regression models for silver fir, common rowan and European beech revealed that management activities and space are most important in explaining the variation in browsing level. These quantitative results underline that management activities are of major relevance for the variation of <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity.</b> Thereby, these activities shape a landscape of management that strongly contrasts the aims of the national park to reduce anthropogenic influence on natural processes. We therefore urge all park managers to carefully reconsider the necessity and effect of their management activities, especially of winter feeding, deer control areas and hiking trails...|$|E

40|$|Domestic goats {{were used}} to modify the growth form of blackbrush, a spinescent shrub {{occurring}} in nearly monospecific stands on several million hectares of rangeland in the southwestern United States. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate goat browsing as a means of improving these rangelands for cattle. Winter goat browsing stimulated spring twig growth from basal and axillary buds which resulted in increased production. Twig production by heavily browsed plants (3 ̆e 95 percent removal of current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs) was a function of precipitation, soil depth, branch location on the plant, and period of rest after browsing. As precipitation doubled, production increased by a factor of 1. 9. Twig production by plants growing on deep soils (71 cm) was 1. 9 times that by plants growing on shallow soils (39 cm). Older branches growing on the outer edges of blackbrush plants (terminal branches) produced 4. 6 times more current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs than sprouts and young branches (basal branches) growing within the shrub canopy. Heavily browsed plants increased twig production by a factor of 3. 6 relative to control plants, and production remained at this level, even after four consecutive years of <b>browsing.</b> Stocking <b>intensities</b> of 2. 4 animal-unit-months·hectare- 1 were required to achieve utilization levels of 80 percent in blackbrush pastures. Annual twig production declined with rest from browsing. However, plants which were browsed and subsequently rested for two years yielded an aggregate 1. 6 times more available forage than plants which were browsed on a yearly basis. This was due to an accumulation of twigs ranging in age from one to three years. Browsing also improved the apparent nutritional quality of blackbrush twigs. Current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs contained more crude protein (6. 5 versus 4. 6 percent), phosphorus (0. 10 versus 0. 08 percent), and in vitro digestible dry matter (48 versus 38 percent) than older twigs. Current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs from basal branches contained more crude protein (6. 1 versus 5. 7 percent) and in vitro digestible dry matter (44 versus 41 percent) than those from terminal branches. The palatability of current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs to goats and cattle was lower, however, than that of older twigs, presumably due to their higher tannin levels. Within individual blackbrush plants, current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs from terminal branches were higher in tannins than those from basal branches. Rest from browsing resulted in decreased tannin levels due to a decrease in the proportion of current season 2 ̆ 7 s to older twigs. Goats and cattle tended to prefer older twigs to current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs, and current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs from basal branches to those from terminal branches. The occurrence and allocation of tannins within blackbrush support hypotheses dealing with the elaboration and allocation of phyto-chemicals as defense mechanisms countering herbivory. Esophageally fistulated goats (does and kids) browsing in pastures where forage consisted primarily of current season 2 ̆ 7 s twigs consumed diets with more crude protein, in vitro digestible dry matter, and tannins than goats browsing in pastures where forage consisted primarily of older twigs. They also lost less weight. Does initially consumed diets higher, but later consumed diets lower in crude protein than those consumed by kids. Kids consumed diets with more in vitro digestible dry matter, but lost more weight than does. No statistically significant differences in weight response were recorded for cattle browsing in pastures which were, and were not, previously browsed by goats. However, the average heifer in previously unbrowsed pastures consumed 1. 9 times more protein supplement than her counterpart in previously browsed pastures...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 The {{influence}} of streambank location {{and timing of}} herbivory on success of planted Booth's willow (Salix boothii Dorn) cuttings along a Rosgen C 5 -type stream in an eastern Oregon meadow was determined. Willow cuttings were planted on two morphological locations (i. e. point bar and floodplain) in May of 2002 and 2003. Gravimetric soil moisture and depth to water table data were collected periodically on each planting location during the growing season, May through September, in both years. Three grazing treatments, early season, late season, and none (control) were conducted. Percent survival, leader density, and number of browsed leaders of willows were recorded prior to and after each grazing treatment, as well as stubble height of forage species. Simple linear regression {{was used to determine}} if a relationship between residual stubble height and percent willow browse existed. Multiple linear regression was used in an attempt to develop a predictive equation for percent browse based on pre-grazing stubble and willow heights. It was hypothesized that depth to water table and percent soil moisture throughout the growing season would significantly influence willow survival and growth; that survival would be higher on point bar locations; and that willows would be <b>browsed</b> at different <b>intensities</b> according to season of grazing. Soil moisture content at point bar locations was greater than that of floodplain locations {{for the majority of the}} growing season in both years. In 2003, groundwater levels were higher on point bar than floodplain locations from May through September. Willow survival was higher for point bar locations than floodplain locations, in both years, regardless of grazing treatment. Willows were browsed more intensively later in the growing season. Results from the simple linear regression suggest that percent browse of willows was related to the residual stubble height, but did not explain the variability observed. An attempt to develop a predictive equation, i. e., expected browse based on pre-grazing stubble height, was made, however no apparent relationship between the willow height, stubble height, and percent browse was found. Grazing treatment did influence willow survival; survival on floodplain locations within the late grazing treatment was less than that of the ungrazed floodplain locations. Our results suggest that planting willows in locations where the planting depth remains within 40 cm of the groundwater depth will increase planting success. Protection from grazing for at least the first year of growth is recommended for optimum planting survival; grazing early in the season is more favorable to survival than grazing later in the season...|$|R
40|$|Vlachos, Dionisios G. Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) simulations {{are used to}} simulate stacks of different sizes {{in order to understand}} nonlinear effects which arise in scale-out of microchemical systems. As an example process, syngas production from methane is studied using a multifunctional, parallel plate reactor with alternating combustion and steam reforming channels. A scale-out strategy is proposed which creates larger stacks from a base-unit. Stacks are evaluated in terms of efficiency, maximum wall temperature and stability under external heat loss for both high and moderate wall thermal conductivities. We find that smaller stacks are unstable under laboratory heat loss conditions. Stacks with high wall thermal conductivities are more stable than those with moderate wall conductivities under our conditions. At high heat loss coefficients, significant transverse thermal gradients exist between interior and edge channels of the stacks that result in significant loss of efficiency. A transition from all ignited to some ignited and extinguished and finally to all extinguished channels is discovered as criticality is approached in moderate size stacks. Microsystems provide one to three orders of magnitude larger volumetric and gravimetric throughputs than conventional technology irrespective of model uncertainty, and such intensification is central to portable and distributed processing. They exhibit energy efficiency that is a strong function of size and heat loss but can outperform conventional processing under many conditions. However, they result in higher cost per unit syngas volume unless system optimization is carried out. Stability improvement techniques such as different reactor sizes, reducing wall thermal conductivity, increasing the Pt catalyst loading and burning hydrogen rather than methane in the outermost channels are investigated. To simulate fuel-lean hydrogen combustion in a computationally efficient manner, a single step rate expression for hydrogen combustion on Pt is derived from a previously published microkinetic model. The most effective means for improving stability is found to be combusting hydrogen or increasing the Pt catalyst loading in the outermost combustion channel.

40|$|Large {{carnivores}} {{can either}} directly influence ungulate populations or indirectly affect their behaviour. Knowledge from European systems, {{in contrast to}} North American systems, on how this might lead to cascading effects on lower trophic levels is virtually absent. We studied whether wolves Canis lupus via density-mediated and behaviorally-mediated effects on their ungulate prey species influence patterns of browsing and tree regeneration inside the Bialowieza National Park, Poland. <b>Browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> of tree saplings (height class < 150 cm), irrespective of tree species or forest type, was lower inside a wolf core area (50. 5 %) where predator presence is highest, than {{in the remainder of}} the wolf pack’s home range (58. 3 %). Additionally, <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> was reduced when the amount of coarse woody debris (CWD), which can act as a ¿ungulate escape impediment', increased (within 5 -m radius) inside the wolf core area. No relationship existed outside the core area. As a result, the proportion of trees growing out of herbivore control increased more strongly with increasing amount of CWD inside compared to outside the wolf core area. This suggests that next to direct effects of wolves on ungulate density caused by a higher predation pressure inside the core area, risk effects are important and are enhanced by habitat characteristics. These results indicate that behaviorally-mediated effects of predators on prey can become more important than density-mediated effects in affecting lower trophic levels. This is the first study we are aware of, that shows CWD can create fine-scale risk effects on ungulates with the potential for cascading effects of large predators on patterns of tree regeneration for a European forest system. This knowledge broadens the discussion on how the impact of large predators on ecosystem functioning depends on the physical landscape, by illustrating these effects for a system which largely contrasts in this respect to the North American systems...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{aspects of}} feeding habits of moose (Alces alces) {{and their impact}} on forest development. The development of forage that is available to moose was studied by sampling the amount of edible biomass on pine and birch trees. A strong relationship was found between foliage (and twig) biomass and tree diameter, which corroborates the hypothesis that sapwood area limits the amount of leaves that can be supported by a tree. The vertical distribution of crown biomass could be described with a sinusoidal function. Tree diameter, tree height, the vertical length of the crown and the physical constraints of the animal determine the amount of available food. The diet preferences of the moose result in uneven browsing patterns in forest landscapes. A managed forest area was studied with respect to twig consumption, and it was found that trees were not consumed in proportion to availability. The probability that the most preferred species (rowan, aspen and willow) would be selected for browsing was found to be about 14 times higher than the corresponding probabilities for Scots pine or downy birch, and about three times higher than for common juniper and silver birch. Spruce was strongly avoided by the moose. When the resource value of a tree was defined by both its preference value and amount of biomass we were able to explain more of the spatial distribution than if biomass was accounted for alone. By introducing browsing into an individual-based gap model (FORSKA) the long-term impact of browsing in a forest stand was studied. As <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> increased, the relative abundance of preferred tree species decreased. Tree species composition was more or less linearly related to <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity.</b> Hence, the impact of browsing on tree species composition is dependent not just on <b>browsing</b> <b>intensity</b> and abiotic factors such as climate, but also on the animals' preference for different tree species. The optimal balance between browsing damage and recreational hunting was addressed by developing a simulation model. An extensive sensitivity analysis on the input parameters revealed that the most influential parameters, together explaining 72 % of the variation in optimal density of herbivores, were: edible biomass produced in young pine stands, the number of days in a season that animals predominately feed on trees, the daily consumption of moose, and the effects of browsing on stand growth. Multiple use of the forest resource, i. e. combining rational forestry with recreational hunting, was found to be more beneficial than single use from a socio-economic perspective. While modelling tools for analysing the impact of large herbivores on forest stands is of interest for both ecological research and resource management, it is complicated by our limited understanding of animal behaviour and forest dynamics. In future research, trees responses' to browsing and the spatial movement of animals will be of particular interest...|$|E
