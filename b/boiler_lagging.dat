5|$|Maintenance problems. The {{chain-driven}} {{valve gear}} {{proved to be}} expensive to maintain and subject to rapid wear. Leaks from the oil bath onto the wheels caused oil to splash onto the <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging.</b> Once saturated with oil, the lagging attracted coal dust and ash, which provided combustible material, and sparks from heavy braking would set the lagging on fire underneath the air-smoothed casing. The fires were also attributed to oil overflowing from axlebox lubricators onto the wheels when stationary, to be flung upwards into the <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging</b> in service. In either case, the local fire brigade would be called to put the fire out, with cold water coming {{into contact with the}} hot boiler causing stress to the casings. Many photographs show an un-rebuilt locomotive with warped casings, the result of a lagging fire.|$|E

25|$|The 1925 {{design was}} by Milwaukee Road Chief Mechanical Engineer C. H. Bilty, with detail design by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, who {{actually}} built them. They represented {{the best of}} American locomotive practice at the time, and were given all the latest devices and fittings. A Coffin feedwater heater was fitted, which was the Milwaukee's favorite type; this was installed flush in the extended smokebox, and thus {{was not at all}} obvious. Possibly because of this, the <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging</b> was continued over the smokebox, which was not common; most North American locomotives had bare smokeboxes which were graphited, rather than painted. The associated steam-driven centrifugal water pump was located under the cab at the left rear. The class F6-a was fitted with the tender-mounted Wilson Water Conditioner instead of the Coffin feedwater heater.|$|E
25|$|Between 1846 and 1870 {{passenger}} locomotives {{were painted}} hunter green with some having black lining. Frames were red, and wheels were black; buffer beams were the regulation 'signal red'. Goods locomotives were black {{with red and}} white lining, except those operating into Brighton or London Bridge, in passenger livery. Some engines had <b>boilers</b> <b>lagged</b> with wooden strips. These were either highly polished mahogany with brass fixings or were painted in alternating stripes of dark green and vermillion. The main shade of green used gradually became darker. By the time Stroudley became Locomotive Superintendent the colour had become a variant of Brunswick Green used by many other companies. Carriages were painted sea green or varnished wood, the latter mainly first class stock.|$|R
50|$|The boiler {{was similar}} to the Watson Standard no. 3B boiler of the Class 15F, but with the {{distance}} between tubeplates reduced from 22 ft to 19 ft by the addition of a combustion chamber. While this resulted in a slight decrease in the total evaporative heating surface, there was a 40% increase in the firebox heating surface and a better ratio of firebox to grate area. The <b>boiler</b> was <b>lagged</b> with Cape Asbestos mattresses, manufactured and fitted in South Africa.|$|R
50|$|These {{locomotives}} were to {{form the}} basis for further development of the Pacific type, which was to become the standard express passenger steam locomotive type in South Africa. They were handsome locomotives and their appearance was enhanced by the use of planished steel plates to cover the <b>boiler</b> and cylinder <b>lagging.</b> They were equipped with two whistles of different tones and a steam turbine generator, mounted on the smokebox between the headlight and the chimney, to power the Edwards headlight.|$|R
500|$|The boiler was enveloped by Bulleid's air-smoothed sheet-steel casing, {{which was}} not for the {{purposes}} of streamlining, as demonstrated by the extremely flat front end, but as a way of lifting exhaust gases. [...] The flat sides were also an aid to cleaning the locomotive with mechanical carriage washers, representing an attempt to reduce labour costs. [...] It followed the profile of the Belpaire firebox and extended to a curved profile forward of the smokebox front. [...] Spun glass mattresses were used for <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging.</b> [...] The smokebox was a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox, acting as a former to maintain the shape of the air-smoothed casing. [...] In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. [...] The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.|$|E

5000|$|Shunting tank engines. 30 engines, {{designed}} {{under the}} supervision of C J Bowen-Cooke, and built at Crewe during 1911-1917. Intended for duties formerly needing two locomotives. Essentially a tank version of the G class 0-8-0s. When introduced they had the then new style of 12″ letters for the company's initials on the tank sides. They were fitted with saturated [...] "Precursor" [...] class <b>boilers</b> with <b>lagged</b> ends, round-top fireboxes, and sloping coal bunkers. The main wheels were coupled by three overlapping rods and the third pair of wheels were flangeless. Lever actuated Joy reversing gear appeared in-lieu of the normal Ramsbottom screw system. The earlier engines initially had slender tapered Cooke buffers but these were replaced by those of standard Webb pattern: The latter type was fitted from new on later engines. Braking was by steam, but vacuum brakes were provided to operate fitted or passenger stock if required.|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the engines}} were {{equipped}} with live-steam injectors {{on the right-hand side}} and exhaust steam injectors on the left-hand side. On the other fourteen locomotives, the boiler was fed by two no. 13 live-steam injectors, one on each side and situated immediately in front of the firebox, mounted low enough to ensure that water could still be drained effectively from the water tender when the engine was on a 1 in 40 (2½%) gradient. The injector feed pipes led to a combined top-feed check valve, situated on the first barrel plate on the top centre-line of the boiler. Feedwater entered the boiler through a spray nozzle beneath which was a baffle tray. The <b>boiler</b> was completely <b>lagged</b> with asbestos mattresses and covered with planished steel, carried on a steel crinoline structure and secured in position by stainless steel bands.|$|R

50|$|Wood lagging is {{a method}} of banding wooden slats around {{pipelines}} to protect against impact, abrasion, and corrosion. Wooden lagging acts as a sheath, protecting the pipeline from damage, and is especially useful in rocky terrain; steep inclines; around rivers or swampy areas; and other rough terrain. <b>Boiler</b> <b>lagging</b> is akin to pipe lagging, but is used to protect steam boilers.|$|E
50|$|The 720 {{class were}} {{built by the}} South Australian Railways as an {{improved}} version of the 710 class locomotives. The initial order was for five locomotives. They were intended to operate on the lighter narrow gauge lines, but after they began to spread rails, they were confined to the heavier lines. A further twelve were built between 1938 and 1943. The final seven differed in having streamlines valances and <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging</b> tinwear. Coal shortages after World War II saw 14 converted to burn oil. All were later converted back to coal burners. The last were withdrawn in April 1960.|$|E
5000|$|The group laid 900 feet of 5 and 7+1/4 in {{ground-level}} track. Only {{five years}} later, they were dismayed {{to be told}} after all this hard work had been done that below the top soil, underneath the track bed lies [...] "The Works" [...] dumping ground of blue asbestos <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging.</b> At {{the end of the}} 1984 operating season, and with winter approaching the opportunity arose to consider the next move. Well somebody moved it, the track that is. Only problem was they forgot to tell the group about it, the whole of the track disappeared, removed by a person or persons unknown.|$|E
50|$|Steam {{locomotives}} of the 21st century {{fall into}} two broad categories: those that use advanced steam technology and {{are designed to be}} commercially competitive with diesel locomotives; and those built to more traditional designs for hauling tourist trains. Even locomotives in the second case likely use some modern methods and materials. These include welded boilers, to simplify construction, and roller bearings to improve reliability. For safety reasons, asbestos is not used for <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging</b> and is replaced by other materials, such as glass fibre. If the locomotive runs on main lines, safety systems such as the Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) and an On-Train Monitoring Recorder (OTMR) must be fitted.|$|E
50|$|The engines from Beyer, Peacock were war-time {{austerity}} {{models on}} which planished steel <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging</b> {{was replaced by}} ordinary steel lagging, while cosmetic dressing items like stainless steel lagging bands, chrome-plated handrails and rounded corners {{on the front of}} the firebox lagging were absent or replaced by unplated items. While the boiler barrels of the pre-war engines were of nickel steel, the austerity locomotives had boiler barrels made of carbon steel with steel plates of 1/16 in greater thickness. When it was subsequently found that the increased thickness was unnecessary, 13/16 in thick carbon steel plates were used on later orders, the same thickness as earlier used with nickel steel plates, which resulted in a desirable reduction in axle loads.|$|E

50|$|The 223 sat in {{the open}} at Liberty Park, {{gradually}} deteriorating from weather and vandalism until 1979, when the city {{gave it to the}} Utah State Historical Society. John Bush, employee of the Roaring Camp & Big Trees Railroad in California, was commissioned to make a report on the cost of potential restoration. Lack of budget limited success with the project and it was again transferred, to the Utah State Railroad Museum in 1992. The 223 was stored behind the Shupe-Williams Candy Factory building just to the south of the Union Station, until the candy factory caught fire in 2006 and burned to the ground, taking with it three narrow gauge freight cars. Luckily the cab had already been removed from the engine before the fire. The 223 was then moved from there to its present location {{at the north end of}} the Utah State Railroad Museum complex next to the restoration shop. Limited restoration has been underway at its current location, Union Station, Ogden, Utah, with the tender and cab in the Museum's shop and the remainder sitting outside without <b>boiler</b> <b>lagging.</b>|$|E
