50|$|Coniothyrium hellebori is {{a fungus}} {{that causes the}} most common fungal disease for helleborus species known as <b>Hellebore</b> <b>black</b> spot or leaf spot. The disease is most common not only in botanical and {{ornamental}} gardens, but also in hellebore nurseries as well. Visible symptoms include blackish-brown spots that often appear as rings on the leaf blade or {{at the margins of}} the leaf. The spots will continue to grow larger as the disease progresses, retaining an elliptical or circular shape and turning a dark brown or black color. The spots will grow until they have infect the whole leaf. Petioles and flowers can also be infected, but the disease is primarily seen in the leaves. The symptoms become visible in the spring and worsen with time.|$|R
5000|$|Helleborus net {{necrosis}} virus (HeNNV) {{also known}} as <b>Hellebore</b> <b>black</b> death is an RNA virus that can cause serious disease in Hellebore plants by stunting or deforming the plant as it grows. The disease marks {{the leaves of the}} <b>hellebores</b> with <b>black</b> streaks, often following the veins of the leaf, and creating ring patterns. It can also mark the sepals and flowers with black spots or streaks, but it will not always do so. When symptoms are severe new leaves will have limited growth before dying off. The most seriously affected in the UK is Helleborus orientalis, but all hellebores are susceptible to the disease. [...] The most effective method of treatment against black death is to dig up and destroy all infected plants immediately. Many viruses are not transmitted through seeds, so it is possible to raise new disease resistant plants this way.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY In {{the absence}} of a {{coherent}} understanding of the pathological basis of a disease, only serendipity can provide effective drugs for its treatment. Nowhere is this more evident than in an examination of the history of psychotherapeutic drugs (Sneader, 1985, pp. 175 - 191). Supernatural medicine Our primitive ancestors believed disease arose from supernatural causes. Inevitably, their medi-cines were often {{selected on the basis of}} super-natural or magical qualities with which they were thought to be endowed. Any aspect of their appearance could be the basis for this, or alterna-tively transference of a desirable feature from an animal or person- whether dead or alive- might be considered. Such sympathetic remedies were often associated with fertility and birth, a process of revitalization (Sneader 1989 b). Castor is a pertinent example. Castor consists of the dried preputial follicles of the beaver, but frequently it was mistakenly believed to have been the testicles. The record of its use in uterine complaints dates back to the time of Hippocrates (Stannard, 1961), yet castor still appears in the Portuguese Pharmacopoeia. Throughout the ages it has been prescribed for hysteria- a condition described as a disease of the uterus (Greek, hustera) by the second century gynaecologist Aretaeus and many subsequent authorities. For not entirely unrelated reasons, castor was also deemed to be of value in treating epilepsy. Some drugs were selected to expel from the body the demons responsible for disease. The plant kingdom could be relied upon to provide an assortment of herbs to expurge such demons via one of the body’s orifices, either end of the alimentary canal being particularly favoured. The earliest recorded specific drug treatment for madness illustrates this. A Greek myth tells us how Melampus cured the daughters of the king of Argos of madness by giving them the milk of goats which had eaten hellebore (Greek melam-podion), a drastic purgative. The plant referred to was almost certainly the <b>black</b> <b>hellebore</b> (Hel-leborus niger), the favoured cathartic of th...|$|E
