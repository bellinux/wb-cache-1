5|$|Steel (with smaller {{carbon content}} than pig iron <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> wrought iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity {{by using a}} bloomery. Blacksmiths in Luristan in western Persia were making good steel by 1000BC. Then improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel were developed around 300BC and AD500 respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|Elemental boron, boron oxide, boric acid, borates, {{and many}} {{organoboron}} compounds are relatively nontoxic to {{humans and animals}} (with toxicity {{similar to that of}} table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD50 above 2g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{battle was}} bloody, but was decided when Li Shimin {{and a part}} of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment, {{planting}} the Tang banners in full view of both armies. Possibly coupled {{with the arrival of the}} flanking Tang cavalry, this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army: trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs, 3,000 Xia soldiers fell in the field or the subsequent pursuit, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50,000 were taken prisoner. These included Dou Jiande himself, who was wounded and captured while trying to find a way to cross the Yellow River.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more {{are classified as}} cities; those having less than five thousand <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one thousand inhabitants are classified as towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants are classified as villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E
5|$|After two {{costly and}} {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to seize the}} fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, {{on the last day}} of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. Considering the time, effort, and resources spent to capture the small fort, it was a pyrrhic victory for the British. A number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way; <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> any other battle of the war, the fighting around Nalapani established the Gurkhas' reputation as warriors. As a result, they were later recruited by the British to serve in their army.|$|E

5|$|Copper {{has been}} in use at least 10,000 years, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 95% of all copper ever mined and smelted has been {{extracted}} since 1900, {{and more than half}} was extracted the last 24 years. As with many natural resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast, with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current rate of extraction. However, {{only a tiny fraction of}} these reserves is economically viable with present-day prices and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from 25 years to 60 years, depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate. Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world. Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; <b>but,</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E

His time of 57.94s placed him seventh in the final, ahead of fellow Australian Mark Tonelli, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two seconds behind the victorious John Naber of the United States. In the 200m event, Kerry put in a personal best time of 2m 3.58s in the first heat to qualify fourth fastest for the final, but swam slower in the decider to finish fifth in a time of 2m 4.07s, one place behind Tonelli and 2.72s away from bronze. Kerry combined with Paul Jarvie, Neil Rogers and Peter Coughlan in the 4100m medley relay, placing sixth. The quartet qualified in sixth place, and Kerry had them in fourth place after posting a time of 57.94s in the first leg, but his teammates were unable {{to keep up with the}} leaders and finished more than four seconds out of medal contention.|$|E

5|$|Oil tankers {{are only}} one source of oil spills. According to the United States Coast Guard, 35.7% {{of the volume of}} oil spilled in the United States from 1991 to 2004 came from tank vessels (ships/barges), 27.6% from {{facilities}} and other non-vessels, 19.9% from non-tank vessels, and 9.3% from pipelines; 7.4% from mystery spills. Only 5% of the actual spills came from oil tankers, while 51.8% came from other kinds of vessels. The detailed statistics for 2004 shown in the table below show tank vessels responsible for somewhat less than 5% of the number of total spills <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 60% of the volume. Tanker spills are much more rare and much more serious than spills from non-tank vessels.|$|E
5|$|The 2005 ACC Championship Game {{kicked off}} in Jacksonville, Florida at 8:11p.m. on December 3, 2005.

Brent Musburger, Jack Arute, and Gary Danielson were the broadcasters for the game. At kickoff, the weather was mostly cloudy with an air temperature of degrees. Approximately 72,429 fans were present at the game, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 75,000 tickets had been sold. Virginia Tech won the pre-game coin toss, but elected to defer its choice to the second half, forcing Florida State to have the ball on offense to begin the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1838-9 an {{agreement}} was signed between the Sakalava king and Seyyid Said, King of Zanzibar, to give Said {{control over the}} Sakalava and Antankarana kingdoms; this agreement never {{came to the attention}} of Tsimiaro and resulted in no changes in governance on the ground. While in exile on Nosy Mitsio, Tsimiaro traveled to Ile Bourbon to conclude a treaty with the French on 5 April 1841 that guaranteed French protection for the Antankarana in exchange for rights to the islands of Nosy Mitsio, Nosy Faly, Nosy Be and Nosy Komba. The French intercession eventually repelled the Merina, allowing the king to reestablish the capital at AmbatoharaÃ±a, <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 40 years passed before the entire Antankarana had permanently returned to the mainland. Upon his death, Tsimiaro was buried at his request in the Ankarana cave where he had taken refuge from the Merina. Other nobles are mainly entombed in the Islamic cemetery near AmbatoharaÃ±a. When the French agreed to recognize Malagasy sovereignty in 1862, they retained their claimed right to the Antankarana and Sakalava protectorates they had established. Tsimiaro was succeeded by his son, Tsialana II, (1883â€“1924) who was born on Nosy Mitsio in 1843. He collaborated with the French actively during their first expedition against the Merina (1883â€“85), and again during the successful expedition of 1895 that ended in French colonization of the island and the dismantling of the Merina monarchy. His son Abdourahaman would go on to fight on the side of the French during World War I. Tsialana II was succeeded by Lamboeny II (1925â€“1938), Tsialana III (1948â€“1959) and Tsimiharo II (1959â€“1982).|$|E

5|$|While II Canadian Corps pushed {{south from}} Caen toward Falaise in Operation Totalize on 8 August, Bradley and Montgomery {{realised}} {{that there was}} an opportunity for the bulk of the German forces to be trapped at Falaise. The Third Army continued the encirclement from the south, reaching AlenÃ§on on 11August. Although Hitler continued to insist until 14 August that his forces should counter-attack, Kluge and his officers began planning a retreat eastward. The German forces were severely hampered by Hitler's insistence on making all major decisions himself, which left his forces without orders for periods as long as 24 hours while information was sent {{back and forth to the}} FÃ¼hrer's residence at Obersalzberg in Bavaria. On the evening of 12 August, Patton asked Bradley if his forces should continue northward to close the gap and encircle the German forces. Bradley refused, because Montgomery had already assigned the First Canadian Army to take the territory from the north. The Canadians met heavy resistance and captured Falaise on 16 August. The gap was closed on 21 August, trapping 50,000 German troops <b>but</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a third of the German 7th Army and the remnants of nine of the eleven Panzer divisions had escaped to the east. Montgomery's decision-making regarding the Falaise Gap was criticised at the time by American commanders, especially Patton, although Bradley was more sympathetic and believed Patton would not have been able to close the gap. The issue has been the subject of much discussion among historians, criticism being levelled at American, British and Canadian forces. Hitler relieved Kluge of his command of OB West on 15 August and replaced him with Field Marshal Walter Model. Kluge committed suicide on 19 August after Hitler became aware of his involvement in the 20 July plot. An invasion in southern France (Operation Dragoon) was launched on 15 August.|$|E
