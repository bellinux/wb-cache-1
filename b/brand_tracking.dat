40|$|MBA thesisBranding {{has become}} a high {{priority}} for management due to the growing realisation that brands {{are one of the most}} valuable intangible assets that companies own. In recognising the importance of brands, companies are placing increased emphasis on understanding how to effectively build, measure and manage brand equity. This requires marketers to have a clear understanding of the <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> metrics used in the measurement of brand equity. The purpose of the study is to assess the degree and prevalence of the use of <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> metrics within FMCG companies in South Africa as well as evaluate the methods by which the metrics are collected and presented. Qualitative research was conducted through in depth semi-structured interviews with 26 respondents involved in FMCG brand management, to gain a better understanding of the use of <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> metrics for measuring brand health. The data was content analysed to identify key themes and metrics. Most FMCG organisations in South Africa are adopting a degree of measurement criteria to track and measure the health of a brand on a regular basis. <b>Brand</b> <b>tracking</b> must be a reflective as well as a predictive tool. It was concluded that South African FMCG organisations consider brand awareness, brand loyalty, brand Association including image and brand performance as all important metrics in tracking brand health. It was further concluded that the most commonly used proprietary models by FMCG organisations in South Africa are the Millward Brown Brand Dynamics and the TNS Conversion model...|$|E
40|$|Traditional <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> {{data have}} been used by {{marketing}} managers for decades to understand consumer response to brands. Marketers and advertisers are highly enthusiastic about the opportunities that the new online tool Google Insights for Search (IFS) provides to monitor “rising searches ” and analyze consumer search trends. IFS augments traditional <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> data in unprecedented ways, but is important for another reason: Google Insights for Search does not only monitor trends, it can influence them. We theorize that organic search results provide a natural measure of the attention being directed toward a brand in a social sphere, quite distinct from measures derived from <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> studies, and propose that consumers are influenced by observing IFS trend results, and infer brand attitudes of social groups from which these results were drawn. These inferred social attitudes then influence the consumer’s own attitudes through a social contagion effect. To test these ideas, we propose a two-stage project. First, we validate that aggregate user search history (IFS) correlates with traditional <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> metrics (WPP). The validation stage will establish that organic search trends relate to consumer brand attitudes at the aggregate level. Second, we use six design factors and a series of experiments to investigate under what conditions – and by what processes- consumer brand attitudes, attitudes toward the ad, and related market response measures can be influenced by observation of brand search trends. The results will sho...|$|E

40|$|Twarql is an {{infrastructure}} translating microblog posts from Twitter as Linked Open Data in real-time. The approach employed in Twarql {{can be summarized}} as follows: (1) extract content (e. g. entity mentions, hashtags and URLs) from microposts streamed from Twitter; (2) encode content in RDF using shared and well-known vocabularies (FOAF, SIOC, MOAT, etc.); (3) enable structured querying of microposts with SPARQL; (4) enable subscription to a stream of microposts that match a given query; and (5) enable scalable real-time delivery of streaming annotated data using sparqlPuSH. In this paper we use a <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> scenario to demonstrate how Twarql enables flexibility in handling the information overload of those interested in collectively analyzing microblog data for sensemaking. The dataset produced is shared as Linked Data.

40|$|Companies are {{increasingly}} turning to sponsorship {{to address their}} corporate social responsibilities (CSR). It {{is the ability of}} sponsorship to generate goodwill towards a brand that sets it apart from other forms of marketing. Yet, measurement of the intangible outcomes from sponsorship has proved challenging for the industry with sponsorship recall often used as the proxy measure. This is relevant for companies looking to enhance their reputation in the community as research suggests sponsorships that are overtly commercial in nature can diminish sentiment towards a sponsor’s brand and potentially erode brand equity. Using six years of <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> data provided by a large Queensland utility corporation, this study compares the impact on reputational brand equity of commercially-oriented, community-relations focused and cause-related sponsorships. By combining sponsorship recall with impact on brand attributes it was found that cause-related sponsorships and community-relations focused and make greater contributions to brand equity than commercially-oriented sponsorships...|$|E

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of social media, questions have begun to emerge about its role in firms ’ marketing research programs. In this research, we investigate the potential to “listen in” on social media conversations {{as a means of}} inferring brand sentiment. Our analysis employs data collected from multiple website domains, spanning a variety of online venue formats to which social media comments may be contributed. We demonstrate how factors relating to the focus of social media comments and the venue to which they have been contributed can be explicitly modeled in an effort to derive a measure of online brand sentiment. Our proposed approach provides an adjusted brand sentiment metric that is highly correlated with the results of an offline <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> survey. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} virtually non-existent correlation between an average sentiment measure derived by aggregating across all social media comments and the same offline tracking survey.

40|$|Social media streams, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Sina Weibo, {{have become}} {{essential}} real-time information resources {{with a wide}} range of users and applications. The rapidly in-creasing amount of live information in social media streams has important societal and marketing values for large cor-porations and government organizations. There is a strong need for effective techniques for data gathering and con-tent analysis. This problem is particularly challenging due to the short and conversational nature of posts, the huge data volume, and the increasing heterogeneous multimedi-a content in social media streams. Moreover, as the focus of “conversation ” often shifts quickly in social media space, the traditional keywords based approach to gather data with respect to a target brand is grossly inadequate. To address these problems, we propose a multi-faceted <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> method that gathers relevant data based on not just evolving keywords, but also social factors (users, relations and loca-tions) as well as visual contents as increasing number of so-cial media posts are in multimedia form. For evaluation, we set up a large scale microblog dataset (Brand-Social-Net) on brand/product information, containing 3 million microblogs with over 1. 2 million images for 100 famous brands. Experi-ments on this dataset have demonstrated that the proposed framework is able to gather a more complete set of relevant brand-related data from live social media streams. We have released this dataset to promote social media research...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Global {{spending}} on sponsorship {{continues to rise}} and many companies now establish portfolios containing a range of sponsorships across sport, arts and cause-related activities. Yet a lack of practical methodologies for the measurement and comparison of sponsorship performance within a portfolio context remains a challenge. Sponsors often rely solely on proxy measures for brand exposure drawn from advertising. These do not capture the higher-level outcomes of sponsorship awareness and goodwill transfer, often attributed to sponsorship as a ‘halo effect’. This paper presents a matrix tool that combines consumer awareness of and goodwill for a sponsorship so the halo effects of sponsorships within a portfolio can be quantified and compared. Design/methodology/approach: This archival analysis study is based on six years of <b>brand</b> <b>tracking</b> data (comprised of some 15, 500 consumer surveys) supplied by a large Australian company. A sponsorship portfolio matrix is developed to measure the halo effect. Findings: This study demonstrates that a sponsorship’s halo effect can be measured and comparisons drawn across sponsorship types within a portfolio. The study shows that despite the {{significantly higher levels of}} brand awareness achieved by commercially oriented professional sports sponsorship types, community relations oriented sponsorship types achieve a greater halo effect due to their more positive impact on the sponsor’s brand attributes. Originality/value: The matrix provides a valuable tool by which sponsorships can be compared, evaluated and managed to meet the longer-term brand and marketing objectives of a company...|$|E
