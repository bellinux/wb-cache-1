40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{investigated}} the product-of-combustion (POC) characteristics of combustible {{materials used in}} typical coal mining operations {{in a series of}} experiments conducted in an intermediate-scale fire tunnel. The materials examined include wood cribs, transformer fluid, coal, conveyor belting, <b>brattice</b> <b>cloth,</b> and ventilation ducting. Smoke and toxic gases evolved from burning materials contribute to panic conditions and hinder escape. Smoke irritates and obscures vision, while toxic gases physically debilitate and disorient the victims. However, poc emissions may be used for early warning fire detection. POC levels will vary not only between materials but also between stages of combustion and the conditions in which they are burning. This report summarizes the POC characteristics of each material and evaluates their effectiveness for early warning mine fire detection. Results show that smoke was the poc most readily detected from the smoldering materials tested" - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 1000816...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} a Bureau of Mines study comparing the construction costs, leakage measurements, and predicted performance {{of different types}} of large stoppings built and tested in a room-and-pillar oil-shale mine. The six full-sized structures (30 ft high by 55 ft wide) included both permanent and temporary stoppings and were fabricated using materials ranging from structural steel to coated <b>brattice</b> <b>cloth.</b> Leakage across each stopping was measured at differential pressures ranging up to 1. 0 in w. g., using both the brattice window method and sulfur hexa-fluoride (SF 6) tracer gas. Blast air pressures resulting from a full-scale face blast of approximately 1, 800 lb of ammonium nitrate-fuel oil (ANFO) explosives were measured across two of the stoppings and the pre-and post-leakage rates were compared for all the stoppings. Overall performance of the stoppings for production applications was evaluated using an operational model of a two-panel oil-shale mine. Different combinations of temporary and permanent stoppings were evaluated based upon ventilation performance and construction and operating costs...|$|E
40|$|DHHS publication; no. (NIOSH) 2014 - 117 Background: One of {{the initial}} and {{persistent}} concerns {{over the use of}} mobile refuge alternatives (RA) is the temperature rise inside the RA from the metabolic heat of the occupants and the heat released by the CO 2 scrubbing system. Moreover, the humidity within the RA will increase as the occupants lose water through respiration and perspiration. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) in its 2007 report to Congress on refuge alternatives recommended that refuge alternatives be designed and deployed to ensure that a temperature-humidity metric known as apparent temperature not exceed 9520 F [NIOSH 2007]. Subsequently the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) adopted this recommendation. Notwithstanding the above process, a standard method to determine compliance with this metric does not exist. The heat transfer process in an RA, including the contributions of the human occupants, is highly complex, and is not easily defined analytically or experimentally. Initially, regulatory agencies accepted the certification of registered professional engineers that the manufactured RAs met the apparent temperature requirement. In 2007, NIOSH tested four mobile RAs in its Lake Lynn Experimental Mine, and found that two failed to meet the apparent temperature criterion by a wide margin. These tests used artificial heat and humidity sources to simulate the heat and humidity loading of human occupants. Another approach to testing the apparent temperature criterion would be to place an RA into mine ambient conditions, fill the RA to its rated occupancy with human subjects, and record the interior ambient temperature and relative humidity over the 96 -hour period mandated in 30 CFR 4 7. 506 for breathable air sustainability. In consideration of this approach, a team of experts including physicians, biomedical researchers, and engineers endeavored to develop and obtain approval of a human subjects protocol for such testing. Ultimately it was determined that the experiment would place the subjects at an unacceptably high risk, and was not approvable by a Human Subjects Institutional Review Board (IRB). Thus, it became necessary to develop experimental and analytical methods to determine if refuge alternatives, as built and deployed, meet the apparent temperature requirement. NIOSH initiated research in 2008 with the goal of developing a technical foundation for such analytical and experimental procedures. Based on a significant amount of preliminary work at the Lake Lynn Experimental Mine, at NIOSH 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, and at manufacturer facilities, the project was focused to address four research questions. The first and likely most significant question is: Does the mine behave as an infinite heat sink? The engineering assumption that a mine does behave as an infinite heat sink was applied in the calculations originally used to certify mobile RAs, and is being applied in the design of tests to the present. If a mine can be assumed to behave as an infinite heat sink, then the temperature rise within an RA would be significantly less for a given configuration than if the mine does not behave as an infinite heat sink. The second question is: Does the facility in which the test is conducted impact the resulting temperature rise? The manufacturers of RAs conduct tests to demonstrate that their RAs meet the 30 CFR 7. 504 apparent temperature requirement, but they do so under varying conditions. The ability of an RA to dissipate heat could be different in a large open room (i. e., a high bay) as compared to a confined space, and accordingly the temperature rise predicted would be different. The third question is: Will the moisture generated by the occupants reduce the air temperature within the RA? It has been suggested that condensation on the interior surfaces of the RA could significantly increase the heat loss, which would in turn reduce the internal air temperature. The fourth question is: Could occupancy derating values be used for RAs that are rated and approved for use at one mine ambient temperature, but are deployed in a mine with a higher ambient temperature? Experimental and analytical studies, described in this report, were designed to answer these questions. Each of the studies contributed incrementally to the overall understanding of the problem, and the knowledge gained in one step was applied in the next to further the understanding of temperature rise in RAs. A recently completed "capstone" study provided data to answer the research questions and to validate the numerical model developed in the project. The in-mine component of this capstone study was conducted in an underground coal mine using a 10 -person tent-type RA in a test area that was isolated from the mine ventilation system using <b>brattice</b> <b>cloth</b> and plastic sheeting to prevent airflow through the test area. The RA, the mine air, and the mine strata were instrumented to measure temperatures and other relevant parameters. The heat input from human occupants was simulated with specially designed containers that mimicked the heat and humidity loading equivalent to a 165 -pound male. Two additional heat sources were placed in the RA to account for heat that would be generated by the CO 2 scrubbers. To examine the effect of including moisture generation on the RA interior environment, the in-mine tests were conducted both dry (without moisture generation) and wet (with moisture generation). Lastly, an additional experiment was performed with the RA located in a large high bay to determine if the measured RA internal temperature rise was affected by the test facility. All tests were conducted for 96 hours. Summary of Findings: The mine strata temperatures were observed to increase throughout the 96 -hour in-mine tests. The strata temperatures near the surface of the roof, rib, and floor increased more than the temperatures deeper into the strata, and, as depth into the strata increased, the strata temperature and its rate of change decreased. The strata temperature beneath the RA was observed to increase to a depth of 48 in (121. 9 cm) into the mine floor. These findings demonstrate that the mine cannot be assumed to behave as an infinite heat sink, and provide a definitive answer to the first research question. This 96 -hour test was repeated with the RA placed inside of a large high bay. The internal air temperature rise for the dry tests conducted in the high bay was compared to the internal air temperature rise for the dry tests conducted in the underground mine. The air temperature rise in the RA for the tests in the high bay was 21. 020 F, whereas for the in-mine tests, the rise was 25. 220 F. These findings demonstrate that the test location can {{have a significant impact on}} the results. In this case, the test conducted in the high bay underestimated the temperature rise by approximately 20...|$|E
40|$|In an {{underground}} mine fire, a toxic mixture of combustion product gases and particulate matter is transported by the ventilating system endangering everyone downstream. To determine {{the magnitude of}} the problem that these toxic combustion products pose, the U. S. Bureau of Mines is investigating the combustion products of typical materials found in underground mines. The total toxicity of the combustion products depends upon the evolving gas species and particulate matter, the amount of material involved, and the ventilation rate. In a simulated mine environment, the products from smoldering poly- vinyl chloride (PVC) brattice and conveyor belting were analyzed for gas concentrations and smoke characteristics. The primary toxic gases are hydrogen chloride (HC 1) and carbon monoxide (CO). Smoldering conveyor belts are more detectable than smoldering PVC <b>brattice</b> <b>cloths.</b> These results, combined with previous analyses, are used to estimate relative toxicities, product levels, and detect-ability of smoldering mine combustibles...|$|R
50|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred as}} the mine was transitioning from day shift to night shift. Most {{of the day}} shift workers had already exited the mine, {{while most of the}} night shift workers had just reached their work areas in the northwest section. The assistant to the mine boss, Tom Callaghan, was among a group of sixteen men who had worked together to erect a <b>cloth</b> <b>brattice</b> approximately 500 ft from the flame zone. Within a few minutes of the explosion, Callaghan had managed to telephone the mine house on the surface.|$|R
50|$|To restart some {{ventilation}} a <b>cloth</b> <b>brattice</b> was rigged {{from the}} surface down to the work area. On the Wednesday the furnace drift was reached but George Emerson, who attempted to enter it, was forced back by the gas. He did report seeing an axe, saw and sawn timber which indicated that the trapped miners had attempted to escape along that route. Later in the day William Adams of Cowpen and Robert Wilson of Backworth managed to enter the yard seam and found the men dead. Humble and Hall penetrated further and found the dead miners, but on their return to the bank were severely affected by the gas. The corn bins to feed the horses had been emptied to provide emergency food for the trapped miners, some miners were found with corn in their pockets. Although other men went down after Humble and Hall, no survivors were found and all returned seriously affected by the gas. All work ceased with the extinguishing of the last hope and the rescue moved into the recovery phase.|$|R
