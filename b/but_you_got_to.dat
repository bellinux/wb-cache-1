6000|$|... "But, Jim, you GOT to have 'em--they all do. So don't make no more {{fuss about}} it. Prisoners ain't ever without rats. There ain't no {{instance}} of it. And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, {{and they get}} to be as sociable as flies. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> play music to them.

6000|$|... "Just what I done! But I {{wanted you}} to speak first. It's Broken Shaft. Jackson, she caught right onto what we was talkin' about. This life," [...] he turned to Westover, in solemn exegesis, [...] "is a broken shaft when death comes. It rests upon the earth, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> look for {{the top of it}} in the skies. That's the way I look at it. What do you think, Jackson? Jombateeste?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None of 'em ain't at 'ome, but Miriam's {{just out}} to do a bit of shopping. Won't let me shop, she won't, because I'm so keerless. She's a {{wonderful}} manager, that girl. Minnie's got some work at the carpet place. 'Ope it won't make 'er ill again. She's a loving deliket sort, is Minnie.... Come into the front parlour.

6000|$|... "They are {{the same}} sort of people as the Samoyedes. I don't know that they are just the same. Anyhow, they speak {{the same sort of}} language. Well, you know the Northern Ostjaks we stayed with speak nearly the same as the Samoyedes. You could hardly get on with them at first, because their talk was so {{different}} to that of the Southern Ostjaks; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> speak it quite easily at last.

6000|$|... "That is true." [...] Henry Morris {{placed the}} last rabbit {{he had brought}} down in his game-bag.

6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} {{to have some sort of}} love-business," [...] the actor returned, with an effect of leaving the right {{interpretation}} of Maxwell's peculiar humor for some other time. [...] "The public wants it. No play would go without it. You can have it subordinate if <b>you</b> like, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> have it. How old did you say Haxard was?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> haven't <b>got</b> me <b>to</b> {{pitch for}} you to-day, Sam," [...] broke in Tom, {{as he came}} up and shook hands. [...] "Who {{is going to do}} the twirling for Brill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Whitwell leaned back, bracing {{his knees}} against the table, {{which was one}} of his philosophic poses. [...] "I have {{sometimes}} believed that Jeff Durgin was goin' to turn out a blackguard. He's got it in him. He's as like his gran'father as two peas, and he was an old devil. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> account in all these here heredity cases for counteractin' influences. The Durgins are as good as wheat, right along, all of 'em; and I guess Mis' Durgin's mother must have been a pretty good woman too. Mis' Durgin's all right, too, if she has got a will of her own." [...] Whitwell returned from his scientific inquiry to ask: [...] "How 'll she take it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take your time," [...] he was saying. [...] "You've got 'm, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{take your}} time. I've seen 'm fight. He's got a punch {{to the end}} of the count. I've seen 'm knocked out and clean batty, an' go on {{punching}} just the same. Mickey Sullivan had 'm goin'. Puts 'm to the mat as fast as he crawls up, six times, an' then leaves an opening. Ponta reaches for his jaw, an two minutes afterward Mickey's openin' his eyes an' askin' what's doin'. So you've got to watch 'm. No goin' in an' absorbin' one of them lucky punches, now. I got money on this fight, but I don't call it mine till he's counted out." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was a layer-on of hands. He {{never came}} to the house without trying to paw her. He touched her arm, let his fist brush her side. She hated the man, and she was afraid of him. She {{wondered}} if he had heard of Erik, and was taking advantage. She spoke ill of him at home and in public places, but Kennicott and the other powers insisted, [...] "Maybe he is kind of a roughneck, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hand it to him; he's got more git-up-and-git than any fellow that ever hit this burg. And he's pretty cute, too. Hear what he said to old Ezra? Chucked him in the ribs and said, 'Say, boy, {{what do you want to}} go to Denver for? Wait 'll I get time and I'll move the mountains here. Any mountain will be tickled to death to locate here once we get the White Way in!'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It sounds {{perfectly}} crazy," [...] she said, finally. [...] "But it mayn't be. The {{only thing}} I didn't like about Mr. Fulkerson was his always wanting to chance things. <b>But</b> what have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do with it?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{just listen}} to your uncle, Pony!" [...] he said. [...] "These fellows don't know {{anything}} about running off. I'll {{tell you how to}} do it; you mind your uncle! It's no use {{trying to get away from}} the constable, if he's there, for he'll catch you as quick as lightning, and he won't mind these fellows any more than fleas. You oughtn't try to start till along about midnight, for the constable will be in bed by that time, and you won't have any trouble. You must have somebody to wake you up, and some of the fellows ought to be outside, to do it. You listen to your grandfather! You ought to tie a string around your big toe, and let the string hang out of the window, the way you do Fourth of July eve; and then just as soon as it strikes twelve, the fellows ought to tug away at the string till you come hopping to the window, and tell 'em to stop. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> whisper, and the fellows mustn't make any noise, either, or your father will be out on them in a minute.

60|$|And {{my advice}} to all people is, Don't stay at home any more than <b>you</b> can help; <b>but</b> when <b>you</b> have <b>GOT</b> <b>to</b> stay at home a while, buy a package of those {{insurance}} tickets and sit up nights. You cannot be too cautious.|$|R
