By placing a specially designed metal reflector behind the bidirectional CP PSSA, one can obtain unidirectional CP patterns with a associated 3 -dB axial-ratio bandwidth (ARBW) almost {{the same as that}} of the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>antenna.</b> The bidirectional L- and S-band PSSAs designed on FR 4 substrates have 3 -dB ARBWs as large as 25. 3 % and 29. 1 %, respectively. For the L-band antennas, the unidirectional design yields a 3 -dB ARBW of 25. 7 % and a gain of about 3 dB higher than that of the bidirectional counterpart. In all these 3 -dB axial-ratio bands, impedance matching with VSWR ≤ 2 is also achieved. Most importantly, the design concepts, procedures, and rules for the proposed antenna are presented in detail. 1...|$|E

40|$|Photonic antenna can {{be defined}} as {{intimate}} integration of optoelectronics with planar antenna to produce a highly multifunction module. Some works have been done to integrate optoelectronics with antenna. Among them, some focus on downlink side (photodiode integration with antenna) and some concentrate on uplink side (integration of laser diode with antenna). There are also some publications on <b>bidirectional</b> photonic <b>antenna,</b> which cover uplink and downlink. The <b>bidirectional</b> photonic <b>antenna</b> can be categorized into two groups, i. e. which use optoelectronics transceiver such as asymmetric Fabry-Perot modulator (AFPM) and separate photodetector and laser. AFPM is very specialized device, rarely available in the market, and its transceiver nature limit the flexibility of performance optimization for uplink and downlink. On other side, vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and photodiode can be easily found in the market, lower cost, allowing independent optimization for uplink and downlink, and reliable. To the best of author’s knowledge, all publications on photonic antenna are measurement-based. This chapter uses simulation software to evaluate photonic antenna performance, to allow flexibility in design optimization, cost and time effective design process, and more complete evaluation parameter due to the use of optical communication system simulation.

The antenna {{consists of an}} orthogonal coupling feed driver and stacked director array, with the overall size 50 × 50 × 160 mm 3. Dual-polarization is excited by the orthogonal coupling lines, and the director array contributes to the bidirectional radiation.

40|$|The growing {{demands for}} {{wireless}} communications in tunnel environments {{are driven by}} requests for maintaining uninterrupted internet access for users in tunnels as well as wireless connections for wireless sensors, security, and control networks. Nevertheless, wireless networks in tunnel environments are associated with technical challenges related to elongated wireless coverage in two opposite near-end-fire directions. Here, we introduce a low-profile <b>bidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> that can be mounted on a large ground plane and that has a dual-magnetic-current mode exhibiting radiation patterns with 3 -db beamwidth coverage at near-end-fire angles. Furthermore, we realized a planar array with eight such bidirectional antennas that were configured as a sparse array {{in order to reduce}} the commonplace issues of mutual coupling and grating lobes. The radiation beams of the proposed antenna array can scan in the end-fire area (60 °<φ< 120 °, 45 °<θ< 80 °), with scanning gains of 11 ~ 15 dB in the near- end-fire directions. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed array can adaptively generate a directional single beam or multiple beams according to the positions of users, which is suitable for intelligent communication systems with low power consumptions and high communication bandwidths in tunnel environments...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{changes and}} {{obstacles}} {{are two main}} factors affecting the accuracy of indoor positioning in wireless indoor localization. The multi-mode sensor positioning {{had been used to}} increase accuracy but at high costs. The proposed study for a new indoor localization technique is based on <b>bidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> and Zigbee wireless sensor network. In order to reduce signal interference problems of environmental factors, an indoor localization algorithm is developed that allows the antenna transmit power to be adjustable. Since the indoor localization algorithm requires only adjustment of the antenna power, it can be quickly adapted for used in different environments. Furthermore, normal distribution adjustment is used to reduce the positioning error. Experimental results showed that the proposed positioning error is in the range of approximately 51. 1 cm which is an improvement of results from other research. Experiments were conducted in two different environments with different signal interferences. Results showed that the antennae were adjustable in the two different environments. Furthermore, the proposed indoor positioning has a higher accuracy rate in comparison to eight other related works which did not use the adjustable mechanism. The proposed algorithm may be used in the applications where requirement varies based in environmental factors and individual needs...|$|E

The Method of Moments (MoM) with RWG basis function was utilized in the study and design processes.

40|$|Frequency Independent (FI) antennas have {{impedance}} and far-field {{properties that}} remain largely invariant with frequency making them {{an excellent choice}} for wideband applications. The need for polarization diversity prompts the use of 4 -arm sinuous or 4 -arm log-periodic FI apertures that can radiate dual-CP over the full bandwidth. The 4 -arm sinuous is almost always backed with carbon loaded absorber limiting its use to receiving or low-power transceiver use. Similarly the 4 -arm log-periodic antenna suffers from twice the size requirement {{as compared to the}} spiral or the sinuous. The sinuous and log-periodic antennas that are commercially available or reported in literature are rated only for low powers (2 - 10 W) and are not low-profile especially in the UHF band. The need for low profile antennas extends to the HF band also where antennas capable of transmitting with large instantaneous bandwidths are needed. It is this need for transmit capable low profile antennas in HF/UHF bands that this thesis addresses. The development of low-profile antennas for transmit applications in the parts of UHF (500 MHz - 3 GHz) and HF (2 MHz - 10 MHz) bands is presented. In the UHF band, 4 -arm sinuous and 4 -arm planar log-periodic (LP) antennas are chosen for their wideband dual circular polarized (CP) FI performance. Various techniques like dielectric lens-loading, lossless cavity-backing with integrated matching network, ferrite-tiled cavity-backing, and ferrite-tiled ground plane backing are incorporated to convert the inherently bidirectional sinuous aperture into low-profile, flush-mountable, efficient, unidirectional antennas with dual CP capability. The developed prototypes are fabricated, characterized, and shown to be capable of transmitting 10 times higher power than conventional sinuous antennas while maintaining thermal and electromagnetic stability. A novel method to halve the size of a 4 -arm planar log-periodic aperture for dual CP performance is introduced. The size reduction is achieved by coupling the currents from the booms of the LP to an annular ring resulting in a ring-turnstile-LP composite aperture. This novel aperture is fabricated, characterized and is shown to be a highly desirable antenna for dual CP applications due to its small size, simple beamformer, and dual CP capability over the same bandwidth. The proposed concept is implemented in slot configuration and the resulting ring-turnstile-slot LP is developed and fabricated. Through both low-power and high power characterizations, the antenna is shown to be a low profile <b>bidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> capable of transmitting hundreds of Watts of CW power. A reconfigurable antenna configuration of a horizontal dipole and a vertical loop is proposed to achieve bandwidths close to 24 KHz for NVIS communication in the HF band. The antenna is designed to be used with the Amphibious Assault Vehicle (AAV) and is low-profile with NVIS compatible radiation patterns throughout the frequency band. The vertical loop is operated in the lower frequencies and the horizontal dipole at higher frequencies in the HF band and the effects of real grounds, wire diameter and the AAV 2 ̆ 7 s tracks on the achieved bandwidth, gain, efficiency, and input resistance are illustrated. Various studies involving the effect of the grounds, position of the antenna above the roof of the AAV, and effect of the AAV 2 ̆ 7 s presence on the performance of horizontal dipole and horizontal loop antennas is also detailed. The results presented in this thesis and the antennas developed herein should pave the way for use of sinuous antenna in efficient transmit applications for the first time, {{and the use of the}} log-periodic antenna for dual-CP transmit applications alongside the spiral or the sinuous in its novel reduced size form, while maintaining hundreds of Watts of CW power capability in the UHF band for both the antennas. The reconfigurable antenna in the HF band should provide an excellent starting configuration for achieving large bandwidths for NVIS transmit applications requiring high data rates...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe discuss {{artificial}} photonic {{antenna systems}} that are built by incorporating chromophores into one-dimensional nanochannel materials and by organizing the latter in specific ways. Zeolite L (ZL) is an excellent host for the supramolecular organization {{of different kinds of}} molecules and complexes. The range of possibilities for filling its one-dimensional channels with suitable guests {{has been shown to be}} much larger than one might expect. Geometrical constraints imposed by the host structure lead to supramolecular organization of the guests in the channels. The arrangement of dyes inside the ZL channels is what we call the first stage of organization. It allows light harvesting within the volume of a dye-loaded ZL crystal and also the radiationless transport of energy to either the channel ends or center. One-dimensional FRET transport can be realized in these guest-host materials. The second stage of organization is realized by coupling either an external acceptor or donor stopcock fluorophore at the ends of the ZL channels, which can then trap or inject electronic excitation energy. The third stage of organization is obtained by interfacing the material to an external device via a stopcock intermediate. A possibility to achieve higher levels of organization is by controlled assembly of the host into ordered structures and preparation of monodirectional materials. The usually strong light scattering of ZL can be suppressed by refractive-index matching and avoidance of microphase separation in hybrid polymer/dye-ZL materials. The concepts are illustrated and discussed in detail on a <b>bidirectional</b> dye <b>antenna</b> system. Experimental results of two materials with a donor-to-acceptor ratio of 33 : 1 and 52 : 1, respectively, and a three-dye system illustrate the validity and challenges of this approach for synthesizing dye-nanochannel hybrid materials for light harvesting, transport, and trapping...|$|R
