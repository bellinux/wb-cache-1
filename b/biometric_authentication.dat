500|$|The iPhone 5S {{received}} a mostly positive reception from reviewers and commentators. Walt Mossberg of All Things Digital gave the phone a favorable review, saying that Touch ID [...] "sounds like a gimmick, but it’s a real advance, the biggest step ever in <b>biometric</b> <b>authentication</b> for everyday devices," [...] and labeled it [...] "the best smartphone on the market." [...] David Pogue of The New York Times praised Touch ID, {{but said that}} the innovation of the smartphone market has been saturated, and [...] "maybe the age of annual mega-leaps is over." [...] He focused much of his review on iOS 7, which he believed was the biggest change of the device over previous generations, praising new Siri features, Control Center, and AirDrop. In an editorial, Pogue stated that iOS 7 was the biggest change in the iPhone series, citing utilitarian interface changes as the main contributor to this. Scott Stein of CNET criticized the lack of design change over iPhone 5 and said that although the iPhone 5S [...] "is not a required upgrade, but it's easily the fastest and most advanced Apple smartphone to date." [...] Although praised the new iPhone for its camera, 64-bit A7 chip, M7 motion-chip, and fingerprint scanning capabilities, some investors thought that the iPhone 5S, although a notable improvement over the iPhone 5, was still relatively unchanged from its predecessor, and worried that the iPhone line had become a stagnant, dull product. Apple's share price fell 5.4% after the launch to close at a month low of $467.71 on the NASDAQ.|$|E

On the one side biometrics has given convenience to citizens as {{they do not need}} to memorize a bunch of passwords, but on the other side intra (inter) class variations within (between) biometric features makes <b>biometric</b> <b>authentications</b> untrustworthy. Therefore, decisions based on <b>biometric</b> <b>authentications</b> are made more reliable by using several <b>biometric</b> <b>authentications</b> performed on single or multiple biometric modalities (i. e. multi-biometric fusion). This paper describes a method to identify if a person tries to re-enrol him/herself in a database, when he/she is already enrolled. This is referred to as duplicate check. In this work, duplicate check is performed using two modalities: face and iris. The templates used during the duplicate check are compliant to the ISO/IEC 24745 - Biometric information protection. Such templates are known as protected biometric templates. The protected biometric templates used in this work are generated using the recently published irreversible transformation based on Bloom filters. Scores are calculated from face and iris Bloom filters based templates by comparison with their respective enrolment templates using the normalized Hamming distance. As a decision of the duplicate check, these scores from both modalities are fused with appropriate weighting factors in order to get improved performance compared to using single individual modalities. The presented scheme is experimentally validated using two public benchmark databases namely the LFW and the CASIA-Iris-Thousand databases for face and iris respectively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Several {{papers have}} already shown the {{interest}} of using multiple classifiers {{in order to enhance}} the performance of <b>biometric</b> person <b>authentication</b> systems. In this paper, we would like to argue that the core task of <b>Biometric</b> Person <b>Authentication</b> is actually a multiple classifier problem as such: indeed, in order to reach state-of-the-art performance, we argue that all current systems, in one way or another, try to solve several tasks simultaneously and that without such joint training (or sharing), they would not succeed as well. We explain hereafter this perspective, and according to it, we propose some ways to take advantage of it, ranging from more parameter sharing to similarity learning. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Biometric</b> based <b>authentication</b> {{protocols}} for multi-server architectures {{have gained}} momentum {{in recent times}} due to advancements in wireless technologies and associated constraints. Lu et al. recently proposed a robust <b>biometric</b> based <b>authentication</b> with key agreement protocol for a multi-server environment using smart cards. They claimed that their protocol is efficient and resistant to prominent security attacks. The careful investigation of this paper proves that Lu et al. 's protocol does not provide user anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and is susceptible to server and user impersonation attacks, man-in-middle attacks and clock synchronization problems. In addition, this paper proposes an enhanced <b>biometric</b> based <b>authentication</b> with key-agreement protocol for multi-server architecture based on elliptic curve cryptography using smartcards. We proved that the proposed protocol achieves mutual authentication using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. The formal security of the proposed protocol is verified using the AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool to show that our protocol can withstand active and passive attacks. The formal and informal security analyses and performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol is robust and efficient compared to Lu et al.

40|$|International audienceSecure user {{authentication}} {{is a crucial}} service for many systems and applications, especially when the data stored and the functionalities offered are highly confidential or critical. In those situations, traditional, single-occurrence, authentication mechanisms can be inadequate to face intrusions: no checks are performed after login, {{and even if they}} were repeated, frequently asking for passwords or secrets would reduce system usability. <b>Biometric</b> continuous <b>authentication,</b> instead, is emerging as viable alternative that can guarantee reliable and transparent verification for the whole session: the traits can be repeatedly acquired without the user active participation.
