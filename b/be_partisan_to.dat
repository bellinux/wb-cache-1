40|$|This master thesis {{in culture}} {{encounter}} {{is about the}} Norwegian grass root movement for the Palestinians and the Jews. After the Second World War the whole Norwegian society was largely supporting the Jews, and the Palestinians was only referred to as Arabs and not as Palestinians. The Norwegians did not relate {{to them in the}} same way as the Jews, and in this context the Norwegian Palestinian Committee was founded in 1970. Their goal was to support the Palestinians in their fight for national liberation. Five years later the organization Med Israel for fred (MIFF) was founded, and their goal was to give correct information about the Israel-Palestine conflict. They would also refute what they meant was unilateral information from the Palestinian Committee. From the 1970 s the Norwegian society has reversed in their attitudes, and today the media, the opinion and the politics tend to be much more supportive to the Palestinians than to Israel. The two organizations represent more than 12 000 members, and are working towards political goals in line with the wishes of the Palestinians and the Jews. In this thesis I have examined what affects the volunteers in MIFF and the Palestine committee when it comes to motivation and engagement. My research shows that the volunteers in both organizations are motivated by concrete events in the conflict like the Six-day or the war in Gaza in 2014. But what motivates them the most is trips to Israel or Palestine, which has resulted in the establishment and administration of local branches. The research also shows that they strive with the same challenges when it comes to knowledge about the conflict in the society, and a polarized debate. But there are also some differences, to illustrate; MIFF is in a position where they find media to be harder to relate to, because they find them to <b>be</b> <b>partisan</b> <b>to</b> the Palestine. MIFF are also more often confronted in a negative way when presenting their views or opinions. This thesis shows that the volunteers relate to different realities, and have totally different experienes with the Palestine-conflict...|$|E

40|$|Communities {{living on}} the margins of society, such as the homeless, are {{overlooked}} in the process of building a vision for peace in the City of Tshwane. This article, therefore, seeks to explore the issue of a vision for peace {{from the perspective of the}} homeless in the City of Tshwane. Isaiah 65 : 17 – 25 was used as a hermeneutic key, within a community engaged action research framework, to stimulate reflection and application in the context of homelessness where meaningful peace is non-existent. Emerging voices of ordinary readers (participants) of the text, as represented by the homeless in the City of Tshwane (CoT), suggest institutions (of education, business, government, churches as well as other individuals) need to work together in synergy towards the realisation of this peace in the city. In relation to peace in the CoT, this research has unearthed some insights from a local homeless community which could contribute towards the development of an integrated praxis needed for transformative urban missiology. The recommendations derived from the research are: the homeless people must <b>be</b> <b>partisans</b> <b>to</b> such a holistic and integrated vision for peace and should be seen as active responsible citizens of the city willing to undertake actions that are in support of this vision.
