5|$|A single large {{opening on}} either side of the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skull links Dimetrodon with mammals and distinguishes it from most of the {{earliest}} sauropsids, which either lack openings or have two openings. Features such as ridges on the inside of the nasal cavity and a ridge at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw are thought to be part of an evolutionary progression from early tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) to mammals.|$|E
5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper jaw).|$|E

5|$|Certain medical {{procedures}} can also injure the airways; these include tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy. The <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trachea may be damaged during tracheotomy. TBI resulting from tracheal intubation (insertion of a tube into the trachea) is rare, and the {{mechanism by which}} it occurs is unclear. However, one likely mechanism involves an endotracheal tube catching in a fold of membrane and tearing it as it is advanced downward through the airway. When an endotracheal tube tears the trachea, it typically does so at the posterior (back) membranous wall. Unlike TBI that results from blunt trauma, most iatrogenic injuries to the airway involve longitudinal tears to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trachea or tears on the side that pull the membranous part of the trachea away from the cartilage. Excessive pressure from the cuff of an endotracheal tube can reduce blood supply to the tissues of the trachea, leading to ischemia and potentially causing it to become ulcerated, infected, and, later, narrowed.|$|E
