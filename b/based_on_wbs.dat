The general mentality of constructing total solution of aircraft digital design platform is presented. The combing method of aircraft digital research and development process is proposed of separating the design results into phases and organizing the design activities hierarchically <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>WBS</b> (Work Breakdown Structure). The characteristics, demands and basic support elements of each target client groups are analyzed. The components and the architecture frame of aircraft digital design platform are defined. Finally, the implementation strategy based on the three dimensions of design phases, design departments and system levels is proposed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceVarious {{wearable}} {{devices are}} foreseen {{to be the}} key components in the future for vital signs monitoring as they offer a non-invasive, remote and real-time medical monitoring means. Among those, Wireless Body Sensors (WBS) for cardiac monitoring are of prominent help to early detect cardioVascular Diseases (CVD) by analyzing 24 / 24 and 7 / 7 collected cardiac data. Today, most of these WBS systems for CVD detection, includeonly limited automatic anomalies detection, particularly regarding ECG anomalies. Severe CVD, such as Myocardial Infarction or Ischemia, needs to achieve an advanced analysis of ECG waves known as P, Q, R, S and T. In particular, the T-wave and its specific changes. In this paper, we focus on T-wave anomalies detection in a context of WBS. Our study suggests an accurate and lightweight T-wave changes detection model which suits well an ECG monitoring system <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>WBS</b> architecture. We performed a comparative study of 7 well-known supervised learning classification models,on real ECG data sets from 7 different leads. We compared the results from both perspectives of classification and processing times. Our results show that the C 4. 5 Decision Tree technique performs better results with 92. 54 % Accuracy, 96. 06 % Sensibility, 55. 41 % Specificity and 7. 41 % Error Rate...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} two-valued digit (twit) as a binary variable that can assume one of two different integer values. Posibits, or simply bits, in H I and negabits in I H, commonly used in two’s-complement representations and @ A encoding of binary signed digits, are special cases of twits. A weighted bit-set (WBS) encoding, which generalizes the two’s-complement encoding by allowing one or more posibits and/or negabits in each radix- 2 position, {{has been shown to}} unify many efficient implementations of redundant number systems. A collection of equally weighted twits, including ones with noncontiguous values (e. g., I I or H P), can lead to wider representation range without the added storage and interconnection costs associated with multivalued digit sets. We present weighted twit-set (WTS) encodings as a generalization of WBS encodings, examine key properties of this new class of encodings, and show that any redundant number system (e. g., generalized signed-digit and hybrid-redundant systems), including those that are based on noncontiguous and/or zero-excluded digit sets, is faithfully representable by WTS encoding. We highlight this broad coverage by a tree chart having WTS representations at its root and various useful redundant representations at its many internal nodes and leaves. We further examine how highly optimized conventional components such as standard full/half-adders and compressors may be used for arithmetic on WTS-encoded operands, thus allowing highly efficient and VLSI-friendly circuit implementations. For example, focusing on the WBS-like subclass of WTS encodings, we describe a twit-based implementation of a particular stored-transfer representation which offers area and speed advantages over other similar designs <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>WBS</b> and hybrid-redundant representations...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFour {{decades after}} their introduction, the {{validity}} of fault slip inversion methods <b>based</b> <b>on</b> Wallace (1951) and Bott (1959) hypothesis, which states that the slip on each fault surface has the same direction and sense as the maximum resolved shear stress, is still a subject of debate. According to some authors, this hypothesis is questionable since fault mechanical interactions induce slip reorientations as confirmed by geomechanical models. This leads us to ask as {{to what extent the}} Wallace-Bott simplifications are reliable as a basis hypothesis for stress inversion from fault slip data. In this paper, we compare two inversion methods; the first is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the Wallace-Bott hypothesis, and the second relies on geomechanics and mechanical effects on fault heterogeneous slip distribution. In that context, a multi-parametric stress inversion study covering (i) the friction coefficients (μ), (ii) the full range of Andersonian state of stress and (iii) slip data sampling along the faults is performed. For each tested parameter, the results of the mechanical stress inversion and the Wallace-Bott (WB) based stress inversion for slip are compared in order to understand their respective effects. The predicted discrepancy between the solutions of both stress inversion methods (<b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>WB</b> and mechanics) will then be used to explain the stress inversions results for the chimney Rock case study. It is shown that a high solution discrepancy is not always correlated with the misfit angle (ω) and can be found under specific configurations (View the MathML sourceR−, θ, μ, geometry) invalidating the WB solutions. We conclude that in most cases the mechanical stress inversion and the WB based stress inversion are both valid and complementary depending on the fault friction. Some exceptions (i. e. low fault friction, simple fault geometry and pure regimes) that may lead to wrong WB based stress inversion solutions are highlighted...|$|R
50|$|The {{division}} was started on March 21, 1955 with its {{first and most}} successful head being Jack L. Warner's son-in-law William T. Orr. ABC had major success against its competition with Walt Disney's Disneyland TV series and approached Warner Bros. initially {{with the idea of}} purchasing the studio's film library (WB eventually sold the rights to the negatives of pre-1950 films and pre-1948 cartoons and shorts to Associated Artists Productions, or a.a.p., in 1956). WB formally entered television production with the premiere of its self-titled anthology series Warner Bros. Presents on ABC. The one-hour weekly show featured rotating episodes of television series <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>WB</b> films, Casablanca and Kings Row, as well as an original series titled Cheyenne with Clint Walker. The first one-hour television western, Cheyenne became a big hit for the network and the studio with the added advantage of featuring promotions for upcoming Warner Bros. cinema releases in the show's last ten minutes. One such segment for Rebel Without a Cause featured Gig Young notably talking about road safety with James Dean.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a {{high data}} rates and fully All-IP network. It is {{developed}} to support well to multimedia services such as Video, VoIP, Gaming, etc. So that, the real-time services such as VoIP, video, etc. need to be optimized. Nevertheless, the deployment of such live stream services having many challenges. Scheduling and allocating radio resource are very important in LTE network, especially with multimedia services such as VoIP. When voice service transmitted over LTE network, it is affected by many network impairments where there are three main factors including packet loss, delay, and jitter. This study proposes a new scheduler which is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> VoIP priority mode, Wideband (WB) E-model, QoS-and Channel-Aware (called WE-MQS-VoIP Priority scheduler) for voice services in LTE downlink direction. The proposed scheduling scheme is built <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>WB</b> E-model and Maximum Queue Size (MQS). In addition, we integrate the VoIP priority mode into our scheduling scheme. Since the proposed scheduler considers the VoIP priority mode and user perception, thus, it improves significantly the system performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduler not only meets QoS demands of voice calls but also outperforms Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (M-LWDF) in terms of delay, Packet Loss Rate (PLR) for all number of user (NU) and excepting NU equals 30, respectively. For Fairness Index (FI), cell throughput, and Spectral Efficiency (SE), the difference among the packet schedulers is not significant. The performance evaluation is compared in terms of Delay, PLR, Throughput, FI, and SE...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibration}} isolation efficiency of seating has been evaluated in 100 work vehicles in 14 categories (cars, vans, lift trucks, lorries, tractors, buses, dumpers, excavators, helicopters, armoured vehicles, mobile cranes, grass rollers, mowers and milk floats). Seat isolation efficiency, {{expressed by the}} SEAT value, was determined for all seats (67 conventional seats and 33 suspension seats) from the vertical acceleration measured on the floors and on the seats of the vehicles. For most categories of vehicle, the average SEAT value was less than 100 %, indicating that the average seat provided some attenuation of vibration. However, there were large variations in SEAT values between vehicles within categories. Two alternative vibration frequency weightings (Wb from BS 6841, 1987; Wk from ISO 2631, 1997) yielded SEAT values that differed by less than 6 %. Overall, the SEAT values determined by two alternative methods (the ratio of r. m. s. values and the ratio of vibration dose values) differed by less than 4 · 5 % when using weighting Wb, although larger differences may be expected in some situations. The median SEAT value for the suspension seats was 84 · 6 %; the median SEAT value for the conventional seats was 86 · 9 % (<b>based</b> <b>on</b> weighting <b>Wb</b> and the ratio of r. m. s. values). Predicted SEAT values were obtained assuming that each seat could be interchanged between vehicles without altering its transmissibility. The calculations suggest that 94 % of the vehicles investigated might benefit from changing the current seat to a seat {{from one of the}} other vehicles investigated. Although the predictions are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> assumptions that will not always apply, it is concluded that the severity of whole-body vibration exposures in many work environments can be lessened by improvements to seating dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Feed {{efficiency}} (FE) is {{an important}} trait in the pig industry, as feed costs {{are responsible for the}} major part of production costs. Availability in the market and cost of feed ingredients dictate changes in feed composition. As a result, fibre level and composition can vary between pig diets. Microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract {{play an important role in}} fibre digestion, because they produce enzymes that break down fibre structures and deliver volatile fatty acids (VFA) to the pig. These VFA can be used as metabolic energy sources. As such, microbial fermentation could influence FE in pigs. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between FE and faecal microbiome in commercial grower-finisher pigs. Three-way crossbreed grower-finisher pigs (154) were either fed a diet <b>based</b> <b>on</b> corn/soybean meal (CS) or a diet <b>based</b> <b>on</b> wheat/barley/by-products (<b>WB).</b> Faecal samples were collected on the day before slaughter (mean body weight 122 kg), and sequenced for the V 3 -V 4 16 S ribosomal DNA regions. Sequences we clustered according to operational taxonomic units (OTU) for each individual. A partial least square regression was applied to the dataset, together with a discriminant analysis using principal components of FE extreme groups (10 high and 10 low FE animals for each diet by sex-combination). Pigs on different diets and males vs females had a very distinct microbiome, needing only two OTUs for diet (P= 0. 018) and 18 OTUs for sex (P= 0. 002) to separate the groups. Faecal microbiome was not related to FE groups fed the CS diet, but there were sex specific OTUs related to FE in male and female pigs in the groups fed the WB diet. In conclusion, our results show a diet and sex dependent relationship between the faecal microbial composition and FE in grower-finisher pigs at slaughter weight.
