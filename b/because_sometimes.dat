500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song. According to Champion, [...] "...it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, <b>because</b> <b>sometimes</b> it sounded too rushed, and sometimes it sounded as if it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E
500|$|Before meeting Beyoncé, Rich Harrison had {{conceptualized}} {{the beat}} of the song. He had sampled the hook's instrumentation from the 1970 song [...] "Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So)," [...] which had originally been written and composed by Eugene Record, frontman of the Chicago-based vocal group The Chi-Lites. When Harrison first played the beat to his friends, they could not [...] "dig it," [...] and this made him realize that he had conceived something special, which people would appreciate better after hearing the whole record. Thus Harrison decided not to market the selection, and instead, he waited for the right artist to record it: [...] "I had it in the chamber, I had not really shopped it much, <b>because</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{you do not want to}} come out of the bag before it's right. People do not really get it and you will leave them with a foul taste in their mouth." ...|$|E
500|$|Grohl {{declared}} that [...] "making this record revitalized this band", particularly the acoustic songs, as they [...] "showed ourselves what we're capable of doing" [...] and [...] " [...] things scary again. You {{do something that}} you've never done, {{and it makes you}} feel like a bigger band." [...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc was an opportunity to use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in the past eight or nine years, but never put on albums because they never seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's hard to put an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, <b>because</b> <b>sometimes</b> it mucks up the sequence." [...] The tracks include Grohl's first composition [...] "Friend of a Friend" [...] – done in 1990, and previously recorded under the pseudonym 'Late!' on the cassette Pocketwatch; [...] "Razor", which Grohl wrote for a benefit concert at the Wiltern Theatre; and drummer Taylor Hawkins' composition [...] "Cold Day in the Sun", which after an attempt to do an electric version became an unplugged track, featuring Hawkins on vocals and tambourine and Grohl in the drums.|$|E

500|$|After a {{creative}} spurt in October resulted in new song ideas, Bono {{proposed that the}} group release a double album. The Edge said: [...] "There would have been two records, depending on which songs we decided to finish. There was this one album, the 'blues' album that Bono was talking about, and another, much more 'European', {{which is kind of}} the way I was led." [...] Eno cautioned the group about pursuing the material, telling the Edge: [...] "I know that any one of these new ideas is good enough to make the record, but we have to draw the line somewhere. If we even consider any of them we'll still be here in three months time." [...] U2 relented, shelving the new songs to avoid missing their deadline to complete the album. Recording for The Joshua Tree wrapped up in November 1986. Rough mixes had been created throughout the sessions after each song was recorded to, in Lanois' words, take [...] "snapshots along the way ... <b>because</b> <b>sometimes</b> you go too far". The Edge explained that the arrangement and production of each song was approached individually and that while there was a strong uniform direction, they were prepared to [...] "sacrifice some continuity to get the rewards of following each song to a conclusion".|$|E
