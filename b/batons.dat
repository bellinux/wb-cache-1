Then {{known as the}} <b>Baton</b> Rouge Standard Metropolitan Area (or <b>Baton</b> Rouge SMA), it consisted of a single parish - East <b>Baton</b> Rouge - and had a population of 158,236. Following a term change by the Bureau of the Budget (present-day Office of Management and Budget) in 1959, the <b>Baton</b> Rouge SMA became the <b>Baton</b> Rouge Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (or <b>Baton</b> Rouge SMSA). By the census of 1960, the population had grown to 230,058, a 45% increase over the previous census. A total of 285,167 people lived in East <b>Baton</b> Rouge Parish in 1970.|$|R
5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal <b>batons</b> and clubs that turn into handcuffs, an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E

5|$|The rank {{insignia}} of a {{field marshal}} in the British Army comprises two crossed <b>batons</b> in a wreath of oak leaves, with a crown above. In some other countries, historically under the sphere of British influence, an adapted version of the insignia is used for field marshals, often with the crown being replaced with an alternative cultural or national emblem.

5|$|Spokane and the Spokane Police Department (SPD) have {{received}} national publicity and scrutiny in the 2000s and 2010s due to many officer-involved shootings and allegations of excessive force. The most high-profile of these incidents was the 2006 death of Otto Zehm, a mentally challenged {{man who was}} initially suspected of theft at a convenience store. Zehm was later found to have committed no crime, but was struck with <b>batons</b> by several officers and tasered. The increased pressure on the SPD prompted an independent review by a commission of the organization's use-of-force policies, an internal culture audit, and the purchase of body cameras.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal {{has been}} the highest rank in the British Army since 1736. A five-star rank with NATO code OF-10, it is {{equivalent}} to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force (RAF). A Field Marshal's insignia consists of two crossed <b>batons</b> surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward's Crown. Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life, though on half-pay when not in an appointment. The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries (when all former holders of the rank were deceased). After the Second World War, it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (later renamed Chief of the General Staff) to the rank on his last day in the post. Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of all the British Armed Forces, were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment.|$|E
