5|$|Ploughshare, triangular-shaped: Triangular-shaped stone ploughshares {{are found}} at the sites of Majiabang culture dated to 3500 BC around Lake Tai. Ploughshares have also been {{discovered}} at the nearby Liangzhu and Maqiao sites roughly dated to the same period. David R. Harris says this indicates that more intensive cultivation in fixed, probably <b>bunded,</b> fields had developed by this time. According to Mu Yongkang and Song Zhaolin's classification and methods of use, the triangular plough assumed many kinds and were the departure from the Hemudu and Luojiajiao spade, with the Songze small plough in mid-process. The post-Liangzhu ploughs used draft animals.|$|E

There was no stupid double roof, window shade, or abortive thermantidote. It was a London and South-Western carriage. Osaka is about eighteen miles from Kobé, and stands {{at the head of}} the bay of Osaka. The train is allowed to go as fast as fifteen miles an hour and to play at the stations all along the line. You must know that the line runs between the hills and the shore, and the drainage-fall is a great deal steeper than anything we have between Saharunpur and Umballa. The rivers and the hill torrents come down straight from the hills on raised beds of their own formation, which beds again have to be <b>bunded</b> and spanned with girder bridges or--here, perhaps, I may be wrong--tunnelled.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bund</b> {{branch in}} Vilno had split {{along the same}} lines {{as the rest of the}} Russian <b>Bund</b> in 1920, into a leftwing {{majority}} group and a rightwing minorities group. The latter was associated with the Russian Social Democratic <b>Bund.</b> Both groups were reluctant to join the Polish <b>Bund,</b> even after it had become apparent that Vilno was an integrated part of the Polish state. The Vilno Social Democratic <b>Bund</b> distrusted the Polish <b>Bund</b> for its overtures to the Comintern, stating that the Polish <b>Bund</b> had ceased to be a Social Democratic organization.|$|R

50|$|A {{spill pallet}} is a <b>bunded</b> {{secondary}} containment item {{that is designed}} to hold containers of oil and fuels, typically in either a 205-litre drum or in an intermediate bulk container.

50|$|Integrated {{agricultural}} development projects were somewhat {{more successful than}} the cooperatives. The Northwest Region Agricultural Development Project, for example, survived the 1980s. Building upon the bunding (creation of embankments to control the flow of water) done by the British in the 1950s and by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in the 1960s, the World Bank picked up the program in the 1970s and 1980s. Yields from <b>bunded</b> farms increased between 24 and 137.4 t/km² over the yields from unbunded farms. However, overall improvement in agricultural production was hardly noticeable at a macroeconomic level.|$|E
50|$|The Building Regulations Approved Document J {{covers the}} legal {{requirements}} for {{the installation of the}} tanks within the premises of a building. The regulations state that any new tank larger than 2,500 litres must be stored within a <b>bunded</b> tank or secondary containment that is a minimum of 110% of the tank’s capacity. If a tank is single skinned and smaller than 2,500 litres, it must be given an individual site pollution risk assessment. This highlights any pollution or hazard risks such as the possibility of the oil escaping and reaching a river or stream, or the risk of a collision if the storage tank is located near a road.|$|E
50|$|The Kolar river {{arises in}} the Vindhya Range of Sehore {{district}} and flows {{in a south}} westerly direction to meet the Narmada near Nasrullahganj in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh.

The {{upper part of the}} river basin lies at an elevation of 350 to 600 metres and much of it is under tropical deciduous forest. The river debouches into the plains near Jholiapur. Much of the upper basin has poor soils and agriculture here is largely of wheat and gram. The lower basin has better soils and a flatter slope and has been used extensively <b>bunded</b> allowing for impounding water during the monsoons.|$|E
