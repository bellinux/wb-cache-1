40|$|To {{identify}} weather {{controls of}} beech diameter growth and masting in southern Sweden, we analyze records of monthly weather, regional masting record, and tree-ring chronologies from five beech-dominated stands. The results indicate a strong weather control of temporal pattern of masting events in southern Sweden over {{the second half}} of the 20 th century. Negative summer temperature anomaly 2 years prior to a mast year, coupled with positive temperature anomaly in the year immediately preceding the same mast year, is a characteristic weather pattern associated with known mast years. Strong dependence of beech masting behavior on temperature explains the high degree of regional synchronization of masting events. Growth of beech in southern Sweden is strongly and negatively correlated with previous year's summer temperature and positively - with previous year's October temperature. The present study does not provide a conclusive answer in identifying a full set of direct and indirect effects of climatic variables controlling tree-ring growth, since the negative effect of previous year's summer temperature may be a result of a temperature-controlled increase in the <b>beech</b> <b>nut</b> production in the current year. Consistent and significant negative departures of ring-width index during mast years support the hypothesis about a trade-off between investment of bioassimilates into production of beech nuts and tree-ring growth. Alternative explanation of growth anomalies in mast years, relating such anomaly to a negative impact of previous year's growing season, was not supported by the data. We found a limited effect of masting on diameter growth in the following years, indicating that decline in the overall wood production, associated with heavy masting, is short term and typically occurs in the year of actual masting.

40|$|In {{southern}} Scandinavia {{there is}} a general desire {{to increase the amount of}} broadleaved forest using, for example, beech and oak, in order to preserve biodiversity and spread risk in the face of climate change. In order to realise this goal cheaper regeneration methods are needed. Although there are a number of uncertainties at present, direct seeding has the potential to fulfill this role. Two of the greatest obstacles to successful regeneration of beech and oak using direct seeding are seed removal by granivorous rodents and competition from ground vegetation. These issues need to be addressed before direct seeding can become a reliable regeneration method. The work described in papers I, II and IV in this thesis investigated the influence of site, sowing dates, rodent population densities, site preparation and repellents on rodent damage to sown <b>beech</b> <b>nuts</b> and acorns. Paper III describes a study which examined the effect of different mechanical site preparation methods, and different sowing dates, on the growth of young oak seedlings. Seedling establishment was more successful at large sites surrounded by mixed forests, compared to smaller areas surrounded by broadleaved forest (I, II). Oak seedling establishment was more successful than that of beech. Fewer acorns were lost and seedling establishment was better following spring sowing compared with summer sowing. In all years, more rodents were captured in the summer/autumn period than the spring. However, no clear correlation between rodent numbers and the success of direct seeding could be established. More rodents were captured in traps close to features providing cover, for example slash piles and the remains of stone walls. There were no clear relationships between the various mechanical site preparation treatments and rodent distribution and seed removal. In a laboratory study, mink excrement was found to have potential as a bank vole repellent, since it reduced consumption of <b>beech</b> <b>nuts</b> to half that of water soaked seeds, and reduced consumption of acorns was also indicated. No decrease in the germination of acorns treated with mink excrement was found, and there was only a minor negative effect on <b>beech</b> <b>nuts</b> (IV). The growth of young oak seedlings was better following sowing in spring than in summer, and mounding was the mechanical site preparation treatment most beneficial for oak seedling growth (III). The results indicate that successful direct seeding of oak on clear-cuts is most likely when acorns are sown at large sites situated in areas surrounded by coniferous forest, in spring rather than summer. In addition, more successful regeneration could be achieved through preparing sites by mounding, removing slash and sowing seeds treated with mink excrement. The data collected in this study indicate it is more difficult to achieve successful direct seeding of beech, than of oak...|$|R
40|$|Conclusion In summary, a warm autumn {{and winter}} 1 year before, {{a hot summer}} (particularly July) 2 years before, and a cold and moist summer (particularly July) 3 [*]years before could serve as early warning {{indicators}} for potential NE outbreaks in Western Europe, particularly if a heavy beech crop is observed together with a warm autumn 1 [*]year before [24, 36]. If global warming with ever hotter summers and very mild autumns plus winters {{are to be expected}} for the next years, further NE epidemics can be anticipated, although regional differences can persist, as shown in France and Germany.

It makes extensive stores of food such as acorns and beechmast in storage chambers and uses other chambers for nesting, bringing in dry plant material for this purpose. There are often mounds of earth outside the entrances to the burrow. It also makes larders of food in holes in trees away from the burrow.

The only pest proved by trapping was Myodes glareolus although damage of tree bases could mean damage caused by species of the genus Microtus. With respect to the large crop of seeds (<b>beech</b> <b>nuts)</b> in 2006, it is possible to expect increase in the population of rodents in the next season and thus increased damage to trees.

40|$|This thesis {{was seeking}} two main {{approaches}} {{for improvement of}} seed germination of oriental beech, a timber producing species in Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran. Germination behavior of beechnuts was enhanced either by decreasing the dormancy breakage period, or by increasing seed lot quality. A simple grading based on the weight of beechnuts, before exposing the dormant nuts to dormancy breaking conditions, significantly increased germination capacity of heavy class beechnuts, and reduced the period of dormancy breakage. Almost the same results were obtained by removing the endocarp. Applying alternative chilling temperatures, during dormancy breakage had positive effects on speed of dormancy release. These simple methods {{can be used with}} little equipment in forest nurseries and are suggested to be accompanied with more advanced techniques, like restricting moisture content during moist cold stratification period to gain maximum benefit. Previous reports from European beech and the results from the effect of endocarp removal suggest a possible role of other agents in dormancy in oriental beechnuts. Water soluble phenolics extracts from the seed coats, significantly suppress the germination of radish seed. The endocarp may act as a barrier against exudation of these germination inhibitors. The deep embryo dormancy presents problems when assessing the viability of oriental <b>beech</b> <b>nuts.</b> It is therefore possible to test germination performance in semi-dormant nuts to predict the nut viability in this species. A dormant seedlot was stored in sub-chilling conditions for 15 months and a series of germination tests were conducted during the dormancy breakage period of stored and fresh nuts. The results showed that mean germination times for both nut groups were almost the same, but germination capacity was statistically different only for semi-dormant nuts. Non-dormant stored and fresh nuts showed no significant differences, which indicate the complexity of dormancy release in oriental <b>beech</b> <b>nuts.</b> Abscisic acid (ABA) contents of embryonic axes of stored and fresh nuts were measured during the dormancy breakage period, and results indicated a close correlation between ABA levels and increment in germination capacity as dormancy was released. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with partial least squares regression (PLS) were used as rapid and non-destructive methods for discrimination of sound and deteriorated single beechnuts. NIRS-PLS is a promising method for quality improvement of nearly all agricultural products and in this study showed 100 % accuracy in separation of viable and non-viable nuts...|$|R

Over 80, 000 plant macroremains of large size (> 2 mm) were recovered and a rich assemblage of large-seeded wild fruits was evaluated.

Three methods of quantification were used to evaluate their importance in the economy taking into account the samples retrieved from 16 fully excavated structures: total average density of fruit items, total estimated amount of fruits, and their calorific contribution. The estimation of the caloric importance of large-seeded wild fruits depends on assumptions on taphonomic biases.

40|$|Molecular studies {{highlighted}} {{a strong}} genetic affinity between the remnant and isolated {{population of the}} Apennine brown bear and other southern European populations. Despite this genetic closeness a recent morphometric study revealed a marked phenotypic distinctiveness of the Apennine population, supporting the reinstatement of a distinct taxon (Ursus arctos marsicanus). By building upon previous morphological analyses, we adopted geometric morphometrics to better investigate the skull morphology of the Apennine brown bear {{with reference to the}} other, closely related southern European populations. Both skull shape and size differences confirmed the strong divergence of U. arctos marsicanus. In particular, the Apennine bears are characterized by an enlargement of the supraorbital apophysis and a larger distance across the zygomatic arches. Furthermore, our analyses highlighted significant shape differences of the first upper molar in the Apennine bears. Our results suggest that the Apennine bears underwent a rapid morphological change, possibly driven by genetic drift and local selective pressures. Because the greatest morphological differentiation is likely {{to be related to the}} muscles involved in mastication, we hypothesize that local selective pressures might be related to a shift in food habits, with highly reduced depredation and feeding on large carcasses in favour of vegetation and hard mast (<b>beech</b> <b>nuts</b> and acorns).
