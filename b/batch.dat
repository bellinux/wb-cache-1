There is a vast body of literature on analysis and modeling of <b>batching.</b> This paper aims to provide a structure for <b>batching</b> decisions that can help in positioning <b>batching</b> research and models with respect to issues pertinent to goods-flow management. The basis of the structure is a distinction of <b>batching</b> issues as related to three decision levels: (i) process choice/design, (ii) activity planning (aggregate planning and activity programming), and (iii) activity control.

It {{is difficult to}} attain a true video-on-demand (TVOD) system, so near video-on-demand (NVOD) is catching the attention of people. In NVOD, requests are multicast in different streams. Important issue in this system is the choice of <b>batching</b> time. Traditionally the <b>batching</b> time is fixed depending {{on the number of}} requests. In this paper we have suggested an adaptive <b>batching</b> scheme (ABS) where <b>batching</b> time is adjusted according to the current arrival rate, which follows the hyper-exponential distribution pattern. A comparison is made between the fixed and adaptive <b>batching</b> schemes. Numerical illustrations are provided to show that adaptive <b>batching</b> policy is better than fixed <b>batching</b> policy for optimizing bandwidth requirements. ...|$|R

40|$|Order picking is a {{warehouse}} function {{dealing with the}} retrieval of articles from their storage location {{in order to satisfy}} a given demand specified by customer orders. Of all warehouse operations, order picking is considered to include the most cost-intensive ones. Even though there have been different attempts to automate the picking process, manual order picking systems are still prevalent in practice. This article will focus on order <b>batching,</b> one of the main planning issues in order picking systems. Order <b>Batching</b> has been proven to be pivotal for the efficiency of order picking operations. With respect to the availability of information about the customer orders, order <b>batching</b> can be distinguished into static <b>batching</b> and dynamic <b>batching.</b> Improved order <b>batching</b> reduces the total picking time required to collect the requested articles. According to experience from practice, this can result in significant savings of labor cost and into a reduction of the customer order's delivery lead time. The aim of this contribution is to provide comprehensive insights into order <b>batching</b> by giving a detailed state-of-the-art overview of the different solution approaches which have been suggested in the literature. Corresponding to the available publications, the emphasis will be on static order <b>batching.</b> In addition to this, the paper will also review the existing literature for variants and extensions of static order <b>batching</b> (e. g. due dates, alternative objective functions). Furthermore, solution approaches for dynamic order <b>batching</b> problems (like time window <b>batching)</b> will be presented.

Once the original <b>batch</b> had proved their worth and had been well received by the crews a further twenty locomotives were ordered in March 1931 for delivery between December 1932 and March 1934. A third <b>batch</b> of twenty were ordered from Eastleigh in March 1932 for delivery after the completion of the previous order, but this was subsequently reduced to ten locomotives because of the continuing trade depression.

This meant that {{the last of the}} S15 class was not completed until 1936, although weight-saving modifications were undertaken to this <b>batch.</b> A final modification was also applied to the class at this time, when all locomotives were equipped with smoke deflectors to improve visibility from the footplate when travelling at speed. This modification was a feature that became common to most Maunsell-influenced designs.|$|E
40|$|In manual {{order picking}} systems, order pickers walk or ride through a {{distribution}} warehouse {{in order to}} collect items required by (internal or external) customers. Order <b>batching</b> consists of combining these – indivisible – customer orders into picking orders. With respect to order <b>batching,</b> two problem types can be distinguished: In off-line (static) <b>batching</b> all customer orders are known in advance. In on-line (dynamic) <b>batching</b> customer orders become available dynamically over time. This report considers an on-line order <b>batching</b> problem in which the total completion time of all customer orders arriving within a certain time period has to be minimized. The author shows how heuristic approaches for the off-line order <b>batching</b> can be modified {{in order to deal}} with the on-line situation. A competitive analysis shows that every on-line algorithm for this problem is at least 2 -competitive. Moreover, this bound is tight if an optimal <b>batching</b> algorithm is used. The proposed algorithms are evaluated in a series of extensive numerical experiments. It is demonstrated that the choice of an appropriate <b>batching</b> method can lead to a substantial reduction of the completion time of a set of customer orders.
