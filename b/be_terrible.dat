500|$|During {{production}} of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight. NBC thought the cast was too young and pushed for an older character who could give the young adults advice. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured [...] "Pat the Cop." [...] Crane found the storyline to <b>be</b> <b>terrible,</b> and Kauffman joked, [...] "You know the kids book, Pat the Bunny? We had Pat the Cop." [...] NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.|$|E

His powerful frame, prematurely wrecked, yet carrying alive the savage will, towers on his crutch, and in his very hobble is the tyrant's pace.... He wants to <b>be</b> <b>terrible</b> for the sake of freedom. His conscience and fortitude are thus fed from his fanaticism. Like all bloody bigots, he thinks he feels God's mercy moving in him." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy {{involving}} young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted {{the group to}} share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become [...] "new, surrogate family members." [...] However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life, and found the scripts developed by NBC to <b>be</b> <b>terrible.</b> When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched Insomnia Cafe, Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were. NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed. Kauffman and Crane began writing a pilot script for a show now titled Friends Like Us, which took three days to write. Littlefield wanted the series to represent Generation X and explore {{a new kind of}} tribal bonding, but the trio did not share his vision. Crane argued {{that it was not a}} series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching. NBC liked the pilot script and ordered the series under another title, Six of One, mainly due to the similar title it shared with the ABC sitcom These Friends of Mine.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1914, {{he started}} {{suffering}} from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At {{the end of the}} war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his name and nationality. When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health. In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: [...] "No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse...Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will <b>be</b> <b>terrible</b> for the whole world, a catastrophe". The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an [...] "Aryan soldier-king" [...] and as a [...] "Siegfried" [...] who had embraced the [...] "struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry". Chamberlain went on to call the war [...] "a life-or-death struggle...between two human ideals: the German and the un-German". Accordingly, the Reich must [...] "for the next hundred years or more" [...] strengthen all things German and carry out [...] "the determined extermination of the un-German". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: [...] "I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations-1870 and 1914-and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes." [...] In his 1914 essay, [...] "Whose Fault Is the War?", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain. Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war and the French and Russians were just British puppets. [...] Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited, were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham. The British historian John C. G. Röhl wrote the war made the [...] "brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular" [...] of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain [...] "more intense".|$|E
