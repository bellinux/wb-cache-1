As a result of the theoretical study of the edge and ventilation losses on the basis of existing mathematical models {{and as a result of}} an experimental investigation performed on a <b>breaking</b> <b>unit</b> and a stand for the visualization of the flow in the turbine stage, a physical model is developed for the processes occurring in the partial stage. The model made it possible to obtain a more precise notion of the mechanism of edge losses. Methods are proposed for calculating the ventilation and edge losses. Developed is a method of visualization of the gas flow in the stage. Design methods of improvement of small-size turbines are investigated.

40|$|Search based {{software}} testing {{has emerged in}} recent years as an important research area within automated software test data generation. The general approach of couching the satisfaction of test goals as numerical optimisation problems has been applied to a variety of problems such as satisfying structural coverage criteria, specification falsification, exception generation, <b>breaking</b> <b>unit</b> pre-conditions and software hazard discovery. However, some test goals may be hard to satisfy. For example, a program branch may be difficult to reach via a search based technique, because the domain of the data that causes it to be taken is exceedingly small or the non-linearity of the “fitness landscape ” precludes the provision of effective guidance to the search for test data. In this paper we propose to “stretch ” relevant conditions within a program to make them easier to satisfy. We find test data that satisfies the corresponding test goal of the stretched program. We then seek to transform the stretched program by stages back to the original, simultaneously migrating the obtained test data to produce test data that satisfies the goal for the original program. The “stretching” device is remarkably simple and shows significant promise for obtaining hard-to-find test data and also gives efficiency improvements over standard search based testing approaches...|$|E

A unit root in real output, for instance, is inconsistent with the notion that business cycles are stationary fluctuations around a deterministic trend. In this paper, we investigate the univariate time series properties of real output for 79 developing countries using the conventional augmented Dickey and Fuller (1979) unit root test, the Zivot and Andrews' (1992) one structural <b>break</b> <b>unit</b> root test, and the Lumsdaine and Papell (1997) two structural <b>breaks</b> <b>unit</b> root test.

We show that under unattended breaks the true size of the Kwiatkowski et. al.

We demonstrate that a simple modification of the statistics can recover the usual limiting distribution appropriate to the case where there are no <b>breaks,</b> provided <b>unit</b> roots do not exist at any of the unattended frequencies. Where unattended unit roots occur we show that the above statistics converge in probability to zero under the null. However, computing the KPSS and CH statistics after pre-filtering the data is simultaneously efficacious against both unattended <b>breaks</b> and unattended <b>unit</b> roots, {{in the sense that the}} statistics retain their usual pivotal limiting null distributions appropriate to the case where neither occurs. The case where breaks may potentially occur at all frequencies is also discussed. The practical relevance of the theoretical contribution of the paper is illustrated through a number of empirical examples. stationarity tests, structural <b>breaks,</b> pre-filtering, unattended <b>unit</b> roots...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that it is vital to account for trend breaks when testing for a unit root. In practice, {{uncertainty}} exists over whether or not a trend break is present and, if it is, where it is located. Harris et al. (2009) and Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2009) propose procedures which account for both of these forms of uncertainty. Each uses what amounts to a pre-test for a trend break, accounting for a trend break (the associated break fraction estimated from the data) in the unit root procedure only where the pre-test signals a break. Assuming the break magnitude is fixed (independent of sample size) these authors show that their methods achieve near asymptotically ecient unit root inference in both trend break and no trend break environments. These asymptotic results are, however, somewhat at odds with the finite sample simulations reported in both papers. These show the presence of pronounced "valleys" in the finite sample power functions (when mapped as functions of the break magnitude) of the tests such that power is initially high for very small breaks, then decreases as the break magnitude increases, before increasing again. Here we show that treating the break magnitude as local to zero (in a Pitman drift sense) allows the asymptotic analysis to very closely approximate this finite sample effect, thereby providing useful analytical insights into the observed phenomenon. In response to this problem we propose practical solutions, based either on the use of a with <b>break</b> <b>unit</b> root test but with adaptive critical values, or on a union of rejections principle taken across with break and without <b>break</b> <b>unit</b> root tests. The former is shown to eliminate power valleys but at the expense of power when no break is present, while the latter considerably mitigates the valleys while not losing all the power gains available when no <b>break</b> exists. <b>Unit</b> root test; local trend break; asymptotic local power; union of rejections; adaptive critical values...|$|R
