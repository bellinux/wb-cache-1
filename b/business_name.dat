25|$|Where a <b>business</b> <b>name</b> {{is based}} on a family name it should in theory take an apostrophe, but many leave it out (contrast Sainsbury’s with Harrods). In recent times there has been an {{increasing}} tendency to drop the apostrophe. Names based on a first name are more likely to take an apostrophe, but this is not always the case. Some business names may inadvertently spell a different name if the name with an s at the end is also a name, such as Parson.|$|E

Messenger organized a 2015 lecture tour of Australia for fellow anti-vaccinationist Sherri Tenpenny.

Its narrow windows (all located above the first floor) and fortress-like exterior led to a campus rumor that it was designed {{in the wake of the}} student activism of the 1960s to be riot-proof.

A new feature is a carousel that gathers all Google Maps imagery in one location and contains an Earth view that directly integrates the 3D experience from Google Earth into the new maps. The new version is also more closely connected to Google+ and the local businesses that are displayed are based on each user's Google+ network.

25|$|The rail {{transport}} system in Great Britain {{developed during the}} 19th century. After the grouping of 1923 under the Railways Act 1921, there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the Great Western Railway (GWR), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the Southern Railway (SR). During World War I the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete nationalisation had been considered, and the Railways Act 1921 is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected. Nationalisation was subsequently carried out after World War II, under the Transport Act 1947. This Act made provision for the nationalisation of the network, {{as part of a}} policy of nationalising public services by Clement Attlee's Labour Government. British Railways came into existence as the <b>business</b> <b>name</b> of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four.|$|E
25|$|He named Stark Bro’s Nurseries & Orchards Co. {{to carry}} on the work. Considerable {{argument}} has been spent upon whether the plants were technically willed to Stark Bro’s; they were not. He left everything to Elizabeth: money, personal property, real estate, dozens of municipal utility bonds — and the plants and precious seeds. Elizabeth had first approached both Stanford and Berkeley to have either or both universities take over the experimental farm, but sold to Stark when those proffers didn’t materialize. Mrs. Burbank entered into an agreement with Stark Bro’s on Aug 23, 1927 to take the material they wanted from Burbank’s properties. The contract included ownership of the <b>business</b> <b>name</b> and all of the customer information. A September 6, 1927 contract provided exclusive rights to sell uncompleted experiments with fruits at Sebastopol (except the Royal and Paradox) for 10 years. Stark Bro’s had right of renewal. Tax receipts indicate payments of $27,000 to Mrs. Burbank. Exciting new kinds of fruits and flowers Burbank had developed (but never marketed) included 120 types of plums, 18 peaches, 28 apples, 500 hybrid roses, 30 cherries, 34 pears, 52 gladioli and many more. Stark Bro’s subsequently introduced many of these varieties in their catalog.|$|E
25|$|With the Bolshevik victory, Swenson {{found not}} just two schooners but his entire Siberian {{business}} and stock impounded and a warrant {{out for his}} arrest. The issues besides alcohol (if that was really an issue) were taxes and his perceived close association with the Whites. He briefly discusses allegations of selling guns to the Whites, suggesting they were inflated, and attributes some allegations to disgruntled competitors. (Hunting arms and ammunition were {{a regular part of}} his business.) He does not mention an allegation of a check for $500,000 found in the pocket of an executed White officer. Swenson reports he declined an offer from a former White officer to raid the coast and recover the furs by force. Instead he and R.S. Pollister (Vice President of Olaf Swenson & Co.) went to China to obtain a Soviet visa and began a long slow process of negotiation to release the furs, trading stock, and books. The ultimate resolution was a contract entered in 1925 to deliver goods in Siberia to Moscow's specification on a cost-plus basis and export furs. This contract was renewed for five years in 1926 and expanded in 1928 after negotiations {{with the head of the}} Soviet fur trust in London. Other associates in this venture were Maurice Cantor and Irving W. Herskovits of New York. In this period, the <b>business</b> <b>name</b> often appears as Swenson Trading Company or Swenson Fur Trading Company. Local trade was handled by a Soviet government trading organization which specified the goods and set fur prices. Swenson reports prices paid to the trappers were reduced in this period and the range of trade goods narrowed to necessities.|$|E

500|$|The Registrar said that, {{based on}} {{information}} it had obtained, the applicant had registered the <b>business</b> <b>name</b> with the ulterior motive of riding on {{the reputation of the}} American corporation. However, the Court noted that the while the test which the Registrar had applied could not be validly criticized, there was no evidence to support the conclusion that the Registrar had arrived at. At all material times, the American corporation had not carried on any business in Singapore. Neither had its trade mark [...] "Penneys" [...] ever been used in Singapore. It had no reputation in Singapore in relation to its business. As such, it could not be maintained that the applicant, in registering her business under the name [...] "JC Penney Collections", had any ulterior motive of [...] "riding on the reputation" [...] of the American corporation. The Registrar and the Minister had, among other things, taken into account this irrelevant consideration in coming to their respective decisions to direct the applicant to change her <b>business</b> <b>name</b> and to dismiss her appeal against the direction. Accordingly, the court made an order of certiorari to quash both decisions.|$|E
