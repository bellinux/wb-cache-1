5|$|When the General Assembly {{votes on}} {{important}} questions, {{a two-thirds majority}} of those present and voting is required. Examples of important questions include recommendations on peace and security; election of members to organs; admission, suspension, and expulsion of members; and budgetary matters. All other questions are decided by a majority vote. Each member country has one vote. Apart from approval of budgetary matters, resolutions are not binding on the members. The Assembly may make recommendations on any matters {{within the scope of}} the UN, except matters of peace and security that are under consideration <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{string of}} new {{peacekeeping}} missions were launched in Namibia, Yugoslavia, Somalia, and Angola <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> which also triggered {{interest in the}} reform of the 15-member body. Germany and Japan in particular, as well as India and Brazil, launched efforts to gain permanent seats and veto rights at the Council. In the late 1990s, Secretary-General Kofi Annan improved the coherence of the United Nations, with a better coordinated development system and more effective humanitarian structures. The fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic was energized, and a new concept of partnership between the United Nations and international business developed under the Global Compact. Other reforms included the revamping of peacekeeping operations following the Brahimi Report. The World Summit in 2005 recognized, albeit mainly symbolically, an international ‘responsibility to protect’ populations from genocide and the Human Rights Council replaced the discredited Commission on Human Rights.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} force led by Castillo Armas {{attempted to make}} forays towards the towns of Zacapa and Puerto Barrios; however, these were beaten back by the Guatemalan army. The propaganda broadcast by the CIA had far more effect; it succeeded in leading a Guatemalan pilot to defect, which led to Árbenz grounding the entire air force, fearing its defection. The CIA also used its planes, flown by American pilots, to bomb Guatemalan towns for psychological effect. When the old planes used by the invasion force {{were found to be}} inadequate, the CIA persuaded Eisenhower to authorize the use of two additional planes. Guatemala made an appeal to the United Nations, but the US vetoed an investigation into the incident <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> stating that it was an internal matter in Guatemala. On 25 June, a CIA plane bombed Guatemala City, destroying the government's main oil reserves. Frightened by this, Árbenz ordered the army to distribute weapons to local peasants and workers. The army refused to do this, instead demanding that Árbenz either resign or come to terms with Castillo Armas.|$|E

25|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) is a court {{under the}} auspices of the United Nations for the {{prosecution}} of offenses committed in Rwanda during the genocide which occurred there during April 1994, commencing on 6 April.

A lame duck president, Bush launched Operation Restore Hope the following day under which the United States would assume command in accordance with Resolution 794.

25|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, the US delegate, Adlai Stevenson, {{strongly}} criticised India's {{use of force}} to resolve her dispute with Portugal, stressing that such resort to violent means was against the charter of the UN. He stated that condoning such acts of armed forces would encourage other nations to resort to similar solutions to their own disputes, and would lead to the death of the United Nations. In response, the Soviet delegate, Valerian Zorin, argued that the Goan question was wholly within India's domestic jurisdiction and could not be considered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> He also drew attention to Portugal's disregard for UN resolutions calling for the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples.|$|E

Tadić drew {{attention to the fact that}} the KSF were formed on the basis of the Ahtisaari Plan that was never adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> and added that the creation of these forces constitutes a breach of the Serbian Constitution and international law, which is why they should be disbanded.

25|$|United Nations Peacekeeping {{started in}} 1948 when the United Nations Security Council {{authorised}} {{the deployment of}} UN unarmed military observers to the Middle East in order to monitor the armistice agreement that was signed between Israel and its Arab neighbours {{in the wake of}} the Arab-Israeli War. This operation was called the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and is still in operation today. With the passage of resolution 73 (1949) <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> in August 1949, UNTSO was given the task of fulfilling four Armistice Agreements between the state of Israel and the Arab states which had participated in the war.
