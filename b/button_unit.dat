40|$|Most {{countries}} of the world are experiencing a rising spate of crime and security challenges. Specifically, the banking sector is seriously imperilled by the menace of armed bandits as recent robbery incidents are targeted mainly at banks. Most security agencies are incapacitated due to the absence of efficient means for intelligence gathering. To this end, this paper reports the implementation of a Wireless Nomadic Bank Surveillance System which comprises of three intelligent sub-units namely the asset tracking unit, the panic <b>button</b> <b>unit</b> and the IP surveillance unit. The asset tracking unit is an assembly of an embedded system together with a programmed hybrid GPS/GSM module. The panic button system is also an embedded system that operates with a GSM module. The IP surveillance unit is used to remotely monitor the banking hall through covert IP cameras placed in the banking hall. All of the three sub-units are monitored and controlled by a nomadic system which is a mini computer system specially assembled for this purpose. The system is used to query the bag and money tracker for the present location. The Google earth software installed on the nomadic system is used to map the received longitude and latitude format to the actual position. To serve as a redundancy to the panic button system, a web application is developed using PHP, JavaScript and MySQL for managing the video feeds and forwarding SMS alert messages to security agencies saved in the database in case of a robbery...|$|E

50|$|The {{cleaning}} time {{depends on}} room size and, for models equipped with dirt sensors, volume of dirt. First-generation models must be told the room size, while second- and third-generation models estimate room size {{by measuring the}} longest straight-line run they can perform without bumping into an object. When finished cleaning, or when the battery is nearly depleted, a second- or third-generation Roomba will try {{to return to a}} base if one is detected. A second-generation Roomba may also be used with a scheduler accessory, allowing cleaning to start at the time of day and on days of the week that the owner desires. Most 500 Series robots support scheduling through <b>buttons</b> on the <b>unit</b> itself, and higher-end models allow the use of a remote to program schedules.|$|R

50|$|The first {{commercial}} {{installation of a}} telephone dial accompanied the {{first commercial}} installation of a 99-line automatic telephone exchange in La Porte, Indiana, in 1892, {{which was based on}} the 1891 Strowger designs. The original dials required complex operational sequences. A workable, albeit error-prone, system was invented by the Automatic Electric Company using three push-buttons on the telephone. These buttons represented the hundreds, tens, and single units of a telephone number. When calling the subscriber number 163, for example, the user had to push the hundreds button once, followed by six presses of the tens button, and three presses of the <b>units</b> <b>button.</b> In 1896, this system was supplanted by an automatic contact-making machine, or calling device. Further development continued during the 1890s and the early 1900s in conjunction with improvements in switching technology.|$|R

This amount is then printed onto the check by the operator pulling a lever {{on the side of the}} unit (or by pressing a <b>button</b> on electric <b>units).</b> This brings the print-heads down upon a wide inked (usually multicolor) ribbon through which they print the selected amount on the check, with a prefix and suffix to prevent a fraudster from adding extra digits.

50|$|Event {{segmentation}} {{is viewed}} as “the brain’s cutting-room floor.” It {{is considered to be}} an automatic and ongoing process that depends on meaningful changes in a perceived situation. To test this, researchers measured brain activity while participants viewed an extended narrative film. They used MRI scanning to show transient evoked brain responses (changes in brain activity) at those points they identified as event boundaries (changes in situation). Situational changes were coded frame by frame into spatial, temporal, object, character, causal and goal changes. Participants were then instructed to perform an event segmentation task by watching a movie and pressing a <b>button</b> to identify <b>units</b> of activity that were natural and meaningful to them. Paying attention to situational changes gives rise to a neural cascade that is consciously perceived {{at the end of one}} event and the beginning of another.|$|R

Briquettes have a heating value high enough {{in the amount of}} 257. 50 Kkals/kg, and besides that it also helped overcome the production of waste pollutants. In the tool manually pressing briquettes produced briquettes size 2. 5 cm diameter and 7 cm high and the emphasis made by the operator, and the pressure used for pressing briquettes are not constant so that the dimensions are not uniform briquettes. In briquette maker manual production process requires a relatively long time in the process of workmanship and production levels are still low around 28 kg per day, where the presses once took 125 seconds.
