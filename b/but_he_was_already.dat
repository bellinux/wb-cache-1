5|$|Harvey {{worked for}} more than five decades for the same {{engineering}} firm, and lived with his wife Myrtle in the western industrial suburb of Footscray. He had two sons, Jeff and Graeme, both of whom played in first grade for Fitzroy. His grandson Robert Harvey—son of Jeff—was one of the leading Australian rules footballers of the 1990s and the early 21st century. Robert made his Australian Football League debut for St Kilda Football Club in 1988 and played 21 seasons. He {{was a member of the}} All-Australian team eight times and won the Brownlow Medal twice, in 1997 and 1998, for the best and fairest player. Robert played for Victoria at Under-19 level as a bowler, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> playing top-flight football at the time and gave up his cricket career after the national Under-19 tournament. Another grandson Anthony, the younger brother of Robert, also played for St Kilda and captained Norwood to the 1997 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) premiership.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself because he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} {{race of the}} Chase for the Sprint Cup at Chicagoland, Harvick would start {{at the rear of}} the field due to unapproved body modifications, but quickly moved back up to the front within 30 laps. He would be put a lap down due to an {{untimely}} caution while Harvick was on pit road, because he did not beat the leader, Martin Truex Jr., to the start-finish line. He never got back on the lead lap for the remainder of the race, and ultimately finished 20th. Harvick's third win of the season would come at the very next week at Loudon, where he passed Matt Kenseth on a late-race restart with 7 laps to go. Next week at Dover, Harvick would have a broken trackbar and would have to go to the garage <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> locked into the next round due to his win at New Hampshire. The next week at Charlotte, Harvick would win the pole and would lead 155 laps before having electrical problems on lap 154 at the same time Joey Logano had a tire problem and hit the wall. Coming into Kansas, Harvick sat 12th in the Chase standings, and would be in a must win situation to make the round of 8, but that was no problem for Harvick as he would dominate the race along with Matt Kenseth, until Kenseth would fade after tapping the wall. Harvick would lead 267 laps to victory, late in the race, Carl Edwards, would get the lead and lead several laps, but after a few cautions and restarts, Harvick would get back the lead and while Edwards and Kyle Busch would battle hard for 2nd place, Harvick would pull away to get his 4th win of the season, and advance into the Round of 8 in the Chase but he would officially get eliminated in the Round of 8. He would wrap up his 2016 season by winning the pole and finishing 3rd at Homestead-Miami.|$|E

500|$|Shankar saw {{about half}} the film in a roughly edited version before {{composing}} the background score, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> familiar with the story. According to Robinson, when Ray met Shankar the latter hummed a tune that was folk-based but had [...] "a certain sophistication". This tune, usually played on a bamboo flute, became the main theme for the film. The majority of the score was composed within the duration of a single night, in a session that lasted for about eleven hours. Shankar also composed two solo sitar pieces—one based on the raga Desh (traditionally associated with rain), and one sombre piece based on the raga Todi. He created a piece based on the raga Patdeep, played on the tar shehnai, to accompany the scene in which Harihar learns of Durga's death. The film's cinematographer, Subrata Mitra, performed on the sitar for parts of the soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Plath {{attended}} Smith College and excelled academically. She {{wrote to}} her mother, [...] "The world is splitting open at my feet like a ripe, juicy watermelon". She edited The Smith Review and during the summer after her third year of college was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was not what she had hoped it would be, and it began a downward spiral. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas—a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, [...] "more than life itself." [...] She hung around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs {{to see if she}} had enough [...] "courage" [...] to commit suicide. Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar. During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt in late August 1953 by crawling under her house and taking her mother's sleeping pills.|$|E
500|$|New {{contracts}} for returning cast members were made, as {{the actors and}} actresses had signed for only two films. Hugh Jackman's contract included the approval of director, initially offering the position to Darren Aronofsky, {{with whom he had}} just finished filming on The Fountain. Joss Whedon, whose comic book [...] "Gifted" [...] was integrated into the script's plot, turned down the offer because he was working on a Wonder Woman film. Rob Bowman and Alex Proyas were also rumored to be up for consideration, though Proyas personally turned it down, citing feuds with 20th Century Fox president Thomas Rothman while producing I, Robot. Zack Snyder was also approached, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> committed to 300. Peter Berg was also considered to direct the film but he too turned down the job. In February 2005, with still no director hired, Fox announced a May 5, 2006, release date, with filming to start in July 2005 in Vancouver. One month later, the studio signed Matthew Vaughn to direct, and pushed the release date three weeks to May 26, Memorial Day weekend. Vaughn cast Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Dania Ramirez as Callisto, and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, but family issues led him to withdraw before filming began. Vaughn was also cautious of the tight deadlines imposed by Fox, stating that he [...] "didn't have the time to make the movie that I wanted to make". John Moore was also considered to direct the film at one point.|$|E

The snake which encircles him is a semi-tame house snake who has escaped from the room of Alexander's mother, Olympias. Alexander sneaks past his nanny, Hellanike, and into his mother's room to return it.

500|$|The initial cast was {{to feature}} Chevy Chase as Otter, Bill Murray as Boon, Brian Doyle-Murray as Hoover, Dan Aykroyd as D-Day, and John Belushi as Bluto, but only Belushi {{wanted to do}} it. Chase was a star from Saturday Night Live, which had {{recently}} become a cultural phenomenon. His name would have added credibility to the project, but he turned the film down to do Foul Play; Landis, who wanted to cast unknown dramatic actors such as Bacon and Allen (the first film for both) instead of famous comedians, takes credit for subtly discouraging Chase by describing the film as an [...] "ensemble". Landis has also stated {{that he was not}} interested in directing a Saturday Night Live movie and that unknowns would be the better choice. The character of D-Day was based on Aykroyd, who was a motorcycle aficionado. Aykroyd was offered the part, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> committed to Saturday Night Live. Belushi, who had worked on The National Lampoon Radio Hour before Saturday Night Live, was also committed to the show, but spent Monday through Wednesday making the film and then flying back to New York to do the show on Thursday through Saturday. Ramis originally wrote the role of Boon for himself, but Landis felt that he looked too old for the part and Riegert was cast instead. Landis did offer Ramis a smaller part, but he declined. Landis met with Jack Webb to play Dean Wormer and Kim Novak to play his wife. Webb ultimately backed out due to concerns over his clean-cut image, and was replaced by John Vernon.|$|E

2500|$|The planned {{attack on}} Fort Fisher {{required}} {{the cooperation of}} the army, and the troops were taken from the Army of the James. It was expected that Brigadier General Godfrey Weitzel would command, but Major General Benjamin F. Butler, the commander of the Army of the James, exercised one of the prerogatives of his position to install himself as leader of the expedition. Butler proposed that the fort could be flattened by exploding a ship filled with gunpowder near it, and Porter accepted the idea; if successful, the scheme would avoid a protracted siege or its alternative, a frontal assault. Accordingly, the old steamer [...] was packed with powder and blown up in the early morning of December 24, 1864. It had, however, no discernible effect on the fort. Butler brought part of his troops ashore, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> convinced that it was hopeless, so he removed his force before making an all-out assault.|$|E

He was an attaché at the German Embassy in London and his family was not a reigning royal family. The Duchess's main concern was her wayward only son, Young Alfred, who had a checkered career in the German army. On 15 October 1895, he reached his majority, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> suffering from bad health. Alexandra's wedding took place in Coburg in April 1896, and the following month, Maria Alexandrovna travelled to Russia {{with her husband and}} their other four children for Tsar Nicholas II's coronation in Moscow. In June 1897, the Duchess and her husband went back to London to take part in Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. By then, the couple's relationship had deteriorated further. Maria Alexandrovna despaired in finding a topic of conversation with her difficult husband as he hated her interest in literature and the theater, while she found his fondness for politics and hunting [...] "dull". The Duchess was relieved when her husband was away. She wrote to her eldest daughter [...] "if only you knew how easy and comfortable life is without him." [...] By 1898, the Duke's health had deteriorated, exacerbated by his excessive smoking and heavy drinking.|$|E

After a meeting with David Geffen he was on board with the project. Summer's main objective for the album was that it have stronger R influences; Faltermeyer who had just finished doing the soundtracks to Top Gun and Fletch, was after a tough FM-oriented sound. On completion, Geffen liked what he heard, but his executives did not think there were enough songs that could be deemed singles. They wanted Faltermeyer to produce [...] "Dinner with Gershwin", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> busy with another project, so another producer was found.
