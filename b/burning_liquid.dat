5|$|A flame fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project <b>burning</b> <b>liquid</b> onto a target. The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E
25|$|Water has a {{high heat}} of {{vaporization}} and is relatively inert, {{which makes it a}} good fire extinguishing fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the <b>burning</b> <b>liquid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{flammable}} liquids such as diesel fuel, methanol, turpentine, jet fuel, and isopropyl alcohol {{have been used}} in place of, or combined with petrol. Thickening agents such as solvents, foam polystyrene, baking soda, petroleum jelly, tar, strips of tyre tubing, nitrocellulose, XPS foam, motor oil, rubber cement, detergent and dish soap have been added to help the <b>burning</b> <b>liquid</b> adhere to the target and create clouds of thick, choking smoke.|$|E

30|$|In recent years, {{surfactants}} in foam-based fire-fighting agents, used {{to extinguish}} flammable liquids or gases, shifted from long-chain PFASs (mainly C 8 -based) to short-chain PFASs (mainly C 6 -based). The stability and surface-active properties of PFASs enable a film formation {{on top of}} <b>burning</b> <b>liquids,</b> extinguishing the fire and preventing burn back. Nowadays, a number of foam-based fire-fighting agents contain short-chain PFASs. The use of fire-fighting agents results in direct contaminations of the environment {{when there is no}} possibility of collecting the fire water and subsequent disposal [33, 34].|$|R
25|$|The Atlas {{first stage}} was a booster skirt with two engines <b>burning</b> <b>liquid</b> fuel. This {{together}} with the larger sustainer second stage gave it sufficient power to launch a Mercury spacecraft into orbit. Both stages fired from lift-off with the thrust from the second stage sustainer engine passing through {{an opening in the}} first stage. After separation from the first stage, the sustainer stage continued alone. The sustainer also steered the rocket by thrusters guided by gyroscopes. Smaller vernier rockets were added on its sides for precise control of maneuvers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{two ships}} around the tanker {{were joined by}} HMS Bramham and by Ledbury (the latter {{returning}} from her search for Manchester). Meanwhile, Rye had again begun to tow Ohio with the newly arrived Ledbury acting as a stern tug. With less pull from Ledbury, a fair speed was maintained, but steering proved impossible. A stabilising factor was needed, thus Commander Swain edged Penn to the starboard side of Ohio. Rye, joined by Bramham, slowly got under way once more, with Ledbury acting as a rudder. Another Axis air attack began just as the group of ships was moving at six knots. At 10.45 AM {{the first wave of}} dive-bombers came low over the water. Only one oil bomb landed close to Ohios bow, showering her with <b>burning</b> <b>liquid.</b> Then came three more echelons of German planes. This time, [...] close air support from Malta was available. Sixteen Spitfires, of 249 and 229 Squadrons from Malta, had sighted the enemy. The first enemy formation wavered and broke. The second formation also broke, but one section of Junkers 88s succeeded in breaking free, making for the tanker. These were swiftly followed by the Spitfires. Three of the German planes were shot down or manoeuvred to evade the Spitfires; nonetheless one bomber held its course, and a 1,000-pound bomb landed in the tanker's wake. Ohio was flung forward, parting Ryes tow, buckling the stern plates of the tanker and forming a great hole.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} animating suspended particle explosions. Rather than modeling the numerically troublesome, and largely invisible blast wave, the method uses a relatively stable incompressible fluid model {{to account for the}} motion of air and hot gases. The fluid's divergence field is adjusted directly to account for detonations and the generation and expansion of gaseous combustion products. Particles immersed in the fluid track the motion of particulate fuel and soot as they are advected by the fluid. Combustion is modeled using a simple but e#ective process governed by the particle and fluid systems. The method has enough flexibility to also approximate sprays of <b>burning</b> <b>liquids.</b> This paper includes several demonstrative examples showing air bursts, explosions near obstacles, confined explosions, and burning sprays. Because the method is based on components that allow large time integration steps, it only requires a few seconds of computation per frame for the examples shown...|$|R

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} is aimed at the {{development}} of temperature and gas concentration measurement techniques in laser diagnostics for use in combustion research. The techniques are developed as tools for the combustion community to meet future demands on combustion efficiency and legislation of exhaust gases. Thermometry based {{on the use of}} laser-induced phosphorescence has been further developed and performed inside internal combustion engines, in a gas turbine afterburner, in <b>burning</b> <b>liquids,</b> and in research on oxy-fuel flame heat transfer. In work carried out within the EU 6 :th framework program, an attempt was made to find new suitable thermographic phosphors for high temperature two-dimensional measurements in gas turbines. The gas turbine industry has a strong interest in better methods of thermometry at high temperatures for optimizing performance of combustion and engine parts. Measurements on spinning objects require the use of fast phosphors, previously unavailable for high-temperature two-dimensional measurements. A variety of inorganic phosphor materials, not previously used in thermometry, were investigated, some of them being very promising for thermographic use. Laser-induced oxygen sensing using a commercial pressure sensitive paint has been applied in low-temperature combustion. The material has been calibrated to oxygen and temperature. The work show on the potential of using oxygen quenched materials in combustion research even though it involves organic sensing materials. Laser-Induced Fluorescence was employed for visualization of formaldehyde both in Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition, HCCI, and in Diesel combustion engines. Formaldehyde formed in HCCI combustion during low temperature reactions was shown to be able to function as fuel marker. This was demonstrated in simultaneous visualization of the traditional fuel tracer toluene and formaldehyde during operation of an HCCI engine. The use of formaldehyde as a fuel marker was also demonstrated in Diesel combustion, which is characterized by a lack of low temperature reactions and where the location of intermediate species is not obvious. Fuel visualization was also employed for the visualization of jet fuel in a jet stream of a fighter-jet gas turbine. Un-burnt fuel was found to exist in the exhaust for some engine conditions...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Concerns {{about the}} rising fuel price and {{environmental}} changes {{have led to}} the search for alternative fuels and energy sources.
