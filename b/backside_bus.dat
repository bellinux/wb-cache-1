50|$|In {{personal}} computer microprocessor architecture, a back-side bus (BSB), or <b>backside</b> <b>bus,</b> was a computer bus used {{to connect the}} CPU to CPU cache memory, usually L2. If a design utilizes it along with a front-side bus (FSB), {{it is said to}} use a dual-bus architecture, or in Intel's terminology Dual Independent Bus (DIB) architecture.|$|E
40|$|A PLGT FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) is {{included}} in the LCC (Load Control Card), GID (Guidance Interface & Drivers), TMC (Telemetry Multiplexer Card), and PFC (Pyro Firing Card) boards of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) spacecraft. (PLGT stands for PFC, LCC, GID, and TMC.) It provides the interface between the <b>backside</b> <b>bus</b> and the power drivers on these boards. The LCC drives power switches to switch power loads, and also relays. The GID drives the thrusters and latch valves, as well as having the star-tracker and Sun-sensor interface. The PFC drives pyros, and the TMC receives digital and analog telemetry. The FPGA is implemented both in Xilinx (Spartan 3 - 400) and in Actel (RTSX 72 SU, ASX 72 S). The Xilinx Spartan 3 part is used for the breadboard, the Actel ASX part is used for the EM (Engineer Module), and the pin-compatible, radiation-hardened RTSX part is used for final EM and flight. The MSL spacecraft uses a FC (Flight Computer) to control power loads, relays, thrusters, latch valves, Sun-sensor, and star-tracker, and to read telemetry such as temperature. Commands are sent over a 1553 bus to the MREU (Multi-Mission System Architecture Platform Remote Engineering Unit). The MREU resends over a remote serial command bus c-bus to the LCC, GID TMC, and PFC. The MREU also sends out telemetry addresses via a remote serial telemetry address bus to the LCC, GID, TMC, and PFC, and the status is returned over the remote serial telemetry data bus...|$|E
50|$|Jhelum is {{near the}} site of the famous Battle of the Hydaspes between the armies of Alexander the Great and Raja Porus. This battle took place a few miles {{downstream}} from the city centre, along the river banks. The city was founded to commemorate the death of Alexander's horse, Bucephalus, and was originally called Bucephala. Nearby there is also the historic 16th century Rohtas Fort, another historic fort since Sikh era located at the <b>backside</b> of main <b>bus</b> stand near Railway Phatak Jhelum City now being used as stores under Railway Authorities and also Tilla Jogian; a centuries-long history of the area.|$|R
40|$|Urban {{transportation}} {{problems are}} particularly noticeable within cities of over 100 thousand inhabitants. In these cities buses are a {{primary means of}} transport, but lack of low-floor and poor interior design does not encourage passengers to use them. However, the qualities that give the most negative feedback on the public transpiration are the technical condition of buses, excessive noise and exhaust emission. Technical <b>backsides</b> of the <b>bus</b> depots that constantly maintain the technical readiness of the required number of vehicles {{play an important role}} to ensure high quality standards. New European Union legislation is very helpful in such. New laws and regulations deal with the safety issues and environmental protection matters, to which the urban transportation depots must be strictly adjusted. This article refers to these documents and presents depot technical stations, which equipment needs to be upgraded in the first place...|$|R
