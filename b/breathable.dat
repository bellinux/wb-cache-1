5|$|The puffball {{was used}} by the Chippewa people of North America as a charm, and medicinally as a hemostat. In British Columbia, Canada, it is used by {{livestock}} farmers who are not allowed to use conventional drugs under certified organic programs. The spore mass of the puffball is applied to bleeding hoof trimming 'nicks', and then wrapped with <b>breathable</b> first-aid tape. It is also similarly used on bleeding areas resulting from disbudding, and wounds resulting from sternal abscesses.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of <b>breathable</b> atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly {{the same as that of}} the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that <b>breathable</b> air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
25|$|A {{dry suit}} {{made with a}} {{waterproof}} <b>breathable</b> membrane to let moisture permeate out of the suit.|$|E
25|$|Because airliners fly at {{very high}} altitudes, the cabin must be {{pressurized}} to provide a safe quantity of <b>breathable</b> oxygen to passengers and crew.|$|E
25|$|It can be {{stretched}} to contain small pores of varying sizes and is then placed between fabric layers {{to make a}} waterproof, <b>breathable</b> fabric in outdoor apparel.|$|E
25|$|By the 1973 Belgian Grand Prix, Hulme and McLaren {{had taken}} F1 safety forward, when his car {{introduced}} the Graviner life-support system to Formula One, supplying the driver <b>breathable</b> {{air in the}} event of fire.|$|E
25|$|The airspheres {{resemble}} in {{some respects}} the orbit-sized ring of <b>breathable</b> atmosphere created by Larry Niven in The Integral Trees, but spherical not toroidal, require a force field to retain their integrity, and arose by artificial rather than natural processes.|$|E
25|$|Dyson {{has also}} {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a Dyson tree, a genetically-engineered plant capable of growing on a comet. He suggested that comets could be engineered to contain hollow spaces filled with a <b>breathable</b> atmosphere, thus providing self-sustaining habitats for humanity in the outer solar system.|$|E
25|$|In practice, magnets {{usually have}} safety devices to stop or limit the current when the {{beginning}} of a quench is detected. If a large magnet undergoes a quench, the inert vapor formed by the evaporating cryogenic fluid can present a significant asphyxiation hazard to operators by displacing <b>breathable</b> air.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{may also be}} made of a {{waterproof}} but <b>breathable</b> material like Gore-Tex to enable comfortable wear without excessive humidity and buildup of condensation. This function does not work underwater. Sailors and boaters who intend {{to stay out of}} the water may prefer this type of suit.|$|E
25|$|The {{cabin is}} pressurized, {{maintaining}} a sea level <b>breathable</b> atmosphere. Oxygen is {{introduced to the}} cabin from a bottle, and carbon dioxide and water vapor are removed by absorbers. The occupants do not wear spacesuits or breathing masks, because the cabin {{has been designed to}} maintain pressure in the face of faults: all windows and seals are doubled.|$|E
25|$|Concrete-like blocks {{made with}} hemp and lime {{have been used}} as an {{insulating}} material for construction. Such blocks are not strong enough to be used for structural elements; they must be supported by a brick, wood, or steel frame. However hemp fibres are extremely strong and durable, and {{have been shown to be}} usable as a replacement for wood for many jobs including creating very durable and <b>breathable</b> homes.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, a DuPont {{research}} {{manager in}} the Teflon business, Bill Gore, left the company because of its unwillingness to develop Teflon as wire-coating insulation. Gore's son Robert found a method for solving the wire-coating problem and the company W. L. Gore and Associates was born. In 1969, Robert Gore developed an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane {{which led to the}} large Gore-Tex business in <b>breathable</b> rainwear. The company developed many other uses of PTFE.|$|E
25|$|Increases in {{temperature}} when filling {{make it difficult}} to accurately decant or pump a measured quantity of gas based on pressure measurement. When cylinders are filled with gas quickly, typically in 10 to 60 minutes at a dive filling station, the gas inside gets hot, which increases the pressure of the gas relative to its mass. When the cylinder cools, the gas pressure falls resulting in a reduced volume of <b>breathable</b> gas available to the diver.|$|E
25|$|The pilots {{initially}} {{believed that}} a bomb had gone off inside the airplane, as this accident happened just two months after Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland. They began an emergency descent {{in order to reach}} an altitude where the air was <b>breathable,</b> while also performing a 180-degree left turn to fly back to Honolulu. The explosion damaged components of the on-board emergency oxygen supply system, as it was primarily located in the forward cargo sidewall area, just aft of the cargo door.|$|E
25|$|The fiber is {{most often}} spun into yarn or thread and {{used to make a}} soft, <b>breathable</b> textile. The use of cotton for fabric is known to date to prehistoric times; {{fragments}} of cotton fabric dated from 5000 BC have been excavated in Mexico and between 6000 BC and 5000 BC in the Indus Valley Civilization. Although cultivated since antiquity, it was the invention of the cotton gin that lowered the cost of production that led to its widespread use, and it is the most widely used natural fiber cloth in clothing today.|$|E
25|$|Once an {{eruption}} occurs, a large CO2 cloud forms above {{the lake and}} expands to the neighbouring region. Because CO2 is denser than air, it {{has a tendency to}} sink to the ground while pushing <b>breathable</b> air up. As a result, life forms that need to breathe oxygen suffocate once the CO2 cloud reaches them, as there is very little oxygen in the cloud. The CO2 can make human bodily fluids very acidic, potentially causing CO2 poisoning. As victims gasp for air they actually hurt themselves more by inhaling the CO2 gas.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{disposable}} baby {{diapers and}} incontinence products have a layered construction, {{which allows the}} transfer and distribution of urine to an absorbent core structure where it is locked in. Basic layers are an outer shell of <b>breathable</b> polyethylene film or a nonwoven and film composite which prevents wetness and soil transfer, an inner absorbent layer of a mixture of air-laid paper and superabsorbent polymers for wetness, and a layer nearest the skin of nonwoven material with a distribution layer directly beneath which transfers wetness to the absorbent layer.|$|E
25|$|The board {{determined}} the oxygen tank failure {{was caused by}} an unlikely chain of events. Tanks storing cryogens, such as liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, require either venting, extremely good insulation, or both, {{in order to avoid}} excessive pressure buildup due to vaporization of the tanks' contents. The Service Module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain supercritical hydrogen and oxygen for years. Each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen, which was used for <b>breathable</b> air and the production of electricity and water. The construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible.|$|E
25|$|In Wales where 'zero-carbon homes' are the {{aspiration}} for 2011 (although 2012 is more likely) the requirements are for Code for Sustainable Homes or equivalent. This {{has opened the}} doors for standards like Passiv Haus and the CarbonLite programme. Another lesser known building type that does not rely on airtightness {{in order to get}} its energy rating is Bio-Solar-Haus. This is not a well known type of house, but it has a range of positive advantages like it is built out of renewable resources and it is a <b>breathable</b> structure thus making it much healthier to live in.|$|E
25|$|As {{the fire}} raged outside the mine, the heat caused {{the cold air}} in the tunnel to rush out, {{replacing}} it with hot air and smoke. Pulaski ordered the men to {{lie down on the}} floor of the mine where there was still some <b>breathable</b> air. As the fire closed in around the tunnel entrance, timber beams at the mouth of the tunnel began to burn. Pulaski carried water in his hat from pools on the mine floor to the entrance, trying to douse the flames. In the process, he was badly burned. Eventually, Pulaski fell unconscious, as did all his men.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) and methane gas in the mine atmosphere made it necessary for rescuers to wait 12 hours after the explosion to begin to reach the miners. Tests taken through holes drilled from the surface showed that the air near where the miners were last known to be stationed contained 1,300 parts per million of CO. More than 200 parts per million is considered unsafe. However, each miner had a Self-Contained Self-Rescuer (SCSR) device that provided one hour of <b>breathable</b> air. Emergency supplies were stored in 55-gallon drums (205 L drums) within the mine.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{environmental}} conditions experienced by humans during spaceflight {{are very different from}} those in which humans evolved; however, technology is able to shield people from the harshest conditions, such as that offered by a spaceship or spacesuit. The immediate needs for <b>breathable</b> air and drinkable water are addressed by a life support system, a group of devices that allow human beings to survive in outer space. The life support system supplies air, water and food. It must also maintain temperature and pressure within acceptable limits and deal with the body's waste products. Shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites is also necessary.|$|E
25|$|As most cave diving {{is done in}} an {{environment}} where there is no free surface with <b>breathable</b> air allowing an above-water exit, it is critically important {{to be able to find}} the way out before the breathing gas runs out. This is ensured by the use of a continuous guideline between the dive team and outside of the flooded cave, and diligent planning and monitoring of gas supplies. Two basic types of guideline are used: permanent lines, and temporary lines. Permanent lines may include a main line starting near the entrance/exit, and side lines or branch lines, and are marked to indicate the direction to the nearest exit. Temporary lines include exploration lines and jump lines.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is first mentioned in Red Mars; it takes off when Sax creates an alga {{to withstand the}} harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into <b>breathable</b> air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In Green Mars, GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By Blue Mars, GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in the dimmer light of the outer planets.|$|E
25|$|Dry {{suits are}} often worn for boating, {{especially}} sailing, and on personal water craft {{in the winter}} months. The primary uses are for protection from spray, and in case of accidental short-term immersion in cold water if the user falls overboard. These dry suits, which are only intended for temporary immersion, are less rugged than diving dry suits. They are usually made of a <b>breathable</b> membrane material to let sweat permeate, keeping the wearer dry and comfortable all day. Membrane type surface dry suits only keep the user dry, and have little thermal insulating properties. Most users will wear a thin thermal undersuit, or street clothes, for warmth; but wearing ordinary fabrics can be dangerous if the suit leaks in cold water because they will lose most of their insulating properties.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet honored California beach resorts {{once again}} by naming the top Chevelle series Laguna with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe. In {{addition}} to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored urethane front end concealing the new 5mph bumper system. On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock- absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds; Laguna models also featured a specific diecast chrome grille with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear bumper, front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional <b>breathable</b> all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.|$|E
25|$|On May 5, 2009, Smith was {{assisting}} two Navy divers, Bill Dodd and Corey Seymour, {{who were}} 300 feet from Aquarius using an underwater jackhammer {{to install a}} way station that would contain <b>breathable</b> air. Smith informed Dodd and Seymour that he was returning to Aquarius but would be back. Five or ten minutes later, Seymour noticed that Smith was lying on his side in the water, his mouthpiece out of his mouth. Seymour began carrying Smith back to Aquarius, but his air umbilical became fouled about thirty yards from the habitat. Dodd carried Smith {{the rest of the}} distance to Aquarius, where the other divers in the habitat helped them get Smith inside. Resuscitation attempts by Dodd, Seymour, and two Navy physicians who dove to the habitat were unsuccessful. Smith was pronounced dead at 3:25 pm by a Navy doctor. His death was the first associated with the Aquarius program.|$|E
25|$|The MUM Sustainable Living Center was {{designed}} to surpass LEED Platinum qualification. The Maharishi University of Management (MUM) in Fairfield, Iowa, founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (best known for having brought Transcendental Meditation to the West) incorporates principles of Bau Biology (a German system that focuses on creating a healthy indoor environment), as well as Maharishi Vedic Architecture (an Indian system of architecture focused on the precise orientation, proportions and placement of rooms). The building {{is one of the}} few in the country to qualify as net zero, and one of even fewer that can claim the banner of grid positive via its solar power system. A rainwater catchment system and on-site natural waste-water treatment likewise take the building off (sewer) grid with respect to water and waste treatment. Additional green features include natural daylighting in every room, natural and <b>breathable</b> earth block walls (made by the program’s students), purified rainwater for both potable and non-potable functions; and an on-site water purification and recycling system consisting of plants, algae, and bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{subsistence}} {{activity for}} the Yup'ik is fishing, though hunting supplements {{the food supply}} and provides skins for clothing. The Yup'ik fur and skin clothing, like other Eskimo groups, is {{a key factor in}} ensuring their survival in the northernmost reaches of the globe. The raw materials of traditional Yup'ik clothing are skin (hide) and fur (pelt), intestine (gut), sinew, and grass. The raw material resources are sea and land mammals, birds, fish and plants. Traditionally, skins of birds, fish, and marine and land animals were used to make clothing. Hunting clothes were designed to be insulated and waterproof. Fish skin and marine mammal intestines were used for waterproof shells and boots. Grass was used to make insulating socks, and as a waterproof thread. Wastefulness being disrespectful, Yup'ik elders made use of every last scrap from hunts and harvests: seal guts became warm, waterproof, and <b>breathable</b> parkas; the skins of fish were fashioned into waterproof mittens, while their heads and entrails were stored in naturally refrigerated pits as insurance against future famine. Dried grasses became anything from insulating socks to bedding to sled rope, or even goggles to protect against snow blindness.|$|E
25|$|Kalas awakens in Mintaka, the Imperial capital, and {{receives}} both his Winglet and his guardian spirit back from Xelha. He also {{takes on the}} role of world-saving hero with greater enthusiasm than before, feeling he must make amends for deceiving his friends. After this, Mizuti directs the group to the lands below the Taintclouds, a poisonous layer of gas {{at the bottom of the}} sky. The atmosphere down there has become <b>breathable</b> over a thousand years, but this was not always the case. Due to this, the people who lived down there wore masks which could filter the air and make it possible to breathe. They also do not know when the air became safe to breathe. It is down here that the gang learn about the Sword of the Heavens, and that this area is Mizuti's homeland. Sadly, the Sword of the Heavens had been stolen by Krumly, who resented the role of guardians that the children of the Earth have inherited for generations. He therefore attempted a ritual to a pierce a hole in the Taintcoluds and beg Malpercio to release the children of the Earth from their duty. This turns out to be a mistake as Melodia and Malpercio rampage through Krumly's village. The village is saved by a last minute intervention from Kalas and the gang, but the Sword of the Heavens is broken.|$|E
500|$|Martha, Milo, and Cheen {{drive into}} the fast lane and begin to hear strange noises all around. A nearby driver warns them to escape into the slow lanes before being eaten by the creatures {{that live in the}} fast lane, but Milo refuses. [...] The Doctor, finding himself in a van just above the fast lane, looks out the bottom and discovers that the floor of the Motorway is filled with Macra. The Macra are monstrous crab-like alien beings that were once {{intelligent}} but now have devolved into feral beasts, who attempt to capture and eat those that fly in the fast lane. [...] The Doctor watches as Milo's van is nearly caught by a Macra claw, but Martha realises that the beings are attracted by the light and motion generated by the van and has Milo cut the power. [...] This saves them from the beasts but leaves them with only a few minutes of <b>breathable</b> air in the van.|$|E
2500|$|The ready {{availability}} of oxygen sensing cells {{beginning in the}} late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. [...] By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain a <b>breathable</b> gas mixture in the loop at any depth.|$|E
2500|$|After the accident, {{numerous}} passengers {{said that}} some oxygen masks did not deploy, whilst others had deteriorated elastic. Consequently, {{it was reported that}} one passenger smashed a panel of the ceiling to attempt {{to gain access to the}} masks. [...] It was stated that these passengers were deprived of oxygen until the plane was lowered to a <b>breathable</b> altitude. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau interviewed passengers who reported problems with the oxygen masks as part of their investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} the [...] "worldhouse" [...] concept, paraterraforming {{involves}} {{the construction of a}} habitable enclosure on a planet which encompasses most of the planet's usable area. The enclosure would consist of a transparent roof held one or more kilometers above the surface, pressurized with a <b>breathable</b> atmosphere, and anchored with tension towers and cables at regular intervals. The worldhouse concept is similar to the concept of a domed habitat, but one which covers all (or most) of the planet.|$|E
