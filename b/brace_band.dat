5000|$|The {{original}} titles to the programme in {{the sixties}} were provided by a most unlikely dance/swing arrangement, later replaced by Herb Alpert's [...] "Magic Trumpet" [...] with <b>bracing</b> brass <b>band</b> instrumentation, which {{were similar to those}} of Go With Noakes, and the presentation similar to an Open University educational television programme.|$|R
50|$|The {{headgear}} {{can also}} be used to make more space for teeth to come in. The headgear is then attached to the molars (via molar headgear bands & tubes), and helps to push or draw them backwards in the mouth, opening up space for the front teeth to be moved back using <b>braces</b> and <b>bands.</b>|$|R

50|$|Permanent lisps {{can often}} be {{corrected}} through extensive oral operations. Often, when a patient has extreme overbite, causing a lisp, having orthodontic <b>braces</b> and rubber <b>bands</b> {{for an extended period}} of time will correct the issue, and resolve the lisp.|$|R
50|$|Before the Band could {{promote the}} album by touring, Danko was {{severely}} {{injured in a}} car accident, breaking his neck and back in six places, which put him in traction for months. While he was in traction, Danko's girlfriend, Grace Seldner, informed {{him that she was}} pregnant, and he proposed from his hospital bed. When they married, Danko was still in a neck <b>brace.</b> The <b>Band</b> finally made their concert debut at Bill Graham's Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in April 1969.|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobial {{effect of}} {{different}} brushing frequencies with fluoride toothpaste on Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species {{in children with}} fixed orthodontic appliances Objective: To evaluate the antimicrobial effect of different frequencies of brushing with fluoride toothpaste on the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in children undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. Methods: The study included 22 patients scheduled for fixed orthodontic therapy distributed between 2 groups with different hygiene regimes. All the subjects received identical <b>braces,</b> <b>bands,</b> and brackets bonded with the same material. Stimulated saliva samples were obtained before placement of the appliance and at 6, 12, and 18 weeks during the therapy. Saliva samples were cultured on selective microbial agar {{for the detection of}} microorganisms. Results: Salivary mutans streptococci were significantly suppressed throughout the experimental period in the group that brushed 4 times a day as compared to the group that brushed twice a day. Salivary lactobacilli were not significantly affected by the frequency of brushing with 0. 32 % sodium fluoride (NaF) toothpaste. Conclusions: The use of 0. 32 % NaF-containing toothpaste more than 3 times a day has effective antimicrobial activity on mutans streptococci but not lactobacilli in the saliva of children with fixed orthodontic appliances.

50|$|The {{appliance}} normally {{consists of}} a frame or a centre bars that are strapped to the patients head during a fitting appointment. The frame has a section which is positioned {{in front of the}} patients mouth, which allows for the attachment of elastic or rubber bands directly into the mouth area. These elastics are then hooked onto the child's <b>braces</b> (brackets and <b>bands)</b> or appliance fitted in his or her mouth.|$|R
50|$|Headgear {{can also}} be used to make more space for teeth to come in. In this {{instance}} the headgear is attached to the molars, via molar headgear bands and tubes, and helps to draw these molars backwards in the mouth, opening up space for the front teeth to be moved back using <b>braces</b> and <b>bands.</b> Multiple appliances and accessories are typically used along with the headgear, such as: power chains, coil springs, twin blocks, plates or retainers, facemasks, a headgear helmet (a headgear helmet is a cervical headgear with a cap that covers the entire head), lip bumpers, palate expanders, elastics, bionaters, Herbst appliances, Wilson appliances, other headgear, hybrid twinblocks, positioner retainers, and jasper jumpers. Many patients wear a combination of, or all of these appliances at any given time in their treatment.|$|R

50|$|Orthodontic {{separators}} (commonly {{known as}} spacers) are rubber bands or metal appliances used in orthodontics. Spacers are placed between the molars {{at the second}} orthodontic appointment, before molar bands are applied. Spacers are either circular rubber bands about a centimeter in diameter placed between top and bottom molars; there may be 1-12 spacers applied or small metal spring clips (spring separators) that push the molars apart. The spacers stay between the teeth for one to two weeks and move the teeth apart slowly until they are far apart enough so that orthodontists can fit a tooth <b>brace</b> or molar <b>band</b> in between them or fit an expander with rubber rings.|$|R
50|$|His {{production}} work {{began with the}} animation film soundtrack All Kinds of Heroes, written by Steve Hopkins (with whom Hannett later worked again). By this time, he also began to mix live sound at pub gigs. Other early {{production work}}s included Greasy Bear material, Belt & <b>Braces</b> Road Show <b>Band's</b> eponymous album in 1975 and five songs from Pete Farrow's repertoire recorded at Pennine Studios, Oldham, later included on Farrow's compilation album Who Says There's No Beach in Stockport. He attracted more musical attention in 1977, when, as Martin Zero, he produced the first independent punk record, Buzzcocks' Spiral Scratch EP. Under the same moniker he produced early records by punk poet John Cooper Clarke, whose Salford monotone was complemented by drum machines, simple synthesiser motifs and Hannett's bass playing. Jilted John's first single (Jilted John) was Hannett's first hit single.|$|R
5000|$|After {{playing a}} final {{show for the}} year all {{activity}} from Nazxul then appeared to cease abruptly. Kostic joined Regurgitator in 2000 and the Hard Ons in 2001. Hades recorded two more albums with Sadistik Exekution before embarking on a solo career. Mitchell continued {{his work as a}} professional sound engineer / producer and in late 2001 formed a rock <b>band</b> <b>Brace</b> with several former members of Canberra group Henry's Anger. Backovic left Nazxul in 2000 to pursue a career in the film industry as a screenplay writer and director. In 2002, Sydney black metal label Decius released a limited-edition live album (titled simply Live) on 12" [...] vinyl. The recording was of the group's 1999 Metal for the Brain performance. A year later, the Nazxul track [...] "Apostasies Legions Arise, Xul!" [...] appeared on a compilation release from Hiberica Records along with tracks from American band Krieg, Necroplasma from Sweden and Goat Semen from Peru.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This {{study was}} {{developed}} (1) {{to compare the}} durability and comfort of stretch and nonstretch in certain selected denim and gingham fabrics, (2) to test specific designs as to their self-help features and (3) to test special features in the designs which might be adapted easily to ready-made clothing for handicapped children. Two shirt designs and two trouser designs were developed for boys who wore leg braces, had limited finger coordination and had varying degrees of deformity in the shoulders. These designs were then constructed into 16 shirts from woven stretch and nonstretch gingham and 16 pairs of trousers from woven stretch and nonstretch denim. Eight boys, {{ranging in age from}} five to 12 years, were selected from the Children's Hospital School in Eugene, Oregon. Each boy had two outfits of the same design, one of stretch fabric and the other of nonstretch. Each outfit was worn once a week for a total of 12 wearings. All garments were laundered after each wearing by a selected laundress who followed a set procedure. The designs and special features were evaluated by two therapists and the mothers of the eight subjects during interviews with the writer. The writer also held discussions with the children. The fabrics were evaluated by the laundress and the writer by examinations of the garments after each laundering. From these evaluations the following results were apparent: 1. The woven stretch fabrics had better abrasion resistance than the nonstretch when worn over corrective appliances and retained their color and dimensional stability. 2. A pull-over style shirt with a dickey and raglan sleeves was desirable for boys who could raise their arms but had little finger coordination. 3. A shirt with a front opening with Velcro fasteners was satisfactory for boys who had limited finger coordination and could not raise their arms. 4. Raglan sleeves in shirts were desirable for boys with poor coordination and deformed shoulders. 5. Elastic at the waistband of trousers was desirable for those who needed larger trousers to fit over leg <b>braces</b> and pelvic <b>bands.</b> 6. A leg opening closed with a zipper or Velcro was desirable in trousers worn over leg braces...|$|R
40|$|I {{have always}} enjoyed the {{challenge}} music has given me. I have found very few disciplines {{that can give}} a work ethic while engaging one’s emotions. Music connects the analytical {{left side of the}} brain while uniting itself with the expressive right side of the brain. I began playing trumpet at ten years old and switched to the euphonium (a lower brass instrument with the range of a trombone but the sound of a French horn) in sixth grade when I got <b>braces.</b> I loved <b>band.</b> I learned how to improve my own playing ability while working with a team. It soon became evident to me that music education was my calling. I explored music education from an academic perspective and continued to play in college. Through college I was learning about the education process and how music education fits into a curriculum. It was all very interesting but I had never had much of an opportunity to write much music. Writing music was homework exercises for music theory classes. Practical, yet not emotional. As I started to plan for my senior recital and my honors project, I saw an opportunity to fulfill my desire to write music, specifically for my euphonium (Greek for sweetly sounded). The solo euphonium repertoire is so limited since the instrument has only existed for 140 years and its purpose in an ensemble is more functional and harmonic rather than melodic. There was a unique convergence of needs; a desire to write music, performing a recital, and completing my senior project. I began to look for inspiration for my recital and one came along. Johann Sebastian Bach’s Chaconne from Partita No. 2 in d minor, a solo violin piece, was a perfect choice to arrange for the euphonium because of its gorgeous flowing lines and technical demand. Hector Berlioz’s Symphonie Fantastique gave another prospect for arranging for the euphonium. The Sheppard’s Duet from the third movement was originally written from oboe and English horn, but was arranged for euphonium and tuba with an electronic recording as well. The electronic recording was filled with wind and birds chirping; it brought the concert hall outside into the fields of Berlioz’s symphony. The final piece of the recital was the only piece originally written for the euphonium. Potiyenko’s Konzert für Euphonium is a marvelous piece for the euphonium, packed with romantic melodies and avant-garde harmonics. My project will follow the transformation of both Bach and Berlioz’s works into recital arrangements for the euphonium, as well as the performance of the recital itself...|$|R
