50|$|<b>Binospirone</b> (MDL-73,005-EF) {{is a drug}} {{which acts}} as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors but as an {{antagonist}} at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. It has anxiolytic effects.|$|E
50|$|The anxiolytics {{are also}} {{classified}} as azapirones {{due to the}} azaspirodecanedione moiety in their structures. 1-PP is a common metabolite of {{most or all of}} the listed agents. Alnespirone, <b>binospirone,</b> and enilospirone, despite being azapirones, are not piperazines and therefore do not metabolize to 1-PP, and while perospirone and tiospirone are piperazines, they are instead benzothiazole-substituted piperazines and do not metabolize to 1-PP either.|$|E
