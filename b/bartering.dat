This study is aimed at investigating the management practices used by firms involved in <b>barter</b> trading {{in order to ensure}} that they take optimal advantage of benefits of <b>barter</b> trade and minimise its potential problems.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} Russia's <b>barter</b> economy. Using interview data, it {{examines the}} mechanics of <b>barter</b> settlements and classifies the main types of non-monetary transactions. The major reason for <b>barter</b> is lack of a competitive monetary system. In the 1990 s <b>barter</b> represented a specific vehicle to perform settlements. <b>Barter</b> itself is not a way to evade taxes or to defraud enterprises of assets. But <b>barter</b> changed the motivation of enterprises and led to systematic distortion of accounting data. The low transparency of the <b>barter</b> economy creates barriers for investment and restructuring. The <b>barter</b> economy is an insider's economy. The lack of affiliated entity regulation and mechanisms for disclosure of transactions with related parties stimulates insiders to criminal application of <b>barter</b> and monetary surrogates. <b>Barter</b> has become a profitable business {{for a number of}} important economic agents including financial intermediaries affiliated with top managers of the biggest privatised enterprises and government agencies. ...|$|R

5|$|Silver {{was one of}} {{the seven}} metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose {{discovery}} is thus lost to history. In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple <b>bartering.</b> However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold. For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC: the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the silver chloride produced to the metal.|$|E

40|$|In a <b>barter</b> {{transaction}} involving <b>barter</b> credits, {{an enterprise}} enters into a transaction to exchange a nonmonetary asset (for example, inventory) for <b>barter</b> credits. Those transactions may occur directly between principals to the transaction or include {{a third party}} whose business is to facilitate those types of exchanges (for example, a <b>barter</b> company). The <b>barter</b> credits {{can be used to}} purchase goods or services, such as advertising time, from either the <b>barter</b> company or members of its <b>barter</b> exchange network.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we survey the common {{explanations}} of <b>barter</b> in transition economies and {{expose them to}} detailed survey data on 165 <b>barter</b> deals in Ukraine in 1997. The evidence {{does not support the}} notion that soft budget constraints, lack of restructuring, or that the virtual economy are the driving forces behind <b>barter.</b> Further, tax avoidance is only weakly associated with the incidence of <b>barter</b> in Ukraine. We then explore an alternative explanation of <b>barter</b> as a mechanism to address transitional challenges where capital markets and economic institutions are poorly developed. First, <b>barter</b> helps to maintain production by creating a deal-specific collateral which softens the liquidity squeeze in the economy when credit enforcement is prohibitively costly. Second, <b>barter</b> helps to maintain production by preventing firms being exploited by their input suppliers when the suppliers' bargaining position is very strong due to high costs of switching suppliers. Thus, in the absence of trust and functioning capital markets <b>barter</b> is a self-enforcing response to imperfect input and financial markets in the former Soviet Union. The paper concludes by discussing potential long-term costs of <b>barter</b> arrangements, and by suggesting particular pitfalls of expansionary monetary policy in <b>barter</b> economies such as Ukraine and Russia.

40|$|Abstract. <b>barter</b> is a scalable, highly-available and ecient {{electronic}} commerce system that facilitates digital content trade {{over an open}} net-work. <b>barter</b> is designed to operate over a large-scale, global and het-erogeneous communication network infrastructure. The <b>barter</b> proto-cols address two vital requirements from an {{electronic commerce}} system, neglected from existing systems: scalability and transactional eciency. <b>barter</b> suggests three basic protocols, oering dierent levels of trust in the system. <b>barter’s</b> novelty is twofold: First, by distributing signature verication away from <b>barter</b> servers, the overhead of online transaction processing is reduced by orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, this does not sacrice strong security requirements, namely the ability to aggregate transaction commitments and to resolve disputes. Second, <b>barter</b> integrates scalability considerations into several system components {{that are likely to}} suer service degradation in a world-wide setting. These components are the authentication subsystem, the ac-count management subsystem, and the maintenance of global data (such as transaction identier lists). In addressing these issues, <b>barter</b> takes into account the inherent asynchronous, unreliable, insecure and failure-prone environment assumptions. We contend that by employing service distribution, <b>barter</b> is expected to scale well, meeting the demands of a world-wide setting, over which it is intended to operate. ...|$|R
