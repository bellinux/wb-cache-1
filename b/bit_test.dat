5000|$|What is {{regarded}} as the Blackfin [...] "core" [...] is contextually dependent. For some applications, the DSP features are central. Blackfin has two 16-bit hardware MACs, two 40-bit ALUs, and a 40-bit barrel shifter. This allows the processor to execute up to three instructions per clock cycle, depending on the level of optimization performed by the compiler or programmer. Two nested zero-overhead loops and four circular buffer DAGs (data address generators) are designed to assist in writing efficient code requiring fewer instructions. Other applications utilize the RISC features, which include memory protection, different operating modes (user, kernel), single-cycle opcodes, data and instruction caches, and instructions for <b>bit</b> <b>test,</b> byte, word, or integer accesses and a variety of on-chip peripherals.|$|E

The copies are delayed so that all <b>test</b> <b>bits</b> occur in parallel in both paths at a time at which the signal amplitudes of all parallel bits in their respective channels are separately summed. The summed values are optoelectronically converted and differenced. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method involves repeated periodic addition of a characteristic <b>test</b> <b>bit</b> sequence from a number of <b>test</b> <b>bits</b> with 0 and 1 bits into a digital signal data stream at the transmitter end and filtering out and evaluating the <b>test</b> <b>bit</b> sequence at the receiver end.

40|$|Abstract—Pseudo-exhaustive pattern {{generators}} for built-in self-test (BIST) provide high {{fault coverage}} of detectable combinational faults with much fewer test vectors than exhaustive generation. In () -adjacent <b>bit</b> pseudo-exhaustive <b>test</b> sets, all 2 binary combinations appear to all adjacent-bit groups of inputs. With recursive pseudoexhaustive generation, all () -adjacent <b>bit</b> pseudoexhaustive <b>tests</b> are generated for {{and more than}} one modules can be pseudo-exhaustively tested in parallel. In order to detect sequential (e. g., stuck-open) faults that occur into current CMOS circuits, two-pattern tests are exercised. Also, delay testing, commonly used to assure correct circuit operation at clock speed requires two-pattern tests. In this paper a pseudoexhaustive two-pattern generator is presented, that recursively generates all two-pattern () -adjacent <b>bit</b> pseudoexhaustive <b>tests</b> for all.

A range of 16-bit instructions treat the A and B registers as a combined 16-bit D register for comparison (X and Y registers may also be compared to 16-bit memory operands), addition, subtraction and shift operations, or can add the B accumulator to the X or Y index registers. <b>Bit</b> <b>test</b> operations have also been added, performing a logical AND function between operands, setting the correct conditions codes, but not modifying the operands.|$|E
40|$|The next <b>bit</b> <b>test</b> was {{introduced}} by Blum and Micali and proved by Yao to be a universal test for cryptographic pseudorandom generators. On the other hand, no universal test for the cryptographic onewayness of functions (or permutations) is known, though the existence of cryptographic pseudorandom generators is equivalent to that of cryptographic one-way functions. In the quantum computation model, Kashefi, Nishimura and Vedral gave a sufficient condition of (cryptographic) quantum one-way permutations and conjectured that the condition would be necessary. In this paper, we affirmatively settle their conjecture and complete a necessary and sufficient for quantum one-way permutations. The necessary and sufficient condition {{can be regarded as}} a universal test for quantum one-way permutations, since the condition is described as a collection of stepwise tests similar to the next <b>bit</b> <b>test</b> for pseudorandom generators. ...|$|E
