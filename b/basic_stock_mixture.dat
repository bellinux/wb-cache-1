Bayesian statistical methods are widely recognized as providing a preferable strategy for such analyses. In general, Bayesian estimation is based on standard latent class models using data augmentation through Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this study, we introduce a novel approach based on recent developments in the estimation of genetic population structure. Our strategy combines analytical integration with stochastic optimization to identify <b>stock</b> <b>mixtures.</b> An important enhancement over previous methods {{is the possibility of}} appropriately handling data where only partial baseline sample information is available.

40|$|Chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) {{populations have}} {{experienced}} declines in Western Alaska {{and in other}} areas of their geographic range. Possible reasons include regime shifts in climate, by-catch by other fisheries, and other environmental perturbations. Genetics offers powerful tools {{that can be used to}} estimate the origins of fish captured on the high seas in mixed stock fisheries. These tools can aid in reducing by-catch and may help to determine other possible causes for their declines. In this project, we developed and tested genetics methods that can be used to resolve <b>stock</b> <b>mixtures</b> of chum salmon. Although microsatellite variation is one approach to estimating compositions of <b>stock</b> <b>mixtures,</b> microsatellites require both coordination among labs that develop baseline to ensure compatibility and experience in conducting the analyses. The type of marker focused on in this study was single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which is becoming increasingly popular because, once the marker has been developed and baseline data acquired, SNP variation can be rapidly surveyed in many individuals. Also, the technology can be readily transported among labs and adapted to different types of instrumentation for analysis. In order to develop SNPs as a tool, however, tens or hundreds o...|$|R

40|$|Specific trace {{elements}} {{incorporated into the}} growing surface of the fish otolith reflect the physical and chemical characteristics of the ambient water, although not necessarily in a simplistic manner. Since fish which spend {{at least part of}} their lives in different water masses often produce otoliths of different elemental composition, the otolith elemental composition (‘elemental fingerprint’) can serve as an environmentally induced tag of groups of fish. On the basis of isotope dilution ICPMS (ID-ICPMS) assays of nearly 2500 dissolved adult cod (Gadus morhua) otoliths, it has become clear that cod otolith elemental fingerprints based on the elements Li, Mg, Mn, Sr and Ba are physically stable, reproducible and consistent between left and right otoliths. Highly significant differences existed among the fingerprints of all of the spawning aggregations, resulting in a characteristic marker for each aggregation. Long-term stability (4 – 13 years) of the fingerprints for a given spawning group was not evident, indicating that the fingerprint was not a proxy for genetic identity. However, the fingerprint was very stable over the short-term (up to 1 year), suggesting that it could serve as a seasonally stable biological tracer, or natural tag, of pre-defined groups of fish, even during situations of extensive stock mixing. As an illustration of the tracer approach, a maximum likelihood-based <b>stock</b> <b>mixture</b> analysis was applied to feeding (summer) and over-wintering stock distributions, using the fingerprints of the spring spawning aggregations as known-stock reference samples. The results of the summer <b>stock</b> <b>mixture</b> analyses suggested that the mixture analysis was accurate within 1 %, while the stock mixtur...|$|R

50|$|The second aspect draws {{heavily from}} George Lakoff's and Mark Johnson's work on concepts. They argued that humans use metaphors {{whenever}} possible to better explain their external world. Humans {{also have a}} <b>basic</b> <b>stock</b> of concepts in which other concepts can be derived from. These basic concepts include spatial orientations such as up, down, front, and back. Humans can understand what these concepts mean because they can directly experience them from their own bodies. For example, because human movement revolves around standing erect and moving the body in an up-down motion, humans innately have these concepts of up and down. Lakoff and Johnson contend this is similar with other spatial orientations such as front and back too. As mentioned earlier, these <b>basic</b> <b>stocks</b> of spatial concepts are the basis in which other concepts are constructed. Happy and sad for instance are seen now as being up or down respectively. When someone says they are feeling down, what they are really saying is that they feel sad for example. Thus {{the point here is}} that true understanding of these concepts is contingent on whether one can have an understanding of the human body. So the argument goes that if one lacked a human body, they could not possibly know what up or down could mean, or how it could relate to emotional states.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2008 I {{developed}} a new technique, DEco-TILLING (an adaptation of Eco-TILLING), to discover useful single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rapidly and inexpensively. Some chum salmon (Oncorhynchus keta) populations have declined in Western Alaska and {{in other areas of}} their geographic range. Possible reasons include climate shifts, by- catch in fisheries, and other perturbations. Genetics offers powerful tools {{that can be used to}} monitor this species on the high seas in <b>stock</b> <b>mixtures</b> aiding management of by- catch identification and other contributors to declines. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are a genetic marker that can be easily and rapidly surveyed on many individuals. Tools like SNPs offer advantages in discriminating <b>stocks</b> in <b>mixtures.</b> However, tens or hundreds of informative SNPs must be discovered from among the millions in the chum salmon genome. Available discovery methods introduce ascertainment bias into this process, which can result in uninformative SNPs or the failure to identify useful ones. I incorporated and improved a genotyping assay to screen SNPs in thousands of individuals for a tenth of the cost of the standard available assay, and improved an assay to resolve the phase of linked SNPs. I show that the SNPs that I discovered are informative and can be use for mixed stock analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to determine if follitropin alfa (recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone; r-hFSH) and lutropin alfa (recombinant human luteinizing hormone; r-hLH) biopotencies were unchanged by reconstituting in sterile water for injection and mixing prior to injection. Methods The biopotencies of r-hFSH and r-hLH were determined following injection of female Sprague-Dawley rats with a mixture of follitropin alfa revised formulation female (RFF) and lutropin alfa (1 : 1, r-hFSH:r-hLH). Biopotencies of follitropin alfa RFF and lutropin alfa were measured using ovarian weight and ascorbic acid depletion assays, respectively, and compared with a reference standard. <b>Stock</b> <b>mixtures</b> of follitropin alfa RFF and lutropin alfa (1 : 1) were prepared within 1 h prior to each respective assay's injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C. Separate low dose (follitropin alfa RFF 1. 5 IU/rat, lutropin alfa 2 IU/rat) and high dose (follitropin alfa RFF 3 IU/rat, lutropin alfa 8 IU/rat) treatments were prepared from <b>stock</b> <b>mixtures</b> or individual solutions by diluting with 0. 22 % bovine serum albumin saline solution and injected within 1 h of preparation. The main outcome measures were ovarian weight and ovarian ascorbic acid depletion. Results FSH bioactivities were similar (p > 0. 10) between the individual follitropin alfa RFF test solution (84. 2 IU) and follitropin alfa RFF/lutropin alfa (87. 6 IU) mixtures prepared within 1 h of injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C. LH bioactivities were similar (p > 0. 10) between lutropin alfa (94. 7 IU) test solution and lutropin alfa/follitropin alfa RFF (85. 3 IU) mixtures prepared within 1 h of injection and stored at 6 +/- 2 °C for not more than 1 h prior to injection. Conclusion Mixing follitropin alfa RFF and lutropin alfa did not alter the bioactivity of either FSH or LH. </p...|$|R
