40|$|Oil and gas {{production}} in the Arctic poses several new challenges that require new solutions. One such {{is the use of}} manned submarines for light intervention tasks. The submarine is completely independent of the surface conditions while adequately submerged, which is their main advantage in the Arctic. This report presents the initial design of an intervention submarine intended for the Shtokman gas condensate field. The vessel is able to perform structural inspection with an ROV and replace smaller subsea components. The vessel is intended for two week missions to the Shtokman field and is designed for operation at depths up to 537 metres. It carries an array of positioning systems originally developed for the military and offshore industry in order to safely transit within, to and from the field. The vessel is completely independent from the surface and other vessels, and do not need specially adapted infrastructure at the field in order to perform the intended tasks. The primary power plant is based on the proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells used in the German Type 212 submarines, while the secondary power source is a large <b>battery</b> <b>rack.</b> The <b>battery</b> <b>rack</b> is large enough to enable the vessel to try to perform repairs on-site before an emergency return on battery power if the primary power source is disabled. The primary power plant is fuelled by pure hydrogen and oxygen. The fuel is stored as cryogenic liquids outside the pressure hull. </p...|$|E

30|$|Therefore, {{the data}} {{available}} for the 5  MWh WEMAG battery-store in Schwerin, Germany have to be scaled up initially {{by a factor of}} 1920 to 9.6  GWh. The battery may lose 20 % of its storage capacity within 20  years (e.g. [41]) due to aging and degradation processes (reflecting its 20 -year warrantee [42]). It will, therefore, be over-dimensioned by 10 %, over-producing in the beginning, and under-producing {{towards the end of the}} life time. Individual battery cells would be replaced gradually, as and when necessary. Hence to provide comparable output on average over the course of its life span, the scaling factor is 2133. It is assumed that the battery solution would be spread over a number of locations, each installation of comparable size to the original installation in Schwerin as it is unlikely that a utility-scale battery 2133 times the size of the installation in Schwerin would be installed in one single location. Therefore, the building housing the <b>battery</b> <b>racks</b> can be scaled up using the same factor as for battery components. Nevertheless, the battery option will be referred to in the singular in the following.|$|R
40|$|Failure of the on-site power {{generators}} concurrent {{with the loss}} of offsite power results in lossof all alternate current power sources. This event is known as station blackout. Electrical power from batteriesis assumed to be available within the plant specific cooping period. Failure to restore alternate power withinthe station blackout cooping period results in loss of all instrumentation and control and consequential coredamage. In this paper the results of the analysis of modification of the direct current power system on the safety of theplant is analyzed and presented. The main modification analyzed in the paper is change of interconnectionswithin the <b>battery</b> <b>rack,</b> introduction of boost converters and different cell technology. Reliability of the newbattery configuration and implications on the safety of the plant are assessed with the probabilistic safety assessmentmodel of the nuclear power plant. The obtained results show that improved reliability is obtained for the new battery system. The improvementof the battery system reliability depends on the proposed modification and reliability of the components. Themain advantages of new battery technologies are discussed. Their application in nuclear power plant is recommended. JRC. G. 10 -Knowledge for Nuclear Security and Safet...|$|E
40|$|Milestone Report No. 1 was {{delivered}} on June 1, 1979 {{and related to}} the conversion of Units 1 - 4. Milestone Report No. 2 describes the conversion of Units 5 - 12 from direct contact condensers which use the iron-catalyst/peroxide/caustic systems to surface condensers and H{sub 2 }S abatement with the Stretford Process Unit. This Report is a 10 week progress report that specifically addresses itself to the differences that are encountered between Units 5 - 6, 7 - 10 and 11 - 12. The task schedule shown in the Summary Section was originally presented to PG and E at the Project Kick-Off Meeting on Monday, April 23. Units 11 and 12 retrofit concept which appears in this report was evaluated with a two pass surface condenser running parallel to the turbine shaft. This concept requires the relocation of the turbine lube oil tank, instrument air compressor and <b>battery</b> storage <b>rack</b> facilities. On Wednesday, June 27, the condenser supplier notified Rogers Engineering that it was feasible to design and install a four pass, two tube bundle condenser at right angle condenser to the turbine-generator shaft. The four pass condenser concept will eliminate the need of relocating equipment sensitive to turbine operation. However, schedule requirements for Milestone Report No. 2 left no time to incorporate {{the benefits of the}} concept they believe will be recommended by Rogers. It will appear in the Final Milestone Report No. 4...|$|R
30|$|With {{emerging}} battery {{needs for}} a vast range of applications, including electric vehicles, {{research and development}} of batteries are currently evolving at a swift pace [16, 17]. Large utility-scale batteries using lithium ion technologies have only emerged recently. They consist {{of a large number of}} <b>battery</b> units on <b>racks</b> filling large halls [18]. They are operated similar to pumped hydropower energy storage, storing energy at times of high availability, and feeding it back into the grid at times of high demand [19]. With efficiencies of over 90 % (e.g. [20, 21]), low memory effect and slow aging [22], lithium-ion batteries represent an appropriate choice for large-scale stationary applications [21, 23]. The particular type of lithium-ion technology considered here are lithium–manganese batteries. The fact that lithium-ion batteries can cope well with partial charging cycles makes them well suited for buffering energy requirements in both directions: reducing excesses and feeding into counteract shortfalls in the system [24]. To allow for operation in the low state of charge zone battery arrays should be over-dimensioned [25].|$|R
