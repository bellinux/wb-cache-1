The letter explained that previously, the Mongols {{had been under}} the impression that the pope was the leader of the Christians, but now they realized that the true power rested with the French monarchy. The letter mentioned Hulagu's intention to capture Jerusalem {{for the benefit of the}} pope, and asked for Louis to send a fleet against Egypt. Hulagu promised the restoration of Jerusalem to the Christians, but also still insisted on Mongol sovereignty, in the Mongols' quest for conquering the world. It is unclear whether or not King Louis actually received the letter, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> it was transmitted to Pope Urban, who answered in a similar way as his predecessors. In his papal bull Exultavit cor nostrum, Urban congratulated Hulagu on his expression of goodwill towards the Christian faith, and encouraged him to convert to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Theodore himself {{remained}} in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially {{he was treated}} with honour, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> during his captivity {{he was accused of}} plotting against John Asen and blinded as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused to carry out the blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.|$|E
5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E

A set of user interviews, together with walkthroughs of existing Web sites of some e-commerce service providers, were conducted in all these three countries, in order to track down how cultural variation might affect users' perception of computer security, as well as their trusting behaviour. The outcome of the study is an understanding that cultural variation indeed {{plays a major role in}} trust-forming, and that the online behaviour of the users representing these three Nordic countries was to <b>some</b> extent similar, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> quite dissimilar to one another. 1...|$|R

40|$|Consider a space X {{with the}} {{singular}} locus, Z=Sing(X), of positive dimension. Suppose both Z and X are locally complete intersections. The transversal type of X along Z is generically constant <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>points</b> of Z it degenerates. We introduce (under certain conditions) the discriminant of the transversal type, a subscheme of Z, that reflects these degenerations whenever the generic transversal type is `ordinary'. The scheme structure of this discriminant is imposed by various compatibility properties {{and is often}} non-reduced. We establish the basic properties of this discriminant: it is a Cartier divisor in Z, functorial under base change, flat under some deformations of (X,Z), and compatible with pullback under some morphisms, etc. Furthermore, we study the local geometry of this discriminant, e. g. we compute its multiplicity at a point, and we obtain the resolution of its structure sheaf (as module on Z) and study the locally defining equation...|$|R
25|$|Birkett {{lived in}} the house for some time, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> moved out, leaving it vacant. By {{the time of his death}} in 1916, the {{structure}} was in very poor condition. After Birkett's death, the property was purchased by Dr. Charles G. Crumrine, a physician from Detroit whose health was failing and who wished to retire to the country. Crumrine moved into Gordon Hall in 1919, repairing the structure and adding a new roof. He ran the property for some time as a farm, but was soon overcome by illness and died in 1924. Crumrine willed the property to his son, Charles Jr. The younger Crumrine rented out portions of the house, but then allowed it to go vacant for many years, and again fall into disrepair. In 1934, the Historic American Buildings Survey project documented the building, taking photographs and making drawings of the exterior.|$|E
25|$|Wesley Church {{is built}} of {{load-bearing}} brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church {{has a strong}} verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to {{the walls of the}} building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.|$|E
25|$|Ashurbanipal sent an army {{against them}} in 667 BC that {{defeated}} the Nubian king Taharqa, near Memphis, while Ashurbanipal stayed at his capital in Nineveh. At the same time some Egyptian vassals rebelled and were also defeated. All of the vanquished leaders save one were sent to Nineveh. Only Necho I, the native Egyptian Prince of Sais, convinced the Assyrians of his loyalty and {{was sent back to}} become the Assyrian puppet Pharaoh of Egypt. After the death of Taharqa in 664 BC his nephew and successor Tantamani invaded Upper Egypt and took control of Thebes. In Memphis he defeated the native Egyptian princes and Necho may have died in the battle. Another army was sent by Ashurbanipal and again it succeeded in defeating the Kushites/Nubians. Tantamani was routed and driven back to his homeland in Nubia and was never again to threaten Assyria or Egypt. The Assyrians plundered Thebes and took much booty home with them. How Assyrian rule in Egypt ended is not certain, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> Necho's son Psammetichus I gained independence while wisely keeping his relations with Assyria friendly.|$|E

Trustees included two signers of the Declaration of Independence, as well as bankers, merchants, and reverends. The faculty was composed of notable figures like Noah Webster Jr. of Webster Dictionaries. Its first campus was located {{on the east side}} of Fourth Street and was directed by Rev. John Andrews, D.D., the Academy's first headmaster. However, when Dr. Andrews and several of faculty members left to teach at the University of Pennsylvania in 1798, The Episcopal Academy was reconstituted as a free school.
