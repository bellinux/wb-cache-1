50|$|Once {{a current}} account has been opened with a new bank or {{building}} society, the Current <b>Account</b> <b>Switch</b> Service will transfer all the activity relating to the old account to the new one. That includes moving incoming and outgoing payments, and transferring the account balance, as well as closing the old account. An important feature of the service is that though the process happens over seven working days, the transfer of account happens on the final day. This means that customers continue to use the old <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> until the agreed switch day {{and from then on}} use the new <b>bank</b> <b>account.</b> This means that there is no loss of service for any period for the customer.|$|R

40|$|I use an {{electronic}} transfer mandate in the UK Child Benefit program, a transfer received by virtually all families with children, {{to estimate the}} effect of <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> ownership on the financial behavior of less educated families with children.

When a less educated family becomes an owner of a <b>bank</b> <b>account,</b> I find a 71 percentage point increase in the probability of owning a credit card, an increase of 1. 4 household durable goods, and no change in vehicle ownership or purchase. Although I find that <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> ownership does not affect the mean level of financial assets, I do find evidence suggestive of an increase in {{the top half of the}} financial asset distribution which indicates that there may be heterogeneity in the savings response to owning a <b>bank</b> <b>account.</b> Overall, my findings suggest that the most important benefit of owning a <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> is access to credit and requiring lower income families to own a <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> will not reverse their low average savings levels in the short run...|$|R
