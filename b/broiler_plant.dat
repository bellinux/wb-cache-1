40|$|The rapid {{development}} of {{agriculture in the}} twentieth century and aviculture in particular, has made the problem of <b>broiler</b> <b>plant</b> wastes utilization evident. It is obvious that the dumping of the <b>broiler</b> <b>plant</b> wastes is not a solution of this problem. In the modern world, more and more advanced technologies are being developed and implemented to reduce the level of the pollutant emissions in the environment. Such technologies are also presented in Ukraine, although their number is insufficient. In the Ukrainian agriculture one of the greatest <b>broiler</b> <b>plant</b> wastes’ producers are poultry plants. According to the experts’ estimations, the dumping of the poultry plant wastes from the Ukrainian poultry plants per year is: the dumping of the dung of natural humidity is about 5, 2 million tons, the dumping of the perished poultry is 50, 000 tons, the dumping of incubation wastes is 12, 000 tons as well as the dumping of slaughtering wastes is 210, 000 tons. The general effect constituents of economic mechanism of the nonwaste production introduction, as well as economic, social and ecological effects which reflect the circumstances of the nonwaste production introduction that should be taken into consideration, have been analyzed. The economic effect includes the following effects, such as the economiceffect of waste processing into biogas; the economic effect of waste processinginto biofertilizers; the economic effect of waste processing into forage admixtures;and cost saving due to the substituting for the mixed fodder by forage admixtures. The social effect lies in the provision of agricultural enterprises and households with cheap and high-quality fertilizers. It shows the possibility of realization of poultry plant wastes as biofertilizers or forage admixtures. The ecological effect is expressed by the reducing the level of the pollutant emissions in the environment. This will lead to the reduced number of fines for environmental pollution. The general effect is calculated by the determination of the enterprise gross receipts by the factors of 1, 5 and 2 on the condition that the factors of influence are permanent...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Campylobacter {{is a human}} {{pathogen}} com-monly found on live broilers and processed carcasses.

40|$|Between 2002 and 2006, the {{feasibility}} of a regional chain for sustainable production of poultry meat is studied. The study is initiated by a company, owned by a family of broiler growers (Kuijpers Kip) and is financed by the Ministry of agriculture, nature management and fisheries and the Ministry of transport, public works and water management. Representatives of the Dutch poultry business, non-governmental organizations and knowledge organizations engineered the study. The goal {{of this study was}} to design a concept for a regional and sustainable production chain for poultry meat and meat products, and to judge its feasibility. The study was divided in two phases. During the fist phase, alternative scenarios for poultry meat production are designed, and for all scenarios technical, economical, legal, organizational and commercial feasibility, social acceptation, animal welfare and environmental effects (with attention for transport effects) are explored. Four alternative scenarios for broiler production and three different slaughtering and processing scenarios are designed. In the alternative broiler production scenarios, the last three days of the incubation and the hatching don¿t take place at a hatchery but at the <b>broiler</b> <b>plant.</b> After 18 days of incubation, the eggs are placed in litter on the floor or on a battery. In the four different scenarios the time on the battery was 0, 10, 18 or 42 days, respectively. The slaughtering and processing and scenario¿s were: slaughtering and processing at the poultry farm; slaughtering at the farm (mobile slaughtering plant) and processing in a traditional processing company, and slaughtering and processing in a traditional poultry processing plant. During the second phase, the scenario `physical short chain¿ is studied in detail. In this physical short chain, the hatching process, broiling and slaughtering are concentrated at one large poultry plant. After slaughtering the carcasses are transported to a processing company, but the farmer directs the process. Therefore he is responsible for the total process and for the final product. Tests and calculations concerning production of the poultry, costs for slaughter, marketing, and reduction of transport costs indicate that the physical short chain is economical practicable. Reduction of transport for day-old chicks and matured chickens is about 400. 000 km/year for this company...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 31 - 35). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Several alternative sampling methods have been recently evaluated for detection of Salmonella on broiler carcasses during commercial processing. The present study evaluated and compared four sampling techniques: carcass rinse, vent skin flap sampling, thoracic skin flap sampling, and the FSIS approved sponge method in a turkey processing plant. Carcass rinse was consistently and significantly superior to tested alternatives for the detection of Salmonella in this plant. Salmonella recovery using the carcass rinse technique on split flocks at the re-hang area from 2 different scald systems suggested that countercurrent water flow improved the microbiological quality when temperatures were similar. However, elevations of the concurrent scald tank temperature eliminated the apparent benefit of directional flow. In contrast to most previously-reported observations in <b>broiler</b> processing <b>plants,</b> overall Salmonella recovery did not increase during processing and a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower overall recovery incidence from 4 flocks was observed immediately pre-chill as compared to post-feather removal. Also in contrast to previously-reported data from <b>broiler</b> processing <b>plants,</b> overall Salmonella recovery incidence in the turkey ceca was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in the crop in 9 flocks evaluated. These data suggest that microbiological investigations to determine plant-specific critical control points in turkey plants are warranted prior to implementation of intervention strategies. After evaluation of turkey processing, we evaluated broiler carcasses in a commercial <b>broiler</b> processing <b>plant</b> for Salmonella incidence on carcasses that had been passed or retained by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) with regard to visible fecal or ingesta contamination. Contaminated and non-contaminated carcasses were removed from the processing line at the site of FSIS inspection (pre-immersion chilling) and subjected to the carcass rinse sampling procedure for Salmonella incidence recovery. Broiler flocks were evaluated over a 2 day period. Although a numerical association of increasing Salmonella recovery with visible contamination was observed, no significant (P < 0. 05) differences in Salmonella recovery incidence were identified in any single flock or combined data when evaluated. These data suggest that focus on organoleptic parameters of inspection may result in disappointing microbiologic improvements in broiler carcass quality...|$|R

40|$|Testing and scheduling” {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a strategy for control of Campylobacter in broiler meat. By this strategy, flocks with high numbers of Campylobacter in fecal samples would be diverted away from fresh meat production {{at the entrance of}} the <b>broiler</b> meat processing <b>plant.</b> Risk assessment studies suggest that this would effectively decrease human health risks, if these flocks are responsible for the meat products with the highest Campylobacter numbers. To investigate the effect of this control strategy, the numbers of Campylobacter were determined in fecal samples from transport containers, and in cecal and breast meat samples from birds in 62 broiler chicken flocks. Results from direct plating and enrichment were combined by a statistical method that allows the inclusion of censored data. As the implementation of “testing and scheduling” requires a rapid on-site test to detect high numbers of Campylobacter, a lateral flow immuno-assay (LFA) was developed and applied to the fecal samples collected from containers. The Campylobacter prevalence in broiler flocks in the autumn of 2007 was found to be 85. 4 % by traditional microbiological methods. Campylobacter could be isolated from breast meat samples from 42 % of the flocks. There was limited agreement between Campylobacter results for the three types of samples and weak correlation between the quantitative results for fecal or cecal samples and meat samples. Agreement between the results of LFA and traditional methods was poor. These findings do not support the implementation of “testing and scheduling” as a practical control strategy, because of both measurement uncertainties and shortcomings in understanding the dynamics of transmission and survival of Campylobacter in the <b>broiler</b> meat processing <b>plant.</b> The limited correlation between Campylobacter contamination of cecal samples and breast meat samples, as observed in this study, suggests that cecal samples are no good indicator for human exposure to Campylobacter...|$|R

Numerical analysis of combined HindIII and EcoRI ribopatterns of these isolates resulted in species-specific clusters that were congruent with the clusters obtained by both DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit A (rpoA) and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase α chain (pheS) housekeeping gene analyses. In the analyses, a group of five isolates distinct from any known enterococcal species clustered together. The five isolates were positioned in the Enterococcus avium group, with E. devriesei being the closest phylogenetic neighbor. The DNA-DNA hybridization levels with E. devriesei ranged from 28. 8 to 54. 3 % and indicated that these strains represented a novel species. The name Enterococcus viikkiensis sp. nov. is proposed, with strain DSM 24043 T (LMG 26075 T) being the type strain.

One day old broiler chickens were randomly divided into seven groups (twenty chickens each) and were reared under similar conditions. The chickens received either normal diet not containing the root powder or were fed a diet containing one or two percents root powder. Chickens were weighed every five days until the age of fifty. Statistical comparison of average body weights in each group showed that chickens in group two (fed the diet containing 1 % root powder from day one) were significantly (P < 0. 05) heavier than the birds in the control group. It is suggested that the effect of active ingredients of the plant be examined in this respect in the future work. Key words: Berberis vulgaris, chickens, growth promote...|$|R

However, it is but not yet known that the best optimum level of meniran plant powder given effect on small intestine microflora of broiler. The {{purpose of this study}} was to find the best level of meniran powder that used to inhibited the growth of small intestine microfora (lactad acid bacteria and Eschirichia coli). This study consist of 4 treatments which were (P 0 = Antibiotic 100 %, P 1 = meniran powder 0 %, P 2 = meniran powder 0, 8 % and P 3 = meniran powder 1, 2 %). Variable tested in this study wereLAB and Eschirichia coli. Nested Completely Randomized Design method used and if there was a different effect, it would tested by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. The result of the research indicated that meniran plant powder had a not significant effect (P> 0. 05) on small intestine microflora of broiler (BAL dan Escherichia coli). It was noted that supplementation meniran plant powder at level of 0, 8 % gave the best effect on the small intestine microflora...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} three 12 -week {{in-plant}} trials were conducted in three USDA-inspected <b>broiler</b> processing facilities (<b>Plants</b> A, B, and C) to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of Cecure (cetylpyridinium chloride or CPC) as a pre-chill whole carcass spray treatment for continuous on-line reprocessing of poultry. The trials were designed to evaluate the microbial effects of treating inspection-held, “visibly contaminated” carcasses in accordance with USDA guidelines for proposed continuous on-line reprocessing trials. Treatment of this group of carcasses was necessary to determine whether Cecure could be utilized {{as an integral part}} of a plant’s on-line reprocessing procedures for carcasses accidentally contaminated with digestive tract contents. During each of the three 12 -week trials, carcasses were collected on 20 sampling days. On each sampling day, within each plant, four groups of carcasses (n= 10) were collected including visibly clean, inspection-passed carcasses; visibly contaminated, inspection-held carcasses; visibly contaminated carcasses after Cecure treatment; and, visibly contaminated carcasses after traditional off-line reprocessing (manual washing with 20 ppm chlorinated water). All carcasses were microbiologically evaluated for aerobic plate count (APC), Escherichia coli (E. coli), total coliform, incidence and level of Campylobacter, and incidence of Salmonella. Treatment of visibly contaminated carcasses with Cecure, in comparison to the other three groups of carcasses, significantly (P< 0. 0001) reduced APC by 2. 5 to 3. 9 logs...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effects of raw, cooked, toasted and defatted melon seeds on performance characteristics and mineral retention of <b>broiler</b> chickens. The <b>plant</b> seeds were fed to the birds at 15 % level. A total of 200 day old broiler chicks of the Marshall strain were randomly allocated to five dietary groups in a completely randomized design. The experiment lasted for five weeks. Feed intake was similar between birds fed the control diet and those fed cooked melon seeds, but significantly reduced in birds fed raw melon seed. Body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion efficiency (FCE) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) were higher in birds fed cooked melon seeds, but significantly reduced in the birds fed raw and defatted melon seeds respectively. Birds fed on toasted melon seeds however ranked next to those fed on cooked melon seeds in BWG, FCE and PER values respectively. Nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus and iron retention were markedly reduced in birds fed on raw melon seeds. Phosphorus and iron retention were however similar between those fed on toasted and defatted melon seeds respectively. Over all, the best significant improvements in the response indices were obtained in birds fed on cooked melon seeds as the birds fed on the diet competed favorably with the control group. it is therefore recommended that cooked melon seeds are best incorporated into diets of broiler chickens...|$|R

The <b>plant</b> concentrate was formulated from faba bean 42 %, cowpea 29. 98 %, pigeon pea 15 % and alfalfa meal 5 %, lysine 0. 8 %, methionine 0. 72 %, calcium 6 % and vitamin premix 0. 5 %, respectively. Two hundred unsexed broiler chicks (Cobb) were used. Four dietary treatments containing 0 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 % plant concentrate were formulated to meet the nutrients requirements as outlined by NRC (1994). The {{experiment was}} in a Completely Randomize Design (CRD), 50 birds per treatment with five replication 10 bird/ replicate. The study lasted for six weeks. Parameters measured was feed intake, body weight gain, Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR), pre-slaughter weight, dressing percentage protein efficiency, some blood parameters (glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, total lipid, total protein, calcium, inorganic phosphorus) and feed cost. Result indicated that dietary inclusion of plant concentrate had significantly (p 0. 05) on weight gain, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency and dressing percentage.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2009 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 27, 28, and 29, 2009 Athens, Georgia. In 2007, Georgia poultry {{processors}} slaughtered over 1. 3 billion broilers (14. 4 % of U. S. production) in 21 {{processing plants}} across the state. Commercial <b>broiler</b> processing <b>plants</b> use {{an average of}} 6. 9 gallons of potable water per bird, with most plants falling in the 5 - 10 gallon range. Thus in 2007 alone, Georgia poultry processors used approximately 9 billion gallons of water. Much of this water is used for scalding, chilling, bird washing, and plant sanitation. The water is also the primary means by which offal (inedible solids) is transported out of the various processing areas for collection and separation from wastewater. Recent severe drought conditions in Georgia and {{the adoption of the}} Georgia Statewide Comprehensive Water Plan (with subsequent development of the Water Conservation Implementation Plan) have placed new emphasis on water conservation by traditional industrial users. To meet these new demands while maintaining or in many cases increasing production, Georgia poultry processors have turned to innovative water reuse systems that maximize water use efficiency while maintaining strict food safety requirements. Current systems utilized by poultry processors are presented with advantages and disadvantages of each explored. A case study is presented showing the decision making process employed by the plant management team in water reuse technology selection. Results and impact of the water reuse system are also presented. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S. Geological Survey, Georgia Water Science Center U. S.

40|$|In 1993, the USDA {{approved}} {{the use of}} on-line reprocessing which allows poultry carcasses that are accidentally contaminated, during the evisceration process, with digestive tract contents {{to remain on the}} processing line if an approved antimicrobial process is in place. Prior to allowance for on-line reprocessing, contaminated carcasses had to be transferred to a salvage line where they were manually rinsed and cleaned with chlorinated water. In accordance with USDA guidelines, all on-line reprocessing procedures must result in pre-chill poultry carcasses of equal or improved microbiological quality in comparison to carcasses that are visibly clean. The objective of the following study was to demonstrate the efficacy of the Precure™ (Safe Foods Corporation, N. Little Rock, AR) antimicrobial as an effective on-line reprocessing treatment. Precure™ is listed as a solution of GRAS acids for use by FDA and is listed as a safe and suitable ingredient by USDA for use on poultry. In this study, fully automated Precure™ application systems were installed in three USDA-inspected broiler processing facilities. Visibly clean, uncontaminated carcasses (control group) and visibly contaminated Precure™-treated (pH = 1. 5) carcasses were sampled (400 mL Butterfield’s Phosphate Diluent) on-site prior to immersion chilling and were shipped on ice and overnight to MCA Services (Rogers, AR) for microbiological evaluation. Upon arrival at the laboratory (Escherichia coli using Petrifilm™ 3. The lower detection level for all groups of organisms was 1 colony forming unit per mL. There were no differences in the levels of any of the groups of organisms between the control group (visibly clean, uncontaminated, n= 345) and the visibly contaminated carcasses that had been treated with Precure™ on-line (n= 354). The mean bacterial counts for the two groups of carcasses (control vs. Precure™-treated on-line reprocessed) were as follows: 3. 7 vs. 3. 6 logs for Aerobic Plate Count, 2. 4 vs. 2. 4 logs for coliforms and 2. 4 vs. 2. 3 logs for E. coli. Thus, in three commercially operated USDA-inspected <b>broiler</b> processing <b>plants,</b> the Precure™ antimicrobial treatment was microbiologically effective, and subsequently approved by the USDA, for the on-line reprocessing of broilers in poultry slaughter facilities nationwide. These studies clearly demonstrate that the Precure™ antimicrobial is a very effective and low cost means for the on-line reprocessing of broilers...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{isolated from}} marinated or non-marinated, {{modified atmosphere packaged}} (MAP) broiler leg products and air samples of a large-scale <b>broiler</b> meat processing <b>plant</b> were identified and analyzed for their phenotypic properties. Previously, these strains had {{been found to be}} coccal LAB. However, the use of a 16 and 23 S rRNA gene RFLP database had not resulted in species identification because none of the typically meat-associated LAB type strains had clustered together with these strains in the numerical analysis of the RFLP patterns. To establish the taxonomic position of these isolates, 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, numerical analysis of ribopatterns, and DNA–DNA hybridization experiments were done. The 16 S rRNA gene sequences of three isolates possessed the highest similarities (over 99 %) with the sequence of S. parauberis type strain. However, in the numerical analysis of HindIII ribopatterns, the type strain did not cluster together with these isolates. Reassociation values between S. parauberis type or reference strain and the strains studied varied from 82 to 97 %, confirming that these strains belong to S. parauberis. Unexpectedly, most of the broiler meat-originating strains studied for their phenotypical properties did not utilize lactose at all and the same strains fermented also galactose very weakly, properties considered atypical for S. parauberis. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of lactose negative S. parauberis strains and also the first report associating S. parauberis with broiler slaughter and meat products. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Some psychrotrophic {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) are specific meat spoilage organisms in modified-atmosphere-packaged (MAP), cold-stored meat products. To determine if incoming broilers or the production plant environment {{is a source of}} spoilage LAB, a total of 86, 122, and 447 LAB isolates from <b>broiler</b> carcasses, production <b>plant</b> air, and MAP broiler products, respectively, were characterized using a library of HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of the 16 and 23 S rRNA genes as operational taxonomic units in numerical analyses. Six hundred thirteen LAB isolates from the total of 655 clustered in 29 groups considered to be species specific. Sixty-four percent of product isolates clustered either with Carnobacterium divergens or with Carnobacterium maltaromaticum type strains. The third major product-associated cluster (17 % of isolates) was formed by unknown LAB. Representative strains from these three clusters were analyzed for the phylogeny of their 16 S rRNA genes. This analysis verified that the two largest RFLP clusters consisted of carnobacteria and showed that the unknown LAB group consisted of Lactococcus spp. No product-associated LAB were detected in broiler carcasses sampled at the beginning of slaughter, whereas carnobacteria and lactococci, along with some other specific meat spoilage LAB, were recovered from processing plant air at many sites. This study reveals that incoming broiler chickens are not major sources of psychrotrophic spoilage LAB, whereas the detection of these organisms from the air of the processing environment highlights the role of processing facilities as sources of LAB contamination...|$|R
