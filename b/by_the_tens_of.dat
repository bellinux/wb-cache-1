5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E

25|$|The CIIDH {{database}} documented 18,000 killings {{by government}} {{forces in the}} year 1982. In April 1982 alone (General Efraín Ríos Montt's first full month in office), the military committed 3,330 documented killings, a rate of approximately 111 per day. Historians and analysts estimate the total death toll could exceed this number <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands.

25|$|To {{develop it}} into {{sugarcane}} plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from Africa. Sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of French Canada, a vast territory, had numbered 65,000. The whites were vastly outnumbered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands of African slaves they had imported {{to work on}} their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one.|$|E

25|$|Perez {{had once}} chaired the {{powerful}} Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee, in which capacity in 1948 {{he threatened to}} deprive senatorial candidate Russell B. Long of the official title of Democratic nominee. Such a move would have denied Long {{a place on the}} Democratic column, the ticket headed with the traditional rooster emblem, which was automatically supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands of white Louisiana voters at the time. The Democratic Party had the only competitive races. Perez toyed with passing the official Democratic mantle to the Republican senatorial nominee, Clem S. Clarke, a Shreveport oilman. Only a deal with Governor Earl Kemp Long kept Long's nephew, Russell Long, on the regular Democratic ticket in Louisiana. The result was that Russell Long began a 38-year tenure in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} attention received by Dyer's anti-lynching bill and speaking campaign {{may have helped}} reduce lynchings in the South. Lynchings per year dropped in four years, from 60 in 1918 to 57 in 1922. More significantly, the Great Migration was underway, and black workers <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands were leaving the South for Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, for jobs, education, {{and a chance to}} escape Jim Crow laws and violence. By 1934, when the Costigan-Wagner anti-lynching bill was introduced, lynchings had dropped to 15 per year. In 1935 and 1938, Senator Borah repeated his constitutional arguments against the bill; he added that he believed such legislation was no longer needed, because the rate of lynchings had fallen so dramatically. By 1940, 1.5 million blacks had left the South in the Great Migration. Another five million left from 1940–1970.|$|E

Some abolitionists accused Sherman of doing little to alleviate the precarious living conditions of the freed slaves. To address this issue, on January 12, 1865, Sherman met in Savannah with Secretary of War Stanton and with twenty local black leaders.

500|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1849, word of the Gold Rush had spread around the world, and an overwhelming number of gold-seekers and merchants began to arrive from virtually every continent. The largest group of forty-niners in 1849 were Americans, arriving <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands overland across the continent and along various sailing routes (the name [...] "forty-niner" [...] {{was derived from the}} year 1849). Many from the East Coast negotiated a crossing of the Appalachian Mountains, taking to riverboats in Pennsylvania, poling the keelboats to Missouri River wagon train assembly ports, and then travelling in a wagon train along the California Trail. Many others came by way of the Isthmus of Panama and the steamships of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Australians and New Zealanders picked up the news from ships carrying Hawaiian newspapers, and thousands, infected with [...] "gold fever", boarded ships for California.|$|E

[...] That evening Trưởng ordered a retreat to a new defense line at the My Chanh River, thereby ceding all of Quảng Trị Province to the North Vietnamese. He was confident that his forces could hold Huế, but he was then astounded by a late afternoon message from the president that now ordered [...] "that because of inability to simultaneously defend all three enclaves, the I Corps commander was free...to redeploy his forces {{for the defense of}} Da Nang only."

[...] The low mintage for the series was the 1926-S, at 970,000— the only date-mint combination with a mintage of less than 1 million. [...] The second lowest mintage for the series came with the 1931 nickel struck at the San Francisco Mint. The 1931-S was minted in a quantity of 194,000 early in the year. There was no need for more to be struck, but Acting Mint Director Mary Margaret O'Reilly asked the San Francisco Mint to strike more so that the pieces would not be hoarded. [...] Using materials on hand, including the melting down of worn-out nickels, San Francisco found enough metal to strike 1,000,000more pieces. Large quantities were saved in the hope they would become valuable, and the coin is not particularly rare today despite the low mintage.|$|E

[...] Elite crossbowmen were also valued as long-range snipers; such was the case when the Liao general Xiao Talin was picked off by a Song crossbow at the Battle of Shanzhou in 1004. [...] Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, {{such as the use of}} a mulberry wood and brass crossbow in 1068 that could pierce a tree at 140 paces. [...] Song cavalry used an array of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, and fire lances that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel. In preparation for war, government armories manufactured weapons in enormous quantities, with tens of millions of arrowheads crafted each year, along with armor components <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands. There were sixteen known varieties of catapults in the Song period, designed to fit many different proportions and requiring work crews in sizes ranging from dozens to several hundred men.|$|E

2500|$|During the Byzantine era, Jerusalem was {{primarily}} Christian and pilgrims came <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> thousands {{to experience the}} places where Jesus walked.

The Byzantine ban on the Jews was lifted and they were allowed to live inside the city and visit the places of worship. Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount area. The war between Seljuqs and Byzantine Empire and increasing Muslim violence against Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem instigated the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1104.
