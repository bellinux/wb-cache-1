5|$|Although {{some of its}} {{stones were}} plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard {{remained}} largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge across the valley. In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uzès the right to levy tolls on those using the <b>bridge.</b> <b>The</b> right later passed to the Bishops of Uzès. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the bridge in good repair. However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the <b>bridge,</b> <b>the</b> duke had {{one side of the}} second row of arches cut away to a depth of about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide enough to accommodate carts and cannons, but severely weakened the bridge in the process.|$|E

In 1894, the Runcorn to Latchford Canal was replaced by the Manchester Ship Canal, and {{the northern part of}} the estate could only be accessed by a swing <b>bridge.</b> <b>The</b> Brooke family left the house in 1921, and it was almost completely demolished in 1928.
