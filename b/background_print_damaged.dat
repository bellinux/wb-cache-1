50|$|DOS {{is not a}} {{multitasking}} operating system. DOS did however {{provide a}} Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) function which allowed programs to remain resident in memory. These programs could hook the system timer and/or keyboard interrupts to allow themselves to run tasks in the background or to be invoked at any time preempting the current running program effectively implementing a simple form of multitasking on a program-specific basis.

40|$|<b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>Print</b> {{media are}} {{a major source of}} health information. OBJECTIVES To analyse press {{coverage}} related to skin cancer prevention. METHODS We conducted a content analysis of print media articles pertaining to skin cancer prevention, solaria and vitamin D published in Germany and Switzerland over a 1 -year period between 2012 and 2013. RESULTS Overall, 2, 103 articles were analysed. Applying sunscreen was by far the most common sun protection recommendation. A considerable number of articles on solaria and vitamin D advocated exposure to ultraviolet radiation to enhance physical appearance and vitamin D photosynthesis, often without mentioning any precaution measures. In total, 26. 8 % of the articles contained misleading or erroneous statements mostly related to sunscreen use and vitamin D issues. CONCLUSIONS Print media can serve as powerful education tools to foster skin cancer prevention. However, misleading or erroneous reports may negatively impact sun-safe behaviour. © 2015 S.

40|$|In his 1971 short film, (nostalgia), American {{artist and}} writer Hollis Frampton oveturned the {{conventional}} narrative roles {{of words and}} images. In his account of an artists's transformation from photographer to filmmaker, Frampton burns photographs he had taken and selected from his past along with one found photograph. A calm voice tells a story about an image, but the story is about the following image, not the one shown. Confounding comprehension still further, the narration begins and ends during the photograph's combustion; smoke and ashes get in our eyes while {{we are trying to}} make sense of the image and the narration—trying to remember the story that fits the image, trying to remember the image that fits the story [...] . Frampton's (nostalgia) is a formal masterpiece, long overlooked and understudied. It emerges from a body of film work that is rarely screened, the <b>prints</b> <b>damaged</b> and difficult to locate. Frampton's work is valued in artist filmmaking and film theory circles, but it has never taken its rightful place at the heart of modern art theory. This study will introduce a new generation to a critical moment in art history—when (nostalgia) confirmed both the essence and fragility of cinema itself...|$|R
