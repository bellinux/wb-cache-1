2500|$|Because locally convex {{spaces are}} topological spaces {{as well as}} vector spaces, the natural {{functions}} to consider between two locally convex spaces are continuous linear maps.

2500|$|By {{the first}} and {{eventually}} the second Hausdorff countability axioms the considered spaces were gradually further specialized. A large class of spaces satisfying the countable first axiom are metric spaces. They were introduced in 1906 by Fréchet under the name [...] "classes (E)". The term [...] "metric space" [...] comes from Hausdorff. In Principles, he developed the theory of metric spaces and systematically enriched it {{through a series of}} new concepts: Hausdorff metric, complete, total <b>boundedness,</b> -connectivity, reducible sets. Fréchets work had been little noticed; only through Hausdorff's Principles did metric spaces become the common property of the mathematician.|$|E

For infinity, the result is a corollary of the uniform <b>boundedness</b> principle.|$|E
2500|$|However, the Fourier {{series of}} a {{continuous}} function need not converge pointwise. Perhaps the easiest proof [...] uses the non-boundedness of Dirichlet's kernel in L1(T) and the Banach–Steinhaus uniform <b>boundedness</b> principle. As typical for existence arguments invoking the Baire category theorem, this proof is nonconstructive. It {{shows that the}} family of continuous functions whose Fourier series converges at a given x is of first Baire category, in the Banach space of continuous functions on the circle. So in some sense pointwise convergence is atypical, and for most continuous functions the Fourier series does not converge at a given point. However Carleson's theorem shows that for a given continuous function the Fourier series converges almost everywhere.|$|E
