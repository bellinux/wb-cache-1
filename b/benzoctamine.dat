5000|$|<b>Benzoctamine</b> (Tacitin) - a tetracyclic {{compound}} and {{is closely related}} to maprotiline, with the two compounds differing only in the length of their side chain, but <b>benzoctamine</b> is not used as an antidepressant and is instead used as an anxiolytic ...|$|E
50|$|In a {{study used}} to compare <b>benzoctamine</b> to sodium amylobarbitone as a sleep promoter, {{it was found that}} during {{administration}} of both drugs, patients reported that their sleep was less restless, and drowsiness was diminished. The study further showed that while sodium amylobarbitone caused withdrawal rebound symptoms, <b>benzoctamine</b> did not. It was also found that <b>benzoctamine</b> reduced plasma corticosteroid hormone levels. There is a relationship between anxiety and adreno-corticosteroid activity, with raised levels commonly being reported as an indication of stress. The study showed that <b>benzoctamine,</b> a drug reported to reduce anxiety, was also able to reduce the hormones that potentially cause it. This points to a phenomenon often seen within pharmacology where drugs intended for other uses often have far-reaching and rarely considered effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzoctamine,</b> {{like other}} psychoactive drugs {{has the ability}} to potentiate the effects of other drugs. However, a motor skill study looking at benzoctamine's {{capacity}} to potentiate the inhibitory effects of alcohol showed no significant decreases in motor skill function due to <b>benzoctamine</b> being administered with alcohol.|$|E
50|$|There {{are usually}} many risks {{associated}} with using sedatives on patients who are suffering from respiratory failure, which has {{made it difficult to}} administer tranquillizing medications in situations when they are desirable. It is not known why this drug is safe and its benzodiazepine cousins are not, but a possible explanation for this phenomenon might come from its similarity in structure to tricyclic antidepressants, which have also been shown to not cause respiratory failure. While further experimentation is necessary, this study points to <b>benzoctamine’s</b> possible consideration for sedation in respiratory failure patients.|$|R
50|$|While <b>benzoctamine</b> {{was made}} to be an {{alternative}} to the benzodiazepine line of anxiolytic drugs, other uses for the drug have been discovered. Due to benzoctamine's ability to tranquilize without causing respiratory depression, scientists are moving forward with studies that test its sedative effects in patients with respiratory failure. In one study that used <b>benzoctamine</b> in a clinical setting, researchers showed that the use of <b>benzoctamine</b> for sedation did not result in changes in forced expiratory volume in one second or carbon dioxide partial pressure PCO2. This confirmed previous statements that claimed the drug did not cause respiratory failure. The main goal of this clinical study was to confirm the findings of another study that showed <b>benzoctamine</b> did not reduce CO2 responsiveness, but instead increased the ventilatory response to CO2.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: <b>Benzoctamine</b> vs. {{chlordiazepoxide}} in serotonin turnover ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 4: <b>Benzoctamine</b> vs. {{chlordiazepoxide}} in {{anxiety neurosis}} ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Benzoctamine</b> {{has been}} found to have the same {{efficacy}} as chlordiazepoxide when treating anxiety neurosis ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzoctamine</b> can be {{injected}} {{directly into}} the blood or given as tablets. When given as tablets, it is given in doses of 10 mg three times daily. And when given intravenously, patients are given the drug {{at a rate of}} 5 mg/minute until 20-40 mg of drug has been injected. <b>Benzoctamine</b> can be analyzed as the 3H acetyl derivative and N-methyl metabolite it gets broken down into using radioactive analysis. <b>Benzoctamine</b> has a half-life of 2-3 hours, with a bioavailability of 100% when given intravenously and around > 90% when given orally. The average time to achieve peak plasma concentrations is 1 hour and the volume of distribution for a 70 kg person is 1-2 l/kg.|$|E
50|$|Benzoctamine’s main {{clinical}} use {{is for the}} treatment of anxiety, and evidence points to it being as effective as other clinical anxiety drugs, in particular diazepam. In the treatment of symptoms of mild anxiety due to psychoneurosis, a daily dosage of 30 to 80 g of <b>benzoctamine</b> was shown to be just as effective as 6-20 mg of diazepam. In another study one group of patients were given 10g of <b>benzoctamine</b> three times a day, while another group was given 5 mg of diazepam, and the treatments were equivalent. While these studies point to higher doses of <b>benzoctamine</b> being needed to exert the same pharmacological effects, the drug is still popular because of its ability to act as an anxiolytic without producing the common respiratory depression associated with other sedative drugs. Some studies have even shown that it stimulates the respiratory system.|$|E
50|$|Monkey studies {{looking at}} the {{dependence}} liability of several sedative drugs showed that <b>benzoctamine</b> was a dependence-free drug, while pentobarbital, alcohol, chloroform, meprobamate, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and oxazolam were not.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>benzoctamine</b> {{does not}} potentiate {{the effects of}} alcohol, studies have shown it can potentiate the {{respiratory}} depression seen with morphine in rats, while also reducing morphine's analgesic effects.|$|E
50|$|In a rat study {{looking at}} the effects of <b>benzoctamine</b> and {{chlordiazepoxide}} on serotonin turnover, rats treated with drug {{were found to have}} elevated levels of 14C-5HT, indicating a decrease in serotonin turnover.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} {{treatment for}} hypertension is blocking peripheral vascular seretonergic neurons or alpha-adrenergic neurons on postsynaptic cell sites. One {{study showed that}} <b>benzoctamine,</b> a serotonin and alpha-adrenergic antagonist, does not reduce blood pressure through a seretonin mechanism but does reduce blood pressure by antagonizing alpha-adrenergic receptors in rats. Rats were given 10 mg of <b>benzoctamine</b> and drops in their blood pressure were approximately 30 mm Hg. The researchers further confirmed that serotonin antagonism was not sufficient to reduce blood pressure by using the highly selective serotonin antagonist 1-(1-naphthyl)-piperazine, which {{was not able to}} decrease the blood pressure of the rats. These studies have yet to be repeated in humans.|$|E
50|$|Medically, <b>benzoctamine</b> {{is used as}} a {{treatment}} for anxious outpatients to control aggression, enuresis, fear, and minor social maladjustment in children. While it is a relatively new anti-anxiety drug, its popularity is increasing as a result of it being able to have comparable anxiolytic and sedative effects to other medications without their potentially fatal respiratory depressive side effects. Its anxiolytic effects are most similar to diazepam, another anxiolytic, but unlike diazepam, <b>benzoctamine</b> has antagonistic effects on epinephrine, norepinephrine, and appears to reduce serotonin turnover. While little is understood about how it carries out its effects, studies point to reduced serotonin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine as partial causes of its pharmacologic and behavioral effects.|$|E
50|$|Not much is {{understood}} about how <b>benzoctamine</b> produces its anti-anxiety effects, but rat {{studies have shown}} that the possible mechanism of action is by way of increased turnover of cathecholamines. In addition to serotonin it has also been shown to decrease epinephrine, dopamine, and norepinephrine turnover by antagonizing their receptors. When given intravenously in doses of 20-40 mg there are no significant differences in efficacy. Oral doses exceeding 10 mg three times daily do not increase the effects of the drug. Assuming serotonin postsynaptic antagonism is the main mechanism by which <b>benzoctamine</b> carries out its effects, studies have shown it to have a half maximal inhibitory concentration(IC50) value of 115 mM at the serotonin receptor.|$|E
50|$|Chemically, <b>benzoctamine</b> {{belongs to}} the class of {{compounds}} called dibenzobicyclo-octodienes. It is a tetracyclic compound, consisting of four rings in a three dimensional configuration, and is very closely related structurally to the tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) maprotiline, differing only in the length of their side chain.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs tend to show dependency in animals, but <b>benzoctamine</b> {{has been shown to}} not be addictive. Other animal studies also point to the drug as a possible mechanism by which to reduce blood pressure through the adrenergic system.|$|E
50|$|Maprotiline is {{very similar}} in {{structure}} to the anxiolytic, sedative, and muscle relaxant drug <b>benzoctamine</b> (Tacitin). The only structural {{difference between the two}} compounds is in the length of their side chain. However, this modification results in considerable differences in their pharmacological and therapeutic effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Benzoctamine</b> is a {{drug that}} {{possesses}} sedative and anxiolytic properties. Marketed as Tacitin by Ciba-Geigy, it is different from most sedative drugs because in most clinical trials it does not produce respiratory depression, but actually stimulates the respiratory system. As a result, {{when compared to other}} sedative and anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines like diazepam, it is a safer form of tranquilizing. However, when co-administered with other drugs that cause respiratory depression, like morphine, it can cause increased respiratory depression.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that <b>benzoctamine</b> {{decreases}} the rate of turnover of serotonin. Scientists confirmed these results and proposed that the method of action was inhibition of serotonin uptake since the drug also blocked the serotonin depleting action of extra-neuronal monoamine transporters (EMT). This would lead to increased stimulation of serotonin receptors through a negative feed back mechanism, eventually decreasing serotonin out put. However, the study points out that other studies {{have shown that}} drugs combined with EMT cause a lowering of body temperature that in fact results in a decrease in 5HT turnover. This means that body temperature effects cannot be ruled out.|$|E
40|$|<b>Benzoctamine</b> (Tacitin) {{was given}} by mouth as night {{sedation}} to patients admitted to hospital with respiratory failure. Fourteen patients had chronic obstructive bronchitis and six had acute severe asthma. One patient with asthma needed intravenous sedation with <b>benzoctamine.</b> No adverse effects were observed, {{and there was no}} significant change of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or Pco 2 in any patient after <b>benzoctamine.</b> Nevertheless, further clinical experience of the drug is required before its use can be safely recommended in respiratory failure...|$|E
40|$|A {{multiple}} regression search {{analysis was conducted}} with 76 anxious out patients treated in a 4 week clinical trial with either <b>benzoctamine</b> 60 mgjday or chlordiazepoxide 60 mglday. Better response was predicted: 1. For <b>benzoctamine,</b> in patients who are less educated, have an adequate occupational adjustment, and are initially higher in anxiety. 2. For chlordiazepoxide, in patients who are more educated and have a. marginal occupational adjustment. 3. For both drugs, in patients who are black, are diagnosed as anxious rather than anxious-depressed, and are higher in initial depression. A major factor accounting for the differential effectiveness predicted for these 2 anti-anxiety agents was felt to be {{the large number of}} sedative side effects reported by patients receiving <b>benzoctamine</b> 60 mgjday...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{males were}} studied during 27 weeks, {{including}} two periods of five weeks {{during which they}} received clinical doses of sodium amylobarbitone and <b>benzoctamine.</b> Substitution of placebo for either drug caused raised anxiety and impairment of mental concentration. The drugs reduced restlessness during sleep and reduced paradoxical sleep. By the fifth week of sodium amylobarbitone, although sleep was still less restless in the early night it was more restless than normal in the late night...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of the tetracyclic compounds 1 -(4, 5 -dichloro- 9, 10 -dihydro- 9, 10 -ethanoanthracen- 11 -yl) -N-methylmethanamine (5) and 1 -(1, 8 -dichloro- 9, 10 -dihydro- 9, 10 -ethanoanthracen- 11 -yl) -N-methylmethanamine (6) as a homologue of the anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs <b>benzoctamine</b> and maprotiline were described. The key intermediate aldehydes (3) and (4) were successfully synthesized via a [4 + 2] cycloaddition between acrolein and 1, 8 -dichloroanthracene. The synthesized compounds were investigated for antidepressant activity using the forced swimming test. Compounds (5), (6) and (3) showed significant reduction in the mice immobility indicating significant antidepressant effects. These compounds significantly reduced the immobility times at a dose 80 mg/kg by 84. 0 %, 86. 7 % and 71. 1 % respectively...|$|E
