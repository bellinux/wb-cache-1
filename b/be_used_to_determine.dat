5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> how to behave.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters can also <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> changes {{due to the}} starting composition of the gas and dust that formed the cluster. That is, the evolutionary tracks change with changes in the abundance of heavy elements. The data obtained from studies of globular clusters are then used to study {{the evolution of the}} Milky Way as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitions}} using two-legged matches, {{each team}} competes at home once, with an aggregate score {{from the two}} matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the away goals rule may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the winners, {{in which case the}} winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space—a mathematical representation of periodic structures {{that is used to}} infer the original structure. ARPES can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.|$|E
5|$|The head is a {{rectangular}} {{section of the}} cloth which is worn at the front. The head section can be at {{the middle of the}} cloth, or placed at one or both ends.

5|$|A CO-oximeter can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> carboxyhemoglobin levels. Pulse CO-oximeters {{estimate}} carboxyhemoglobin with a non-invasive finger clip {{similar to}} a pulse oximeter. These devices function by passing various wavelengths of light through the fingertip and measuring the light absorption of {{the different types of}} hemoglobin in the capillaries. The use of a regular pulse oximeter is not effective in the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning as people with carbon monoxide poisoning may have a normal oxygen saturation level on a pulse oximeter. This is due to the carboxyhemoglobin being misrepresented as oxyhemoglobin.|$|E

5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to detect Gliese 876 c is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. This is because the measured mass value depends on the inclination of the orbit, which is not determined by the radial velocity measurements. However, in a resonant system such as Gliese 876, gravitational interactions between the planets can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the true masses. Using this method, the inclination of the orbit can be determined, revealing the planet's true mass to be 0.72 times that of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water to be present, and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E
5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of}} a heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E
30|$|Next, we {{compared}} {{how well the}} baseline chest radiograph score, EVLWI, and PaO 2 /FiO 2 predicted mortality (within 30 days of hospital admission) and ventilator-free days. The t test <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether the baseline values of these three predictors differed between survivors and nonsurvivors. Univariate logistic regression <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether these three baseline values predicted ICU mortality. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was determined {{for each of these}} three predictors and compared. Univariate linear regression <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether these three baseline values predicted ventilator-free days.|$|R

5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists {{must be aware of}} other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers that can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present in their current form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the age of the Earth through radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.|$|E

5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|This {{treatise}} {{was thought}} lost until {{the discovery of}} the Archimedes Palimpsest in 1906. In this work Archimedes uses infinitesimals, and shows how breaking up a figure into an infinite number of infinitely small parts can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> its area or volume. Archimedes may have considered this method lacking in formal rigor, so he also used the method of exhaustion to derive the results. As with The Cattle Problem, The Method of Mechanical Theorems was written {{in the form of a}} letter to Eratosthenes in Alexandria.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hixon was {{the first}} to {{describe}} the use of electromagnetic principles to measure articulation. In his letter to the editor, published in The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, he described a setup using two sensor coils and one generator coil. The sensor coils, attached to the forehead and back of the neck, would remain stationary while the generator coil, attached to the jaw, would move creating variable currents in the sensor coils. These currents could then <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the distance in two dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} stipitate hydnoid fungi are {{hampered}} by {{a dearth of}} information about their basic ecology, and so molecular genetic techniques are increasingly employed in attempts to better understand these fungi. In the case of Phellodon tomentosus, for example, there is little correlation between fruitbody appearance and below-ground mycelium, {{making it hard to}} determine the distribution and rarity of the fungus with standard surveying techniques. Phellodon melaleucus and P.niger were included in a Scottish study to develop species-specific PCR primers {{that can be used to}} detect the mycelia of stipitate hydnoids in soil. DNA testing of collections labelled as P.melaleucus and P.niger from the United Kingdom revealed additional cryptic species. PCR analysis can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the presence of a Phellodon species up to four years after the appearance of fruitbodies, allowing a more accurate determination of their possible decline and threat of extinction.|$|E
5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control of an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E
