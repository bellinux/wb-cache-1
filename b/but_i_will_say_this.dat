6000|$|... "You {{must try}} and {{do the best you}} can now. I am not saying what that should be. I am not dictating to you. You are a man, and, of course, you must judge for yourself. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this.</b> You shouldn't do {{anything}} just because it is the easiest. I don't suppose I should live after it. I don't indeed. But that should not signify to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nat's {{adventure}} {{was like}} this; I don't know how true it is; maybe {{he got it}} out of a paper, or somewhere, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for him, that he DID know how to tell it. He could make anybody's flesh crawl, and he'd turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and girls got so faint they couldn't stick it out. Well, it was this way, as near as I can remember: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "To-morrow, perhaps. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> my real {{good-bye to}} you here, now, to-day. I hope {{you may be}} happy. I hope it with all my heart. Good-bye. God bless you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "People of the Mist," [...] cried Juanna, {{taking the}} hint, [...] "you {{have heard the}} words of Nam and the words of her who was my servant. They dare to tel you that we are no gods. So be it: on this matter we will not reason with you, for can the gods descend to prove their godhead? We will not reason, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> in warning: put us away if you wish,--and it may well chance that we shall suffer {{ourselves}} to be put away, since the gods do not desire to rule over those who reject them, but would choose rather {{to return to their}} own place.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{arriving}} at a decision, which I may say I have succeeded in doing," [...] continued Aunt Jane, calmly, [...] "I do not claim to have acted with either wisdom or discernment. I have simply followed my own whim, as I {{have the right to}} do, and selected the niece I prefer to become my heiress. You cannot accuse of injustice, because none of you had a right to expect anything of me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> that I am well pleased with all three of you, and now wish that I had taken pains to form your acquaintance earlier in life. You might have cheered my old age and rendered it less lonely and dull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ... I cannot but {{express my}} {{gratitude}} that this true {{view of this}} element of discord among us, as I believe it is, is attracting more and more attention. I {{do not believe that}} Governor Seward uttered that sentiment because I had done so before, but because he reflected upon this subject, and saw the truth of it. Nor do I believe, because Governor Seward or I uttered it, that Mr. Hickman of Pennsylvania, in different language, since that time, has declared his belief in the utter antagonism which exists between the principles of liberty and slavery. You see we are multiplying. Now, while I am speaking of Hickman, let me say, I know but little about him. I have never seen him, and know scarcely anything about the man; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> much about him: of all the anti-Lecompton Democracy that have been brought to my notice, he alone has the true, genuine ring of the metal.|$|E
60|$|DEAR SIRS:--Your kind {{invitation}} to visit you and deliver a poem for the 333d Anniversary of founding Santa Fe has reach'd me so late that I have to decline, with sincere regret. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> {{a few words}} offhand.|$|R
6000|$|... "Less likely {{things have}} happened," [...] said Mellish. [...] "I won't say that Cashel Byron is getting stale; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that his luck {{is too good}} to last; and I {{know for a fact}} that he's gone quite melancholy of late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [3] I {{have heard}} him say more than once, 'I <b>will</b> not <b>say</b> our people know good from bad, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that they don't hate the good when it is pointed out to them, as {{a great many people}} do in England.' ...|$|R
6000|$|While I am here {{upon this}} subject, I cannot but express {{gratitude}} that this true {{view of this}} element of discord among us--as I believe it is--is attracting more and more attention.

And now, without indorsing anything else he has said, I will ask this audience to give three cheers for Hickman. [The audience responded with three rousing cheers for Hickman.] ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a feather}} {{in a young}} man's cap to have gone through college in 1755, which was the year I graduated. It is true, the University men, who had been home for their learning, {{were more or less}} numerous; but they were of a class that held itself aloof from the smaller gentry, and most of them were soon placed in office, adding the dignity of public trusts to their acquisitions--the former in a manner overshadowing the latter. But, I was nearer to the body of the community, and my {{position}} admitted more of comparative excellence, as it might be. No one thinks of certain habits, opinions, manners, and tastes, in the circle where they are expected to be found; but, it is a different thing where all, or any of these peculiarities form the exception. I am afraid more was anticipated from my college education than has ever been realized; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for my Alma Mater, that I am not conscious my acquisitions at college have ever been of any disadvantage to me; and I rather think they have, in some degree at least, contributed to the little success that has attended my humble career.|$|E
5000|$|In 1889, the {{contracts}} of White and teammate Jack Rowe {{were sold to}} the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, but the pair refused to report unless they were paid additional money, leading to a protracted dispute. Eventually {{the two men were}} paid, with White telling a reporter, [...] "We appreciate the money, but we ain't worth it. Rowe's arm is gone. I'm over 40 and my fielding ain't so good, though I can still hit some. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this.</b> No man is going to sell my carcass unless I get half." [...] Complaints like this were {{part of the reason that}} the Players' League was formed in 1890.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you know, sir," [...] {{interposed}} Grace, [...] "you're sure William would neither drink, nor idle, nor waste, in any way. He's my husband, and I shouldn't praise him; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> there's not a soberer, honester man i' England nor he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The lad has pith in him! I {{like him}} better than if he came like a spaniel to my foot. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> no more till I fully have my brother's consent. No one knows what crooks there may be in folks' minds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly no one {{who knows}} nothing about the matter. There is nothing papa and I dislike much more than such foolish talk; and to tease your sister about it is even worse; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> no more about that, as I believe it was chiefly Wilfred's doing.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Clarence {{always worked}} {{on the basis that}} he was no more {{important}} than anyone else.... You could always be sure that if we were really in a bind, he'd come down and help you get out. It didn't mean that he was there all the time, but I can't emphasize enough how much the correspondence made me feel that we were having careful direction. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> that sometimes I'd have anywhere from six letters a day... When I later worked with PPFA, when Clarence wasn't as closely connected, I didn't feel that security. I don't know what it is. It's a psychological something that he gave to each of his workers that was priceless.... He was interested in every detail. There wasn't anything that was too much or too detailed for him to be interested in." ...|$|E
5000|$|My {{recommendation}} {{comes with}} a caveat: there is no roadmap {{for this kind of}} show, and it could easily fall apart quickly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for The Last Man on Earth: it does not seem like {{the sort of thing that}} would be a primetime network sitcom. And that's precisely why it should be one. James Poniewozik of Time The Last Man on Earth has received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the first season has a score of 72, based on 30 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an 85% approval rating with an average score of 7.74 out of 10 based on 46 reviews. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "It may run out of steam before the season's over, but The Last Man on Earths ambitious concept and comedic undertone are enough to lure viewers in." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter called the show [...] "a genre-busting breakout that's creative, nuanced and inspired". Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Forte's [...] "audacity, inventiveness and achievement". Hank Stuever of The Washington Post called it [...] "a charming and intelligent sendup of pop culture's obsession with the end of everything". Slate Willa Paskin called the program [...] "well-made, polished, odd, surprisingly funny". [...] "For a show that shouldn't really work at all, Last Man works pretty well", remarked Margaret Lyons of Vulture.|$|E
5000|$|On October 31, 2012, accused Conservative Party {{staff member}} Michael Sona, whom {{anonymous}} reports had named as {{responsible for the}} Guelph voter suppression efforts, gave an extensive media interview on CBC's Power & Politics. Sona stated that he had hoped that the Elections Canada investigation would have shown he was not involved by this point in time, but that given {{that there was no}} end in sight to the lengthy investigation, he felt he had to speak out. In the interview, Sona denied involvement and indicated that he was [...] "not going to take responsibility for something that was not responsible for". He added, [...] "I think that there's some people that maybe had an interest in seeing me take the fall for it." [...] During the interview, he was asked who was involved and Sona stated, [...] "You've got {{to take a look at}} the options and just say, you know what, what is the more realistic option here? That some then-22-year-old guy managed to co-ordinate this entire massive scheme when he didn't even have access to the data to be able to do this, or the alternative — that this was much more co-ordinated or possibly that there were people that knew how to do this, that it was being done? ... I don't know for sure who it could have been, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>this.</b> It's interesting that you had a bunch of people come out and point the finger at me, officially to Elections Canada, only after my name was leaked to the media by anonymous sources." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be all}} right, Irma néni," [...] the {{neighbour}} said, {{in response}} to some remark of the other woman. [...] "Klara Goldstein does not expect our village girls to take much notice of her. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that the men are sharp enough dangling round her skirts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} laugh any more, or these naughty {{children}} will {{think they have}} done something very clever in running away," [...] said Miss Celia, when the fun subsided, adding, soberly, [...] "I am displeased, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> nothing, for <b>I</b> think Ben is already punished enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And to you, sir, also, good-night!" [...] the {{professor}} added, taking Tavernake's hand and holding {{it for a}} minute in his, while he looked impressively in his face. [...] "I <b>will</b> not <b>say</b> too much, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> this: so much as I have seen of you, I like. Good-night!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I shall {{dress in}} my finest clothes and {{walk up and}} down the Palace Bridge. Surely a rich man will fall in love with me and ask me to be his wife. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> 'No! <b>I</b> can never be yours! Not unless you first give me all your buttons!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, {{blow the}} Mister and blow the Bush. Call me Jimmie. I can't stand ceremony. The way I look {{on it is}} this. We're both of us gentlemen. Now, mind you, I'm not a fellow to praise myself. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> this: <b>I</b> am a gentleman. That's not self-praise, is it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{deny that}} she has spoken {{to me on the}} subject," [...] he answered, [...] "I being a lawyer. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> to you, in strict confidence, please, that if you and your husband are {{sincerely}} attached to each other there is nothing on earth she can do to separate you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't wish to boast; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> am {{satisfied}} with my summer's work, and go South feeling that I leave an enviable reputation behind me." [...] And Mrs. Wing plumed herself {{with an air}} of immense importance, as she nodded and bridled from her perch on the window-sill.|$|R
6000|$|Next day we {{mounted at}} daybreak and renewed the hunt, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> no {{more about it}} than that we bagged twenty-six springboks amongst us, and that Six-foot Johnny, having killed the {{greatest}} number of animals, returned home [...] "King of the hunt," [...] with a scrap of ostrich feather in his cap.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Atli, thou hast had thy way," [...] he said, [...] "and methinks {{things are}} worse than they were before. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> this: would that I lay there and thou stoodest to watch me die, for as lief would I have slain my father as thee, Earl Atli. There lies Swanhild's work!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you study}} {{physiognomy}} as well," [...] he said. [...] "Well, Miss Granger, {{it is rather}} odd, considering all things, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> to you what I have never said to any one before. I believe that you are right. I shall rise. If I live I feel that I have it in me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If it's fated that {{listeners}} {{are never}} {{to hear any}} good of themselves,' said Mrs Browdie, 'I can't help it, and I am very sorry for it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> Fanny, that times out of number I have spoken so kindly of you behind your back, that even you could have found no fault with what I said.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, fie, fie, my dear, that's folly. Mr Clennam {{is a very}} gentlemanly man--very gentlemanly. A little {{reserved}} at times; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> extremely gentlemanly. <b>I</b> couldn't {{think of}} your not being here to receive Mr Clennam, my dear, especially this afternoon. So go and freshen yourself up, Amy; go and freshen yourself up, like a good girl.' ...|$|R

60|$|Pilate, too, I noted, showed heavy anxiety. That {{they were}} giving him a hard time of it was patent. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say,</b> as you shall see, that he matched their subtlety with equal subtlety; and from what I saw of him I have little doubt but {{what he would have}} confounded many a disputant in the synagogues.|$|R
