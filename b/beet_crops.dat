50|$|To {{cultivate}} beets successfully, {{the land}} must be properly prepared. Deep ploughing {{is the first}} principle of beet culture. It allows the roots to penetrate the subsoil without much obstruction, thereby preventing the beet from growing out of the ground, besides enabling it to extract considerable nourishment and moisture from the lower soil. If the latter is too hard, the roots will not penetrate it readily and, as a result, the plant will be pushed {{up and out of}} the earth during the process of growth. A hard subsoil is impervious to water and prevents proper drainage. It should not be too loose, however, as this allows the water to pass through more freely than is desirable. Ideally, the soil should be deep, fairly fine and easily penetrable by the roots. It should also be capable of retaining moisture and at the same time admit of a free circulation of air and good drainage. Sugar <b>beet</b> <b>crops</b> exhaust the soil rapidly. Crop rotation is recommended and necessary. Normally, beets are grown in the same ground every third year, peas, beans or grain being raised the other two years.|$|E

40|$|Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris sp. vulgaris) crops {{account for}} about 30 % of world sugar. Sugar yield is {{compromised}} by reproductive growth hence crops must remain vegetative until harvest. Prolonged exposure to cold temperature (vernalization) in the range 6 degrees C to 12 degrees C induces reproductive growth, leading to bolting (rapid elongation of the main stem) and flowering. Spring cultivation of crops in cool temperate climates makes them vulnerable to vernalization and hence bolting, which is initiated in the apical shoot meristem in processes involving interaction between gibberellin (GA) hormones and vernalization.

Only small deviations from the mean daytime Concentration of 283 ppm occurred during {{the remainder of the}} season. The mean nocturnal concentration during this period was 320 ppm and was more variable than the daytime concentration. The daily amplitude of concentration averaged 70 ppm and was as great at times as 100 ppm.

Mean concentration was independent of mean temperature, mean incident radiation, and predominant wind direction. During each day the concentration remained constant between 1 % hr after sunrise and 1 hr before sunset except for a few cases. These were associated with incident radiation below 0. 2 cal cm- 2 min- 1 and/or wind speeds at 25 cm above the crop of less than 0. 3 m sec-l or more than 3 m sec-I.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} labour have clearly {{established}} that the capitalist state is very involved in the recruitment, relocation and retention of migrant labour forces. Most of the literature tends to analyze migrant labour within the broader social, political and economic context of expanding capitalism. Consequently, studies {{tend to focus on}} how the use of migrant labour is profitable to capitalism because it is cheap and easy to exploit. Such studies, however, neglect {{the ways in which the}} state actually intervenes in the labour market in order to facilitate the flow of migrant workers to places of employment. Therefore, this thesis explores the relationship between the migration of labour, the state and the reserve army of labour through an analysis of the Native migrant work force in the sugar beet industry in southern Alberta. Through the use of archival material, which includes various federal and provincial documents, annual reports of the Alberta Sugar Beet Growers' Association, newspapers and other materials, the circumstances underlying state intervention in the economy of the southern sugar beet industry became clear. While analyzing the structure of the sugar beet industry in southern Alberta, it was found that throughout much of the history of the sugar beet industry, farmers received low returns for their <b>beet</b> <b>crops.</b> Moreover, farmers also suffered financially from the high cost of machinery and, more recently, from the increased costs for fertilizer and chemical weed controls. An examination of government documents on the FederalProvincial Agricultural Manpower Committee, whose mandate was to recruit workers and move them to areas of need in agricultural sectors throughout Canada, revealed that the federal part of the committee was represented by officials from the Department of Manpower and Immigration and, beginning in the early 1950 s, officials from the Department of Indian Affairs, who represented Indians on reserves. When the working conditions in sugar beet industry were examined, it was found that they were very poor for beet workers. In general, the weeding and hoeing of the sugar beets was difficult and the housing accommodations inadequate. Moreover, because of the low return on their <b>beet</b> <b>crops</b> and the high costs of machinery, fertilizer and weed control, the farmers had to keep the cost of labour as low as possible, which, meant paying low wages to beet workers. Moreover, it was found that throughout much the history of the sugar beet industry in southern Alberta, agricultural workers were unprotected by labour laws, which, was very conducive to reproducing conditions for cheap labour. Consequently, few wanted to work in the beet fields of southern Alberta if other employment could be found. Prior to the 1950 s the state recruited immigrant workers and even prisoners of war from internment camps to supply farmers with the needed labour for their <b>beet</b> <b>crops.</b> However, in the early 1950 s unskilled immigrant labour could no longer be procured for beet work. It was at this time that the sugar beet industry, through the Federal-Provincial Agricultural Manpower Committee, turned to recruiting Natives, particulary northern Alberta and northern Saskatchewan reserve Indians, to perform their labour requirements. In order to maintain this needed work force, the state helped organize Native migratation to southern Alberta at the start of the beet season and also helped ensure that they stayed there for the duration of the needed period...|$|E
40|$|Beet yellows virus (BYV) can {{dramatically}} reduce yield from sugar <b>beet</b> <b>crops.</b> A BYV resistant plant from a Beta germplasm accession was crossed with a {{sugar beet}} plant {{to generate the}} segregating population BYV 1. This population was evaluated for BYV resistance and analysed with amplified fragment length polymorphism and single-nucleotide polymorphism markers to identify resistance loci. At 2 weeks after inoculation a number of plants displayed either mosaic or vein-clearing disease symptoms on infected leaves. The locus that largely controlled this disease reaction was mapped to chromosome IV. We refer to this novel genetic locus as Vc 1. Three BYV resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified and mapped to chromosomes III, V and VI. QTL mapping results suggested that the chromosome III and V QTLs acted only in plants with mosaic symptoms and that the chromosome VI QTL acted only in plants with the mosaic symptom allele of Vc 1. These findings agreed with further statistical tests using general linear model analysis. There is now the potential to breed for BYV resistance using molecular marker technology...|$|E
