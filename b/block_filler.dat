Utilizing energy dissipation theory analyzes the building energy consumption. Conclusion: The glass bead thermal insulation concrete frame structure of fly ash autoclaved aerated concrete <b>block</b> <b>filler</b> wall meets the requirement of Sichuan residential building energy-saving code. China is the biggest coal producing and consumptive country. Recently, with the steady development of energy industries, the fly ash produced by coal increased annually, resulting in serious environmental pollution and stress to economics. As the relevant data shown, in 2013, only 3 cities met the tier 2 standard among 74 cities under the air quality monitoring. The disposition and recycle of fly ash have drawn the wide concern of publics. Producing the fly ash autoclaved aerated concrete block opened up a new approach for power plant fly ash. 1 m 3 fly ash NALC can consume 350 kg fly ash; therefore, production of autoclaved aerated concrete block is significant by improving environmental pollution and energy-saving. This article analyzed the energy-saving performance of fly ash autoclaved aerated concrete block in glass bead thermal insulation concrete frame structure...|$|E

40|$|Cables {{that are}} not {{longitudinally}} water blocked are vulnerable to water ingress over long lengths of hundreds of meters or more. In these events, electric utilities and/or cable producers may suffer high cable replacement costs or delays caused by long cable lead times or right-of-way problems. Conversely, properly water blocked cables limit water ingress to a distance of typically less than 1 meter. Recently, cable and water blocking material producers have witnessed and reacted to a clear industry trend towards complete longitudinal water blocking of power cables, including the conductor, rather than the traditional requirement for “screen only ” water blocking. To address these new challenges, new water blocking materials were developed by Geca Tapes for use under the strenuous conditions of CV extrusion and decades of service at conductor operating temperatures. The new materials included a thin water blocking tape for use in power conductors, a new high-capacity water blocking yarn designed for use in conductors and two new water <b>blocking</b> <b>filler</b> yarns designed {{for use in the}} interstitial areas between conductors in LV and MV multicore cables In addition, methods were developed to analyze power cable geometry and produce an estimated bill of materials for water blocking. This information proved useful to cables makers for verification trials of new water blocked cable designs...|$|R

40|$|Engineering {{structures}} often {{consist of}} elements having {{the character of}} a periodically repeated composite structure. A multivolume micromechanical model based on a representative cell division into r 1 × r 2 × r 3 subcells with different elastic material properties has been used in this paper to derive macromechanical characteristics of the composite construction response to applied load and temperature changes. The multivolume method is based on ensuring the equilibrium of the considered volume on an average basis. In the same (average) way, the continuity conditions of displacements and tractions at the interfaces between subcells and between neighboring representative elements are imposed, resulting in a homogenization procedure that eliminates the discrete nature of the composite model. The details of the method are shown for the case of a concrete block pavement. A parametric study is presented illustrating the influence of joint thickness, joint filling material properties and the quality of bonding between <b>block</b> and <b>filler</b> elements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSperm {{competition}} theory {{predicts that}} males should produce many, similar sperm. However, in some species {{of animals and}} plants, males exhibit a heteromorphism that results {{in the production of}} at least two different types of sperm or pollen grains. In animals, sperm heteromorphism typically corresponds to the production of one fertile morph and one (or more) sterile morph(s), whereas in plants two or more pollen morphs (one of which can be either sterile or fertile) are produced in all flowers but sometimes in different anthers. Heteromorphism has arisen independently several times across phyla and at different phylogenetic levels. Here, we compare and contrast sperm and pollen heteromorphism and discuss the evolutionary hypotheses suggested to explain heteromorphism in these taxa. These hypotheses include facilitation, nutritive contribution, <b>blocking,</b> cheap <b>filler,</b> sperm flushing or killing for animals; outcrossing and precise cross-pollen transfer or bet-hedging strategy for plants; cryptic female choice for both. We conclude that heteromorphism in the two phyla is most likely linked to a general evolutionary response to sexual selection, either to increase one male's sperm or pollen success in competition with other males, or mediate male/female interactions. Therefore, although sperm and pollen are not homologous, we suggest that heteromorphism represents an example of convergence across kingdoms...|$|R

In the present study, {{we focus on the}} effect of chemical and geometrical characteristics of GNRs on the thermal conduction properties of composite materials. Configurations consisting of single and triple GNRs are here considered as representative building <b>blocks</b> of larger <b>filler</b> networks. In particular, GNRs with different length, relative orientation and number of cross-linkers are investigated. Based on results obtained by Reverse Non-equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations, we report correlations relating thermal conductivity and thermal boundary resistance of GNRs with their geometrical and chemical characteristics. These effects in turn affect the overall thermal transmittance of graphene based networks. In the broader context of effective medium theory, such results could be beneficial to predict the thermal transport properties of devices made of polymer matrix composites, which currently find application in energy, automotive, aerospace, electronics, sporting goods, and infrastructure industries...|$|R
40|$|The {{performances}} of asphalt concretes are typically {{influenced by the}} quantity and quality of filler, which is the aggregate with particle diameter of less than 0. 075 mm. Large amounts of filler change the rheological behaviour and limit the possibility of movement for the bitumen, which is <b>blocked</b> by the <b>filler</b> particles. This study evaluated the behaviour of asphalt mastics (bitumen plus filler) in the linear viscoelastic region, mixing various types of binder with different fillers. Bitumens produced in Italy with penetration 50 - 70 and 70 - 100 0. 1 xmm were used. The fillers were selected in order to represent two types of material, a common construction product (cement) and a conventional by-product often processed as a waste (municipal solid waste incinerator ash). The amount of filler added to the bitumen varied from 0 to 100 % by weight of bitumen. Tests were performed using a dynamic shear rheometer with two geometries, in amplitude and frequency sweep, with temperature scales between 15 °C and 70 °C. The tests verified that with a high filler content (100 % by weight) the behaviour of mastic changes radically, due to the reduction of mobility and higher viscosity induced by the filler. The SHRP-derived Christensen-Anderson model, which can be conventionally used for describing the behaviour of mastics with a low percentage of filler, is not suitable for mastics with the characteristics analysed...|$|R
40|$|Novel liquid {{crystalline}} epoxy nanocomposites, which exhibit reduced polymerization shrinkage {{and effectively}} bond to tooth structures, {{can be applied}} in esthetic dentistry, including core and post systems, direct and indirect restorations, and dental brackets. The {{purposes of this study}} were to investigate the properties of liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposites including biocompatibility, microhardness, and frictional forces of bracket-like <b>blocks</b> with different <b>filler</b> contents for further clinical applications. Methods: In this study, we evaluated liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposite materials that exhibited various filler contents, by assessing their cell activity performance using a 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and their microhardness with or without thermocycling. We also evaluated the frictional force between bracket-like duplicates and commercially available esthetic bracket systems using Instron 5566. Results: The liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposite materials showed good biocompatibility. The materials having high filler content demonstrated greater microhardness compared with commercially available bracket materials, before and after the thermocycling treatment. Thus, manufacturing processes are important to reduce frictional force experienced by orthodontic brackets. Conclusion: The microhardness of the bracket-like blocks made by our new material is superior to the commercially available brackets, even after thermocycling. Our results indicate that the evaluated liquid crystalline epoxy nanocomposite materials are of an appropriate quality for application in dental core and post systems and in various restorations. By applying technology to refine manufacturing processes, these new materials could also be used to fabricate esthetic brackets for orthodontic treatment...|$|R
