40|$|This paper studies {{monetary}} policy {{games in a}} two-period Mundell-Fleming model, under a regime of managed exchange rates. A regime of managed exchange rates is defined as one where exchange rates are pegged but <b>bilateral</b> <b>parities</b> can be changed from time to time. The paper argues that such a regime is the most appropriate description of the Bretton Woods system and many arrangements currently in existence. We show that Cournot-Nash equilibria under managed rates differ significantly from those under fixed or floating rates. Under managed rates the world-wide efficiency losses from lack of coordination are not equally shared by all countries. Exchange Rates; Monetary Policy; Mundell-Fleming Model...|$|R
40|$|In 1979, Italy {{entered into}} the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) as a {{founding}} member of the European Monetary System. After that date, the country’s monetary policy was geared toward the maintenance of exchange rate stability against its ERM partners, despite a number of exchange parity realignments and with the exception of the period from September 1992 to November 1996. 1 The strength of the ERM commitment was not uniform over time, either in terms of amplitude of the fluctuation band 2 or in terms of frequency of realignment of <b>bilateral</b> <b>parities.</b> Despite this variability, however, changes in official rates—the discount rate and the rate on fixed term advances—were overwhelmingly linked throughout the ERM period to developments in foreign exchange markets. The broad exchange-rate stability objective was made operational as a target range for the overnight interbank deposit rate. This target was articulated as a corridor (in the 1990 s, of typical width between 1 and 1. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} the forward {{discount}} puzzle is primarily a statistical phenomenon and that statistical rejections of Uncovered Interest Parity do not necessarily constitute valid rejections of market efficiency. We find by using a Taylor expansion a theoretical negative bias in existing regressions of UIP. We propose two alternative tests for market efficiency, {{one of which is}} designed to measure the degree of market inefficiency. Our results from these tests indicate that for all four of the <b>bilateral</b> dollar <b>parities</b> studied the foreign exchange market is efficient despite decisive clear rejections of UIP using the conventional regression approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncovered}} interest parity (UIP) condition {{suggests that}} carry trades whereby investors borrowin the lowinterest rate currency {{and invest in}} the high interest rate currency should not result in excess profits over the long run. In this paper, we test {{the significance of the}} conventional empirical failure of UIP condition. Using the four <b>bilateral</b> pound <b>parities</b> we fail to detect significant excess carry trade profits for the yen, euro and swiss franc–pound parities. The only parity for which the carry trade consistently makes excess profits is the dollar–pound parity. This result is somewhat surprising as this is the currency pair with the lowest interest rate differentia...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the returns and ex post variability of returns {{associated with the}} investment strategies of three distinctive groups of hypothetical traders in the foreign exchange market: Chartists, Fundamentalists, and Simpletons. Each group consists of three heterogeneous traders and is distinguished by its use of a different information set for trading purposes. We compare the returns associated with these imperfect traders to those of a perfect trader. The analysis covers four <b>bilateral</b> dollar <b>parities</b> using quarterly data over the period 1974 - 94. We find that statistically speaking no particular group dominates the others in terms of profitability. With respect to variability, there are some statistically significant differences but no robust conclusions can be drawn. We also find {{that in terms of}} yield a random walk investment strategy is beaten for all four parities by a strategy that relies upon recent extrapolation.

40|$|International audienceThis study aims to {{investigate}} venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk {{in relation to}} age at menopause, age at menarche, <b>parity,</b> <b>bilateral</b> oophorectomy, and time since menopause, {{as well as any}} interaction with randomized hormone therapy (HT) assignment, among postmenopausal women. Using pooled data from the Women's Health Initiative HT clinical trials including 27, 035 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who had no history of VTE, we assessed the risk of VTE in relation to age at menopause, age at menarche, <b>parity,</b> <b>bilateral</b> oophorectomy, and time since menopause by Cox proportional hazards models. Linear trends, quadratic relationships, and interactions of reproductive life characteristics with HT on VTE risk were systematically tested. During follow-up, 426 women reported a first VTE, including 294 non-procedure-related events. No apparent interaction of reproductive life characteristics with HT assignment on VTE risk was detected, and there was not a significant association between VTE and age at menarche, age at menopause, parity, oophorectomy, or time since menopause. However, analyses restricted to non-procedure-related VTE showed a U-shaped relationship between age at menopause and thrombotic risk that persisted after multivariable analysis (P 55 y) had a significantly increased VTE risk (hazard ratio [95 % CI]: 1. 8 [1. 2 - 2. 7] and 1. 5 [1. 0 - 2. 4], respectively). Reproductive life characteristics have little association with VTE and do not seem to influence the effect of HT on thrombotic risk among postmenopausal women. Nevertheless, early and late onset of menopause might be newly identified risk factors for non-procedure-related VTE...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} {{considers}} a multilateral target zone model that generalizes Krugman's {{model of a}} <b>bilateral</b> target zone. <b>Parities</b> are defended by manipulating money supplies in participating countries. This means that interventions aimed at one given exchange rate influence other exchange rates as well. As {{a result of these}} 'externalities' shocks on each fundamental affect the whole range of exchange rates involved. Moreover, intramarginal interventions arise endogenously, and the exchange rate distribution does not exhibit the u-shaped pattern which is typical of traditional target zones. Instead, his model gives rise to 'intramarginal targets' to which exchange rates tend to return. The location of these targets is shown to depend on the intervention-sterilization mix adopted by monetary authoritiesJournal home page : [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{events and}} family history as {{risk factors for}} breast cancer in {{northern}} Alberta were investigated {{with the use of}} data from a computerized population-based registry. Women aged 30 to 79 years attending diagnostic breast clinics at the Cross Cancer Institute from 1971 through 1975 constituted the two study groups; 1232 women had diagnosed breast cancer (malignant disease group) and 602 women were clinically free of all types of breast disease (control group). An increased relative risk of breast cancer was found in women with a family history of breast cancer, those who gave birth to their first term infant at age 30 years or older, those in whom more than 15 years elapsed between menarche and that birth, and those with a late natural menopause. There was a decreased risk, relative to nulliparity, in the postmenopausal women who first gave birth to a term infant 5 years or less after menarche. Artificial menopause (<b>bilateral</b> oophorectomy), <b>parity</b> and age at menarche had no apparent effect on the risk. The pattern of risk factors in northern Alberta differed from that reported for other geographic areas, including other provinces of Canada, thus emphasizing the need for local studies in the planning of screening programs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the cointegrating regression with errors whose variances change smoothly over time. The {{model can be}} used to describe a longrun cointegrating relationship, the tightness of which varies along with time. Heteroskedasticity in the errors is modelled nonparametrically and is assumed to be generated by a smooth function. We show that it can be consistently estimated by the kernel method. Given consistent estimates for error variances, the cointegrating relationship can be efficiently estimted by the usual GLS correction for heteroskedastic errors. It is shown that the US money demand function, both for M 1 and M 2, is well fitted to such a cointegrating model with growing variance. Moreover, we found that the <b>bilateral</b> purchasing power <b>parities</b> among many industrialized countries including the US, Germany, Japan, Canada, and the UK have been changed somewhat conspicuously over the past twenty years. They all had been monotonically loosened in the 70 's and 80 's, but most of them became tightened in the 90 's.

40|$|Age-related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is an important}} cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. The number of people affected by the disease {{is expected to rise}} due to increasing longevity. Development of adequate eye care for these patients should be based on knowledge about the prevalence of AMD. Further, preventive measures are the best strategy for any disease. The aims of this thesis were to estimate the prevalence of AMD and examine risk factors associated with AMD. We described prevalence rates of AMD among Caucasian elderly participants from the Tromsø Eye Study, a population-based study in Norway. The overall prevalence of late AMD was 3. 5 % among the participants aged 65 - 87 years old. Neovascular AMD outnumbered geographic atrophy. Symmetry between eyes was relatively low. Prevalence increased strongly with age. No significant sex differences in prevalence rates of AMD were observed. Refractive error was lower in eyes with late AMD than in eyes without late AMD. We then analysed relationships between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and AMD. Daily smoking was a strong predictor for the presence of late AMD. We found a significant interaction between age and sex for late AMD, suggesting that age may be a stronger risk factor for late AMD in women than in men. Higher systolic blood pressure, higher pulse pressure, infrequent physical exercise and overweight or obesity were in adjusted analyses associated with late AMD in females, but this was not observed in men. Based on our observation of sex and AMD, we studied associations between female hormone related factors and AMD. We found a significant inverse relationship between duration of lactation and late AMD. No significant relationships were found between late AMD and exogenous oestrogen exposure in the form of contraceptives or hormone therapy. Nor did we find an association between late AMD and onset, end or length of fertile years, <b>bilateral</b> oophorectomy or <b>parity</b> as surrogate measures...|$|R
