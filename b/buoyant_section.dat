Increases in particulate concentrations of Cd are accompanied by a reduction in dissolved Cd to levels below ambient seawater. We show that dissolved Cd is scavenged from seawater in the <b>buoyant</b> <b>section</b> of the plume while Cd re?dissolves from the particles in the non?buoyant plume. Up to 43 % of hydrothermally injected Cu is found in the < 0. 4 µm fraction in the non?buoyant plume...|$|E

Like Bela Bartok and Zoltan K 6 daly, Ralph Vaughan Williams {{spent a great}} deal of time studying the folk music of his native country. Vaughan Williams collected, catalogued and arranged hundreds of English folk songs, which led to his post as the editor of the English Hymnal (1906). Through this work, he developed a profound sense of nationalistic pride and much of his later compositions reflect the impact that the native folk songs of England had on him. Like many of the English folk songs Vaughan Williams worked closely with, O Clap Your Hands is characteristic of his music with its lyrical freshness and easily accessible melodic lines. This "open-air" anthem is based on Psalm 47 written 'for the Sons of Korah', and is a rousing, exultant song written specifically for filling great churches with joyous sounds. George Philip Telemann is regarded as a link between the late Baroque and early Classical styles. He was a prolific composer and theorist who wrote in almost every genre of his time including opera, oratorio, mass, cantata and chamber music. His style of composition was a self-described blend or combination of German, French, Italian and Polish influences. In 1721 Telemann became cantor at the Johanneum in Hamburg and musical director of the five main churches. Psalm 117 - Laudate Jehovam omnes gentes written in 1758, was originally scored for mixed chorus, strings and continuo and was part of just one of more than twenty sacred song cycles he wrote for the Johanneum every year. It begins with a rhythmically <b>buoyant</b> <b>section</b> exclaiming the greatness of the Lord in 4 / 4 time, and quickly moves into an almost contemplative Largo section to describe "His merciful kindness". The work ends in dialogue with a duet in the men's and women's sections finishing both sections singing a majestic Alleluia. Howard Hansen was a distinguished American composer, conductor and educator considered to be an American Neo-Romantic. He dedicated his professional life to the encouragement and creation of beauty and emotional expressiveness in music. This Romanticism is immediately evident in his treatment of text in How Excellent Thy Name, Op. 41. Based on text taken from Psalm 8, Hansen effectively captures the sense of awe, wonder and perspective the text using rhythmic vitality and tonally based ostinato figures. The Missa Brevis in G. K 49 (K 47 d) is one of Mozart's earliest compositions. This work is sometimes confused with the Miss a Brevis in C minor, Kl 3 9 (K 47 a), which was called the Orphanage Mass or Waisenhausmesse because it was composed and first performed at an orphanage in Rennwig, Vienna within months of the other. Written in Vienna in 1768, this work features all of the early Classical 'Missa Brevis' traditions seen in the works of Johann Ernst Eberlin, and Michael Haydn. Composed for Sunday services celebrating the Ordinary of the Mass, this Mass is concise in its formal dimensions and rarely repeats text. The choir predominates the orchestra and the instruments most often simply accompany the vocal parts colla parte. Solo passages occur only sporadically emerging from the texture of the tutti choir and then fall back into the choral texture. The bass solo in the Credo is the only glimpse of an aria or more precisely an arioso type of solo. Following tradition, the Benedictus incorporates the use of a solo quartet, but again, brevity prohibits development. The Agnus Dei is somber, homorhythmic and immediately followed by a very cheerful sounding "Dona nobis pacem". As a youth, Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn enjoyed early exposure to influential figures in literature, philosophy and music. Shakespeare, Goethe, Hegel, Marx, Bach, Handel, Mozart and Beethoven all influenced his intellectual life and in turn influenced the music he wrote. Mendelssohn composed music known for its clarity and Classical tendencies but eventually developed a style of his own which was much more Romantic than his predecessors. In Verleih uns Frieden gnadiglich, which was written in 1831, his command of clear writing, melodic development and purposeful emotional connection are evident. (See more in text. ...|$|E

5000|$|Harrison Butler was [...] "a strong {{believer in}} the 'metacentric shelf formula' to achieve good balance and {{handling}} under sail. The theory held that as a yacht heels under sail, its balance {{will depend on the}} immersed form of the hull, with different sections exerting varying degrees of buoyancy and aft sections possibly being more <b>buoyant</b> than forward <b>sections.</b> Metacentric shelf analysis plots the shifts in the varying buoyancies as a net value to windward or leeward and serves as a guide to achieving equal buoyancy in the dissimilar ends of a design. The work can now be done by computer, but when it was applied by the brain, hand and eye of Dr. Harrison Butler it produced famously sweet-handling boats, in the age of heavy weather helm." ...|$|R
