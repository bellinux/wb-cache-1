40|$|The {{requirement}} for wide operation range of steam turbine can cause, that the blades work close to resonant frequency. For decreasing of blade’s vibration there are placed damping {{elements in the}} <b>blade</b> <b>shroud.</b> These elements are calculated for dissipation of the vibration energy.

A total of 21 hr of cyclic and steady-state data were taken with surface speeds of 335 m/s (1100 ft/s) and shroud temperatures to 620 C (1150 F).

40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{modelling}} of friction effects in <b>blade</b> <b>shrouding</b> which are realized by means of friction elements placed between blades. In order to develop a methodology of modelling, two blades with one friction element in between are considered only.

The blades and the friction element are connected through two concurrent friction planes, where the friction forces arise on the basis of centrifugal force acting on the friction element. The linearization of friction is performed using the harmonic balance method to determine equivalent damping coefficients in dependence on the amplitudes of relative slip motion between the blades and the friction element.

40|$|The {{operation}} of water-jet propulsion can generate nonuniform inflow {{that may be}} detrimental {{to the performance of}} the water-jets. To reduce disadvantages of the nonuniform inflow, a rim-driven water-jet propulsion was designed depending on the technology of passive magnetic levitation. Insufficient understanding of large performance deviations between the normal water-jets (shaft) and permanent maglev water-jets (shaftless) is a major problem in this paper. CFD was directly adopted in the feasibility and superiority of permanent maglev water-jets. Comparison and discussion of the hydraulic performance were carried out. The shaftless duct firstly has a drop in hydraulic losses (K 1), since it effectively avoids the formation and evolution of the instability secondary vortex by the normalized helicity analysis. Then, the shaftless intake duct improves the inflow field of the water-jet pump, with consequencing the drop in the backflow and blocking on the <b>blade</b> <b>shroud.</b> So that the shaftless water-jet pump delivers higher flow rate and head to the propulsion than the shaft. Eventually, not only can the shaftless model increase the thrust and efficiency, but it has the ability to extend the working range and broaden the high efficiency region as well...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to investigate the aerothermal performance of a shrouded high pressure turbine blade {{in a large scale}} rotating rig. The rotor blade and the associated shroud and casing geometry have been modelled in a large scale low speed turbine rig that was designed to investigate a novel passive shroud cooling methodology. The objective of the present paper is to provide {{a detailed description of the}} flow field around the rotor <b>blade</b> <b>shroud.</b> The improved physical understanding of the shroud flow gained from this study will be used to analyse the aerothermal performance of the shroud cooling strategy as reported in a companion paper, Lehmann et al.

The measurements are complemented by steady and unsteady numerical computations of the turbine stage. The study identifies the existence of important vortical structures within the shroud cavities that not only interact with the main passage flow but also modify the amount and distribution of the shroud leakage flow in a manner that has major implications for shroud cooling and heat transfer. A detailed shroud flow model is derived and used to elucidate the causes and consequences of the flow pattern observed. The model emphasises the circumferentially asymmetric nature of the cavity flow structures caused by the presence of the inter shroud gap that in turn influences the production, interaction and dissipation of such vortical structures...|$|E

40|$|Actual {{trend in}} steam turbine design {{is to use}} <b>blades</b> with {{integral}} <b>shrouds,</b> for high pressure and intermediate pressure steam turbine sections, as well as sometimes also for the long blades of the low pressure sections. The blades are either inserted with their root into the seat on the shaft {{in such a way}} that small clearances remain between adjacent <b>blade</b> <b>shrouds,</b> so that the relative vibration amplitude is restricted by the contact between adjacent shrouds. This mechanism is called “snubbing mechanism”. Another technology for mounting blades on the shaft is to do it {{in such a way that}} the blades are slightly forced against each other in correspondence of the shrouds: this should allow the continuity of the contact without clearances also at rated speed and full load. In this case the blades are called “pre-twisted”. Field experience has shown that these kinds of blade rows has a “robust and smooth” behavior. But there is still some lack of theoretical/numerical investigation for defining its dynamical behavior in different operating conditions, both for the blades with clearance and with pre-twist. The aim of this paper is to investigate numerically the non-linear dynamic behavior of a couple of <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades,</b> taking account of contact forces and friction.

But design engineers {{are faced with the}} problem of blade placement because of the disk size and root dimensions. The problem of increasing life and cyclic durability, vibration strength, and lightweight design of the turbine gas turbine wheels, can be solved by an elimination of blade - disk locks. The technology of manufacturing one-piece blisks by connecting the blades with the disc part using hot isostatic pressing was developed. This technology allows us to use <b>blades</b> with <b>shrouds.</b> It is necessary to increase efficiency and to improve high cycle fatigue performance of rotor blades. One of the pressing problems is to ensure the necessary position of shrouds in relation {{to each other in the}} manufacturing process as well as in the service. Numerical studies of the influence of the shroud mounting position on blade strength during operation allowed us to develop a methodology of choosing a shroud mounting position. Based on the two turbine wheels (LPT and HPT) calculations advantages of blisk design with respect to the lock-based design were shown. Application of bimetallic blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> resulted in a lifespan increase and weight reduction. In addition, other advantages of blisk design are as follows: possible reduction in the number of parts, elimination of leaks and fretting that take place in the blade - disk locks, exception of expensive broaching operations and disk alloy saving. The shortcoming is elimination of damping in root connection. In addition, there are no widely used repair methods. Despite these disadvantages the usage of bimetallic turbine blisks with <b>shrouded</b> <b>blades</b> is very promising. </p...|$|R

Results include both static and dynamic seal leakage measurements running against a 5. 1 in (129. 54 mm) diameter smooth surface test rotor and another that simulates sealing against turbine <b>blade</b> <b>shrouds.</b> A further test was undertaken using a 2 D static rig that determined acoustic noise experienced during testing was attributed to leaves vibrating at their natural frequency {{as a result of}} inter-leaf gaps. The dynamic simulated shroud test includes steps, duplicating small discontinuities of adjacent shroud sealing surfaces and slots to inject air radially under the seal leaves as may occur between <b>shrouds</b> on <b>blades</b> {{with a high degree of}} reaction. Consistent seal performance over 15 hours confirms suitability for turbine blade tip applications. Controlled deflection of PALS leaves with operating differential pressure is effective for startup rub avoidance in service as well as conformal wear-in sizing of leaf tips with the rotor.
