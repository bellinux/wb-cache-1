40|$|With the <b>building</b> <b>wastes</b> {{contaminated}} by chromium in Haibei Chemical Plan in China as objects, we studied {{the contents of}} total Cr and Cr (VI) of different sizes, analyzed the effect of 6 different washing agents, discussed the removal mechanisms of 6 different washing agents for Cr in various forms, and finally selected applicable washing agent. As per the results, particle size had little impact on the contents of total Cr and Cr (VI); after one washing with water, the removal rate of total Cr and Cr (VI) was 75 % and 78 %, respectively, and after the second washing with 6 agents, the removal rate of citric acid was the highest, above 90 % for total Cr and above 99 % for hexavalent chromium; the pH of <b>building</b> <b>wastes</b> were reduced by citric acid, and under acid condition, hexavalent chromium was reduced to trivalent chromium spontaneously by organic acid, which led to better removal rate of acid soluble Cr and reducible Cr; due to the complexing action, citric acid had best removal rate for oxidizable trivalent chromium. In conclusion, citric acid is the most applicable second washing agent for <b>building</b> <b>wastes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Urban {{residential}} buildings are formed, maintained and reformed by different external material and energy flows, and their behaviors of input, accumulation and output {{are characterized by}} their architectural factors and modes of use that usually determine the consumption of material and energy of a building at its overall life cycle. In this research, we took Beijing city, a rapid developing city as a case study, and examined material flows of urban residential building system based on a survey of typical {{residential buildings}} in the urban areas of Beijing city. The quantitative analysis were made to describe the input, transformation/accumulation, and output of building materials from the year 1949 to 2008, and a comparative analysis was done to identify the differences of material uses among the buildings with different architectural structures as masonry-concrete, and steel-concrete. During the period from 1949 to 2008, there were six main materials of cement, sand, gravel, steel, bricks and timber used in urban residential building system in Beijing. The total amount of material imported into the system was 5. 1 x 10 (8) t, among which the accumulated amount was 4. 7 x 10 (8) t, an accumulation rate of 92. 5 %, and the total of <b>building</b> <b>wastes</b> reached 3. 9 x 10 (7) t. Among the buildings with two architectural structures, {{the total amount of}} material use for buildings with steel-concrete structure was larger than masonry-concrete. It was found that the buildings with steel-concrete structure experienced a rapid increase since the year 1979 in Beijing. As a result of rapid urban development, the large-scale reformation and demolishment of urban old buildings also led to a rapid growth of the amount of <b>building</b> <b>wastes.</b> And the <b>building</b> <b>wastes</b> generated in the process of reformation and demolition began to exceed that produced in the process of new buildings construction. The amount of <b>building</b> <b>wastes</b> generated from 2004 to 2008 accounted for 52. 2 % of the total that generated from 1949 to 2008. From this research, the rapid development of Beijing's residential building system in the past 60 years became a big ecological pressure for urban sustainable building development. It is important to change the traditional model of urban construction, and develop some sustainable or ecologically friendly construction technologies to enhance the capacity of recycling and reuse of residential <b>building</b> <b>wastes</b> for realizing a sustainable urban building construction and management in Beijing.

5000|$|Much <b>building</b> <b>waste</b> {{is made up}} of {{materials}} such as bricks, concrete and wood damaged or unused for various reasons during construction. Observational research has shown that this can be as high as 10 to 15% of the materials that go into a building, a much higher percentage than the 2.5-5% usually assumed by quantity surveyors and the construction industry. Since considerable variability exists between construction sites, there is much opportunity for reducing this waste.|$|E

50|$|When water percolates through waste, it {{promotes}} and assists {{the process of}} decomposition by bacteria and fungi. These processes in turn release by-products of decomposition and rapidly use up any available oxygen, creating an anoxic environment. In actively decomposing waste, the temperature rises and the pH falls rapidly {{with the result that}} many metal ions that are relatively insoluble at neutral pH become dissolved in the developing leachate. The decomposition processes themselves release more water, which adds to the volume of leachate. Leachate also reacts with materials that are not prone to decomposition themselves, such as fire ash, cement-based building materials and gypsum-based materials changing the chemical composition. In sites with large volumes of <b>building</b> <b>waste,</b> especially those containing gypsum plaster, the reaction of leachate with the gypsum can generate large volumes of hydrogen sulfide, which may be released in the leachate and may also form a large component of the landfill gas.|$|E
50|$|Brownfield {{sites are}} {{construction}} sites where an existing building or man-made structure have been before, {{as opposed to}} greenfield sites where man expands his building activities into natural areas. An interesting idea is brown-roofs: Here {{the idea is to}} use <b>building</b> <b>waste</b> to provide a new growth medium on a flat roof (e.g. rubble/bricks produced as a by-product when an existing structure is demolished). Advantages are that {{there is no need to}} transport rubble away from the site and that various flora and fauna species which thrive on rubble landscapes can prosper - there are numerous examples of these. Unfortunately, in the UK at least, the idea is not so easy to put into practice, as bureaucracy dictates that rubble be analysed and often small amounts of what may be 'technically' termed pollution which may have lain 'happily' for many years forbids that it be reused on the roof. If the architect of the building-to-be has specified a brown roof then sometimes rubble is specially brought in on trucks, which to some extent defeats the object of nature conservancy, landfill waste reduction, transport pollution reduction and transport volume reduction. These brown roofs do provide a successful wildlife habitat when planned and implemented correctly. They are either specially seeded with chosen plant types or allowed to self-seed and make an attractive and visually pleasing roof.|$|E
