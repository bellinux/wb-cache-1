40|$|<b>Breast</b> density, as {{assessed}} by mammography, reflects <b>breast</b> tissue composition. <b>Breast</b> epithelium and stroma attenuate x-rays more than fat and thus appear light on mammograms while fat appears dark. In this review, we provide {{an overview of}} selected areas of current knowledge about the relationship between <b>breast</b> density and susceptibility to <b>breast</b> cancer. We review the evidence that <b>breast</b> density is a risk factor for <b>breast</b> cancer, the histological and other risk factors that are associated with variations in <b>breast</b> density, and the biological plausibility of the associations with risk of <b>breast</b> cancer. We also discuss the potential for improved risk prediction that might be achieved by using alternative <b>breast</b> imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance or ultrasound. After adjustment for other risk factors, <b>breast</b> density is consistently associated with <b>breast</b> cancer risk, more strongly than most other risk factors for this disease, and extensive <b>breast</b> density may account for a substantial fraction of <b>breast</b> cancer. <b>Breast</b> density is associated with risk of all of the proliferative lesions that are thought to be precursors of <b>breast</b> cancer. Studies of twins have shown that <b>breast</b> density is a highly heritable quantitative trait. Associations between <b>breast</b> density and variations in <b>breast</b> histology, risk of proliferative <b>breast</b> lesions, and risk of <b>breast</b> cancer {{may be the result of}} exposures of <b>breast</b> tissue to both mitogens and mutagens. Characterization of <b>breast</b> density by mammography has several limitations, and the uses of <b>breast</b> density in risk prediction and <b>breast</b> cancer prevention may be improved by other methods of imaging, such as magnetic resonance or ultrasound tomography...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{quantify}} vertical movement of the <b>breast</b> beyond the anatomical position (<b>breast</b> extension) in various support conditions and to investigate the relationship of <b>breast</b> extension to <b>breast</b> pain, <b>breast</b> mass, and <b>breast</b> kinematics during running. The <b>breast</b> and trunk motion of 23 females of varying <b>breast</b> mass was recorded in a static no bra condition and during running in different support conditions. Static <b>breast</b> position was subtracted from dynamic position to calculate extension. In no bra, everyday and sports bra, the <b>breast</b> extended 21 mm, 9 mm, and 4 mm beyond the anatomical position. <b>Breast</b> extension displayed a strong relationship to <b>breast</b> pain and provides information on the mechanical loading of the <b>breast</b> beyond that of gravity.

40|$|Abstract Background Unusual {{presentation}} of <b>breast</b> lymphoma with {{signs and symptoms}} suggestive of inflammatory <b>breast</b> cancer. Discussion Lymphoma of the <b>breast</b> is uncommon whether it is primary or secondary. Most <b>breast</b> lymphomas are of B cell origin. The most frequent mode of presentation is a painless <b>breast</b> mass. The clinical {{presentation of}} localized left <b>breast</b> erythema and edema with an associated left <b>breast</b> mass is common for an inflammatory <b>breast</b> cancer but highly unusual for lymphoma of the <b>breast.</b> Conclusion In patients with a left <b>breast</b> mass associated with erythema and edema, the differential diagnosis should include <b>breast</b> lymphoma in addition. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} desirable <b>breast</b> types using measurements from 31 selected female subjects {{based on}} the ratio of <b>breast</b> in works of art and to design a brassiere cup design according to the <b>breast</b> type of 182 female subjects in their 20 s. The subjects selected for this paper are somewhat larger than a previous study on aesthetically perfect <b>breasts</b> of foreigners according to chest breadth, center neck point to <b>breast</b> point, <b>breast</b> circumference, and <b>breast</b> volume. However, the aesthetic <b>breasts</b> of foreigners are larger than the subjects selected for this study according to chest depth, under-bust circumference, and bust point to bust point. Comparing various <b>breasts</b> types and aesthetic <b>breasts,</b> padding is necessary to complement the form of flat <b>breasts</b> to increase the volume and diameter. Brassiere cups for cone-shaped <b>breasts</b> should be designed to increase <b>breast</b> volume through an increase in nipple height.

25|$|The <b>breast</b> implant has no {{clinical}} bearing upon lumpectomy breast-conservation {{surgery for}} women who developed <b>breast</b> cancer after the implantation procedure, nor does the <b>breast</b> implant interfere with external beam radiation treatments (XRT); moreover, the post-treatment incidence of breast-tissue fibrosis is common, and thus a consequent increased rate of capsular contracture. The study <b>Breast</b> Cancer Detection and Survival among Women with Cosmetic <b>Breast</b> Implants: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Observational Studies, reported a significant delay in the diagnoses of women who developed <b>breast</b> cancer after undergoing <b>breast</b> augmentation, when compared to <b>breast</b> cancer patients who had not undergone <b>breast</b> augmentation. The metadata study <b>Breast</b> Implants following Mastectomy in Women with Early-stage <b>Breast</b> Cancer: Prevalence and Impact on Survival (2005) reported that <b>breast</b> augmentation patients were statistically likelier to die from <b>breast</b> cancer. Although the use of implants for <b>breast</b> reconstruction after <b>breast</b> cancer mastectomy appears to have no negative effect upon the incidence of cancer-related death, women who underwent a mastectomy procedure tend to die earlier than women who underwent a lumpectomy procedure, with like diagnoses.|$|R
