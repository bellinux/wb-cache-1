25|$|The Lorentz {{force is}} {{perpendicular}} {{to both the}} velocity of the electrons, {{which is in the}} plane of the disc, and to the magnetic field, which is normal (surface normal) to the disc. An electron at rest in the frame of the disc moves circularly with the disc relative to the <b>B-field</b> (i.e. the rotational axis or the laboratory frame, remember the note above), and so experiences a radial Lorentz force. In Figure 1 this force (on a positive charge, not an electron) is outward toward the rim according to the right-hand rule.|$|E
40|$|Understanding star {{formation}} rates (SFR) {{is a central}} goal of modern star-formation models, which mainly involve gravity, turbulence and, in some cases, magnetic fields (<b>B-fields).</b> However, a connection between <b>B-fields</b> and SFR has never been observed. Here, a comparison between the surveys of SFR and a study of cloud-field alignment - which revealed a bimodal (parallel or perpendicular) alignment - shows consistently lower SFR per solar mass for clouds almost perpendicular to the <b>B-fields.</b> This is evidence of <b>B-fields</b> being a primary regulator of SFR. The perpendicular alignment possesses a significantly higher magnetic flux than the parallel alignment and thus a stronger support of the gas against self-gravity. This results in overall lower masses of the fragmented components, which are {{in agreement with the}} lower SFR. Comment: Nature Astronomy 201...|$|R

25|$|Both {{of these}} EMFs, despite their {{apparently}} distinct origins, are {{described by the}} same equation, namely, the EMF is {{the rate of change}} of magnetic flux through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see below.) Einstein's special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects. In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the solenoidal vector field portion of the E-field can change {{in whole or in part}} to a <b>B-field</b> or vice versa.|$|E
25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background is polarized {{at the level of}} a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to electrostatics, in which the electric field (E-field) has a vanishing curl and the magnetic field (<b>B-field)</b> has a vanishing divergence. The E-modes arise naturally from Thomson scattering in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the South Pole Telescope in 2013; the second one is from gravitational waves arising from cosmic inflation. Detecting the B-modes is extremely difficult, particularly as the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the weak gravitational lensing signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{magnetic}} field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, {{the magnetic}} flux ΦB linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the <b>B-field</b> varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different <b>B-field,</b> ΦB will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation {{with respect to the}} <b>B-field,</b> the [...] differential element will change because of the different angle between B and dA, also changing ΦB. As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent <b>B-field,</b> and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit's component parts with time (surface ∂Σ(t) time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday's law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in ΦB.|$|E

2500|$|In the Faraday's disc example, {{the disc}} is rotated {{in a uniform}} {{magnetic}} field perpendicular to the disc, causing a current to flow in the radial arm due to the Lorentz force. It is interesting to understand how it arises that mechanical work is necessary to drive this current. When the generated current flows through the conducting rim, a magnetic field is generated by this current through Ampère's circuital law (labeled [...] "induced B" [...] in the figure). The rim thus becomes an electromagnet that resists rotation of the disc (an example of Lenz's law). On {{the far side of}} the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through {{the far side of the}} rim to the bottom brush. The <b>B-field</b> induced by this return current opposes the applied <b>B-field,</b> tending to decrease the flux through that side of the circuit, opposing the increase in flux due to rotation. On the near side of the figure, the return current flows from the rotating arm through the near side of the rim to the bottom brush. The induced <b>B-field</b> increases the flux on this side of the circuit, opposing the decrease in flux due to rotation. Thus, both sides of the circuit generate an EMF opposing the rotation. The energy required to keep the disc moving, despite this reactive force, is exactly equal to the electrical energy generated (plus energy wasted due to friction, Joule heating, and other inefficiencies). This behavior is common to all generators converting mechanical energy to electrical energy.|$|E

The space-time evolution of the <b>B-fields</b> is experimentally characterized by high-frequency bandwidth B-dot probes and by proton-deflectometry measurements. The magnetic pulses, of ns-scale, are long enough to magnetize secondary targets through resistive diffusion. We applied it in experiments of laser-generated relativistic electron transport into solid dielectric targets, yielding an unprecedented 5 -fold enhancement of the energy-density flux at 60 μ m depth, compared to unmagnetized transport conditions. These studies pave the ground for magnetized high-energy density physics investigations, related to laser-generated secondary sources of radiation and/or high-energy particles and their transport, to high-gain fusion energy schemes and to laboratory astrophysics.
