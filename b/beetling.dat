25|$|Figure-work {{seems to}} have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more {{difficult}} but also less satisfactory than sculpting with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the <b>beetling</b> brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.|$|E
500|$|... {{is one of}} the few Australian artists {{here who}} {{combines}} a firm technique with a sensitive and rich emotion. In some of the lighter landscapes in this exhibition, Miss Bellette seems to have been trying to solve some of the particular difficulties of painting Australian landscapes. The clear, strong light tends to flatten the form and bleach the colour; a problem that doesn't lend itself to the dramatic tensions and dark moods that are characteristic of her work. It requires a colder and more dispassionate approach. But when she finds landscapes to her taste, such as the rugged hills and <b>beetling</b> clouds in No. 8, the earth decaying with erosion in No. 19, or the prickly desolation of [...] "Rough Country", No. 14, she handles them with great skill and effectiveness. Her figure drawings are decisively drawn and firmly modelled. The girls have a pensive dignity as though they are pondering the burdens and joylessness of a future to be spent as caryatids. The still lives and the interior are admirable exercises in formal organisation, the colours being sombre yet rich.|$|E
500|$|The Bath Roman Temple {{stood on}} a podium more than two metres above the {{surrounding}} courtyard, approached by a flight of steps. On the approach there were four large, fluted Corinthian columns supporting a frieze and decorated pediment above. The pediment, parts of which are displayed in the museum, is the triangular ornamental section, [...] wide and [...] from the apex to the bottom, above the pillars {{on the front of}} the building. It featured the very powerful central image of the Gorgon’s head glowering down from a height of 15 metres on all who approached the temple.The great head itself has snakes entwined within its beard, wings above its ears, <b>beetling</b> brows and a heavy moustache although there is some controversy about what this really represents as Gorgons are usually female. An alternative interpretation sees the central head as the image of a water god such as the image of Oceanus, and yet another as a Celtic sun god. [...] In early 2010 various stones on the pediment were conserved and rearranged.|$|E

The book of Ainu Life and Legends by author Kyōsuke Kindaichi (published by the Japanese Tourist Board in 1942) contains the physical description of Ainu: [...] "Many have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very {{few of them}} have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But {{this is due to}} the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, <b>beetling</b> eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them." ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The Quail Ridge Reserve {{is part of}} the University of California Natural Reserve System and {{is located}} in Napa County on a {{peninsula}} {{at the southern end of}} Lake Berryessa. The reserve is composed of land owned by the US Bureau of Land Management, US Bureau of Reclamation, Quail Ridge Wilderness Conservation, California Department of Fish and Game, and UC Regents. The University NRS continues to expand on the reserve as private property owners become willing to sell parcels, thereby increasing the size of this amazing protected wildlife and ecological study site. Vegetation on Quail Ridge consists primarily of mixed oak woodland, riparian, native and non-native grasslands, and chamise chaparral. The illustrated <b>beetles</b> and species and family list in this book are the product of a <b>beetle</b> survey conducted on the reserve. <b>Beetles</b> were collected by black light at the reserve field station and in Decker Canyon, on flowering vegetation, under logs and other harborage, and along roadsides during daytime and evening hours and reared from logs.
