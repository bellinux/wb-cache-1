When Rama Rao heard he was making the film Nannu Preminchu entirely with newcomers, Rama Rao went to him and bought the rights with fifty {{thousand}} rupees borrowed from a friend and drawn from the recently opened Hong Kong <b>Bank.</b> For <b>publicity,</b> Rama Rao created newspaper and radio ads asking people when they wanted the film released. While this generated substantial curiosity, the film itself was considered a failure. Rama Rao recovered, however, and {{has gone on to}} produce a number of Indian films.|$|R
2500|$|The {{final phase}} of Reis' scheme was to buy {{controlling}} interest in the Bank of Portugal, a step which {{would allow him to}} retroactively make his fiction about Bank approval true. [...] With control of the bank, the entire counterfeiting could be swept under the rug, ensuring that there would never be any evidence of the fraud. During the summer and fall of 1925, while he and Hennies toured Angola, he had Bandeira and his own assistant Francisco Ferreira, Jr. [...] ferreting out the ownership of the Bank shares (it was secret) and buying them under the complicated rules that the Bank's charter allowed. [...] Eventually they controlled 10,000 of the 45,000 shares needed for controlling interest in the <b>bank,</b> but <b>publicity</b> led Bandeira to ease off the purchases even as he sent Reis ever more inflated false reports of the number of shares they had acquired.|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that marketing communications, particularly advertising, {{have a significant effect}} on consumers. However, an important influence on the behaviour of service consumers comes from communications that are essentially uncontrolled by the marketer. This study examined the role of marketer-controlled and marketer-uncontrolled communications on consumption-aroused feelings and service brand attitudes. Data were gathered from customers of specific service brands and comparisons were made across two different service types (retail stores and banks). The findings indicated that advertising has a significant effect on consumption-aroused feelings and service brand attitudes, whereas word-of-mouth communications affects brand attitudes only in terms of <b>bank</b> brands and <b>publicity</b> has no effect on consumption-aroused feelings or brand attitude...|$|R
