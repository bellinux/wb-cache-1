We compare two conditions which exclusively differ with respect to {{how difficult it is}} to organize and enforce <b>boycotts.</b> We find that cost increases translate into sudden price increases, and that these frequently trigger consumer <b>boycotts.</b> However, consumer <b>boycotts</b> are un-successful in holding down market prices even if collective action problems are completely eliminated. While consumer <b>boycotts</b> do not increase consumer rent, they reduce firm profits and market efficiency.

5|$|Charles Cunningham <b>Boycott</b> {{was born}} in 1832 to ReverendWilliam Boycatt and his wife Georgiana.

5|$|Early in his career, <b>Boycott</b> {{continued}} to play in his spectacles, and later switched to contact lenses. He feared his career would have ended had he not used such aids as his eyesight was poor. Boycott's initial appearances for Yorkshire failed to impress, and he was compared unfavourably to his main rival, John Hampshire. When Brian Close took over from Vic Wilson as captain of Yorkshire in 1963 he persuaded the committee to keep <b>Boycott</b> on, and was rewarded when, on 2 June 1963, <b>Boycott</b> scored 145 against Lancashire. His century was also part of a 249-run fourth wicket partnership which became a Yorkshire record. <b>Boycott</b> cemented {{his place in the}} Yorkshire XI in the 1963 season with successive scores of 76, 53, 49 not out and 50, and on 29 August made a century partnership in both innings of a match against Leicestershire with Ken Taylor. <b>Boycott</b> handed in his notice to the Ministry of Pensions that same year. After a brief loss of form he kept his place with scores of 62, 28 and 113 in the following matches. This second century again came against Lancashire, making <b>Boycott</b> the first Yorkshire cricketer to score his first two centuries in a Roses match, as the hotly contested Yorkshire versus Lancashire matches were termed.|$|E

5|$|In early 2008, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that <b>Boycott</b> would be awarded a role amongst the England coaching staff, pertaining {{in particular to}} the coaching of Andrew Flintoff back from injury. On 8 May 2008, however, the ECB revealed that <b>Boycott</b> would not hold such a position. The two {{had been involved in}} the past, and while Flintoff is an admirer of <b>Boycott,</b> the ECB stressed any coaching relationship would only be informal. <b>Boycott,</b> however, used to give informal talks to younger cricket players during his career, and the media speculated that he might find a place coaching the England U19s. <b>Boycott</b> continued in his commentating career for TMS, criticising the England team's approach to the ODI matches under Pietersen in India in November 2008.

The ambulance was escorted to Claremorris railway station, where <b>Boycott</b> and his family boarded a train to Dublin, where <b>Boycott</b> was received with some hostility. The hotel he stayed in received letters saying that it would be boycotted if <b>Boycott</b> remained.

They had awarded to them something of especial glory as being <b>boycotted</b> heroines, and were regarded {{with a certain amount}} of envy by the Miss Blakes, Miss Bodkins, Miss Lamberts, Miss Ffrenchs, and Miss Parsons of the neighbourhood. They had, none of them, as yet achieved the full honours of <b>boycotting,</b> though some of them were half-way to it. The Miss Ffrenchs told them how their father's sheep had been <b>boycotted,</b> the shepherd having been made to leave his place. The Miss Blakes had been <b>boycotted</b> because their brother had been refused a car. And the Bodkins of Ballytowngal were held to have been <b>boycotted</b> en masse because of the doings at Moytubber gorse.

5|$|Appointed vice-captain for {{the tour}} of Pakistan and New Zealand that winter, <b>Boycott</b> assumed the {{captaincy}} in 1978 for two Tests when Mike Brearley was injured, and brought with him his successful summer form. However, he was replaced upon Brearley's return. While {{the rest of the}} England team took part in warm-up matches, <b>Boycott</b> remained in Lahore and organised a special warm up match where the team would play itself. However he went on to occupy the crease {{for a long period of}} time, limiting the amount of time other players had to practice. He later stated that, as the number one batsman, he should have the most time in the middle. In the second Test match, he scored 79 and 100 not out, increasing his statistics since his return to the England team to 684 runs at 136.80. It was between this match and the third Test that Brearley broke his arm, giving <b>Boycott</b> the captaincy. <b>Boycott</b> led England to a draw in the third match, his leadership meeting mixed reviews.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>Boycott</b> and McGregor Blacker were {{involved}} in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr, the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate, from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands, and Mr O'Donnell, Carr's bailiff. The dispute began when <b>Boycott</b> and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate, and Boycott's candidates won. Carr was also the local receiver of wrecks, which meant that he was entitled to collect the salvage from all shipwrecks in the area, and guard it until it was sold in a public auction. The local receiver had a right to a percentage of the sale and to keep whatever did not sell. In 1860 Carr {{wrote a letter to the}} Official Receiver of Wrecks stating that <b>Boycott</b> and his men had illegally broken up a wreck and moved the salvage to Boycott's property. In response to this accusation, <b>Boycott</b> sued Carr for libel and claimed £500 in damages.|$|E

5|$|<b>Boycott</b> {{began playing}} for his home county in 1962 after topping the averages for Leeds, Yorkshire Colts and Yorkshire Second XI. In 414 matches for Yorkshire he scored 32,570runs {{at an average}} of 57.85, with a highest score of 260 not out against Essex, and 103centuries in all. He scored another 8,699runs in List A cricket, {{averaging}} 40.08. <b>Boycott</b> twice averaged over 100 in an English first-class season: 100.12 in 1971, and 102.53 in 1979. He is one of only two players to have achieved this twice, Mark Ramprakash was the other. <b>Boycott</b> was appointed captain of Yorkshire in 1971, but was sacked in 1978 after failing to win a trophy while in charge. He was then dismissed as a player, but reinstated after a members' revolt. During his career <b>Boycott</b> frequently clashed with other strong personalities at the club, including Fred Trueman, Brian Close and Ray Illingworth, but remained popular with the Yorkshire crowds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boycott</b> {{was also}} the first player to score 99 not out, and the first to score 99 and then a century in a Test match. The forty-eight century {{partnerships}} he was involved was a record for any England player, but has again been surpassed by Alastair Cook. In 1977 against Australia, <b>Boycott</b> became the first England player to bat on all five days of a Test match. He spent the 629 minutes at the crease for 191 runs in 1977.|$|E
5|$|<b>Boycott</b> {{went on to}} hit his highest score thus far, 165 not out, against Leicestershire, {{and ended}} his first full season with 1,446 runs {{at an average of}} 46.64, placing him second in the 1963 {{national}} batting averages.

40|$|Election <b>boycotts</b> are {{a common}} {{occurrence}} in unconsolidated democracies, particularly in the developing world, with prominent examples from recent years occurring in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia.

This paper is based in the democratization literature, with a particular focus on the behavior and vulnerabilities of hybrid or electoral authoritarian regimes. Using an original dataset with global coverage including hybrid regimes from 1981 to 2006, this paper uses event-history analysis to determine the efficacy of <b>boycotts</b> in national elections among other risk factors thought to undermine electoral authoritarian regimes as well as the possibilities for subsequent democratization occurring following both contested and <b>boycotted</b> electoral processes...|$|R
