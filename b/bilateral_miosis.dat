40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{an unusual}} {{case of a}} 65 -year-old male taking an herbal mixture containing compounds with anticholinesterase activity {{for a long period}} of time, presented with acute my myocardial infarction and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome followed by death. Clinically, there are findings correlated with anticholinesterase activity, such as <b>bilateral</b> <b>miosis,</b> diaphoresis, vomiting and fasciculation without a history of any toxic ingestion or exposure. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry screening studies identified the presence of thymol, anethole in the herbal extract and butylated hydroxytoluene in the blood sample.

40|$|We present clinical, histological, muscle {{imaging and}} {{molecular}} data from 3 patients (proband, {{his brother and}} father) of an Italian family affected by tubular aggregate myopathy (TAM). The proband was a 53 years-old woman with cramps and CK elevation. The muscle biopsy of his father, performed when he was 62 years old to investigate an asymptomatic hyperCKemia, revealed a tubular aggregate myopathy at histochemical and ultrastructural levels. The same findings were observed in the muscle biopsy of the brother {{at the age of}} 55. He had CK elevation and proximal lower limb weakness. All three patients had <b>bilateral</b> <b>miosis.</b> Muscle MRI revealed a very mild muscle involvement in the proband and his father, and a severe fatty replacement in the brother. All the patients carried a novel pathogenic mutation in ORAI 1 gene, confirmed by a functional essay on patient myoblasts and HeLa cells harboring the missense mutation that proved a dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in the cells related to a gain-of-function effect of CRAC channel. Our findings expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of tubular aggregate myopathies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Miosis occurs {{following}} {{exposure to}} toxins that decrease the sympathomimetic tone, increase the cholinergic tone, or exert sedative-hypnotic effects, {{but has not}} been reported in insulin poisoning. Case Report: A 64 -year- old woman without co-morbidities was found unconscious next to an empty insulin pen. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was 3 with absent reflexes, <b>bilateral</b> reactive <b>miosis,</b> and injection marks across the abdominal wall. The patient was endotracheally intubated, mechanically ventilated, and transferred to this hospital. At admission, the blood glucose level was 34 mg/dL. Glasgow Coma Scale remained at 3, with persistent bilater-al reactive miosis. The toxicology screening was negative for ethanol, barbiturates, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, amphetamines, cannabinoids, salicylates, acetaminophen, and cocaine. Cranial computed to-mography with angiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any structural brain lesions. Intravenous glucose was continued at 6 - 14 g/h for 3 days. On repeated neurological examinations, the patient remained deeply comatose, with partial loss of cranial nerve function. <b>Bilateral</b> reactive <b>miosis</b> persisted for 4 days. From day 5 on, the patient awoke progressively. At discharge, the patient was fully alert and orientated, without a focal neurological deficit. Conclusions: Prolonged <b>bilateral</b> reactive <b>miosis</b> can be a clinical symptom accompanying metabolic encephalopathy in se-vere insulin poisoning.

40|$|Ictal {{autonomic}} {{pupillary dilation}} is common; however, miosis is rare. We describe {{a case of}} focal seizures secondary to cortical dysplasia presenting with <b>bilateral</b> pupillary <b>miosis,</b> rendered seizure free by resective surgery. The seizure-onset zone was localized within the left middle parietal gyrus by intracranial electrographic recording. Seizure onset was coincident with focal left centroparietal fast spike activity on electroencephalography (EEG). A large region of the left frontocentral cortical dysplasia was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Complete resection of the area of cortical dysplasia and additional cortical regions of ictal activity, identified using intracranial EEG, rendered the patient seizure free...|$|R
40|$|Os autores descrevem um caso de ptose palpebral {{bilateral}} com paralisia do olhar vertical para cima, predominantemente unilateral, após acidente vascular hemorrágico do tronco encefálico. Outra característica marcante do quadro clínico foi um estado de sonolência que regrediu lentamente. Após revisão da literatura sobre a fisiopatologia da ptose palpebral e dos movimentos oculares verticais, juntamente com a análise de casos publicados, são propostas explicações para os aspectos clínicos peculiares do presente caso, sempre relacionadas ao resultado da tomografia computadorizada. ______________________________________________________________________________________________ SUMMARYThe authors {{report a}} case of <b>bilateral</b> ptosis with <b>miosis,</b> paralysis of upward gaze and of smooth pursuit movements to the right, {{as well as a}} slowly regressive state of lassitude. This syndrome followed a haemorragic brain stem infarction. After a review of the pathophysiology of ptosis and of vertical eye movements, together with analysis of data provided by computerized tomography studies - since the case was not fatal - explanations are offered for each clinical sign and it is proposed that the lesion, a paramedian, slightly deviated to the right haemorragic focus in the midbrain, with a diameter of 15 mm, might have involved several structures, namely the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, the mesencephalic reticular formation, as well as cortico-nuclear and sympathetic pathways...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a 79 -year-old Caucasian Italian woman with a transient basilar occlusion monitored by transcranial Doppler, with subsequent recanalization and clinical shrinking deficit. This is the first case of transient basilar occlusive disease diagnosed and monitored by transcranial Doppler. This case is important and needs to be reported because transient basilar occlusion may be easily diagnosed if transcranial Doppler is performed. Case presentation A 79 -year-old woman affected by chronic atrial fibrillation and not treated with oral anticoagulants, cardioverted to sinus rhythm during a gastric endoscopy. She then showed a sudden-onset loss of consciousness, horizontal and vertical gaze palsy, tetraparesis and <b>bilateral</b> <b>miosis</b> and coma. Two hours later, the symptoms resolved quickly, leaving no residual neurologic deficits. Transcranial Doppler examination showed a dampened flow in the basilar artery in the emergency examination and a restored flow when the symptoms resolved. Conclusion This is the first case of transient basilar occlusive disease diagnosed and monitored by transcranial Doppler. We believe that transcranial Doppler should be performed in all cases of unexplained acute loss of consciousness, in particular, if associated with signs of brainstem dysfunctions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Chest compression-only (CC-only) is now {{incorporated}} in the Norwegian protocol for dispatch guided CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) in cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac aetiology. We present a case that is unique and instructive as well as unusual. It {{reminds us of the}} challenges that face bystanders, dispatch centres and ambulance services when faced with possible cardiac arrest. This case report describes a 50 year old man in a rural community. He had suffered a heart attack 8 months previously, and was found unconscious with respiratory arrest in his garden one morning. Due to the proximity to the ambulance station, the paramedics were on the scene within three minutes. A chain-saw was lying beside him, but no external injuries were seen. The patient had no radial pulse, central cyanosis and respiratory gasps approximately every 30 seconds. Ventilation with bag and mask was given, and soon a femoral pulse could be palpated. Blood sugar was elevated and ECG (electrocardiogram) was normal. GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) was 3. Upon arrival of the physician staffed air ambulance, further examination revealed <b>bilateral</b> <b>miosis</b> of the pupils and continuing bradypnoea. Naloxone was given with an immediate effect and the patient woke up. The patient denied intake of narcotics, but additional information from the dispatch centre revealed that he was hepatitis C positive. After a few hours, the patient admitted to have obtained a fentanyl transdermal patch from an acquaintance, having chewed it before falling unconscious. This case report shows the importance as well as the challenges of identifying a non-cardiac cause of possible cardiac arrest, and the value of providing causal therapy. </p...|$|E

40|$|Inhibition of NK 3 {{receptor}} agonist-induced contraction in {{the rabbit}} isolated iris sphincter muscle {{was used to}} assess the in vitro functional activity of three 2 -phenyl- 4 -quinolinecarboxamides, members of a novel class of potent and selective non-peptide NK 3 receptor antagonists. In addition, an in vivo correlate of this in vitro response, namely NK 3 receptor agonist-induced miosis in conscious rabbits, was characterized with some of these antagonists. In vitro senktide (succinyl-[Asp 9,MePhe 8]-substance P (6 - 11) and [MePhe 7]-neurokinin B ([MePhe 7]-NKB) were potent contractile agents in the rabbit iris sphincter muscle but exhibited quite different profiles. Senktide produced monophasic log concentration-effect curves with a mean pD 2 = 9. 03 ± 0. 06 and mean nH= 1. 2 ± 0. 02 (n= 14). In contrast, [MePhe 7]-NKB produced shallow log concentration-effect curves which often appeared biphasic (nH= 0. 54 ± 0. 04, n= 8), preventing the accurate determination of pD 2 values. The contractile responses to the NK 3 receptor agonist senktide were antagonized in a surmountable and concentration-dependent manner by SB 223412 ((−) -(S) -N-(α-ethylbenzyl) - 3 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylquinoline- 4 -carboxamide; 3 – 30 [*]nM, pA 2 = 8. 4, slope= 1. 8 ± 0. 3, n= 4), SB 222200 ((−) -(S) -N-(α-ethylbenzyl) - 3 -methyl- 2 -phenylquinoline- 4 -carboxamide; 30 – 300 [*]nM, pA 2 = 7. 9, slope= 1. 4 ± 0. 06, n= 4) and SB 218795 ((−) -(R) -N-(α-methoxycarbonylbenzyl) - 2 -phenylquinoline- 4 -carboxamide; 0. 3 and 3 [*]μM apparent pKB= 7. 4 ± 0. 06, n= 6). Contractile responses to the NK 3 receptor agonist [MePhe 7]-NKB in the rabbit iris sphincter muscle were unaffected by SB 218795 (0. 3 and 3 [*]μM, n= 8). In contrast, SB 223412 (30 and 300 [*]μM, n= 4) and SB 222200 (0. 3 and 3 [*]μM, n= 4) inhibited responses to low concentrations (⩽ 1 [*]nM), {{to a greater extent than}} higher concentrations (> 1 [*]nM) of [MePhe 7]-NKB. Furthermore, log concentration-effect curves to [MePhe 7]-NKB became steeper and monophasic in the presence of each antagonist. SB 218795 (3 [*]μM, n= 4) had no effect on contractions induced by transmural nerve stimulation (2 [*]Hz) or substance P, exemplifying the selectivity of this class of antagonist for functional NK 3 receptors over NK 1 receptors in the rabbit. In vivo, senktide (1, 10 and 25 [*]μg i. v., i. e. 1. 2, 11. 9 and 29. 7 [*]nmol, respectively) induced concentration-dependent <b>bilateral</b> <b>miosis</b> in conscious rabbits (maximum pupillary constriction= 4. 25 ± 0. 25 [*]mm; basal pupillary diameter 7. 75 ± 0. 48 [*]mm; n= 4). The onset of miosis was within 2 – 5 [*]min of application of senktide and responses lasted up to 30 [*]min. Responses to two i. v. administrations of 25 [*]μg senktide given 30 [*]min apart revealed no evidence of tachyphylaxis. Topical administration of atropine (1 %) to the eye enhanced pupillary responses to 25 [*]μg senktide. This was probably due to the mydriatic effect of atropine since it significantly increased baseline pupillary diameter from 7. 0 ± 0. 4 [*]mm to 9. 0 ± 0. 7 [*]mm (n= 4), thereby increasing the maximum capacity for miosis. Senktide-induced miosis was inhibited by SB 222200 (1 and 2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v., i. e. 2. 63 and 5. 26 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1; maximum inhibition 100 %; n= 3 – 4), SB 223412 (0. 5 and 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v., i. e. 1. 31 and 2. 61 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1; maximum inhibition 100 %; n= 3), SB[*] 218795 (0. 5 and 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v., i. e. 1. 26 and 2. 52 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1; maximum inhibition 78 %; n= 3), and the structurally distinct NK 3 receptor antagonist SR 142801 ((S) -(N) -(1 -(3 -(1 -benzoyl- 3 -(3, 4 -dichlorophenyl) piperidin- 3 -yl) propyl) - 4 -phenylepipiperidin- 4 -yl) -N-methylacetamide; 1. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v., i. e. 2. 47 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1, maximum inhibition 92 %; n= 3). Topical administration of senktide (25 [*]μg; 29. 7 [*]nmol) to the eye induced unilateral miosis in the treated eye only. At this dose there was no significant difference (P< 0. 05) between pupillary constriction obtained by topical or i. v. senktide, and topically administered atropine had no significant effect on responses to topical senktide (n= 4). [MePhe 7]-NKB (125, 250 and 500 [*]μg, i. v., i. e. 98. 31, 196. 62 and 393. 24 [*]nmol, respectively) also induced <b>bilateral</b> <b>miosis</b> in conscious rabbits (maximum pupillary constriction= 4. 13 ± 0. 30 [*]mm; n= 4), but in contrast to in vitro studies this agonist was approximately 100 fold less potent than senktide. [MePhe 7]-NKB-induced miosis was inhibited by SB 222200 (5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v., i. e. 13. 14 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1; maximum inhibition 69 %; n= 3). In summary, SB 223412, SB 222200 and SB 218795 are potent and selective antagonists of NK 3 receptor-mediated contraction in the rabbit isolated iris sphincter muscle. In addition, NK 3 receptor agonist-induced miosis in conscious rabbits is a good in vivo correlate of the in vitro rabbit iris sphincter muscle preparation and appears to be a useful model for characterizing the pharmacodynamic profile and efficacy of structurally distinct NK 3 receptor antagonists, such as SB 222200, SB 223412, SB 218795 and SR 142801...|$|E
