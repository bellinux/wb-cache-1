Copper-Catalyzed Asymmetric Addition of Olefin-Derived Nucleophiles to Ketones A copper (I) catalyzed {{coupling}} olefins and ketones {{has been}} developed for the diastereo- and enantioselective generation of homopropargyl alcohols <b>bearing</b> <b>vicinal</b> stereocenters.

Copper-Catalyzed Enantioselective Addition of Styrene-Derived Nucleophiles to Imines We describe the catalytic generation of amines <b>bearing</b> <b>vicinal</b> stereocenters with a moderate degree of diastereoselectivity. The stereoselective hydrocupration of an unactivated olefinic component is followed by nucleophilic addition of the organocuprate to an N-phosphinoyl protected imine.

Palladium-facilitated Regioselective Nucleophilic Fluorination of Aryl and Heteroaryl Halides. The preliminary findings regarding an aryl and heteroaryl halide fluorination process facilitated by palladium as a reagent is described. Stoichiometric studies illustrate the utility of the method in producing aryl fluorides with unprecedented regioselectivity, and preliminary studies into the fluorination of five- and six-membered heteroaryl bromides are described. Halogen atom substitution as a route to irreversible oxidative addition of aryl and heteroaryl halides is discussed. This strategy may serve to facilitate the fluorination of particularly problematic heteroaryl bromide and chloride substrates. by Ian B. Perry. Thesis: S.

40|$|An {{important}} {{challenge in}} asymmetric synthesis {{is the development}} of fully stereodivergent strategies to access the full complement of stereoisomers of products bearing multiple stereocenters.

Under strongly basic conditions, O-propargyl ethers are capable of undergoing [2, 3] Wittig rearrangements to afford structurally rearranged allenic alcohols. However, O-propargyl glycolate methyl esters, when subjected to dibutylboron triflate and Hunig’s base, were observed to undergo a [2, 3] Wittig rearrangement and subsequent alkylative cyclization sequence resulting in 3 -hydroxy- 2 -furanone derivatives that have incorporated an alkyl group from the boron reagent. This unusual reaction sequence is explored in Chapter 2. Nitrogen analogs of Wittig rearrangements are investigated in Chapter 3. These aza-Wittig rearrangements of tertiary amines are less common and typically less facile than rearrangements of the corresponding ethers.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes synthetic endeavors {{aimed at}} harnessing the reactivity of arynes and cyclic alkynes toward {{the synthesis of}} heterocycles. Arynes and cyclic alkynes are highly reactive intermediates that act as electrophilic arene and alkyne surrogates. Additionally, this dissertation outlines the strategic activation of the amide C–N bond using nickel catalysis. This recently discovered mode of reactivity is employed for the generation of molecular complexity. Chapter One describes a systematic experimental and computational study of a particularly important class of arynes, 3 -halobenzynes. Our efforts show that aryne distortion, rather than steric factors or charge distribution, {{are responsible for the}} regioselectivities observed in 3 -halobenzyne trapping reactions. Experiments also validate the synthetic utility of 3 -halobenzynes for the synthesis of heterocycles, using a tandem aryne trapping / cross-coupling sequence involving 3 -chlorobenzyne. Chapter Two outlines synthetic studies pertaining to two heterocyclic aryne intermediates: the 2, 3 -pyridyne and the 4, 5 -pyrimidyne. 2, 3 -pyridyne generation and trappings were used to access a variety of functionalized pyridines in a regioselective manner. Additionally, synthetic routes to two isomeric silyl triflates, which were intended to serve as precursors to the 4, 5 -pyrimidyne, are disclosed. Subsequent 4, 5 -pyrimidyne generation and trapping experiments were ultimately unfruitful. Chapter Three reports on the synthesis of poly(benzonorbornadiene) polymers via a strategic blend of benzyne chemistry and ROMP. Through a comparative study, we demonstrate that substitution at the benzylic / allylic position prevents oxidative deformation and polymer decomposition, yet does not inhibit polymerization by common ruthenium catalysts with good control over molecular weight dispersity. Chapter Four illustrates the strategic use of cyclohexyne and the more elusive intermediate, cyclopentyne, as efficient tools for the synthesis of new heterocyclic compounds with high sp 3 character. Experimental and computational studies of the first 3 -substituted cyclohexyne are also described. The observed regioselectivities are explained by the distortion / interaction model. Chapter Five describes the generation of the first 3, 4 -piperidyne and its use as a building block for the synthesis of highly decorated piperidines. Experimental and computational studies of this intermediate are disclosed, along with comparisons to the well-known 3, 4 -pyridyne aromatic analogue. Additionally, the distortion / interaction model is used to explain the observed regioselectivities. Chapter Six pertains to the generation of two stained oxacyclic intermediates, the 4, 5 -benzofuranyne and the 3, 4 -oxacyclohexyne. In situ trapping of these intermediates affords an array of heterocyclic scaffolds. Across all trapping reactions performed, product distributions are consistent with predictions made with the distortion / interaction model. Oxygen-containing strained intermediates were also found to react with higher selectivities when compared to their corresponding nitrogen-containing analogues. Chapter Seven depicts the first non-decarbonylative Mizoroki–Heck reactions of amide derivatives. The transformation relies on the use of nickel catalysis and proceeds with sterically hindered tri- and tetrasubstituted olefins to yield products containing quaternary centers. Moreover, a diastereoselective variant of this reaction demonstrates its utility for accessing adducts <b>bearing</b> <b>vicinal</b> stereocenters.

40|$|The {{stereoselective}} synthesis of all carbon quaternary stereocenters {{is an important}} problem in synthetic chemistry due to their common occurrence in bioactive compounds. The zoanthamine class of marine natural products highlights the challenge in constructing such stereocenters. After {{a summary of the}} isolation, structure determination, and biological activities of the zoanthamine natural products, published approaches toward their chemical synthesis are reviewed. Synthetic strategies toward the carbocyclic portion of zoanthenol focus on the synthesis of the three challenging quaternary stereocenters located on the central C ring. An unusual acid-mediated SN' cyclization of a nucleophilic arene with an allylic alcohol forms the B ring and diastereoselectively constructs the benzylic C(12) quaternary stereocenter. However, difficulties with late-stage installation of the remaining C(9) quaternary stereocenter compelled the use of C ring synthons containing the vicinal C(9) and C(22) stereocenters installed at an early stage in the synthesis. Desymmetrization of a meso-anhydride containing vicinal quaternary stereocenters accomplishes this goal in an enantioselective fashion. Several C ring synthons <b>bearing</b> the <b>vicinal</b> quaternary stereocenters are elaborated with A ring fragments, and several methods for the formation of the C(11) -C(12) bond in these systems are explored. Ultimately, a radical conjugate addition strategy provides the carbocyclic core of zoanthenol with the correct relative configuration of all three quaternary stereocenters. These efforts toward the synthesis of zoanthenol highlight the difficulty in generating enantioenriched alpha-quaternary cycloalkanones derived from ketones with multiple acidic alpha-hydrogens. The first direct catalytic enantioselective access to such products is achieved by the application of chiral bidentate phosphinooxazoline (PHOX) ligands to Tsuji’s non-enantioselective allylation reactions. Cyclic allyl enol carbonates, silyl enol ethers, and allyl beta-ketoesters all provide uniformly excellent yields and high enantioselectivity in the reaction. The limitations on the substrate scope of the reaction are discussed. Preliminary studies into the mechanism of these allylation reactions with prochiral enolate fragments suggest that they occur by a different mechanism than the outer-sphere nucleophilic attack commonly proposed in the alkylation of prochiral allyl fragments. ...|$|R
40|$|Anthocyane, eine Untergruppe der Flavonoide, sind als natürliche Farbpigmente weit verbreitet in Lebensmitteln pflanzlicher Herkunft. Ihnen werden eine Reihe von gesundheitlich positiven Wirkungen zugeschrieben, was dazu geführt hat, dass auf dem Markt für Nahrungsergänzungsmittel immer mehr Produkte auf Anthocyanbasis auftauchen. Als ein möglicher nachteiliger Faktor für eine potentielle genotoxische Wirkung von Flavonoiden wird die Interaktion mit humanen Topoisomerasen diskutiert. Bezüglich einer möglichen Risiko/Nutzen-Evaluierung ist es nicht nur von Bedeutung, ob Flavonoide/Anthocyane mit diesen Enzymen interagieren, sondern auch die Art dieser Interaktion und sich möglicherweise daraus ergebende Konsequenzen, besonders im Hinblick auf die Integrität der DNA. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Anthocyanidine Delphinidin (Del), Cyanidin (Cy), Pelargonidin (Pg), Paeonidin (Pn) und Malvidin (Mv) hinsichtlich ihrer Beeinflussung humaner Topoisomerase I und II zu untersuchen. Ein Schwerpunkt lag bei der Aufklärung des Wirkmechanismus dieser Verbindungen bezüglich einer Stabilisierung des Cleavable Complex, möglichen Interaktionen mit der DNA und die Relevanz dieser Effekte für die Integrität zellulärer DNA. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass nur die Verbindungen mit vicinalen Hydroxygruppen im B-Ring des Anthocyangrundgerüstes, Del und Cy, effektiv die katalytische Aktivität isolierter humaner Topoisomerase I und Topoisomerase IIalpha + IIbeta hemmen. Sie wirken jedoch nicht wie die klassischen Topoisomerasegifte Camptothecin oder Etoposid über die Stabilisierung des kovalenten Topoisomerase-DNA-Komplexes, sondern stellen rein katalytische Inhibitoren dar. Del und Cy könnten sogar die DNA vor Topoisomerase I-Giften schützen, da sie zumindest am isolierten Enzym die Stabilisierung des Cleavable Complex der Topoisomerase I durch Camptothecin effektiv verhindern. Für alle getesteten Anthocyanidine konnte gezeigt werden, dass sie im niedrigen mikromolaren Bereich, zwischen 15 µM und 50 µM, sowohl an die kleine Furche der DNA binden, als auch in die DNA interkalieren können und das diese DNA-interagierenden Eigenschaften keinen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Hemmung der Topoisomerasen liefern. Auch wenn im Falle der Anthocyanidine die direkte DNA-Interaktion im Hinblick auf die Topoisomerasehemmung nur von geringer Bedeutung ist, so scheint sie jedoch {{relevant}} bezüglich der Integrität zellulärer DNA zu sein. Die einstündige Inkubation von HT 29 Kolonkarzinomzellen zeigte, dass bei Inkubation mit den Anthocyanidinen in Konzentrationen > 50 µM, signifikant DNA-Schäden induziert werden. Im Hinblick auf die Integrität der DNA lebender Zellen scheint der jeweilige Konzentrationsbereich von entscheidender Bedeutung zu sein. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, den Einfluss der Überexpression der Tyrosyl-DNA-Phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP 1) nach Inkubation mit Topoisomerasegiften zu untersuchen. Im Rahmen einer Kooperation mit Prof. Boege, Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf, wurden uns verschiedene Zellklone zur Verfügung gestellt, die ein Fusionsprotein aus TDP 1 und GFP überexprimierten, sowie eine katalytisch inaktive Variante des Enzymes (TDP 1 -H 263 A). Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden Untersuchungen an diesen Zelllinien zur Zytotoxizität von Topoisomerasegiften durchgeführt, sowie Untersuchungen zum Einfluss der TDP 1 auf die Induktion von DNA-Schäden durch Topoisomerasegifte. Untersuchungen zum Zellwachstum der verschiedenen Zelllinien mittels MTT-Zytotoxiziätsassay zeigten nach 72 stündiger Inkubation mit den Topoisomerasegiften Camptothecin (Topo I) und Etoposid (Topo II) keinen signifikanten Wachstumsvorteil bei Überexpression der TDP 1. Betrachtet man jedoch die Induktion von DNA-Schäden bei Kurzzeitinkubationen (1 h) von Camptothecin im Comet-Assay, so erkennt man eine signifikante Reduktion der DNA-Schäden bei Überexpression der TDP 1. Ist bei der TDP 1 das katalytische Histidin 263 gegen Alanin ausgetauscht, steigen die DNA-Schäden auf das gleiche Niveau wie bei nicht TDP 1 -überexprimierenden Zellen, d. h. es findet keine Reparatur statt. Erstaunlicherweise zeigte sich auch bei der Inkubation mit dem Topoisomerase II-Gift Etoposid, welches ursprünglich als Negativkontrolle gedacht war, der gleiche Reparatureffekt. Eine Hochregulation DNA-reparierender Enzyme ist unwahrscheinlich, da bei Inkubation mit dem DNA-methylierenden Agens N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidin (MNNG) alle Zelllinien eine vergleichbare Menge an DNA-Schäden aufwiesen. Die nunmehr erzielten Ergebnisse eröffnen erstmals die Möglichkeit den Comet-Assay, unter Verwendung der unterschiedlichen TDP 1 -Klone, zum Auffinden von TDP 1 -Hemmstoffen einzusetzen. In {{the present}} study we investigated {{the effect of the}} anthocyanidins delphinidin (DEL), cyanidin (CY), pelargonidin (PG), paeonidin (PN) and malvidin (MV) on human topoisomerases I and II and its relevance for DNA integrity within human cells. We especially focused on the mechanism of interaction with the target enzyme, particularly the stabilization of the covalent DNA-topoisomerase-intermediate (cleavable complex), possible interactions with DNA and the potential relevance for DNA integrity within human cells. Anthocyanidins <b>bearing</b> <b>vicinal</b> hydroxyl groups at the B-ring, DEL and CY, were found to potently inhibit the catalytic activity of human topoisomerases I and II, without discriminating between the IIalpha and IIbeta isoforms. However, in contrast to topoisomerase poisons, DEL and CY did not stabilize the cleavable complex. Using recombinant topoisomerase I, the presence of CY or DEL (> 1 µM) effectively prohibited the stabilization of the cleavable complex by the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin. In contrast, the stabilization of the topoisomerase II cleavable complex by etoposide remained unaffected. Using a fluorescence competition assay with ethidiumbromide or Hoechst 33258, it could be shown that at all analogues were able to compete with ethidium bromide for the intercalation into calf thymus DNA or to replace the minor groove binder Hoechst 33258. Furthermore it could be shown that at concentrations > 50 µM all anthocyanidins tested (delphinidin, cyanidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, paeonidin), including those not interfering with topoisomerases, were found to induce DNA strand breaks in the comet assay. These data indicate substantial affinity to double stranded DNA, which might contribute at least to the DNA strand breaking effect of anthocyanidins. The effect of anthocyanidins on DNA integrity appears to depend on the concentration range. A second focus of {{the present study}} was the influence of an overexpression of the tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP 1) on the effects of topoisomerase poisons. The group of Prof. Boege, Düsseldorf University Hospital, established a cell line that overexpresses a fusion protein of TDP 1 with the green fluorescent protein (GFP), as well as a catalytic inactive form of the fusionprotein (TDP 1 -H 263 A). Within the scope of a cooperation, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of topoisomerase poisons on these cell lines and the impact of the TDP 1 overexpression on DNA damage induced by topoiosmerase posions. Studies on cell growth of the different cell lines were performed using a MTT-cytotox assay. After 72 h incubation with the topoisomerase poison camptothecin (topo I) or etoposide (topo II), there was no significant advantage in cell growth when TDP 1 was overexpressed. Regarding the DNA damaging effect of a short time incubation (1 h), it could be shown that a TDP 1 overexpression results in a significant reduction of the DNA damage induced by camptothecin. If the catalytic histidine 263 of TDP 1 is mutated to alanine, the amount of DNA damage in this cell line is comparable to the parental control cell line, i. e. an active TDP 1 is needed for the “repair” of the drug-stabilized covalent topoisomerase-DNA-complex. To our utter astonishment, a similar effect was seen upon exposure to the topo II poison etoposide, initially meant as a negative control. This unexpected result seemed to suggest that overexpression of active TDP 1 confers some sort of a general resistance to DNA-damaging agents. However, this hypothesis had to be discarded because treatment of the cells with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a chemical compound that damages DNA in a manner independent of topo I or topo II, produced DNA comets of similar size in all cell lines. It might even be worthwhile to consider TDP 1 as a therapeutic cotarget of topo I and topo II poisons. These results might allow to use the comet assay, in combination with the available cell lines, to search for TDP 1 inhibitors...|$|E
