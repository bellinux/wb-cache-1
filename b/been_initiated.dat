The Uí Briain interlopers, however, do not appear to have been well received; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen, perhaps led by supporters of Lǫgmaðr himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{changing}} strengths {{between the}} two opponents prompted the Luftwaffe to make operational changes for the battle. Previous offensive campaigns had <b>been</b> <b>initiated</b> with Luftwaffe raids against opposing airfields to achieve air superiority. By {{this point in the}} war Red Army equipment reserves were extensive and the Luftwaffe commanders realised that aircraft could be easily replaced, making such raids futile. Therefore, this mission was abandoned. In addition, previous campaigns had made use of medium bombers flying well behind the frontline to block the arrival of reinforcements. This mission, however, was rarely attempted during Citadel.|$|E

It was part of a broader working class movement involving the study of nature and natural history that developed in the late 18th century and continued into the next.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the North American river otter has been {{significantly}} reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. In some regions, though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts.

A number of reintroduction projects have <b>been</b> <b>initiated</b> to help stabilize the reduction in the overall population.|$|E

5|$|There was no {{assembly}} language defined for the Mark 1. Programs {{had to be}} written and submitted in binary form, encoded as eight 5-bit characters for each 40-bit word; programmers were encouraged to memorize the modified ITA2 coding scheme to make their job easier. Data was read and written from the papertape punch under program control. The Mark 1 had no system of hardware interrupts; the program continued after a read or write operation had <b>been</b> <b>initiated</b> until another input/output instruction was encountered, {{at which point the}} machine waited for the first to complete.|$|E

5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at {{the margin of the}} continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have <b>been</b> <b>initiated</b> by a change in plate direction, or by kinematic effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of a slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E

Around €3.5 billion will be invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and Belgrade Tower. The project is, however, considered by many as 'controversial', since {{there are a number}} of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, as well as chosen architectural solutions.|$|E
5|$|In 393 BC, Conon and Pharnabazus {{sailed to}} {{mainland}} Greece, where they raided {{the coast of}} Laconia and seized the island of Cythera, where they left a garrison and an Athenian governor. They then sailed to Corinth, where they distributed money and urged {{the members of the}} council to show the Persian king that they were trustworthy. Pharnabazus then dispatched Conon with substantial funds and {{a large part of the}} fleet to Attica, where he joined in the rebuilding of the long walls from Athens to Piraeus, a project that had <b>been</b> <b>initiated</b> by Thrasybulus in 394 BC. With the assistance of the rowers of the fleet, and the workers paid for by the Persian money, the construction was soon completed. Athens quickly took advantage of its possession of walls and a fleet to seize the islands of Scyros, Imbros, and Lemnos, on which it established cleruchies (citizen colonies).|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} for Times Higher Education, Jack Harris says that Walker is an {{extremely}} good writer and even {{those who do not}} specialise in technical fields will derive enjoyment from the book. According to Harris, Walker has unique experience as historian to the NRC which has placed him in an unrivalled position to tell the TMI story. But Harris identifies some omissions in the book. There is little on the other two major nuclear that threatened large civilian populations: the Windscale fire (UK, October 1957), and the Chernobyl disaster (Ukraine, April 1986). Harris states that Windscale threw up similar problems to TMI, particularly relating to whether large-scale evacuations should have <b>been</b> <b>initiated,</b> but he could find no reference to the Windscale accident in the book's index which is surprising in a book that aims to put TMI in historical perspective.|$|E

5|$|Parashurameshvara Temple {{is one of}} the Parashurameshvara {{group of}} temples, {{considered}} to be the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar. Some historians believe Parashurameshvara Temple to have been built in the early 8th century CE., subsequent to the construction of the Satruguneswar, Bharateswar and Lakshmaneswar temples in the late 7th century, although K.C.Panigrahi places the date as 650 CE. Fergusson believed that the temple might have <b>been</b> <b>initiated</b> at around 500 CE. A mid-7th century date is agreed by most scholars based on style and the presence of the eight planets which appear over the door to the inner sanctum as the later temples portray nine.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish {{historian}} T. I. Itkonen {{mentions that}} A.muscaria was once used among the Sami people: sorcerers in Inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots. In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken {{published an article}} in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan. There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of A.muscaria among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it {{was known as the}} miskwedo. This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking. There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have <b>been</b> <b>initiated</b> into traditional Tlicho use of Amanita muscaria.|$|E
5|$|The first {{official}} inquiries into establishing ionosphere research in Svalbard {{was taken by}} Leiv Harang, then head of the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI), in October 1950. Two similar facilities, a completed one at Kjeller and one under construction in Tromsø, had already <b>been</b> <b>initiated.</b> The proposal, regarded by Harang as primarily a military project, was initially issued to the United States. It was considered by US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who {{saw it as a}} possible excuse to populate Spitsbergen as a counter-measure to the Soviet mining communities. However, nothing came of the plans before the International Geophysical Year in 1957–58, when an ionosphere research station was established as Isfjord Radio and moved to Ny-Ålesund in 1963. Although unrelated to the telemetry station, this was the initiation of technology services in Ny-Ålesund.|$|E
