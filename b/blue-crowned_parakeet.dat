50|$|The <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> is a {{medium-sized}} bird measuring approximately 37 cm {{in length and}} weighing between 140 and 190 g.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet,</b> blue-crowned conure, or sharp-tailed conure (Thectocercus acuticaudatus) is a {{small green}} Neotropical parrot with a blue head and pale beak native to large parts of South America, from eastern Colombia in the north to {{northern}} Argentina in the south. They inhabit savanna-like habitats, woodland and forest margins, but avoid dense humid forest such as the Amazon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet's</b> nest is {{a hole in}} a tree. The {{eggs are}} white and there are usually three to four in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for 26 days, and the chicks fledge from the nest about 52 days after hatching.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeets</b> are {{generally}} called blue-crowned conures in aviculture. They are social birds and are relatively good talkers {{compared to other}} conures. [...] They have become quite popular as pets, with {{a reputation as one}} of the [...] "easier" [...] parrots to care for. However, they are also intelligent, high-energy birds that require a lot of attention and a cage with ample room and toys. They can also be quite loud at times. Consequently, they are more appropriate companions for serious bird enthusiasts rather than the casual birdkeeper.|$|R
5000|$|The {{peninsula}} is {{the only}} home of the endangered yellow-shouldered amazon parrot, and {{is also home to}} the <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet.</b> The seasonal watercourses, or quebradas, are the main nesting and feeding grounds for the yellow-shouldered amazon. They are being mined for sand and gravel to be used in construction, and in some areas the parrot is hunted, considered a pest that robs jocote orchards.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of the national park in the Chaco - Monte ecotones entails the presence of representative species of both biomes. Chaco species such as the gray brocket, Chacoan mara, <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> and Argentine boa coexist with characteristic species of the Monte, such as the pink fairy armadillo, sandy gallito and Darwin's tree iguana, among others. About 270 vertebrate species {{are found in the}} park, including 4 introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The World Wildlife Fund {{gives the}} {{ecoregion}} {{the status of}} [...] "Critical/Endangered".Deforestation and exploitation of sand and gravel around streams in Macanao threatens the habitat of the Yellow-shouldered Amazon.The capture for trade of Yellow-shouldered Amazon and <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>Parakeet</b> threaten these species with extinction.All the dry vegetation in Araya and Macanao is at risk from overgrazing by goats.Adventure tourists drive vehicles along the protected beaches of La Restinga National Park and destroy turtle nests.The Cumaná lagoons are threatened by urbanization, pollution and introduction of exotic species.|$|E
50|$|Due to the climatic {{regime of}} the Gran Chaco, herpetofauna are {{restricted}} to moist refugia in various places throughout the chaco. Rotting logs, debris piles, old housing settlement, wells, and seasonal farm ponds are examples of such refugia. The black-legged seriema (Chunga burmeisteri), <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Aratinga acuticadauta), Picui ground dove (Columbina picui), guira cuckoo (Guira guira), little thornbird (Phacellodomus sibilatrix) and many-colored Chaco finch (Saltaitricula multicolor) are notable of the 409 bird species that are resident or breed in the Gran Chaco. 252 of these Chaco species are endemic to South America.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of this genus {{has recently been}} resolved by splitting it in four genera as the genus as previously defined was paraphyletic. The species of the Aratinga solstitialis complex, were retained in this genus, while other former Aratinga species were moved to Eupsittula (brownish-throated species), Psittacara (pale-beaked species) and Thectocercus (<b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet).</b> Furthermore, the closely related nanday parakeet (Aratinga nenday) and the dusky-headed parakeet (Aratinga weddellii) are placed in this genus. The nanday parakeet was previously placed in its own genus based on the differences in coloration and elongated upper mandible, {{but this was not}} supported by phylogenetic studies that showed a close relationship with the solitarius complex species.|$|E
50|$|The Macanao Peninsula and the westernmost {{part of the}} Araya Peninsula are {{important}} areas for threatened neotropical birds, particularly the yellow-shouldered amazon (Amazona barbadensis), which is in demand for the pet trade.The subspecies Margarita <b>blue-crowned</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Thectocercus acuticaudatus neoxena) found in the mangroves around the La Restinga lagoon, is also threatened by pet trade.The lagoon complex around Cumaná, the Golf of Cariaco salina and the Araya peninsula lagoons provide refuges to many species of birds. The Chacopata Lagoon has the largest pelican colony in Venezuela, and is used by large groups of flamingos.Beaches on Margarita are used for breeding by the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) and green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas).The north coast of the Paria Peninsula is the main nesting zone for the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) in Venezuela.Maragarita is home to subspecies of the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus margaritae) and the Margaritan tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella margaritae).|$|E
