5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. Therefore, it {{is known as the}} Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display {{for the first time with}} six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. A first, quick look by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx. It was found in a limestone <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.|$|E
5|$|At the Falls of Arcadia, {{a fictional}} planned {{community}} in San Diego County, California, disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives {{at home to}} find a package from an unknown person. The package contains a tacky whirligig, which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors. While in <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> night, Kline hears an intruder in the house. He goes to investigate while his wife, Nancy, stays in bed. A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E

5|$|The Red River had {{a history}} of {{seasonal}} flooding, aggravated by the broad ancient lake <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> formed the Red River Valley. The 1997 Red River Flood caused extensive damage in the city. Fargo was upstream from the bulk of the flood waters that season, and Winnipeg had built an extensive system of flood control structures in the 1960s. In 1997 Grand Forks suffered the most damage of any major city in the Red River Valley. During the height of the flooding, a major fire destroyed eleven buildings in the downtown area. The government began developing a new levee system to protect the city, which was completed ten years later. It required the relocation of numerous residents as some neighborhoods were emptied for this construction.|$|E
5|$|The girl, near death, {{is being}} ministered to by paramedics, fantasizing and being 'sexually aroused {{by a large}} python and writhing on a <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> lit up {{in time with the}} music, while {{surrounded}} by a group of bemused, semi-naked dancers'. When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, jump out of the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E
5|$|The main {{collectibles}} {{available in}} Pokémon Channel are trading cards that display various Pokémon. The trading cards, known in game as Nice Cards, exist in three forms: Single, which simply show a picture; Motion, which are holographic; and Platinum, which are holographic {{and play the}} respective Pokémon's cries. The collectibles can be found by having Pikachu speak with other Pokémon and help them with tasks, or by ordering from Shop 'n Squirtle. There is a virtual Pokémon Mini console hidden under the player's <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> plays six games: Snorlax's Lunch Time (exclusive to Pokémon Channel) and five others previously released for the real-life Pokémon Mini. The games are simple and mainly based on rhythm.|$|E
50|$|Ball-and-pillow {{structures}} are masses of clastic sediment {{that take the}} form of isolated pillows or protruding ball structures.

It is also possible to find ball-and-pillows in limestone <b>beds</b> <b>that</b> overlie shale, but it's less common. They are normally hemispherical or kidney shaped, and range in size from a few inches to several feet.|$|R

5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, in his diary, about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a <b>bed),</b> <b>that</b> he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E
5|$|Ocepeia is {{from the}} Paleocene of Morocco's Ouled Abdoun Basin, {{although}} its fossils were initially thought to be earliest Ypresian (early Eocene) in age. That age has been revised, {{and now it is}} known that O. daouiensis comes from the same bone <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> is dated to the Selandian age of the Paleocene (59-60 MYA), which also yields Eritherium, Abdounodus, and Lahimia. O. grandis is slightly younger (more recent) in age, occurring in the Thanetian bone bed of the same area. Its larger size and younger age suggest it is in the same evolutionary lineage as O. daouiensis. The area of western Morocco during the late Cretaceous through the Eocene consisted of warm, shallow inland seas, where the ancient Tethys Ocean met the Atlantic Ocean, and during which phosphate deposits and associated fossils accumulated over some 25 million years.|$|E
5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers were able {{to make it through the}} barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on the eastern side of the camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge in a dry creek <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down. In an attempt to save the defenders at Lang Vei, Company C Headquarters in Da Nang tried to call for reinforcements from the Marines at Khe Sanh, but its request was also turned down. Finally, Company C Headquarters placed another Mobile Strike Force Company and a company-sized unit on standby alert in Da Nang, to be airlifted into battle as soon as helicopters were available.|$|E

25|$|The {{second was}} a lens of {{sandstone}} that formed after the ceratopsian bonebeds cataloged as H97-12. This lens of sandstone penetrated {{down into the}} <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> hosted the ceratopsian bonebeds, probably deposited by a creek. Like H97-09, H97-12 contained only fragmentary remains of aquatic vertebrates like crocodiles and turtles.|$|E
25|$|The sand {{was washed}} from Broken Hill, and {{laid down in}} a <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> is about 200 metres thick. Currents washed through it, {{leaching}} {{out most of the}} minerals and leaving a very poor rock that made an insipid soil. They washed out channels in some places, while in others, the currents formed sand banks that show a characteristic current bedding or cross-bedding that can often be seen in cuttings.|$|E
25|$|An {{electric}} blanket is a blanket with an integrated electrical heating device usually placed above the top bed sheet. The first {{electric blanket}} {{was invented in}} 1912 by American physician Sidney I. Russell. This earliest form of an electric blanket was an 'underblanket' under the <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> covered and heated from below. In 1937, Electric 'overblankets which lie {{on top of the}} sleeping person were introduced in the United States.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, the Royal Tyrell Museum finally {{performed}} a preliminary {{survey of the}} area studied by Langston and Taylor and entire new bonebeds were discovered.
