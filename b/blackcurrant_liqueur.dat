5000|$|The case {{concerned}} {{the sale of}} [...] "Cassis de Dijon" [...] (a type of crème de cassis) in Germany by an importer and retailer (Rewe). Crème de cassis is a <b>blackcurrant</b> <b>liqueur</b> produced in France containing 15% to 20% alcohol by volume. The German government had a law stipulating that products sold as fruit liqueur had to contain at least 25% alcohol by volume. Therefore, the Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein (a section of the German Federal Ministry of Finance) told Rewe that the Cassis de Dijon might be imported: on the other hand, it advised the importer that its marketing wasn't allowed in Germany. The importer argued that this represented an effect equivalent to a quantitative restriction on trade in breach of article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.|$|E
