500|$|Casino Royale {{had been}} {{produced}} as a 1954 television episode and a 1967 satirical film. [...] Eon Productions gained {{the rights to}} Casino Royale in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to Spider-Man. In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming {{to bring back the}} flavour of Ian Fleming's original Bond novels. Paul Haggis' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her." ...|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{would not}} be available, since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend {{most of her time}} in the hospital. As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner out from behind the desk, and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was a big hole when Mulder was gone, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Robert came in and did a wonderful job. He brought a really good energy to the set, and it was a lot of fun getting to know and work with him." [...] In addition, Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode, since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett. [...] Robert Patrick called the episode his [...] "favorite episode," [...] because the writers saw a chance to really create a [...] "vulnerable" [...] moment for the his character, John Doggett.|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale reboots the series, {{establishing}} a new timeline and narrative framework {{not meant to}} precede or succeed any previous Bond film. Barbara Broccoli stated that [...] "For years, my father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail... We {{wanted to make a}} tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting [...] "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we {{decided to go back to}} the basics and update". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Vesper [...] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1985 O'Donnell {{was named}} in the 12 man Australian one day squad. [...] ""I am very delighted," [...] he said. [...] "It {{will be the biggest}} thrill of my life to walk out on to the MCG on Sunday. It was my goal {{at the start of the}} year to try and make {{national}} selection, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> might not come for two or three years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in 2013 {{about the}} 1993 petition, {{shortly before his}} death, Popović said: [...] "I signed a letter that was sent to Clinton asking {{for some sort of}} limited {{intervention}} against the official Belgrade like bombing the airports from which the planes are taking off for Bosnia. I didn't entirely agree with the letter as a whole, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> some form of intervention had to happen in accordance with the convention on the genocide prevention".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{was sitting}} at my desk {{examining}} the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn't that I believed I could make it work, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn't working, {{but it was all}} I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn't understand how I'd missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I'd keep coming back to my desk looking {{to see if it was}} still there. It was still there. I couldn't contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I ever do again will mean as much." ...|$|E

2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This is not fair. There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1975, he {{audition}}ed for the Broadway play A Matter of Gravity. Katharine Hepburn watched his audition and cast him as her character's grandson in the play. With Hepburn's {{influence over the}} CBS network, Reeve worked out the schedules of Love of Life and the play {{so that he would}} be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals, and suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition. On the first night of the play's run, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, [...] "This boy's a goddamn fool. He doesn't eat enough red meat." [...] The understudy finished the play for him, and Reeve was treated by a doctor who advised him to eat a more healthy diet. He stayed with the play throughout its year-long run and was given very favorable reviews. He and Hepburn became very close. She said, [...] "You're going to be a big star, Christopher, and support me in my old age." [...] He replied, [...] "I can't wait that long." [...] A romance between the two was rumored in some gossip columns. Reeve said, [...] "She was sixty-seven and I was twenty-two, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was quite an honor...I believe I was fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her." [...] Reeve said that his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles in 1976, Reeve— to Hepburn's disappointment— dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the play's run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer instead of just sending messages back and forth.|$|E
