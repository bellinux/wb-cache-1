40|$|Overview] The {{statistics}} of annual accounts of public funds, institutions and enterprises (Statistik der Jahresabschl 6 ffentlicher Fonds, Einrichtungen und Unternehmen, abbreviated as JAB) contains information on annual balance sheets, income statements, reports on assets and appropriations of earnings of all publicly owned funds, institutions and enterprises (6 ffentliche Fonds, Einrichtungen und Unternehmen, abbreviated as FEUs) in Germany. The {{definition of a}} public entity is based on 7 2 Abs. 1 Nr. 10 und Abs. 3 Finanz- und Personalstatistikgesetz (FPStatG), according to which entities {{are considered to be}} public, given that their public owners, like the Federation, federal states and local governments, own at least a 50 percent share of nominal capital or voting rights. FEUs fulfill public tasks in economically and organizationally separate entities, which can either be subject to private or to public law. [ [...] . ] This data documentation is structured as follows: Section 1. 2 presents the variables contained in the data set as well as the sample size; Section 1. 3 provides information on the distribution of FEUs across all German L 4 nder. Section 2. 1 is concerned with the legal forms that the entities in the panel exhibit: The variables and descriptive results are presented in Section 2. 1. 1, followed by an outline of the legal requirements for municipal economic activity and a brief overview of different legal forms of FEUs on the municipal level in Section 2. 1. 2. Additionally, changes in legal form across time are examined in Section 2. 1. 3. Standards for annual accounts and exemptions from report on assets are approached in Section 2. 2 and Section 2. 3, respectively. Section 3 covers information on the number and characteristics of owners involved with FEUs. Section 4 examines the industries in which the entities conduct their business.

40|$|State {{organisational}} units still compile {{their budget}} as incremental {{and as such}} it therefore disregards causes of the origination of costs and does not put a sufficient pressure on increase in efficiency of economy. This article aims to propose a budgetary setup for operating costs using the methods of ABC/ABM (Activity Based Costing/Activity Based Management) in state organisational units (SOU). Essence of the proposed procedure towards budgetary setup as well as cost management is specification of such cost drivers that reflect the causal link between activities of the given organisation and indirect operating costs. Through a system of linear equations there is in turn resolved parity between demands on budgetary funding of a specific activity and full costs of activities. Using a multiple regression analyses, for selected cost groups there was also tested their dependence upon criteria that may act as general cost drivers. Undertaken research has also uncovered that frequently used variable “number of workers” cannot explain the analysed cost groups. Benefit of proposed solutions is increase in efficiency of SOU economy. This way, the management receives a tool for budgeting and cost control not only within the process structure based on activities, but also within individual items of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|E

Because of a fixed annual budget at the national level, these results directly imply that the upcoding led to a budget reallocation which increased the share of health spending that went to for-profit hospitals, at the expense of public nonresearch hospitals.

40|$|For {{the republics}} of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) as for many other {{transition}} economies, {{an important step in}} introducing a more market-oriented system was the restructuring of their budget systems. This paper reviews and evaluates the process of budget system reform during the transition period extending from the time they emerged from the collapse of the SFRY in 1989 until the end of 2002. For at least a decade of this period, the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to these countries to facilitate such reforms. Based on the material generated by this effort, the authors offer a review of the progress made and an assessment of the reform elements still to be completed. Given that the former Yugoslav republics all commenced the reform process with the same institutions, this paper offers a unique opportunity to analyze the critical elements in successful budget system reform. An attempt is made to explain the varying degrees of success experienced by different countries, and a reform agenda is suggested to guide future TA.
