The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E

The assassination of Aetius in 454 and the subsequent retreat of Roman forces to the south of the Alps marked the definitive end of Roman power in Switzerland, {{and the beginning of the}} transition to the Middle Ages.|$|E

This {{was once an}} area of industry, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> has gone, {{to be replaced by}} housing estates, light industrial units, and playing fields. At the northern end of Gosty Tunnel, a layby marks the site when a tug was once kept to pull barges through the tunnel. Beyond lies Hawne Basin, refurbished as a marina after its use as a railway interchange ceased in 1967. The head of navigation is just beyond the basin entrance. Much of the remaining route to the tunnel mouth is traceable, and the Lapal Tunnel Trust have carried out some restoration, as they have also done on the section from the eastern portal to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal at Selly Oak.|$|E
25|$|Far {{from finding}} the exact figure of Armenian casualties, some {{researchers}} have at least tried to provide some figures of losses {{during the war and}} what followed based on some sources. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is rough estimates or are based on calculations of others. An example here might be the cases of Justin McCarthy, since {{he is one of the}} rare researcher that has worked with Ottoman records, various Ottomanists have recycled his figures. Scholarly consensus, however, has largely followed the conclusions presented by Levon Marashlian's study (arriving at a figure of 1.2 million), which claimed that McCarthy's approach suffers from a fatal methodological flaw: in basing his results on inaccurate records. Marashlian maintains there was a reciprocal undercounting on the Ottoman's government's part on the one hand, and underreporting by Armenians, on the other. McCarthy, nonetheless, claims that his results and the Ottoman adult male records were accurate. Others go on to criticize McCarthy in not only having undercounted the prewar Armenian population, but also overcounting the survivors. McCarthy, for his part, argue that his works are too easily labeled by academia as a Turkish-apologist, and complains of a lack of scholarly debate.|$|E

500|$|As {{stated by}} Warren Ellis, Hellblazer's major themes were cynicism, {{nihilism}} and [...] "sudden violence", with the protagonist oftentimes narrating {{the story in}} dark proses with occasional breaking of the fourth wall.

His friends, family, and others would be sacrificed or {{be caught in the}} crossfire, many of them are dead or have left him.
