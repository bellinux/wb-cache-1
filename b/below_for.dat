5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 <b>below</b> <b>for</b> possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main difference was that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E

They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|In Pseudo-Kodinos' work, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch ranks 24th in the {{imperial}} hierarchy, between the Eparch and the megas hetaireiarches. The Grand Droungarioss distinctive court dress, as reported by Pseudo-Kodinos, consisted of a gold-brocaded hat (skiadion), a plain silk kabbadion tunic and a staff (dikanikion) with a gilded knob on top, and covered with golden-red braid <b>below.</b> <b>For</b> ceremonies and festivities, he bore the domed skaranikon, of yellow and golden silk and decorated with gold wire embroidery, and with {{a portrait of the}} emperor seated on a throne in front and another with the emperor on horseback on the rear.|$|E
5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from {{a volcanic}} vent or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given <b>below</b> <b>for</b> each type.|$|E

Lubbock saw temperatures at or <b>below</b> freezing <b>for</b> 207 hours. The Dallas-Fort Worth airport measured temperatures at or <b>below</b> freezing <b>for</b> a total of 296 consecutive hours.

5|$|Many {{bacteria}} (such as E. coli) {{have two}} distinct modes of movement: forward movement (swimming) and tumbling. The tumbling {{allows them to}} reorient and makes their movement a three-dimensional random walk. (See external links <b>below</b> <b>for</b> link to videos.) The flagella of a unique group of bacteria, the spirochaetes, are found between two membranes in the periplasmic space. They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{properties}} of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, {{the properties}} of the elements likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams <b>below</b> <b>for</b> atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed, that led to the establishment of the periodic law ({{the properties of}} the elements recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.|$|E
5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing enzyme inhibition. Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition <b>below</b> <b>for</b> more information.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described <b>below</b> <b>for</b> courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, they even bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors <b>below.</b> <b>For</b> faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
