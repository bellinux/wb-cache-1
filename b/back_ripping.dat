When I rode after him the cowmen said I {{was as good as}} killed. I made a lance by driving a nail into the end of a short pole and sharpening it. After he had chased me, I wheeled my broncho, and hurled the lance into his <b>back,</b> <b>ripping</b> a wound as long as my hand. That put the fear of Providence into him and took the fight all out of him. I drove him uphill and down, and across canyons at a dead run for eight miles single handed, and loaded him on a freight car; but he came near getting me once or twice, and only quick broncho work and lance play saved me.|$|E
50|$|An epitaph to Tamiki Hara was {{originally}} built by his {{friends at the}} site of Hiroshima Castle.

50|$|Kimberly {{was thrilled}} when Brooke chose {{her to be}} Forrester's newest model. While {{modeling}} the show-stopper, {{the back of the}} dress was caught on a hook on the runway. When the <b>back</b> <b>ripped</b> off, Kimberly was left utterly humiliated. This began a war between the Spectras and the Forresters. The Spectras were convinced the Forresters did it to humiliate Kimberly while the Forresters were convinced the Spectras did it to ruin the show. The incident was soon overshadowed when Macy and Thorne broke up over it, and Kimberly began to resent Brooke, who she felt seduced Thorne to destroy his relationship with her sister. After finally putting C.J. off once and for all, Kimberly returned to pursuing Rick, even encouraging him to divorce Amber so they could be together. When she saw how Amber didn't want Becky near the baby, she pushed Rick to find out why. Despite her disapproval of what Brooke did to her half-sister, Kimberly accepted a modeling position with Forrester when Brooke offered it as they both knew it was Brooke's way of trying to come between Rick and Amber.|$|R

50|$|On {{the night}} of the match, Brell has Samantha kidnapped and orders Rip to go ten minutes through the fight then lose the fight to save her life. As the battle begins, Samantha manages to escape, but just as Brell's goons corner her, Charlie rescues her by {{knocking}} them out with a fire extinguisher. Zeus has the upper hand {{at the start of the}} fight, ruthlessly pummeling Rip, even trying to kill him by ripping out one of the steel posts and trying to run Rip through. Randy cheers to urge his brother to fight <b>back.</b> <b>Rip</b> is re-energized by Randy's words and once he sees Samantha is safe, gains a second wind and starts to turn the tides on Zeus. The fight destroys the ring, with Rip and Zeus continuing the battle up the through the stands as a disbelieving Brell watches from the control room. Rip finally puts an end to the match by knocking Zeus off a catwalk, which causes him to fall through the ring and lose. A frustrated Brell begins destroying electrical equipment, in total disbelief over Zeus' loss. Rip angrily goes after Brell intending to repay him for his misdeeds. In fear, Brell retreats, but accidentally touches live wires he has exposed in his tirade and dies from being electrocuted. With his enemies now vanquished, Rip celebrates his victory with Randy and his friends.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Vulgar Display of Power, Pantera's fifth {{album is}} not only {{considered}} one of the band's best, but {{is also one of the}} defining albums of early '90s metal. The band's chemistry really begins to gel with collective symmetry here, as a pre-Dimebag Darrell (he was known as Diamond Darrell <b>back</b> then) <b>rips</b> the strings of his axe like a rabid weasel, frontman Phil Anselmo following in kind with chaotic vocal utterances, and the rhythm section of Vinnie Paul and Rex Brown keeping the rhythms in check and the whole mess glued together with low end prowess.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{protective}} reef, the surf is dangerous for swimming. On account of powerful waves which break on the shore resulting in <b>back</b> flow, <b>rip</b> currents have caused drowning incidents. Specialist bodyboarders and surfers surf on the shorebreak, particularly on {{the eastern side of the}} beach where the river joins the ocean. Because of its scenic beauty with the back drop of volcanic rock cliffs and the Pacific Ocean in the foreground, the beach is a popular landscape setting among painters and for commercial photos. The beach was used in the 1958 World War II romantic movie South Pacific where a scene depicted Mitzi Gaynor singing “I'm Going to Wash that Man Right out of my Hair". In the movie, the nurses' quarters were set on Lumaha'i Beach but signed as [...] "Nurses’ Beach".|$|R
5000|$|The {{second season}} {{was the first}} to feature three {{different}} kinds of eliminations; also, the camera effects were removed. The contestant {{on the left side of}} the stage was seated in front of a seemingly normal brick wall. If they lost, his/her chair was pulled backwards and upon hitting the wall a trap door would swing open to allow the contestant to be pulled backstage. The door was then shut to [...] "trap" [...] the contestant behind the wall. The contestant in the middle was in front of a doorway lined with blue wallpaper. Upon elimination, he would be pulled <b>back</b> and <b>rip</b> through the wallpaper, with a black curtain lowered in front of the contestant to keep him hidden them from view. The contestant on the right was in the infamous [...] "flipper" [...] chair, which was yanked upwards and backwards so that the stage floor was now the wall from the vantage point of the audience.|$|R

Rip's daughter took him home to live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout cheery farmer for a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that used to climb upon his <b>back.</b> As to <b>Rip's</b> son and heir, who was the ditto of himself, seen leaning against the tree, he was employed to work on the farm; but evinced an hereditary disposition to attend to any thing else but his business.|$|R
5000|$|The guitar is of Italian {{workmanship}} {{and still}} bears intact and perfect the original label of its maker, [...] "Gaetano Vinaccia, Napoli, Rua Catalana, No. 46, 1834". It is constructed of native maple wood without figure, {{the back and}} sides being varnished golden yellow. The edges of the table were originally inlaid, but this decoration is now missing. The ebony bridge has been at some late period attached to the table very rudely by two rough screws, and the points of the bridge terminate with fanciful and delicately carved tracery in ebony, which is placed in relief over {{the lower part of}} the table. Its fingerboard shows signs of having been decorated also, and there remain but three of its pegs. It was damaged during the Siege of Paris (1870-71), when a Prussian artillery officer kicked it. Its body, head, neck, and fingerboard got scorched by fire and its <b>back</b> was <b>ripped</b> off. A friend of Gounod's found it and put it in the Museum of the Paris Opera.|$|R
25|$|In the 1967 Italian Grand Prix at Monza after {{starting}} from pole, Clark was leading in his Lotus 49 (chassis R2), when a tyre punctured. He lost an entire lap while having the wheel {{changed in the}} pits. Rejoining sixteenth, Clark <b>ripped</b> <b>back</b> through the field, progressively lowering the lap record and eventually equalling his pole time of 1m 28.5s, to regain the lost lap and the lead. He was narrowly ahead of Brabham and Surtees starting the last lap, but his car had not been filled with enough fuel for such a performance: it faltered, and finally coasted {{across the finish line}} in third place.|$|R
50|$|The house {{remained}} {{within the}} Balch family until 1916, though with periods of tenant rental. It was then {{acquired by the}} Balch Family Association. They hired Norman Isham, a popular preservation architect, to evaluate the house. After finding original rafters in the attic, he recommended that the <b>back</b> lean-to be <b>ripped</b> off and the southern half of the house be dismantled. This plan was eventually modified to expose and recreate the roofline of the original story and a half structure. Thus today's house has been heavily shaped by intentional restoration. In 1932, the home {{was turned over to}} the Beverly Historical Society, which maintains and operates it today.|$|R

5000|$|... ===Knee=== This {{suspension}} {{takes place}} hooked from the knees and hung vertically {{with the head}} closest {{to the ground and}} the knees at the top. There is no standard for hook placement on this suspension, as it depends almost solely on the anatomy of the suspendee. Some people refer to this as a [...] "Falkner" [...] suspension since Allen Falkner is the first known person to ever attempt this particular configuration. This style is relatively new, but is quickly growing in popularity. It is not considered to be an extremely painful suspension, but the drawbacks include lower <b>back</b> pain and <b>ripping</b> of skin in the areas around the knees. Another factor of this suspension is the increased blood pressure to the brain due to the inverted position, which can lead to disorientation and cause headaches.|$|R
5000|$|Tony Isabella wrote {{a two-year}} story arc in which Blaze {{occasionally}} encountered an unnamed character {{referred to as}} [...] "the Friend" [...] who helped Blaze stay protected from Satan.

40|$|A {{series of}} Class B burning-brand tests were {{performed}} on experimental modules using high-temperature, back-surface materials to develop the technology base required to construct fire-ratable modules. Results indicate the existence of synergistic relationships between hydrocarbon encapsulation materials and the experimental module configurations that provide increased fire resistance. These configurations use Kapton, fiberglass, neoprene rubber, stainless-steel foil or aluminum foil as the back surface. Successful test results occur when the structural integrity of the module back surface is maintained. Test failures of these modules always occur for one of three reasons: the outermost <b>back</b> cover melts, <b>rips,</b> or is too porous. In each case flammable molten encapsulant, its gaseous byproducts, or both, penetrates the back surface of the module and bursts into flame. Future efforts to complete the technology base will concentrate on the spread-of-flame test, focusing on the more promising configurations identified in the initial series of tests...|$|R

From the side next the wall Uri <b>ripped</b> <b>back</b> the moss and removed three of the logs. The jagged ends he sawed off and replaced so that the projecting row remained unbroken. Fortune carried in sacks of flour from the cache and piled them on the floor beneath the aperture.

In 2002, Michael Strahan and the Giants negotiated on a new contract. He said the team failed to negotiate after he turned down its first contract proposal. He accused the front office of not trying to be competitive in 2002. Four days later, running <b>back</b> Tiki Barber <b>ripped</b> him for being selfish and greedy.

50|$|The sea otter, Enhydra lutris, is {{a member}} of the Mustelidae that is fully aquatic. Sea otters are the {{smallest}} of the marine mammals, but they are also the most dexterous. Sea otters are known for their ability to use stones as anvils or hammers to facilitate access to hard-to-reach prey items. There are three recognized subspecies of otters, all of which exhibit tool use behavior in some capacity. Tool use behavior is more associated with geographic location than sub-species. Most behavioral research has been conducted on Enhydra lutris nereis, the Californian otter, and some has been conducted on Enhydra lutris kenyoni, the Alaska sea otter. Sea otters frequently use rocks as anvils to crack open prey, and they are also observed to rip open prey with their forepaws. While laying on their <b>backs,</b> otters will <b>rip</b> apart coral algae to find food among the debris. The frequency of tool use varies greatly between geographic regions and individual otters. Regardless of the frequency, The use of tools is present in the behavioral repertoire of sea otters and is performed when most appropriate to the situation.|$|R
