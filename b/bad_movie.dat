25|$|By 2004, it was {{observed}} that since the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, Paltrow's film career had been less noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned. She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several <b>bad</b> <b>movie</b> choices, agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse. During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children. In The Guardian, she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: The Royal Tenenbaums, Proof, and Sylvia fell into the former category, while she signed on to View from the Top and Shallow Hal for the latter.|$|E

Despite negative reviews, the film made US$170.3 million worldwide. For her work in both Intersection and The Specialist, Stone won a Golden Raspberry Award and a Stinkers <b>Bad</b> <b>Movie</b> Award for Worst Actress, but was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Most Desirable Female for The Specialist. In the western The Quick and the Dead (1995), she obtained {{the role of a}} gunfighter who returns to a frontier town in an effort to avenge her father's death.

40|$|In the {{judgments}} involved in evaluating <b>bad</b> <b>movies,</b> ―bad underscores the implicit assumption that movies should be aesthetically realistic. Where different counter-cinemas, {{such as the}} avant-garde or even self-conscious films, critique the dominant realist aesthetic from a point of distance, <b>bad</b> <b>movies</b> represent a critique from within realism, jolting the audience out {{of a state of}} passivity via their impossible-to-ignore failures to reproduce the codes of cinematic realism. <b>Bad</b> <b>movies</b> encourage attention to the extratextual elements of a film which helps viewers activate the entire film. Working within the realist aesthetic (instead of from its outside, {{as is the case with}} other counter-cinemas) demands a theoretical reformulation of realism instead of just simply expressing a formal, theoretical critique. To this end, the existing discourse on citationality as received from J. L. Austin and Jacques Derrida is a useful model for how the dominant realist aesthetic and <b>bad</b> <b>movies</b> both attempt to repeat iterable models of the real but only the former is successful at it. By couching realism in the terms of an iterable discourse, we can follow Fredric Jameson‘s belief that the problems of realism are more epistemological than aesthetic, and this allows us to reengage classical realist film theory, such as the works of Andre Bazin and Siegfried Kracauer, in a productive way. If we place <b>bad</b> <b>movies</b> at the center of the realist discussion (instead of just censuring them as the negative half of a taste binary), then not only will the stalled scholarship on cinematic realism be jump started with new points of entry, but we will also come to see <b>bad</b> <b>movies</b> as an instructional site for the demonstration of the limits of realism and the activation of the proverbially passive audience...|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film zero stars, writing {{in his review}} that it [...] "is not simply a <b>bad</b> <b>movie,</b> but also a stupid and incompetent one." [...] He lists several {{elements}} that he finds unbelievable, including that Ellen is [...] "haunted by flashbacks to events where she was not present." [...] Ebert joked that Caine could not attend the ceremony to accept his Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor earned for Hannah and Her Sisters because of his shooting commitments on this film, because {{he may not have}} wanted to return to the shoot if he had left it.|$|E
500|$|Daniel D'Addario from Time {{called the}} movie [...] "clunky and ridiculous", but also called it [...] "a rare movie about women" [...] and [...] "the <b>Bad</b> <b>Movie</b> Hollywood Needs Right Now," [...] adding that: [...] "Lopez's new [...] project {{represents}} an earnest attempt {{to capitalize on}} a very real public [...] hunger to see {{a woman at the}} center of a mainstream movie—not an indie, but an old-fashioned popcorn flick. Can either the boy-centric Best Picture nominees or the elusive Best Actress pictures say that? If every director, at every level of ambition, were making [...] commercially ambitious movies about [...] women, The Boy Next Door wouldn't feel so perversely refreshing. But its director is one of very few who actually did." ...|$|E
500|$|Bandslam was The Washington Post's critic choice, {{having a}} perfect score of 4/4 stars. Bandslam was somehow {{associated}} with High School Musical {{in a couple}} of reviews. However, the reviews concluded the comparisons positively, saying that Bandslam was [...] "actually a lot quirkier than the posters would have you believe." [...] New Jersey's local newspaper, The Star Ledger says that the plot is nicely skewed: [...] "Basically, it's the standard teen picture – girl torn between bad boy and nice guy – with a gender switch." [...] Michael Phillips of The Los Angeles Times praised the film by saying: [...] "Bandslam is a pretty good movie given that the odds of it having been a pretty <b>bad</b> <b>movie</b> were steep." [...] Critic Andy Webster of The New York Times said that Bandslam may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert wrote: I saw [...] "Repo Man" [...] {{near the}} end of a busy stretch on the movie beat: Three days during which I saw more relentlessly <b>bad</b> <b>movies</b> than during any {{comparable}} period in memory.

[...] "Repo Man" [...] comes out of left field, has no big stars, didn't cost much, takes chances, dares to be unconventional, is funny, and works. There is a lesson here. Roger Ebert ...|$|R

500|$|However, {{the film}} was not without its detractors. Richard Roeper gave the film a C+, saying [...] "This is a safe, predictable, edge-free, nearly bland effort from a studio that rarely hedges its bets." [...] Stephen Whitty of Newark Star-Ledger gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and said [...] "The artwork is accomplished, and intricate. The G-rating is genuine, without any gross-out gags. And there's none of the usual winks to the adults with tired, pop-culture references." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of five and wrote [...] "Both the {{originality}} and stirring emotional complexity of Monsters, Inc., with its exquisitely painful and touching parallels with the human world, are missing." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, and said [...] "This is not a <b>bad</b> <b>movie,</b> and to small children {{it will be a}} very good one, but it's closer to average than one would wish from the company that gave us Up, WALL-E, The Incredibles, and the Toy Story series." [...] Rene Rodriguez of Miami Herald gave the film two stars out of five and wrote that it [...] "feels half-hearted and lazy, like they weren't even trying. At least show a little effort, guys." ...|$|E
500|$|The New York Times critic Janet Maslin {{felt the}} film lacked any real plot, failed in its attempt at satire, should have {{included}} Myron's only mentioned son and [...] "mostly wasted" [...] Hartman, while Levant's direction was [...] "listless". Similarly, the BBC's Neil Smith criticized the film's script, {{its focus on}} the commercialization of Christmas, as well as Schwarzenegger's performance which shows [...] "the comic timing of a dead moose," [...] but singled out Hartman for praise. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington panned the film, wondering why the characters (primarily Howard) acted so illogically: [...] "Howard Langston {{is supposed to be}} a successful mattress manufacturer, but the movie paints him as a hot-tempered buffoon without a sensible idea in his head." [...] Jack Garner of USA Today condemned the film, finding it more [...] "cynical" [...] than satirical, stating [...] "this painfully <b>bad</b> <b>movie</b> has been inspired strictly by the potential jingle of cash registers." [...] He wrote of Levant's directorial failure as he [...] "offers no...sense of comic timing," [...] while [...] "pauses in the midst of much of the dialogue are downright painful." [...] Trevor Johnston suggested that the film [...] "seems to mark a point of decline in the Schwarzenegger career arc" [...] and the anti-consumerism message largely failed, with [...] "Jim Belushi's corrupt mall Santa with his stolen-goods warehouse...provid the film's sole flash of dark humour." ...|$|E
500|$|South Pacific {{was made}} into a film of the same name in 1958, and it topped the box office that year. Joshua Logan {{directed}} the film, which starred Rossano Brazzi, Mitzi Gaynor, John Kerr, Ray Walston and Juanita Hall; all of their singing voices except Gaynor's and Walston's were dubbed. Thurl Ravenscroft, later television's Tony the Tiger, sang the basso profundo notes in [...] "There Is Nothing Like a Dame". The film opened with Cable's flight to the island in a PBY, followed by the Seabees' beach scene, and added Billis' rescue and scenes from the mission to spy on the Japanese. [...] The film won the Academy Award for Best Sound. It was also nominated for the Oscar for Best Scoring of a Musical Picture (Alfred Newman and Ken Darby), and the 65mm Todd-AO cinematography by Leon Shamroy was also nominated. The film was widely criticized for its use of color to indicate mood, with actors changing color as they began to sing. The film includes the song [...] "My Girl Back Home", sung by Cable, which was cut from the stage musical. [...] The movie was the third-highest-grossing film in the U.S. of the 1950s; its UK revenues were the highest ever, a record it kept until Goldfinger in 1963. Although reviewers have criticized the film– Time magazine stated that it was [...] "almost impossible to make a <b>bad</b> <b>movie</b> out of it– but the moviemakers appear to have tried"– it has added success on television, videotape and DVD to its box office laurels.|$|E

2500|$|Jade's {{appearance}} in Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, {{like many of}} the film's cast of characters, was not well received.

2500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} film an A minus. She praised the {{performance}} of Wormald, commenting that he [...] "handily owns the role for a new audience" [...] and closed her review saying, [...] "Guardians of the '80s flame will approve of the production's sincere respect for the original; church still matters, and so do Ariel's red cowboy boots." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a negative review of the film, rating it one and half stars out of four. He criticized the film for being {{so close to the}} 1984 original [...] "sometimes song for song and word-for-word". He thought poorly of Wormald's performance, saying, [...] "He's got the Kevin Bacon role but not the Kevin Bacon charisma." [...] Ebert closed his review expressing, [...] "This new Footloose is a film without wit, humor or purpose. It sets up the town elders as old farts who hate rock 'n' roll. Does it have a clue that the Rev. Moore and all the other city council members are young enough that they grew up on rock 'n' roll? The film's message is: A <b>bad</b> <b>movie,</b> if faithfully remade, will produce another bad movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{destroying}} film studios, videotape sales {{became increasingly}} {{important to their}} revenue. The press discussed the VCR [...] "and the viewing habits it has engendered — the Saturday night trip down to the tape rental store to pick out {{for a couple of}} bucks the movie you want to see when you want to see it". Film studios opened new divisions to produce prerecorded tapes, and by 1985 their sales were about the same as box office revenue; the Associated Press reported that [...] "because of the VCR, even a <b>bad</b> <b>movie</b> can make money". Although the VCR received blame for a 25% decline in the summer 1985 box office compared to 1984's, and closing movie theaters, by 1987 it was credited with causing a record-high box office, as videotapes' popularity encouraged consumers' interest in films and watching them in theaters. Cable movie channels worried about VCRs affecting subscriptions, but began to offer more films for owners who wanted to build a home library, even encouraging time shifting by broadcasting the movies during the night so VCRs could record them while their owners slept.|$|E
