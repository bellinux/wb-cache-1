40|$|Feature {{modeling}} systems usually {{employ a}} boundary representation (b-rep) {{to store the}} shape information on a product. It has, however, been shown that a b-rep {{has a number of}} shortcomings, and that a cellular representation can be a valuable alternative. A cellular model stores additional shape information on features, including the feature faces that are not on the boundary of the product. Such information can be profitably used for several purposes. A major operation in every feature modeling system is <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation,</b> which computes the geometric model of a product, i. e. either the b-rep or the cellular model, from the features that have been specified by the user. Since <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> has to be executed each time a feature is added, removed or modified, its efficiency is of paramount importance. In this paper, <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> for a cellular model is described in some detail. Its efficiency is compared to the efficiency of <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> for a b-rep, on the basis of both complexity analysis and performance measurements for the two types of evaluation. It turns out that <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> for a cellular model is, in fact, more efficient than for a b-rep, which makes cellular models even more attractive as an alternative to b-reps...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} system, ESOLID, that {{performs}} exact <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> of low-degree curved solids in reasonable amounts of time. ESOLID performs accurate Boolean operations using exact representations and exact computations throughout. The demands of exact computation require {{a different set}} of algorithms and efficiency improvements than those found in a traditional inexact floating point based modeler. We describe the system architecture, representations, and issues in implementing the algorithms. We also describe a number of techniques that increase the efficiency of the system based on lazy evaluation, use of floating point filters, arbitrary floating point arithmetic with error bounds, and lower dimensional formulation of subproblems. ESOLID has been used for <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> of many complex solids. These include both synthetic datasets and parts of a Bradley Fighting Vehicle designed using the BRL-CAD solid modeling system. It is shown that ESOLID can correctly evaluate the boundary of solids that are very hard to compute using a fixed-precision floating point modeler. In terms of performance, it is about an order of magnitude slower as compared to a floating point <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> system on most cases. ...|$|E

40|$|The recent {{availability}} of Non-Manifold Topology (NMT) enables the coexistence of wireframe geometry, surfaces, and solids {{in a single}} representation with complete topological resolution. This in turn allows {{a new approach to}} <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation.</b> This new approach merges a set of primitives into a single Boundary REPresentation (B-rep), and selects the desired Boolean results without destroying any B-rep entities. The results of the Boolean operations are displayed by drawing only selected entities. The B-rep resulting from the merge contains a complete description of the input primitives. While traditional algorithms allow incremental addition of primitives, this new approach also allows incremental deletion of primitives from the merged B-rep. Changes in Boolean operators and/or their order of evaluation can be reflected in the B-rep simply by changing the criteria of the selection process. Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) editing operations can be mirrored in the B-rep incrementally, i. e. without performing complete reevaluation of the B-rep from its constituent primitive definitions. In addition, the domain of <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> has been extended to include Boolean operations between wireframe geometry, surfaces, and solids. This new approach has been successfully implemented and tested to <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Test results have shown an order of magnitude reduction in the cost associated with reflecting CSG editing operations on existing B-reps, with only minimal additional cost for initial construction.

The reliability of the algorithm depends on the accurate evaluation of these signs and roots. In this paper, we present a naive precision-driven computational model to perform these computations reliably and demonstrate its effectiveness on a certain class of problems like sign of determinants with rational entries, <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation</b> and curve arrangements. We also present a novel algorithm to compute all the roots of a univariate polynomial to any desired accuracy.

40|$|We {{present a}} stereo {{algorithm}} that achieves high quality results while maintaining real-time performance. The key idea is simple: we introduce an adaptive aggregation {{step in a}} dynamic-programming (DP) stereo framework. The per-pixel matching cost is aggregated in the vertical direction only. Compared to traditional DP, our approach reduces the typical “streaking ” artifacts without the penalty of blurry object <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Evaluation</b> using the benchmark Middlebury stereo database shows that our approach is among the best (ranked first in the new evaluation system) for DP-based approaches. The performance gain mainly comes from a computationally expensive weighting scheme based on color and distance proximity.

However, this action may not always be possible. ED-Ni is inherently tough at ambient temperature, especially if a low level of sulfur was intentionally maintained. A new method was developed to study sulfur and other migrant species to the grain boundaries, which also migrate to free surfaces.

40|$|Solids {{defined by}} Boolean {{combinations}} of solid primitives may {{be represented in}} constructive solid geometry (CSG) as binary trees. Most CSG-based algorithms (e. g., for <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation,</b> graphic shading, interference detection) do various forms of set-membership classification by traversing the tree associated with the solid. These algorithms usually generate intermediate results that do {{not contribute to the}} final result, and hence may be regarded as redundant and a source of inefficiency. To reduce such inefficiencies, we associate with each primitive A in a tree S an active zone 2 that represents the region of space where changes to A affect the solid represented by S, and we use a representation of 2 instead of S for set-membership classification. In the paper we develop a mathematical theory of active zones, prove that they correspond to the intersection of certain nodes of the original trees, and show how they lead to efficient new algorithms for <b>boundary</b> <b>evaluation,</b> for detecting and eliminating redundant nodes in CSG trees, for interference (null-set) detection, and for graphic shading...|$|E
