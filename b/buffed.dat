5|$|Following the breakup, {{the former}} {{partners}} feuded {{for a while}} with Bagwell getting the better of Riggs. Riggs {{would go on to}} briefly feud with Raven, later joining The Flock, while Bagwell formed Vicious and Delicious with Scott Norton before suffering a severe neck injury that kept him out of action for a while. Bagwell later returned to WCW, teaming with Shane Douglas to win another tag team championship. After losing the championship, he formed another tag team, pairing with Lex Luger to form Totally <b>Buffed.</b>|$|E
5|$|KroniK helped The Boogie Knights battle The Filthy Animals in {{subsequent}} matches at Mayhem and Millennium Final. As the year ended, KroniK were hired by their former enemies, the Natural Born Thrillers, {{during which they}} helped them at the Starrcade event, by facing Reno and Big Vito in a tag team match, during which Reno turned on Vito and had been revealed {{as the one who}} had paid KroniK to assault Vito in the previous weeks. A month later, at Sin, KroniK turned faces by ending their association with Thrillers, as they turned on Thrillers leader Mike Sanders by helping Ernest Miller beat Sanders to become the WCW Commissioner. The following month, at SuperBrawl Revenge, KroniK made their final pay-per-view appearance, where they were scheduled to face Totally <b>Buffed</b> (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell), in a #1 contender's match for the tag team titles. Clark was injured by Mike Awesome before the match, leaving Adams to face them in a handicap match, which he lost. KroniK remained with WCW until the company was purchased by WWF on March 23, 2001.|$|E
25|$|At Starrcade, Bagwell, who at {{the time}} had {{returned}} as a backstage interviewer, betrayed Goldberg by trying to cost him his match with Lex Luger. Bagwell's efforts were unsuccessful, but he managed to hit Goldberg with a steel chair after he had pinned Luger. Despite feuding in the past, Bagwell and Luger united and became known as Totally <b>Buffed.</b> Totally <b>Buffed</b> would go on to defeat Goldberg at Sin after a fan maced Goldberg, allowing Bagwell to pin him. Due to a stipulation in the match, Goldberg was, in storyline, fired. In early 2001, Totally <b>Buffed</b> joined Ric Flair's Magnificent Seven stable, and remained with them until WCW's closure.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 15-16 mm. The forewings are sepia, {{with warm}} <b>buff</b> {{points on the}} costa and two warm <b>buff</b> patches obliquely on {{the lower half of}} the wing, one antemedially and the other just before the postmedial line. There is a warm <b>buff</b> spot between the two. The postmedial fascia consists of a fine, wavy, warm <b>buff</b> line from the costa to vein 2. The hindwings are sepia with a warm <b>buff</b> patch at the base. The medial fascia is oblique, waved and warm <b>buff</b> and the postmedial fascia is oblique and warm <b>buff.</b>|$|R
25|$|At the Sin {{pay-per-view}} in January 2001, Goldberg and his trainer DeWayne Bruce lost a tag team {{match to}} Totally <b>Buffed</b> (Buff Bagwell and The Total Package.) As a result, Goldberg was fired.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the surface}} may be {{polished}} or <b>buffed</b> using steel wool, pumice, rotten stone or other materials, {{depending on the}} shine desired. Often, a final coat of wax is applied over the finish to add a degree of protection.|$|E
25|$|When {{polishing}} brass (a softer metal) {{there are}} often minute marks in the metal caused by impurities. To smooth out the finer marks, the surface is polished with a very fine (600) grit, copper plated, then <b>buffed</b> to a mirror finish with an airflow mop.|$|E

25|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} WCW World Heavyweight Championship between Scott Steiner, Sid Vicious, Jeff Jarrett, and Animal in a Four Corners match. The WCW {{champion}} heading into Sin was Scott Steiner, who retained the title after pinning Sid Vicious who had fractured his leg after attempting an aerial attack. The main match on the undercard was between Totally <b>Buffed</b> (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell) and Goldberg and DeWayne Bruce, in a match where if Goldberg lost, he {{would be forced to}} retire. Totally <b>Buffed</b> won the match when Lex Luger pinned Goldberg after a Buff Blockbuster from Bagwell with Goldberg on Luger's shoulders. As a result, Goldberg was forced to retire. The rights to WCW Sin now belong to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).|$|E
25|$|The ninth match, and {{the main}} match in the undercard, was between Totally <b>Buffed</b> (Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell) and Goldberg with DeWayne Bruce in a No Disqualification tag-team match, where if Goldberg lost {{he would have had}} to retire. The match started out with Goldberg against Bagwell, where Goldberg had full control of the match. Bruce was then tagged in by Goldberg where he gained an early {{advantage}} over Bagwell for a short time, but was then double teamed by Totally <b>Buffed.</b> Goldberg was then tagged in, where Bagwell gained the upper-hand. Luger then exited the ring and walked up to a fan, who asked for Goldberg's autograph earlier in the event. This distracted and lured Goldberg near the fan, who sprayed mace into Goldberg's eyes. Luger then lifted Goldberg on his shoulders and Bagwell hit a Super Blockbuster. Luger covered him for the victory, thus ending Goldberg's undefeated streak of thirty-five victories and forcing Goldberg to retire from professional wrestling.|$|E
25|$|Polishing {{may be used}} {{to enhance}} and restore the looks of certain metal parts or object on cars and other vehicles, handrails, cookware, kitchenware, and {{architectural}} metal. In other applications such as pharmaceutical, dairy, and specialty plumbing, pipes are <b>buffed</b> to help prevent corrosion and to eliminate locations where bacteria or mold may reside.

25|$|For most pointe shoes, {{the sole}} is {{constructed}} from {{a piece of}} leather that {{is attached to the}} shoe with adhesive and reinforced by stitching along its edges. The sole overlaps and secures the unfinished edges of the shoe's exterior fabric. Pointe shoes may be manufactured with either scraped soles, which provide superior traction, or <b>buffed</b> soles, which have a smoother surface for reduced traction.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideal of}} breasts and {{cleavage}} has also {{evolved in the}} later half of 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use {{of a variety of}} methods and techniques. In the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy, echoing the sci-fi look of the times; in 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with Hippie chic of the times; and from 1990s <b>buffed,</b> pumped and engorged look has become the preference.|$|E
25|$|Either by hand or in a rice polisher, {{white rice}} may be <b>buffed</b> with glucose or talc powder (often called {{polished}} rice, though this term may also refer to white rice in general), parboiled, or processed into flour. White rice {{may also be}} enriched by adding nutrients, especially those lost during the milling process. While the cheapest method of enriching involves adding a powdered blend of nutrients that will easily wash off (in the United States, rice which has been so treated requires a label warning against rinsing), more sophisticated methods apply nutrients directly to the grain, coating the grain with a water-insoluble substance which is resistant to washing.|$|E

25|$|The {{secondary}} feud {{heading in}} to Sin, was between Goldberg and Buff Bagwell. This feud began at Mayhem, where Goldberg hit a spear on the referee by accident after Luger pushed {{him in his}} place. Although this {{would have resulted in}} a disqualification, Goldberg won the match after a jackhammer. Luger would claim that Goldberg had lost via disqualification, which led to his desire of ending Goldberg's undefeated winning streak. This feud carried over to Starrcade where Goldberg's career was on the line, as he would be forced to retire if he had lost, although Goldberg was victorious. Lex Luger and Buff Bagwell would then form the tag team of Totally <b>Buffed</b> in December 2000, where they got Goldberg's WCW Power Plant trainer, DeWayne Bruce, involved in the feud leading to a match between the two sides at Sin.|$|E
25|$|Pottery {{produced}} by the Caddoan Mississippian culture {{is some of the}} finest known in North America. It is usually found in the areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma. About 1200 CE as the Caddoan culture emerged from local woodland cultures such as Fourche Maline, a distinctive pottery tradition emerged, unmistakable because of its designs, materials and fine execution. These early pots were often grog tempered, although sometimes finely ground bone was used. Two main forms emerged that would become Caddoan pottery standards for the next 1000 years, a long slender necked bottle and a carinated form of bottles and bowls. Caddo pottery is considered to be some of the finest Mississippian pottery because of its thinness, symmetry, and very smooth finish, with some of its best examples being bottle forms with extensive geometric engravings. Pieces are often dark brown and black with a glossy finish achieved by the application of a fine slip made from a mixture of sifted fine clay or paint and <b>buffed</b> to a high finish. The first Europeans to encounter Caddoan pottery were members of the Hernando de Soto Expedition in 1541, who described it as matching even the finest potters of their European homeland.|$|E
25|$|Medal {{manufacturer}} Stange {{was authorized}} to begin producing Eagle Scout medals in 1968, {{at the same}} time as Robbins– they created six distinct models. The 1968 version is very similar to the Robbins version, but the bend in the scroll is much flatter, more like a sideways V as compared to the S on the Robbins scroll. The BSA was added back to the front, and the obverse was returned to a full feathered design in 1970. A major re-design of the eagle pendant was made in 1974 to match the new NESA logo. In 1978, Robbins ceased manufacturing Eagle Scout medals and Stange switched to the last design used by Robbins. Minor differences are in the white edged ribbon and the sterling silver markings. In 1980 the price of silver rose dramatically and the medal was changed to silver-plated, die-struck copper. Very early versions were silver-plated and oxidized, thus the scroll and pendant are black. Later versions were oxidized, <b>buffed</b> and lacquered to maintain the silver shine. Sterling silver medals were produced from the same dies and from this time were only available on special order. The year 1993 saw a number of changes. The clasp on the scroll was changed from the pin on type to a double clutch back. The pendant was changed to pewter and enlarged due to the lighter rigidity of the material.|$|E

50|$|He {{lost the}} World Bantamweight Championship {{for the second}} time on September 23, 1921 when he was outpointed by Johnny <b>Buff</b> in a fifteen-round title match at Madison Square Garden. <b>Buff</b> took ten rounds {{employing}} lightning speed, with only four rounds for his opponent. Herman put <b>Buff</b> on the canvas only once very briefly in the fourth round with a right to the jaw. For most of the bout, Herman had trouble using his often powerful right effectively. By the fifteenth round <b>Buff</b> was able to freely reign most of his blows on Herman. Having a very slight advantage in reach, and a four-pound weight disadvantage, <b>Buff</b> won on points by a sizable margin. <b>Buff</b> was fighting at nearly thirty while Herman was only 25. <b>Buff</b> had taken the American Flyweight Championship previously.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Buff</b> {{was born}} in Los Angeles, {{the son of the}} {{architect}} Conrad <b>Buff</b> III and the grandson of children's book creators Mary and Conrad <b>Buff</b> (painter Conrad <b>Buff</b> II).

She repulses Discord, represented by snakes. The medal is suspended from the flukes of an anchor." [...] It is made of solid red brass, oxidized and <b>buffed.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lanolin, a {{hydrophobic}} grease from wool-bearing {{animals such as}} sheep or goats, acts as both a waterproofing wax and a bonding agent, {{giving the}} shoe polish its greasy feel and texture. It prevents the naphtha from evaporating until the polish has been spread and <b>buffed</b> into a thin film on the leather surface. [...] An essential ingredient in shoe polish is a thickener; without this, the polish would be too runny, {{making it difficult to}} use. Gum arabic, a substance from two sub-Saharan species of the acacia tree, is commonly used to increase the viscosity of the product.|$|E

He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond {{the corners of his}} mouth and then turned upward at the ends. His hair was the talk of the Army: [...] "long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders, trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby." ...|$|E
