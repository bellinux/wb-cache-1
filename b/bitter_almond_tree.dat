50|$|Amygdalin, C20H27NO11, is a {{glycoside}} initially {{isolated from}} the seeds of a cultivar of the <b>almond</b> <b>tree,</b> Prunus dulcis var. amara, also known as <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds,</b> by Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Antoine-François Boutron-Charlard (1796-1879) in 1830, and subsequently investigated by Liebig and Wöhler in 1830, and others.|$|R
60|$|Thus, <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> contain two substances, {{amygdalin}} and synaptase, {{which can}} be extracted, in a separate state, from the <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds.</b> The amygdalin thus obtained, if dissolved in water, undergoes no change; but if a little synaptase {{be added to the}} solution, the amygdalin splits up into <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> oil, prussic acid, and a kind of sugar.|$|R
50|$|Extract of <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> {{was once}} used medicinally {{but even in}} small doses, effects are severe or lethal, {{especially}} in children; the cyanide must be removed before consumption. The acute oral lethal dose of cyanide for adult humans {{is reported to be}} 0.5-3.5 mg/kg of body weight (approximately 50 <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds),</b> whereas for children, consuming 5-10 <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> may be fatal.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> is {{slightly}} broader and {{shorter than the}} sweet almond and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme emulsin which, {{in the presence of}} water, acts on soluble glucosides, amygdalin, and prunasin, yielding glucose, cyanide and the essential oil of <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds,</b> which is nearly pure benzaldehyde, the chemical causing the <b>bitter</b> flavor. <b>Bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> may yield from 4-9 mg of hydrogen cyanide per almond and contain 42 times higher amounts of cyanide than the trace levels found in sweet almonds. The origin of cyanide content in <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> is via the enzymatic hydrolysis of amygdalin.|$|R
50|$|In Italy, <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> are the {{traditional}} base for amaretti (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> (10-20%) {{is added to}} the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, apricot kernels are used as a substitute for <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds).</b> Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in torrone. In Apulia and Sicily, pasta di mandorle (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, pistachio, or chocolate. In Sicily, almond milk is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bitter</b> <b>almond</b> {{is one of}} the {{medicinal}} plants that have been used to prevent and treat diseases since many centuries ago. <b>Bitter</b> <b>almond</b> essential oil can be effectively used to heal wounds, hemorrhoids and hair loss, relieve joint pain, facilitate delivery, and strengthen and condition hairs. Moreover, oral use of <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> seed has been demonstrated to cause antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer effects because of containing certain compounds such as amygdalin. However, there have been some challenges in investigations conducted to discover bitter almond-based oral, herbal drugs to treat different diseases such as cancer because of cyanide-induced poisoning, partly precluding use of this plant. This study was conducted to comprehensively review the traditional uses, phytochemical compounds, and therapeutic actions of <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> and its compound as well as the side effects due to use of them...|$|R
40|$|Thepossible {{laxative}} and prokinetic {{effects of}} <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> were studied: 1 - {{two groups of}} 7 rats were gavaged with ethanol extract of <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> (500 mg/kg) or placebo {{and the number of}} feces, fecal weight and its percentage of water were studied 18 - 24 h thereafter. 2 -Ethanol extract of <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> (125 or 250 mg/ml), lactulose (as positive control) or placebo was randomly injected into jejuna segments in anesthetized rats (n= 9). The volume of the fluid in each segment was measured after 1 h. 3 - Gastrointestinal (GI) transit time was studied in rats treated with the extract or placebo using phenol red. The rats were sacrificed at times 30 min, 1, 2 and 4 h. ethanol extract of <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> at 500 mg/kg significantly increased fecal weight and water. It had no significant effects on the osmotic infiltration of fluid into the intestine or on the transit time of the contents in the GI tract. The current results suggest that <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> has a laxative effect that seems to be due to malabsorption of electrolytes and water via enterocytes...|$|R

60|$|As {{chemistry}} advanced, facts came {{to light}} which put a new face upon Stahl's hypothesis, {{and gave it a}} safer foundation than it previously possessed. The general nature of these phenomena may be thus stated:--A body, A, without giving to, or taking from, another body B, any material particles, causes B to decompose into other substances, C, D, E, the sum of the weights of which is equal to the weight of B, which decomposes. Thus, <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> contain two substances, amygdalin and synaptase, which can be extracted, in a separate state, from the <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds.</b> The amygdalin thus obtained, if dissolved in water, undergoes no change; but if a little synaptase be added to the solution, the amygdalin splits up into <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> oil, prussic acid, and a kind of sugar.|$|R
