40|$|Milling {{quality is}} {{considered}} to be a combination of the potential yield, bran content, colour and starch damage of flour. It is a complex trait because these factors interact with one another, with the milling process and with the requirements for the end product to be made from the flour. Despite considerable gains in wheat flour milling yield through conventional breeding strategies and milling technologies, the theoretical maximum yield still has not been attained. Attempts to unravel the genetics of flour yield are made especially difficult by the number and complexity of linkages between gene expression and grain processing. Our approach was to improve the understanding of the role of grain endosperm microstructure in determining high flour yield. A lack of vitreousness in hard wheat causes microstructural weaknesses characterised by low endosperm strength and stiffness that result in fracture through cell contents with a consequent high first break release and low overall flour yield. The SKCS provides a method for stress-strain analysis of wheat grain in which better milling quality is characterised by increased endosperm strength and stiffness. These properties were used to discriminate wheat samples according to their milling yield so that the differences in microstructure between contrasting groups, within each of the two hardness genotypes present in Australian wheat germplasm, could be examined. The Pina-D 1 a, Pinb-D 1 b set was characterised by a higher average flour yield than the Pina-D 1 b, Pinb-D 1 a, although the ranges of flour yields showed considerable overlap between the genotypes.

A subset of polymorphic markers was surveyed across the 182 RILs of the mapping {{population and the}} marker segregation data {{was used for the}} construction of a framework linkage map with 101 loci. Mapping of the candidate genes involved in nitrogen metabolism as well as in grain quality parameters was also taken up.

Three polymorphic primer pairs, each representing the genes encoding glutamate synthase (GOP 5), starch branching enzyme (SBE 12) and granule <b>bound</b> <b>starch</b> synthase (GBSS 1) were surveyed across the RILs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide further {{evidence}} {{about the nature of}} a 77 -kD starch synthase (SSII) that is both soluble and <b>bound</b> to the <b>starch</b> granules in developing pea (Pisum sativum L.) embryos.

These results confirm that SSII is a starch synthase and indicate that partitioning between the soluble and granule-bound fraction of storage organs is an intrinsic property of the protein. A 60 -kD isoform of starch synthase found both in the soluble and granule-bound fraction of the pea embryos is probably derived by the processing of SSII and is a different gene product from GBSSI, the exclusively granule-bound 59 -kD isoform of starch synthase that is similar to starch synthases encoded by the waxy genes of cereals and the amf gene of potatoes.

30|$|The {{degree of}} {{gelatinization}} {{is proportional to}} the amount of amylose; the less amylose there is, the greater the degree of gelatinization and vice versa. In other words, starches with lower amylose content will have higher Glycemic Indexes. Inversely, starches with a higher amylose content will be less susceptible to gelatinization, that is, to breaking down into glucose, that which makes for low Glycemic Indexes. The amount of amylose content (AC), Waxy haplotype and digestibility of rice are significantly correlated (Fitzgerald et al. 2011) and observed that AC {{plays a key role in}} rate of starch digestion and GI (Kharabian-Masouleh et al. 2012).

The combination of two single-nucleotide-polymorphism (SNP) markers in the Waxy gene allows for the identification of three marker haplotypes in this gene.

The PCR template for CCMK was successfully amplified from a commercially purchased cDNA clone, while the GBSSI gene was specifically amplified directly from the genome of O. tauri (Fig.  2 b, see PCR 1). The subsequent PCR 2 reactions yielded the desired amplicons and were good templates for high-yield production of full-length mRNAs (Fig. 2 c), which were further introduced into MINI-translation mix (Fig.  2 d). For quick detection of the protein product, all MINI-translation reactions were supplemented with the fluorophore-labeled lysine-charged tRNA (FluoroTect™ GreenLys) for incorporation of fluorophore-tagged lysine into the synthesized protein. The use of the fluorophore-tagged lysine allows detection of picomolar levels of protein with SDS-PAGE without any need for purification.

Fermentation {{played a major role}} upon the prevailing microflora: viable numbers of yeasts, lactobacilli, streptococci, lactococci, enterococci and leuconostocs increased, whereas those of molds, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, staphylococci and micrococci decreased. After fermentation, yeasts and lactic‐acid bacteria dominated. Neutral‐lipids were quantified by normal phase‐high performance liquid chromatographyevaporative‐ light scattering detection and electrospray ionization‐tandem mass‐spectrometry, after employing two independent extraction procedures – yielding non‐starch and starch lipids, as well as free, <b>bound</b> and <b>starch</b> lipids. Solid‐phase extraction separated neutral‐lipids prior to derivatization of sterol‐esters, triacylglycerol, free‐fatty acids, sterols with diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols, permitted fatty‐acids separation by gas‐liquid chromatography. Breadmaking affected lipid extractability, and neutral‐lipid and fatty‐acid profiles. Triacylglycerols decreased during dough‐mixing and fermentation – so those of diacylglycerols and monoacylglycerols increased, whereas sterol‐esters remained constant; the effect of baking was less pronounced. Triacylglycerols dominated, but sterol‐esters, diacylglycerols and free‐fatty acid amounts were considerable. Palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids were dominant. The nutritional value of broa was apparent, owing to poly‐ and monoene dominanc...|$|R

Starch material {{may be used}} as a matrix for controlled release of aroma and bioactive compounds or the selective adsorption of bitter components. The binding of organic compounds to starch is based on inclusion complexes formation through hydrophobic bonding in the amylose helix, and/or polar interaction between the hydroxyl groups of starch and ligands, or non-specific sorption to the starch surface. It is known that high hydrostatic pressure evoked changes in starch physicochemical properties what in turn might affect its capability for binding organic compounds. In view of the above, the studies were subjected to the effect of high pressure treatment on the ability of binding catechin and quercetin by sorghum and amaranth starches. Sorghum (17 % of amylose) and amaranth (pure amylopectin) starch were isolated from the commercial grains. The starch-water suspensions (30 %, w/v) were subjected to pressure treatment (650 MPa/ 9 mins), and freez-dried. Catechin (10 mg/ 1 g starch) and quercetin (5 mg/ 1 g of starch) were separately added to the starch-water suspensions. The suspensions were stirred at room temperature (24 h), centrifuged and the collected pellets were freez-dried. The compounds <b>bound</b> by the <b>starches</b> were isolated from the pellets by extraction with methanol/water, and the extracts were characterized by HPLC-PAD-MS. The obtained starchphenolic complexes were examined regarding their thermodynamic (DSC) and structural (13 C CP/MAS NMR) properties. The antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds <b>bound</b> by analyzed <b>starches</b> was additionally performed using oxygen radical absorption capacity (ORAC) assay. The HPLC analysis showed that catechin and quercetin demonstrated higher binding affinity to sorghum than to amaranth starch. The high pressure treatment resulted in an increase in sorption of bioactive compounds by the starch preparations obtained. High pressure-treated amaranth starch demonstrated lower sorption of catechin, however. Although binding of ligand to starch was related to surface sorption, formation of bioactive compounds with fully hydrated starch can be also assigned to inclusion complexation. However, the results obtained from thermodynamic and 13 C CP/MAS NMR analysis did not reveal that the complexation phenomenon took place in the studied case. The distinct increase in melting enthalpy values observed for starch-phenolic complexes in melting thermograms resulted probably from non-covalent binding of polysaccharides with the phenolic compounds due to hydrophobic cooperative interaction, mostly. The changes in antioxidant capacity of phenolic compounds <b>bound</b> by the <b>starches</b> (native and high pressure-treated) were found to be irregular. The study was financed by a grant of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education (Grant No. N N 312 101938). Peer Reviewe...|$|R
