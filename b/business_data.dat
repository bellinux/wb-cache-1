Jean Sammet attributed COBOL's unpopularity to an initial [...] "snob reaction" [...] due to its inelegance, the lack of influential computer scientists participating in the design process and a disdain for <b>business</b> <b>data</b> processing. The COBOL specification used a unique [...] "notation", or metalanguage, to define its syntax rather than the new Backus–Naur form because few committee members had heard of it. This resulted in [...] "severe" [...] criticism.|$|E

2500|$|The first Wang VS {{computer}} {{was introduced in}} 1977, {{about the same time}} as Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX, and continues to be in use 39 years later. Its instruction set was compatible with the IBM 360 series, but it did not run any IBM 360 system software. The VS operating system and all system software were built from the ground up to support interactive users as well as batch operations. The VS was aimed directly at the <b>business</b> <b>data</b> processing market in general, and IBM in particular. While many programming languages were available, the VS was typically programmed in COBOL. Other languages supported in the VS integrated development environment included Assembler, COBOL 74, COBOL 85, BASIC, Ada, RPG II, C, PL/I, FORTRAN, Glossary, MABASIC, SPEED II and Procedure (a scripting language). Pascal was also supported for I/O co-processor development. The Wang PACE (Professional Application Creation Environment) 4GL and database was used from the mid-1980s onward by customers and third party developers to build complex applications sometimes involving many thousands of screens, hundreds of distinct application modules, and serving many hundreds of users. Substantial vertical applications were developed for the Wang VS by third party software houses throughout the 1980s in COBOL, PACE, BASIC, PL/I and RPG II. The Wang OFFICE family of applications and Wang WP were both popular applications on the VS. Word Processing ran on the VS through services that emulated the OIS environment and downloaded the WP software as [...] "microcode" [...] (in Wang terminology) to VS workstations.|$|E
