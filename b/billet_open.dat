50|$|The term {{is derived}} from the low German māt (comrade). Via the Dutch language, the word became a nautic term and {{described}} the assistant to a deck officer. Since {{the second half of the}} 17th century Maate were the lowest class of non-commissioned officers aboard a warship. In the Prussian Navy and the Kaiserliche Marine Maate were Unteroffiziere ohne Portepee. According to their specialization, Maate would be known as e.g. Steuermannsmaat (Coxswain's Mate), Feuerwerksmaat (Ordnance Mate), Bootsmannsmaat (Boatswain's Mate) or Maschinistenmaat (Machinist's Mate).Maate were recruited among conscripts who volunteered to serve for a minimum of six years. After approximately four years they could expect to become Maat. Re-enlistment was common but in most specialisms the career options would end with achieving the rank of Obermaat; only after 18 years in service a promotion as supernumary Vizefeldwebel was possible, if there was a <b>billet</b> <b>open.</b> The 1914/15 naval budget included 7857 billets for Maate and 5237 for Obermaate.|$|E
50|$|On-line Training was {{the term}} for busy work given to cadets {{when there were no}} open spaces in the next level. They did any unskilled menial task that needed doing until a <b>billet</b> <b>opened</b> up.|$|R
50|$|Selection of {{the right}} {{personnel}} begins with a rigorous screening process designed to identify the right Marines for the right billet within MARSOC. Operational <b>billets</b> were <b>opened</b> to females as of 2016. Screening takes place in 3 stages: record screening, physical screening, and a psychological and medical evaluation.|$|R
50|$|On 30 July 1987, the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB) granted {{accreditation}} for the Computer Science program. In 1991, Midshipman Juliane Gallina, {{class of}} 1992, {{became the first}} woman brigade commander. On 29 January 1994, the first genderless service assignment was held. All <b>billets</b> were <b>opened</b> equally to men and women with the exception of special warfare and submarine duty.|$|R
50|$|Selection of {{the right}} {{personnel}} begins with a rigorous screening process designed to identify the right Marines for the right billet within MARSOC. Operational <b>billets</b> are <b>open</b> to men and women. Marines who want to serve as Marine Raiders must first attend Assessment and Selection (A&S). All Marines are screened {{to ensure that the}} Marines joining MARSOC meet the established prerequisites for duty within the command. Screening takes place in three stages: record screening, physical screening, and a psychological and medical evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Selection of {{the right}} {{personnel}} begins with a screening process designed to identify the right Marines for the right billet within MARSOC. Operational <b>billets</b> are <b>open</b> only to males. Only those Marines wanting to serve as Critical Skills Operators, as opposed to support, must attend Assessment and Selection (A&S); however, all Marines are screened {{to ensure that the}} Marines joining MARSOC meet the established prerequisites for duty within the command. Screening takes place in 3 stages: record screening, physical screening, and a psychological and medical evaluation. Prior to A&S candidates go through the Assessment and Selection Preparation and Orientation Course (ASPOC) to prepare marines for A&S.|$|R
60|$|Gallwey {{did as he}} was bidden, half asleep, {{though he}} heard a beat of hoofs that grew louder. Then there was a {{stamping}} of feet outside, and Leland flung a few split <b>billets</b> through the <b>open</b> top of the stove. A sharp crackling followed, and a blaze sprang up, but the light only flickered here and there, leaving the room almost dark.|$|R
50|$|Despite Longstreet's {{praise for}} Law's {{performances}} in previous battles, the two {{became involved in}} bitter disputes, some of which involved professional jealousy between Law and Brig. Gen. Micah Jenkins, a favorite of Longstreet's. At different times and places, Longstreet had promised both Law and Jenkins command of Hood's division, should that command <b>billet</b> ever <b>open.</b> Law had served in Hood's division since its organization, and had commanded it successfully at Gettysburg and Chickamauga. Jenkins was new to the division and had never commanded it, but his commission as a brigadier general pre-dated Law's, and when Jenkins's brigade was attached to Hood's division in September 1863, shortly after Chickamauga, with Hood absent due to wounds, Law had to turn command of Hood's division over to Jenkins.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{synthesis}} {{methods are}} being developed as a future source of PZT 95 / 5 powder for neutron generator voltage bar applications. Laboratory-scale powder processes were established to produce PZT billets from these powders. The interactions between calcining temperature, sintering temperature, and pore former content were studied to identify the conditions necessary to produce PZT billets of the desired density and grain size. Several binder systems and pressing aids were evaluated for producing uniform sintered <b>billets</b> with low <b>open</b> porosity. The development of these processes supported the powder synthesis efforts and enabled comparisons between different chem-prep routes...|$|R
40|$|The {{techniques}} of physical modeling and visioplasticity {{were used to}} explore the behavior during extrusion of particulate metal-matrix composites. Plasticine billets with nylon inclusions were chosen as modeling materials. Initial full-billet testing was done {{in order to make}} sure that the previously-observed phenomenon of void formation during extrusion of half-billets was not due solely to interaction between the half-billet and the transparent chamber cover or its silicon gel coating. Extensive half-billet testing was then undertaken. A constant reduction ratio of 2 : 1 was used. Friction was kept as constant as possible: the die and chamber were coated with talcum powder, and the chamber cover was coated with silicon gel. The semicone die angle was varied. Six values were used: 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 °. Some degree of void-formation around the front and back of the nylon half-sphere was found in almost all samples. However, the size of the voids was significantly smaller in the billets extruded through 15 ° dies than in those extruded through the other dies. It may be that there is a critical angle somewhere below 30 °. Voids visible on the top of the billet were similarly shaped for both front and back positions. They had conical profiles, with the largest cross-sectional area at the sphere, and were slightly overhung with plasticine along their sides. Voids not visible from the top of the billet, but only when the <b>billet</b> was cut <b>open</b> and the half-sphere removed, were smaller than the top-visible voids, but had clear similarities to them. Video-taping of the extrusions, with normal and magnifying lenses, allowed the flow patterns in front and back of the nylon half-sphere to be observed at length. A distinct flow pattern emerged. The pattern and the shape of the voids show strong resemblances to those of the piping defect...|$|R
