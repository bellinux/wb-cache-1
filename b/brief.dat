40|$|Aims: The paper {{reviews the}} {{development}} of information and communication technology in <b>briefing</b> and proposes a collaborative <b>briefing</b> framework to extend key stakeholder engagement, aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of project <b>briefing</b> for megaprojects. Scope: Authors introduce an innovative collaborative approach to promote stakeholder involvement by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of managing {{a large group of}} stakeholders, harnessing collaboration technology. Drawing parallels with biological neural networks in humans, a conceptual collaborative <b>briefing</b> framework is proposed to demonstrate how <b>briefing</b> team members can work collaboratively as a virtual organisation through a shared digital workspace. This framework has five core elements: integrated <b>briefing</b> team, collaborative <b>briefing</b> job plan, computer supported cooperative work platform, requirements processing models and facilitation models. Conclusion: The proposed framework supplements face-to-face discussion with computer mediated discussion, depending on the type, flexibility and interaction needed for different aspects in <b>briefing.</b> This "hybrid <b>briefing</b> method" would maximise the benefits to costs ratio of expanded stakeholder engagement in project <b>briefing.</b> The framework is expected to promote the accuracy and transparency of 'requirements identification' processing, the effective engagement and appropriate integration of more stakeholder inputs and finally, to improve the efficiency and reliability of <b>briefing</b> outputs. Lastly, some framework limitations are discussed, aimed at further development and a computer prototype. © 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
