50|$|Within Dutch society nudity is less sexualized as in {{for example}} the English-speaking world and resembles more the views of other Northern European {{cultures}} on nudity. Saunas, gyms and swimming pools are often visited by families and therefore always mixed. Some saunas do offer special children mornings or men-only or women-only evenings. At the beach and on the terraces along it, the Dutch are as sparsely clothed as possible. Do not get offended by this because to the Dutch this kind of <b>beach</b> <b>dress</b> is completely normal. Women, also older women, may also (sun) bathe topless on most beaches in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has nudist beaches.|$|E

Her "Children on the Beach " depicts a placid scene {{around the turn of}} the century. With buckets and small shovels, two little girls in <b>beach</b> <b>dresses,</b> one with a sun bonnet, make an attempt to change the sandy landscape; in the background sailboats float serenely in the calm waters. On viewing the painting, we feel that everything is right with the world. If only it were true. We love our children; we pamper them; we indulge them; we educate them-but we also pollute their environment. Exposure to toxicants is a daily experience for our children. The exposures occur in ways in which we often are not aware. Children play in sand that may contain toxicants of unknown origin. Children play on the lawn and, as children will do, end up with soil on their hand...|$|R

The group became [...] "Virgins in Residence" [...] at the Intersection Theatre in 1973 and 1974 performing 30 minute improv musical shows before the scheduled Charlie Chaplin and Betty Boop movies.

[...] The group's message was that the media only paid attention to entrances.|$|R
