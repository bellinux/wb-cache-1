40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} three types of aesthetics (classical, expressive, and design aesthetics) on users' quality perceptions about websites based on very short exposure (one second) to websites. It also examines the consistency of website quality perceptions based on very short exposure with the quality perceptions based on a long exposure {{and the impact of}} the quality perception based on a very short exposure on users' buying intentions. An experimental design was developed on participants exposed to different web shops for different exposure times. The findings indicate that quality perceptions and buying intentions are not affected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> of a website if this is based on one second exposure. Longer exposure to a website is an important determinant of buying behavior, while all three types of aesthetics are important determinants of the customer's quality perception about the site and the customer's intention to buy a produc...|$|E

Nowadays, it is the 3 rd most common reason of bowel obstruction mostly in the Middle East countries, Africa, India, and Russia where average age is younger compared to the west (about 40 to 50).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an approach of consumer perception in {{relation with the}} packages appearance. How consumers perceive certain messages from the outlook of a package may influence their buying decision. Study had been done in three main issues arose from the topic of packages which are the appropriateness of appearance, branding and pricing as reflected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> towards the packages. Survey based on coffee packages had been done targeting consumers in Malaysia through the means of printed questionnaire and online questionnaire distribution. As results obtained by these attempts, consumers notice the differences possessed by each package {{in the market and}} they are most likely to purchase what they like. Thus shows that it is crucial for the packages to be able to create emotional attachment in consumers' mind during their first glimpse. From the findings, most of the time consumer will rather attracted by the packages outlook instead of the functionality of the packages. Besides, consumers also have the opinion that appearance, branding and pricing are highly related to each other in order to convey the correct messages to the correct group of people. Also, the response of the respondents is reflecting the behaviour of consumers in Malaysia that take outlook of product packages into consideration during their buying process. Thus, {{it is important for the}} marketers in Malaysia to notice the shifting of modern consumer perception as to create product packages that is attractive and appropriate to their target market. ...|$|E

60|$|At daylight, Tahiti, {{an island}} which must for ever remain {{classical}} to the voyager in the South Sea, was in view. At a distance the appearance was not attractive. The luxuriant vegetation {{of the lower}} part could not yet be seen, and as the clouds rolled past, the wildest and most precipitous peaks showed themselves towards {{the centre of the}} island. As soon as we anchored in Matavai Bay, we were surrounded by canoes. This was our Sunday, but the Monday of Tahiti: if the case had been reversed, we should not have received a single visit; for the injunction not to launch a canoe on the Sabbath is rigidly obeyed. After dinner we landed to enjoy all <b>the</b> delights produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> of a new country, and that country the charming Tahiti. A crowd of men, women, and children, was collected on the memorable Point Venus, ready to receive us with laughing, merry faces. They marshalled us towards the house of Mr. Wilson, the missionary of the district, who met us on the road, and gave us a very friendly reception. After sitting a short time in his house, we separated to walk about, but returned there in the evening.|$|R

40|$|The current {{research}} aims {{to present a}} detailed idiographic analysis regarding the experience of changing jobs from public service to private sector. The study was conducted on a sample consisting of five participants, ages between 24 and 46 years old. Each participant was interviewed based on semi-structured interviews and their transcripts were further analyzed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis. This specific method implied analyzing the experiential responses and their respective meanings line <b>by</b> line, retaining <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> followed <b>by</b> identifying <b>the</b> emergent topics from the experiential material, with focus on similarities and discrepancies within each case, {{as well as between}} all cases. Five themes emerged from the experiential material provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> participants: the job characteristics in the public sector, the causes that lead to changing the workplace, the job characteristics in the private sector, barriers in adapting to the new work settings, changes regarding the relationship work – family life. Based on the “verbatim” content obtained, there could be outlined a certain “portrait” of the public sector as a product of a specific cultural, economic, social and even political environment, presented mainly as opposed to the private sector. The propensity to the “family” type work group, the institutional disorganization, <b>the</b> chaos represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bureaucracy, the lack of motivation and the routine are among the issues that matter, but „lack” to the participants in the new workplace. We consider that this kind of approach provides new insights regarding the experience of changing the workplace from public to private sector, based on first-hand information from people who went trough the experience...|$|R

40|$|The four studies {{included}} in this paper examine the strength of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> in <b>the</b> estimation of work effort. The studied context is mainly one where <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impressions</b> of software development effort is manipulated (biased) through comparisons with either much too low or too high reference effort values, e. g., by responding to a question from the client whether one believes that the effort will be less than 10 work-hours when the likely usage of effort typically {{would be in the}} range of 100 - 300 work-hours. Then, the software developers are exposed to a subsequent comparison with reference effort values in the opposite direction, e. g., by responding to a question from the client whether one believes that the effort would be less than 800 work-hours. The results from the four studies suggest a strong <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> effect, but also a noticeable effect from the subsequent comparisons. We also observe that the instruction to “forget ” <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> seems to have the opposite effect, i. e., it seems to increase the strength of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression.</b> A practical implication of the results is that it is essential that software professionals ensure that their <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> of a project’s development effort is based on comparisons with representative reference values and objects. <b>First</b> <b>impressions</b> in software development seem to be easy to manipulate with misleading reference values and difficult to replace. 1...|$|R

40|$|When {{firms are}} doing {{business}} {{it is important}} to meet the customer’s expectations. It is often in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> (<b>the</b> <b>first</b> time <b>the</b> parties meet in a sales encounter) that the seller fails to do this, sometimes resulting in the prospective customer dropping the whole thought of a business deal and no further relationship is established. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> results from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> image and understanding a seller creates in a potential customer: here the latter gets a brief insight into the former’s organization, credibility and overall quality. Each encounter or meeting is an opportunity to achieve trust and build a relationship, but also contains the risk of reducing credibility and losing all chances of a relationship. The purpose of this thesis is to describe and analyse the importance of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> when creating and building a business to business relationship and to describe the factors which influence this process. The theoretical framework is based on theories regarding <b>the</b> concept of <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> and <b>the</b> implications of two-way communication during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> encounter. These include the seller’s preparation and categorisation of the customer before each encounter. Other variations of communication concerns verbal and non-verbal communication, generalizations, cultural differences and circumstances where a failure can turn into an advantage. The present qualitative case study is based on interviews with five highly competent respondents with long experience of business relationships. They were chosen after discussions with Walter Carvajal, owner and MD of City Guest Service. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> was very important in creating a business relationship. Some variables, e. g. gender, had less significance. Generally, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>impression</b> included <b>the</b> small things a person perceived and interpreted during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> encounter. Combined, they determined whether a person chose to do business with the counterpart in question. All aspects of verbal and non-verbal commu-nication formed a basis for judging the other person. Cultural differences increased the acceptance level, reducing the risk of failure, when the parties were from differ-ent cultures...|$|R
