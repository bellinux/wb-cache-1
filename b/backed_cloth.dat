5000|$|In 1973 the '1300 Marathon' {{replaced}} the original Marathon (type 6645 for sedans, 6646 for coupes, 6647 for combis). It featured a 1289cc [...] {{version of the}} Renault C-series inline 4 engine used in all 66s. The 1300 Marathon was distinguishable from its lesser brethren by the foglights mounted in the grille. The interior featured a centre console with room for fitting extra gauges and high <b>backed</b> <b>cloth</b> sports seats. The less torquey but more powerful 1108cc Marathon engine remained available as an option on all models.|$|E

50|$|Walton’s next {{product was}} inlaid {{linoleum}}, which resembled encaustic tiles, in 1882. Previously, linoleum had been produced in solid colours, with patterns {{printed on the}} surface if required. In inlaid linoleum, the colours extend {{all the way through}} to the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth.</b> Inlaid linoleum was made using a stencil type method where different-coloured granules were placed in shaped metal trays, after which the sheets were run through heated rollers to fuse them to the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth.</b> In 1898 Walton devised a process for making straight-line inlaid linoleum that allowed for crisp, sharp geometric designs. This involved strips of uncured linoleum being cut and pieced together patchwork-fashion before being hot-rolled. Embossed inlaid linoleum was not introduced until 1926.|$|R

50|$|To {{maximize}} screen life most manufacturers {{build their}} screens with {{multiple layers of}} mesh over a very sturdy <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> to further protect the cloth against solids loading and wear. The multiple layers of mesh act as a de-blinding mechanism pushing near sized particles, which may get stuck in the openings, out of the mesh reducing blinding issues and keeping the screen surface available for use.|$|R

40|$|Unconventional {{textiles}} are goods {{obtained by}} methods {{other than the}} classic spinning, weaving and knitting. They are manufactured by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a fabric consisting of fiber layers {{or a combination of}} fiber, weaving, yarn or textile layers. Also, unconventional textiles can be obtained by mechanically or chemically reinforcing a yarn pattern or multiple yarn patterns. The tendency of the industry to increase production of synthetic fibers în comparison to natural fibers is also visible în the field of unconventional textiles. Additionally, there is more and more emphasis on using fibers recovered from recycled materials and products which resulted from a classic textile manufacturing process. A TUFTING product is made from a <b>backing</b> fabric, usually <b>cloth,</b> reinforced with yarn introduced through the fabric in loops spaced equally relative to the stitches, and raised at the ends. The fur substitutes can also be obtained with unconventional TUFTING technologies, by reinforcing a <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> and then undergoing a final reinforcement by raising and felting on one side. The TUFTING product obtained by reinforcing and weaving can be used în the manufacturing process because it is predisposed to unraveling and has an inadequate aspect. For an optimal uniformity în Tufting fur substitutes, it is recommended that the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> has a mean apparent density of 300 Kg/m 3 with a 5...|$|R
50|$|As {{an input}} to the jute {{manufacturing}} (goods) industry, the supply for jute {{is derived from}} the demand. Nearly 75% of jute goods are used as packaging materials, burlap, gunny cloth, (hessian), and sacks. Carpet <b>Backing</b> <b>Cloth,</b> the third major jute outlet, is fast growing in importance. Currently, it consists of roughly 15% of the world's jute goods consumption. The remaining products are carpet yarn, cordage, felts, padding, twine, ropes, decorative fabrics, and heavy duty miscellaneous items for industrial use.|$|R

50|$|Jute {{is used in}} the {{manufacture}} of a number of fabrics such as Hessian cloth, sacking, scrim, carpet <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> (CBC), and canvas. Hessian, lighter than sacking, is used for bags, wrappers, wall-coverings, upholstery, and home furnishings. Sacking, a fabric made of heavy jute fibers, has its use in the name. CBC made of jute comes in two types. Primary CBC provides a tufting surface, while secondary CBC is bonded onto the primary backing for an overlay. Jute packaging is used as an eco-friendly substitute.|$|R

50|$|Additional {{items that}} reflect a regiment's {{historical}} accomplishments, such as <b>backing</b> <b>cloth</b> and hackles, may be worn behind the cap badge. In Scottish regiments, for instance, it {{is a tradition}} for soldiers to wear their cap badges on a small square piece of their regimental tartans. Officer Cadets may wear a small white backing behind their badges. Members of arms such as the Adjutant General's Corps and Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers serving on attachment to other units often wear that regiment's beret or headdress but with their own Corps cap badge.|$|R
50|$|Cellophane {{was invented}} by Swiss chemist Jacques E. Brandenberger while {{employed}} by Blanchisserie et Teinturerie de Thaon. In 1900, inspired by seeing a wine spill on a restaurant's tablecloth, he decided to create a cloth that could repel liquids rather than absorb them. His {{first step was to}} spray a waterproof coating onto fabric, and he opted to try viscose. The resultant coated fabric was far too stiff, but the clear film easily separated from the <b>backing</b> <b>cloth,</b> and he abandoned his original idea as the possibilities of the new material became apparent.|$|R
