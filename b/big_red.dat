5|$|After {{making the}} {{decision}} to use a new character rather than Dizzy, Codemasters allowed <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> Software free rein to develop the new game, only stipulating that it must be ready for release within 12weeks. By this point <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> Software was already familiar with platform adventure games. The game retained the Dizzy graphic adventure title engine. Pete Ranson had previously designed graphics for every Dizzy game bar the first, graphics were shared between Dizzy games and some were also recycled for Seymour Goes to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with Magicland Dizzy, Codemasters sub-contracted <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> Software, {{headed by}} Paul Ranson, {{to assist in}} the {{production}} of future Dizzy games in the series. The success of Dizzy Prince of the Yolkfolk prompted <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> Software to take the series in a new direction. The publisher decided that the titular egg character's next adventure should be set in a world based on real-life.|$|E
5|$|Ivy League rivals Cornell and Princeton {{then had}} their 70th meeting, but {{first in the}} NCAA tournament. Earlier in the postseason, the <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> {{defeated}} the Tigers to split the Ivy League championship. Three Princeton shots hit the post {{in the first half}} of the second quarter, and Cornell entered halftime with a 5–1 advantage. In the third quarter, Tigers attackman Tommy Davis ended their 27:58 scoring drought with a 15-yard shot. Princeton quickly tallied again with 28 seconds in the period. In the final quarter, the <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> withstood two penalties to win, 6–4.|$|E

It featured larger balloon tires and a sportier look than the similar <b>Big</b> <b>Reds,</b> but could be ordered with cargo racks if the buyer chose to.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} designed {{as part of}} the Dizzy series, with a working title of Movieland Dizzy, but the creators of Dizzy disagreed with the real-world direction the game had taken, despite it being 90% complete. The developers, <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> Software, were given 12 weeks to create a new game with a different character. Seymour was adapted from Dizzy, with a new shape and fingers to differentiate the two.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or <b>big</b> <b>red,</b> is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Harvard set {{a school}} record with 26 wins during the season and tied {{a school record}} for conference wins with 12. Its 14 non-conference wins also tied an Ivy League record {{previously}} held by the 2009-10 Cornell <b>Big</b> <b>Red.</b> The season culminated in {{an invitation to the}} 2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where Harvard lost in the second round. It was Harvard's first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946 and third consecutive appearance in a postseason tournament. Junior Kyle Casey was a first-team All-Ivy selection, while junior Brandyn Curry and senior Keith Wright earned second-team recognition.|$|E

The film's script has been locked in a safe, meaning Seymour must solve puzzles by collecting and using objects scattered throughout the game in order to progress, ultimately retrieving the script and allowing filming to start.|$|E
5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a <b>big</b> <b>red</b> chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the <b>Big</b> <b>Red</b> Machine. Ellis admired Pete Rose and was concerned about how he would respond, but Ellis {{decided to do it}} regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of the}} first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 2011, Harvard {{made its}} first-ever {{appearance}} {{in either the}} AP (25th) or Coaches' Poll (24th).
