Fenwick concludes that the program's long-term effects are unknown, the est training may not be appropriate for certain groups of people, and that the large proportion of participants experience positive effects.|$|E
2500|$|A serious viticultural {{concern for}} Chablis {{vineyard}} owners is frost protection. During the bud <b>break</b> <b>period</b> of a grapevine's annual cycle, the Chablis region {{is vulnerable to}} springtime frost, from March to early May, which can compromise the crop yield. Formerly, the financial risk involved saw many producers turn to polyculture agriculture, pulling up vineyards to plant alternative crops. The 1957 vintage was hit particularly hard by frost damage: the regional authorities reported that only 11 cases (132 bottles) of wine were produced.|$|E
40|$|A new 10 -category, polarimetric-based {{hydrometeor}} identification algorithm (HID) for C band is de-veloped from theoretical scattering simulations including wet snow, hail, and big drops/melting hail. TheHID {{is applied}} to data from seven wet seasons in Darwin, Australia, using the polarimetric C-band (C-POL) radar, to investigate microphysical differences between monsoon and <b>break</b> <b>periods.</b> Scattering simulations reveal significant Mie effects with large hail (diameter. 1. 5 cm), with reduced reflectivity and enhanced differential reflectivity Zdr and specific differential phaseKdp relative to those associated with S band. Wet snow {{is found to be}} associated with greatly depreciated correlation coefficient rhv and moderate values of Zdr. It is noted that large oblate liquid drops can produce the same electromagnetic signatures at C band as melting hail falling quasi stably, resulting in some ambiguity in the HID retrievals. Application of the new HID to seven seasons of C-POL data reveals that hail and big drops/melting hail occur much more frequently during <b>break</b> <b>periods</b> than during monsoon <b>periods.</b> <b>Break</b> <b>periods</b> have a high frequency of vertically aligned ice above 12 km, suggesting the presence of strong electric fields.

40|$|Abstract: In the past, {{scientific}} studies {{have investigated the}} effects of shift timing and duration on sleep and alertness in the rail industry. To our knowledge no {{research has been conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} extended break lengths (> 48 h) on these factors. Hence, this study analyses the work and rest schedules of 304 Australian rail employees (mean age 41. 3 yr, standard deviation 7. 4 yr) to determine the effect of prior break lengths (12 â 169 h) on sleep and subjective alertness at work after periods of leave. Extended <b>break</b> <b>periods</b> (> 48 h) were found to increase the length of the sleep prior to returning to work and reduce the total wake time to the end of the first shift, but did not influence levels of subjective alertness immediately prior to the commencement of the first shift. Research into the influence of longer <b>break</b> <b>periods</b> (> 169 h) is needed in order to make definitive conclusions regarding sensible return to work policies after extended leave within the Australian rail industry...|$|R

40|$|Clouds forming {{during the}} summer monsoon over the Indian subcontinent affect its {{evolution}} through their radiative impact {{as well as the}} release of latent heat. While the latter is previously studied to some extent, comparatively {{little is known about the}} radiative impact of different cloud types and the vertical structure of their radiative heating/cooling effects. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to partly fill this knowledge gap by investigating and documenting the vertical distributions of the different cloud types associated with the Indian monsoon and their radiative heating/cooling using the active radar and lidar sensors on-board CloudSat and CALIPSO. The intraseasonal evolution of clouds from May to October is also investigated to understand pre-to-post monsoon transitioning of their radiative heating/cooling effects. The vertical structure of cloud radiative heating (CRH) follows the northward migration and retreat of the monsoon from May to October. Throughout this time period, stratiform clouds radiatively warm the middle troposphere and cool the upper troposphere by more than +/- 0. 2 K day(- 1) (after weighing by cloud fraction), with the largest impacts observed in June, July and August. During these months, the fraction of high thin cloud remains high in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). Deep convective towers cause considerable radiative warming in the middle and upper troposphere, but strongly cool the base and inside of the TTL. This cooling is stronger during active (- 1. 23 K day(- 1)) monsoon <b>periods</b> compared to <b>break</b> <b>periods</b> (- 0. 36 K day(- 1)). The contrasting radiative warming effect of high clouds in the TTL is twice as largeduring active <b>periods</b> than in <b>break</b> <b>periods.</b> These results highlight the increasing importance of CRH with altitude, especially in the TTL. Stratiform (made up of alto- and nimbostratus clouds) and deep convection clouds radiatively cool the surface by approximately - 100 and - 400 Wm(- 2) respectively while warming the atmosphere radiatively by about 40 to 150 Wm(- 2). While the cooling at the surface induced by deep convection and stratiform clouds is largest during active periods of monsoon, the importance of stratiform clouds further increases during <b>break</b> <b>periods.</b> The contrasting CREs (cloud radiative effects) in the atmosphere and at surface, and during active and <b>break</b> <b>periods,</b> should have direct implications for the monsoonal circulation...|$|R
