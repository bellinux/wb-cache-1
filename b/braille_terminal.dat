50|$|A refreshable {{braille display}} or <b>braille</b> <b>terminal</b> is an {{electro-mechanical}} device for displaying braille characters, usually by means of round-tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface. Blind computer users who cannot use a computer monitor {{can use it to}} read text output. Speech synthesizers are also commonly used for the same task, and a blind user may switch between the two systems or use {{both at the same time}} depending on circumstances.

40|$|Blind programmers {{have been}} able to work productively along side their sighted peers in a {{command-line}} environment with the aid of tools such as screen readers and <b>Braille</b> <b>terminals.</b> Over the past few decades, however, computers have transitioned from text-based to graphical interfaces, and this change has resulted in the blind being unable to design commonly used applications. A scripting language was thus created that would allow blind programmers to design graphical Microsoft Visual Basic forms by specifying the layout in a text file rather than using the conventional “point and click ” method. The compiler for the language was written in Microsoft Visual C++ and utilizes a table-driven parser to interpret the user’s text file and output its respective form file. In addition to allowing blind programmers to create graphical forms, the language bears a strong resemblance to Visual Basic syntax and maintains Visual Basic’s status as a RAD (Rapid Application Development) programming language. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel concept on reading assistive technologies for the blind: the TactoBook, {{a system that}} is able to translate entire electronic books (eBooks) to Braille code and to reproduce them in portable electronic Braille terminals. The TactoBook consists of a computer-based translator that converts fast and automatically any eBook into Braille. The Braille version of the eBook is then encrypted as a file and stored in a USB memory drive which is later inserted and reproduced in a compact, lightweight, and highly-portable tactile terminal. In particular, this paper presents a piezoelectric ultrasonic actuation approach to design and implement such portable <b>Braille</b> <b>terminal.</b> Actuating mechanism, design concept, first prototype, and performance results are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a multi modal user interface integrated within an architecture allowing visually impaired pupils and sighted people to work on the same station. This architecture is developed to face the problem of the inclusion of visually impaired pupils in mainstream education. The system is able to display the same original multi-media content converted in different ways on screen, <b>Braille</b> <b>terminal</b> and vocal synthesizers. It accepts various interactions from keyboard, Braille bar and mouse. Both blind and sighted users can manage the same tools, cooperate together on the same content, and thus perform the same activities. Blind pupils may be assisted by sighted teachers or tutors that don’t know how to read Braille characters...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimates}} at 285 {{million the}} number of people affected by visual deficiencies, among which 39 millions are totally blind. In our modern society saturated with visual media tools and applications (images, videos, web pages, etc.), accessing visual information becomes a central need for all kinds of tasks and users, including the visually impaired. In this context, various adapted tools of assistance (screen readers, <b>Braille</b> <b>terminals,</b> screen magnification, etc.), have been increasingly helping persons suffering from a visual incapacity to access and manipulate information. While effective with textual contents, nonetheless, existing solutions remain very limited when it comes to accessing and understanding visual contents. The goal of our work is to provide a computerized solution, investigating the use of the vibrating touch screen technology in providing a contour-based presentation of simple images for visually impaired users. This could prove very useful in allowing blind people to access geographic maps, to navigate autonomously inside and outside buildings, as well as to access graphs and mathematical charts (for visually impaired students). To achieve this, we develop a detailed experimental protocol, EVIAC, testing a blind userâs capacity in learning, understanding, distinguishing and identifying basic geometric objects using a vibrating touch screen. Preliminary tests on blindfolded candidates show promising results with respect to traditional paper embossing. N/...|$|R
40|$|The tactile {{channel is}} the only {{communication}} channel available for the speech and deaf-blind people. The common used communication methods {{are based on a}} hand contact between the handicapped person and the others; this communication is obviously possible only at short distance. Another communication method is based on the Braille code; this is possible only if both the parties in conversation have a dedicated terminal namely, the handicapped perdon a <b>Braille</b> <b>terminal</b> and the other a terminal for data transmission. In this paper we describe a system that allows a handicapped person to make a telephone communication. The system uses speech processing technologies. Current technology of speech processing allows the automatic text-to-speech convertion with good quality and the automatic recognition of spoken words with low error rates for limited vocabulary (hundred words) and connected speech...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a portable communication aid which allows the deaf-blind people to communicate with others without the help of an assistant. The system is composed of two major units–one for the deaf-blind persons and the other for sighted persons. The deaf-blind person can send messages by typing on a <b>Braille</b> <b>terminal</b> and the messages will be converted to be Mandarin phonetic symbols which are then displayed on an LCD display to be read by a sighted partner. Then the sighted partner can send messages back by typing on a simple keyboard and the messages will be displayed on a Braille display to be "read " by the blind-deaf person. The aid has been designed to be effective, reliable, and inexpensive. Some experimental results are reported to demonstrate the applicability of the aid...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The TiM project {{intends to}} develop and to adapt {{computer}} games for visually impaired children. A game platform, the blindstation, was developed to adapt existing content or create some new games. It provides a set of Python functions to describe those games in an abstract way, independent from their representation. The platform can then render the game in a multi-modal way using the screen, keyboard, mouse and joystick, but also using some specific devices like a <b>Braille</b> <b>terminal,</b> 3 D sound, a tactile board or a speech synthesizer. The rendering is done according to an XML style sheet which describes the available resources. It can be customized depending on the available devices {{but also on the}} user's choices and disabilities. Several games have already been developed in different types (action, adventure, exploration [...] .) and are currently tested in schools specialized in visually impaired children. 1. The TiM Project The game engine presented in this paper is part of the TiM (Tactile Interactive Multimedia) project [TiM 2000]. The purpose of this project is to offer multimedia computer games intended for young children who are blind or severely visually impaired. TiM is also addressing visually impaired children with additional impairments in form of slight to moderate degree of learning or cognitive disability and/or a physical impairmen...|$|E
