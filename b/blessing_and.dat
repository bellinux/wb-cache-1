Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's <b>blessing,</b> <b>and</b> assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Paretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2.

5|$|Bojić's matrilineal line traces {{its origins}} {{to the town}} of Tetovo, in what is now {{northern}} Macedonia. His mother's family had fled the town in 1690 as part of the Great Serb Migration and settled in Bečkerek (modern Zrenjanin). Bojić's maternal grandfather, Jovan, had lived in the border town of Pančevo since he was a child, married and started a family there. Much like Bojić's father, he was a successful shoemaker, and in 1890 he offered to marry his only daughter to him. After initial disagreement over the price of the dowry, Bogojević gave the marriage his <b>blessing</b> <b>and</b> Bojić's parents were soon married.|$|E

5|$|Concordant rites exist {{with the}} <b>blessing</b> <b>and</b> often the active support of regular masonic lodges. There are several {{concordant}} {{bodies in the}} United States which admit the wives and female relatives of Freemasons. The Dutch Order of Weavers admits only the wives, while in the American orders {{the men and women}} share in the ritual. Like the lodges of adoption, they have their own ceremonies, which means that some grand lodges view them as irregular.|$|E
5|$|In 1869 reformers again left Baith Israel, and, joining with dissenters from Kahal Kodesh Beth Elohim of Williamsburg, founded Temple Israel. Though many reformers {{had left}} the congregation, several reforms in the service were {{nonetheless}} introduced: the congregation abolished most piyyutim and the Priestly <b>Blessing,</b> <b>and,</b> in 1873, introduced a confirmation ceremony for girls, led by the Reverend Dr. Tinter. The confirmation ceremonies, which had initially been held during the holiday of Sukkot, were eventually moved to the holiday of Shavuot (the holiday during which the Reform movement held these ceremonies), and continued for {{both boys and girls}} (in place of Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations) until the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a religious belief among some Christians, who hold that financial <b>blessing</b> <b>and</b> physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|The main {{threat to}} Harald Maddadsson and Rognvald Kali came from Erlend Haraldsson, {{especially}} from Erlend's supporter Frakkok. The old conspirator, however, was soon disposed of, {{burned to death}} in her hall near Helmsdale. The Orkneyinga Saga names Svein Asleifsson as the killer, and says that he came to Caithness from the south, from Atholl, with Rognvald's <b>blessing</b> <b>and</b> Matad's help. This Svein Asleifsson had also been the man in whose custody Earl Paul had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali, also spelled Dakshinakaali, is {{the most}} popular form of Kaali in Bengal. There are various {{versions}} for the origin of the name Dakshinakaali. Dakshina refers to the gift given to a priest before performing a ritual or to one's guru. Such gifts are traditionally given with the right hand. Daksinakaali's two right hands are usually depicted in gestures of <b>blessing</b> <b>and</b> giving of boons. One version of the origin of her name comes from the story of Yama, lord of death, who lives in the south (daksina). When Yama heard Kali's name, he fled in terror, and so those who worship Kali are said to be able to overcome death itself.|$|E
5|$|During Fineshriber's {{early years}} the {{congregation}} continued to modify its religious practices. At funerals, it encouraged mourners {{to leave the}} graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and Sukkot, required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish, and restored the Orthodox practice of <b>blessing</b> <b>and</b> naming babies in the synagogue {{as part of the}} services.|$|E
