30|$|Most {{previous}} studies used knit fabrics {{to compare the}} performance of conventional and HE washers (Ankeny et al. 2014; Klausing et al. 2012). Schlag and Ordonez (2010) used both knit and woven fabrics {{and found that the}} differences between the two <b>types</b> of <b>washers</b> were mostly in the woven fabric. Therefore, in the current study, an 100 % cotton, plain weave, black fabric was used as the test fabric. Dark color fabrics are more vulnerable to the problem of fading than light color fabrics during the laundering process (Fergusson 2008); therefore, a black test fabric was selected to examine the color change after washing (color fastness to washing). The fabric weight was 112.15  g/m 2, which was measured according to ASTM D 3776 /D 3776 M- 09 a (2013): Standard Test Method for Mass per Unit Area (Weight) of Fabric.

The authors {{indicated that the}} specimens washed in the two HE washers “seemed to have” less color change than the specimens washed in the conventional washer. Because statistical analysis was not used in the study, it is unclear if the findings were statistically different between the <b>types</b> of <b>washers</b> or within the sample/testing variance. The specimens washed in two HE washers had consistently lower degrees of shrinkage than those washed in the conventional washer after 5, 10, 15 and 20 laundering cycles. These findings were inconsistent {{with the results of}} Klausing et al. (2012) and Schlag and Ordonez (2010), who found no significant differences in shrinkage and color change after five laundering cycles. Among the few studies that compared conventional and HE washers (Ankeny et al. 2014; Klausing et al. 2012; Schlag and Ordonez 2010), many mixed findings were reported, indicating an essential need for further studies.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBolted joints {{are used}} for {{fastening}} components together in the industry, aeronautics and in railways. These joints may get loose with time and if not attended timely may result in catastrophic failure also. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of tightening torque on loosening.

30|$|Schlag and Ordonez (2010) {{presented}} their study at a conference, reporting {{the comparisons of}} several care performances (appearance smoothness, dimensional change, color change, skewness change, and stain removal) of woven and knitted fabrics between washed in a conventional top-loading washer and a front-loading HE washer after five laundering cycles. For the woven fabric, the HE washer had better performance in appearance smoothness than the conventional washer, but {{no significant difference in}} appearance smoothness was found for the knit fabric. In addition, {{no significant differences were found}} in dimensional change and color change between the two <b>types</b> of <b>washers</b> for both the woven and the knit fabric. Schlag and Ordonez also reported some mixed results. A significant difference in skewness change was found for the woven test fabric after five laundering cycles, but no significant difference was found for the woven ballast fabric. (Ballast fabric was used to bring the total weight of the laundry load to a specified value, which was 4.00 [*]±[*] 0.13  lb). In stain removal, spectrophotometric measurements of Delta E showed that the HE washer had better performance in removing used motor oil and mustard stains for both woven and knit fabrics, but the conventional washer had better performance in removing lipstick stains. However, the Gray Scale Color Change results were opposite to the spectrophotometric results; the conventional washer had better performance in removing used motor oil and mustard stains for both woven and knit fabrics, but the HE washer had better performance in removing lipstick stains.|$|R
30|$|Several {{limitations}} of the study were recognized and may be examined through further research. First, although many brands of washers are available on the market, only one conventional washer and one front-loading HE washer were used in the study. The wash action and setting of each washing machine may differ. More tests involving various washers are needed to verify the effects of washer on fabric care performances. Second, only a plain weave fabric was used in the current study, but different fabrics may behave in a different way when washed in different <b>types</b> of <b>washers.</b> Further studies using other types of fabric structures, such as knits or woven fabrics with other types of weaves (e.g., twill or satin weave), may be carried out. Third, only a black fabric was used in the current study. Although a fabric in a dark color was a better choice in comparing color change after washing, a black fabric might make the differences in stain removal harder to detect. Further studies may consider using a lighter color to verify the findings of stain removal in the current study. Fourth, only one type of laundry detergent and one type of dryer sheet softener were used. Chowdhary (2017) reported that a significant difference was found in dimensional stability between an AATCC standard detergent and a commercial detergent. Further studies may need to use different types of detergents or softeners to fully understand the role a detergent or softener plays in the fabric care performance of conventional and HE washers.|$|R
50|$|Bushings {{are perhaps}} the easiest things to change on a truck in order to change the feel of how it turns. Bushings are usually made of a {{polyurethane}} material, and come in varying shapes and durometers (hardness). Two of the most standard bushing shapes include barrels and cones. Barrels, having a larger shape, are often thought to have more stability and rebound whereas cones, having a more narrow shape, allow for more turn and less rebound. The durometer of the bushing also greatly influences its characteristics. a harder bushing (such as a bushing with a rating around 97A) will be much harder to turn on than a softer bushing (something around 78A). The <b>type</b> of <b>washers</b> used with the bushing can also greatly affect the bushing's characteristics. While {{it depends on the}} size of the washer, generally a cupped washer will be the most restrictive on a bushing, a flat washer will be neutral, and a flipped cup washer will be the least restrictive.Another aspect of the longboard that has an influence on bushing performance is the bushing seat on the truck. The bushing seat is the area on the hangar where the bushing makes contact. This area often has a rim to cup the edge of the bushing, adding a small amount of restriction as the bushing deforms through a turn. Some trucks have very loose or even non-existent bushing seats, whereas others have very restrictive bushing seats, greatly reducing bushing deformation. More restrictive bushing seats generally found on trucks designed with faster riding in mind as they offer more stability and lean.|$|R
40|$|Viable {{bacteria}} {{have been}} found on environmental surfaces, including washed and unwashed clothing, and places that {{come into contact with}} laundry. Under certain conditions, clothing contaminated with pathogenic organisms may present a health risk to the laundry handler. This research project focused on i) evaluating Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA survival using front-load and top-load washing machines; ii) determining relative microbial levels on new, disposable, laundered and unlaundered hospital scrubs; iii) characterizing the relative hygiene of public and apartment laundromat surfaces; and iv) developing a quantitative risk assessment for laundry handlers. Standard microbial evaluation techniques were used to identify and quantify a variety of microorganisms on fabrics and environmental surfaces, including HPC bacteria, S. aureus, MRSA, total coliforms and Escherichia coli. S. aureus and MRSA were exclusively used during evaluation of bacteria reduction levels achieved by front- and top-load washers. Results from this research indicate:i) Washing in either a top- or front-load washer affords a 5 - 6 log 10 reduction of S. aureus and MRSA when detergent is used. If complete drying and/or bleach are also employed, a 6 - 7 log 10 reduction is achieved and few organisms remain. ii) Bacteria cross-contamination of other fabrics within a laundry load is common for both <b>types</b> of <b>washers</b> and between loads on the interior of top-load washers. iii) Significantly fewer bacteria (p= 0. 044) were detected on hospital-laundered scrubs than on home-laundered scrubs. iv) Laundromat surfaces can be contaminated with substantial numbers of bacteria and the potential exists for transfer of bacteria from a past user to the next laundromat patron. v) The risk of acquiring a S. aureus infection after handling unwashed laundry contaminated with an initial S. aureus level of 106 CFU/cm 2 was estimated to be 0. 59 infections per person per year. The estimated risk became negligible if handling washed laundry...|$|R
40|$|Superconducting quantum {{interference}} devices (SQUIDs) {{based on}} high critical-temperature superconducting nanowire junctions were designed, fabricated, and characterized {{in terms of}} their potential as magnetometers for magnetoencephalography (MEG). In these devices, the high kinetic inductance of junctions and the thin film thickness (50 nm) pose special challenges in optimizing the field coupling. The high kinetic inductance also brings difficulties in reaching a low SQUID noise. To explore the technique for achieving a high field sensitivity, single-layer devices with a directly connected pickup loop and flip-chip devices with an inductively coupled flux transformer using a two-level coupling approach were fabricated and tested. Two-level coupling is an approach designed for flip-chip nanowire-based SQUIDs, in which a <b>washer</b> <b>type</b> SQUID pickup loop is introduced as an intermediate coupling level between the SQUID loop and the flux transformer input coil. The inductances and effective areas of all these devices were simulated. We found that at T = 77 K, flip-chip devices with the two-level coupling approach (coupling coefficient of 0. 37) provided the best effective area of 0. 46 mm(2) among all the tested devices. With a flux noise level of 55 mu Phi(0) Hz- 1 / 2, the field sensitivity level was 240 fTHz- 1 / 2. This sensitivity is not yet adequate for MEG applications but it is the best level ever reached for nanowire-based high-Tc SQUID magnetometers...|$|R

The 241 -AN- 105 system is the third-generation corrosion monitoring system described by TTP RLO- 8 -WT- 21. Improvements and upgrades from the second-generation system (installed in 241 -AN- 102) that have been incorporated into the third-generation system include: Gasket seating surfaces utilize O-rings instead of a <b>washer</b> <b>type</b> gasket for improved seal; Probe design contains an equally spaced array of 22 thermocouples; Probe design contains an adjustable verification thermocouple; Probe design contains three ports for pressure/gas sampling; Probe design contains one set of strain gauges to monitor probe flexure if flexure occurs; Probe utilizes an adjustable collar to allow depth adjustment of probe during installation; System is capable of periodically conducting LPR scans; System is housed in a climate controlled enclosure adjacent to the riser containing the probe; System uses wireless Ethernet links to send data to Hanford Local Area Network; System uses commercial remote access software to allow remote command and control; and Above ground wiring uses driven shields to reduce external electrostatic noise in the data.

5000|$|During {{the years}} that Frigidaire was owned by General Motors, it was very {{competitive}} in the automatic clothes-washing-machine business. Frigidaire engineer Kenneth Sisson, also credited with {{the design of the}} incrementing timer used on clothes washers and dishwashers for years to come, designed the Frigidaire automatic washer with the Unimatic mechanism in the late 1930s. Production of the first Frigidaire automatic clothes washers was halted due to World War II and therefore the machine was not formally introduced until 1947. The washing action of a Frigidaire automatic was unique in that the agitator pulsated up and down, a unique departure from the traditional oscillating <b>type.</b> The Frigidaire <b>washers</b> were commonly named for their mechanisms, which, in true General Motors fashion, underwent frequent changes over the years. The Unimatic was in production the longest, for any single Frigidaire mechanism, from 1947 to 1958. The Pulsamatic mechanism, unique in that it pulsated 630 times per minute, was introduced in 1955 for the lower-end models. This became the foundation for the Multimatic, introduced for the 1959 model year. The Multimatic lasted through 1964, as the Rollermatic was brought out for the 1965 lineup. The Rollermatic was unique in that instead of using an oil-filled gearcase, metal and urethane rollers transferred the power within the mechanism. This underwent a slight revision in 1970 for the new eighteen-pound capacity 1-18, which kept the same basic mechanism but differed in that it was belt-driven off of the motor and added a recirculating pump. Besides the unique action, another notable feature of these older washers was the final, high-speed spin cycle (nicknamed [...] "Rapidry"), 1140 revolutions per minute in the Unimatic, 850 in the Multimatic, and 1010 in the high-end Rollermatic models.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a review of}} different techniques to tighten a bolted joint and investigates {{the ability of the}} methods to tighten the joint to a prescribed bolt tension. A literature survey was undertaken which revealed that different opinions exist regarding the performance of certain tightening methods and the influence of several commonly encountered factors on them. Test equipment was designed and built to study the performance of five tightening methods: torque control, angle control - elastic range, angle control - yield range, yield control, and load indicating washers. The effects of a number of practical factors on the performance of these methods were investigated. The main factors investigated were: joint stiffness, nut and bolt plating and geometry, and <b>washer</b> <b>type.</b> The tests have shown that yield controlled tightening and angle control (yield range) provide the most accurate methods of tightening a bolted joint to a prescribed bolt tension (+/- 5 %). Torque control and load indicating washers (Coronet) can tighten the joint to +/- 10 %. Angle control (elastic range) gives relatively poor control over bolt tension (+/- 14 %), largely due to variations in snug position and tension-angle gradient. The deflections of the joint components influence the performance of the angle-related tightening methods. The deflection of the threaded connection itself is significant, especially for 'hard' joints. This contribution to the overall deflection has been largely neglected in previous studies. Methods to improve the accuracy of the tightening methods are discussed. In particular the use of hardened washers to improve the accuracy and repeatability of torque control is recommended. Furthermore, preliminary tests were conducted on the design of a washer, which would indicate when the joint has been tightened to a prescribed tension...|$|R
40|$|During 100 h {{servicing}} of an aeroengine, chips were {{noticed in}} the oil system. Strip examination of the engine revealed severe damages to the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of the engine accessory gearbox with cage broken and lying inside the casing along with the balls. In addition, on the cover side, the bush on O 3 axis was found without nuts and tab washers. The damaged bearing along with the dislodged nuts and tab washers were sent to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that there was spalling, smearing and flow of material in all elements of the cover side bearing. There was sliding in the bearing due to breakage of the cage resulting in loss of shape of the balls and flow of material out of inner raceway. Fractographic study confirmed that the cage of the bearing had failed by fatigue. This, along with the signatures of failure in the bearing as a whole indicated that the failure was progressive in nature, and it was caused due to rotational creep from either inner ring being loose or outer ring being loose or excessive axial load. Since there is remote possibility of excessive axial load on the bearing on O 3 axis of the EAGB, looseness in the inner ring and/or outer ring or any problem(s) elsewhere which could give rise to similar situation {{appears to be the}} reason for the bearing failure. Laboratory examination did not reveal any damages to the dislodged nuts except for rubbing marks along all six edges of the nut faces. The Cu-plating on all the faces was found undisturbed. The threads were found to be in tact without any distress. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bush nuts have come out of the bolts by progressive unwinding. This is further substantiated by the presence of rubbing marks on all the six edges of the nuts, which is possible only when the nuts rotate around the axis, that is, the bolts, and they make contact periodically with the tab washer surface. The two tab washers provided for examination showed fretting damage on the contacting surfaces with the nuts as well as the bush. This is indicative of relative movement of the tab washers in assembly in service. Examination also revealed that the bending of the tab washers for effecting the locking of the nuts was oblique and also, the contact between the tab washer and the nut faces was inadequate. This was evident from the contact marks available on the tab washer surfaces. Evidences suggest that the nut surface was in partial contact with the tab washer and hence, the locking was not effective enough to offer adequate resistance for preventing unwinding of the nuts even under normal operating conditions. Once there was unwinding of the nuts, the bush on the cover side was as good as unsupported. This is similar to a situation wherein the outer ring of the bearing is loose. Hence, the looseness in the bush would result in progressive failure in the bearing as seen in the present case. The disturbances caused because of progressive failure in the cover side bearing had resulted in initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of the bearing on the casing side as well. Hence, the damages to this bearing are secondary in nature. Laboratory studies did not reveal any metallurgical deficiencies in the bearing elements or in the tab washers which could give rise to the present failure. Also, negligible discolouration even after complete destruction of the bearing indicates that there were no lubrication related issues which could be the cause of failure. Based on the above, it is concluded that the failure in the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of EAGB was progressive in nature. The failure was resulted due to unwinding and dislodgement of the nuts meant for securing the bush in position. Investigation showed that the unwinding of the nuts was possible because of deficiency in locking mechanism. Therefore, the primary cause for the bearing failure is attributed to either improper assembly of tab washers or inappropriate choice of the tab <b>washer</b> <b>type</b> for the present application...|$|R
