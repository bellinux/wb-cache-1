5|$|Wismer {{sought a}} place for his team to play, but was only able to secure the {{decrepit}} Polo Grounds, which had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a major tenant since {{the departure of the}} New York Giants baseball team in 1957. The stadium stood on the northern tip of Manhattan, across the Harlem River from Yankee Stadium, where the New York Giants NFL team played.|$|E
5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his life. Since the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have <b>been</b> <b>without</b> merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and asked that the stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have <b>been</b> <b>without</b> incident.|$|E

It provides subsidized rental, technical expertise, and marketing support for the companies using it, and turned a profit in its fourth fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a club {{since his}} departure, Žigić began {{training}} with Birmingham again in November 2014. After a successful appeal {{to be granted}} a work permit, for {{which he did not}} qualify automatically, he signed a contract on 4 December to expire {{at the end of the}} season. He made his second debut as a late substitute in the Championship match at home to Reading on 13 December, with Birmingham already 6–1 ahead. He played only infrequently– nine substitute appearances in the league and two FA Cup matches– and the club confirmed he would be released when his contract expired.|$|E
5|$|Hugh {{was elected}} to the see of Lincoln about 14 April 1209, after a papal command to the cathedral chapter to elect a new bishop, as Lincoln had again <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a bishop since 1206. During the summer of 1209, Hugh, along with his brother, was one of the councilors of King John urging the king to settle with Pope Innocent III before the pope excommunicated the king. However, {{negotiations}} with papal representatives got nowhere, and the king was excommunicated on 8 November 1209. Hugh and his brother Jocelin had continued to support King John until this, two years after many of their fellow bishops had deserted the king, but by late in the year, Hugh left the king's service and went into exile.|$|E

5|$|In {{keeping with}} an {{existing}} tradition for Australian gold medallists at the Summer Olympics, Bradbury, Camplin and Begg-Smith's victories were recognised by Australia Post, which released stamps depicting their triumphs, {{and gave the}} athletes royalties {{for the use of}} their image. Due to the relative lack of interest in winter sport in Australia, both Camplin and Bradbury had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> sponsorship before their Olympic triumphs, and were effectively broke.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Ileana was {{forecast}} {{to intensify}} further to reach Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson scale. After passing south of Socorro Island, the hurricane began a slow weakening trend due to cooler waters; as the winds decreased, the eye expanded and the thunderstorms waned. The ridge to its north weakened, causing the storm to slow and turn {{more to the}} west-northwest. Early on August26, Ileana weakened to tropical storm status. Later that day, convection decreased markedly, and early on August27 it deteriorated to tropical depression status. By late on August27, Ileana had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> deep convection for about 18hours, and so degenerated into a broad remnant low. It continued slowly westward, dissipating on August29 about 830mi (1340km) west-northwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Life Is People is {{the fourth}} studio album by English singer, pianist and {{songwriter}} Bill Fay, released by Dead Oceans in August 2012. Fay had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a record label after being dropped by Deram Records following the release of his second album, Time of the Last Persecution in 1971, and could not secure a release for his third album Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow. In order to support himself, Fay took various jobs outside of the music industry, while continuing to record music at home. In 1998, Fay's first two albums were reissued on compact disc by British record label See for Miles Records, prompting a revival of interest in his work, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow was finally released in 2005.|$|E

There are five registered Seminaries and five private Schools. The NCHD is running five feeder Schools. Teachers in these private schools work in a quack fashion and use very crude methods of teaching, including bastinado-type caning on the hands. 83% of schools <b>are</b> <b>without</b> electricity, 45% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> a boundary wall, 50% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> a toilet, and 35% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> drinking water.|$|R

5|$|The {{death of}} Chekhov's brother Nikolay from {{tuberculosis}} in 1889 influenced A Dreary Story, finished that September, {{about a man}} who confronts the end of a life that he realises has <b>been</b> <b>without</b> purpose. Mikhail Chekhov, who recorded his brother's depression and restlessness after Nikolay's death, was researching prisons at the time as part of his law studies, and Anton Chekhov, in a search for purpose in his own life, himself soon became obsessed with the issue of prison reform.|$|E
5|$|The {{description}} of feathered dinosaurs has not <b>been</b> <b>without</b> controversy; {{perhaps the most}} vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that some purported feather-like fossils {{are the result of}} the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' skin, and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with vaned feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but convergent with dinosaurs. However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, {{to the point that the}} scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Wells {{is named}} from three wells {{dedicated}} to Saint Andrew, {{one in the}} market place and two within {{the grounds of the}} Bishop's Palace and cathedral. A small Roman settlement surrounded them, which grew in importance and size under the Anglo-Saxons when King Ine of Wessex founded a minster church there in 704. The community became a trading centre based on cloth making and Wells is notable for its 17th century involvement in both the English Civil War and Monmouth Rebellion. In the 19th century, transport infrastructure improved with stations on three different railway lines. However, since 1964 the city has <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a railway link.|$|E

5|$|Eliza Farnham's 1856 {{account of}} the Donner Party was based largely on an {{interview}} with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves, Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted {{that she and her}} family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph Kingwhose account is sympathetic to the Breen familydo not consider it credible that the Breens, who had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> food for nine days, {{would have been able to}} survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this into her account independently of Margaret Breen.|$|E
5|$|In 1133, Roger of Salisbury {{secured the}} bishopric of Ely for Nigel. Ely had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a bishop since 1131; after the two-year vacancy, King Henry made the {{appointment}} {{because he was}} settling outstanding business before leaving England to return to Normandy. At this time Henry also appointed Geoffrey Rufus to Durham, and Æthelwold to the newly created Diocese of Carlisle. Nigel was consecrated on 1 October 1133 at Lambeth by William de Corbeil—who was by then Archbishop of Canterbury—possibly {{with the assistance of}} Roger of Salisbury. Nigel continued to hold the office of treasurer until 1136, when he was replaced by a relative, Adelelm, although the historian C. Warren Hollister placed his departure from the office in 1133 with his appointment to Ely. The Constitutio domus regis, or Establishment of the King's Household, may have been written by Nigel, or possibly for his use, and probably was composed around 1135.|$|E
5|$|In August 2006, Žigić {{signed for}} Spanish club Racing Santander; his goals and his {{partnership}} with Pedro Munitis helped them achieve a mid-table finish in La Liga.

He spent {{the second half of the}} 2008–09 La Liga season back with Racing on loan, for whom he scored 13 goals in just 19 matches. Žigić joined Birmingham City of the Premier League in 2010, and in his first season, he scored in their League Cup win. Even after relegation to the Championship, and despite increasing efforts to remove his large salary from the financially struggling club's wage bill, he remained with Birmingham for the full four years of his contract. Having <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a club for a few months, he rejoined Birmingham for the second half of the 2014–15 season.|$|E

5|$|The Philadelphia 76ers are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They are {{a member of}} the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Formerly known as the Syracuse Nationals, the 76ers joined the NBA when it was founded in 1949. The Nationals had a record of 51–13 in their first NBA season under coach Al Cervi and won the Eastern Division crown. The franchise were purchased by Philadelphian Irv Kosloff and Ike Richma in the spring of 1963; the NBA approved their franchise shift on May 22 and name change to the Philadelphia 76ers on August 6. This brought {{professional basketball}} back to the city, which had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a team since the Golden State Warriors left Philadelphia in 1962. After coaching the 76ers since , Doug Collins resigned as head coach on April 18, 2013 following the 2012–13 season. Brett Brown was hired to be the head coach of the 76ers on August 15, 2013 {{prior to the start of}} the 2013-14 season.|$|E
5|$|The early 2010s saw {{a series}} of unfortunate {{economic}} events for the city. In December 2010, Harrisburg's AMC, formerly Kerasotes' Cinema 4 theater, closed. This {{was the first time}} Harrisburg had <b>been</b> <b>without</b> a cinema since 1920. After release of the 2010 census, in February 2011, the city learned that its population had dropped to a low of 9,017 people, an 8.5 percent decrease. It was the lowest population since the pre-coal boom of 1900. Harrisburg also suffered from numerous scandals involving the school district and police department. In 2011, the Chief Deputy of the Saline County Sheriffs Department was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing a high school student who was working as an intern. The biggest hit was in late February 2012, an EF4 tornado hit Harrisburg during the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak. The southern part of the city was heavily damaged, with houses and businesses destroyed, many of which were completely leveled. Eight people were killed and 110 were injured by that tornado. In November 2012 a decision was made to close Willow Lake Mine, one of the last remaining mines in Saline County, putting 400 employees out of work.|$|E
5|$|This artistic {{period is}} one of {{discovery}} of the expressive possibilities of the human body; {{there is a greater}} freedom in the poses and gestures, and an increased attention to anatomical verisimilitude, as may be observed in the ponderated stances of figures W9 and W4, who partially anticipate the Doryphoros of Polykleitos. There is a noticeable ease to the physiques of the frieze compared with the stiffness of the metopes along with an eye for such subtleties as knuckle joints, veins, and the careful articulation of musculature. One important innovation of the style is the use of drapery as an expression of motion, or to suggest the body beneath; in archaic and early classical sculpture, clothing fell over the body {{as if it were a}} curtain obscuring the form below, in theses sculptures there is the billowing chlamydes of the horsemen and the multi-pleated peploi of the women that lends a surface movement and tension to their otherwise, static poses. Variation in the manes of the horses has been of particular interest to some scholars attempting to discern the artistic personalities of sculptors who laboured on the frieze or perhaps, indicating deliberate representation of different regional traditions, so far this Morellian analysis has <b>been</b> <b>without</b> conclusion.|$|E
