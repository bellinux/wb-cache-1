It is 15% smaller, paler and greyer than the Eurasian crag martin, and has smaller tail spots. It is smaller, paler, and has a more contrasting throat than the rock martin. In the far east of its range, the pale crag martin always has lighter underparts than the dusky crag martin. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and <b>brown-throated</b> <b>sand</b> <b>martin,</b> the pale crag martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. Separation of similar species in flight may be complicated by the difficulty of judging colours accurately in strong desert light, particularly with juveniles.

40|$|Observations of 15 species, {{made during}} {{a survey of}} {{wetlands}} on Iran's Arabian Gulf coast, in January-February 2000, are presented. These included two potential first records in Iran, Great Knot Calidris tenuirostris and <b>Brown-throated</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin</b> Riparia paludicola, an apparently important wintering area for Dead Sea Sparrow Passer moabiticus, records of several vagrants and scarce winter visitors, and a potentially significant range extension for the near endemic Iraq Babbler Turdoides altirostris. In addition, the area surveyed appears to be of considerable significance to wintering waterbirds, particularly waders. More than 53, 000 waterbirds of 82 species were counted during the survey, including globally threatened species such as Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus, Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris, Ferruginous Duck Aythya nyroca, and White-tailed Haliaeetus albicilla, Greater Spotted Aquila clanga and Imperial Eagles A. heliac...|$|E
40|$|The {{breeding}} and feeding {{ecology of the}} Swallow, Hirundo rustica, and the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin,</b> R. riparia, in Central Scotland is described, with particular reference to the constraints imposed by environmental conditions. The time and energy investment in reproduction was examined for all stages of the breeding season {{in a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. Brood sizes were manipulated to change the investment of each parent in the brood. The D 2018 technique was used to measure flight costs (0. 0848 kcal g-l h- 1 for the Swallow, 0. 1288 kcal g-l h- 1 for the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin)</b> and the rate at which each species collected food under a variety of conditions was examined (mean values were 0. 14 assimilable kcal min- 1 for the Swallow, 0. 05 assimilable kcal min- 1 for the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin).</b> These data, along with measurements of the nestlings' daily energy requirements, were used to investigate energy balance and the consequences for the timing and level of each breeding attempt. It is suggested that the Swallow lays later than the <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin</b> because (a) it takes larger insects and does not lay until these become abundant and (b) the female Swallow incubates alone whereas both <b>Sand</b> <b>Martin</b> sexes incubate, hence the Swallow defers laying until the risk of encountering bad weather during incubation is low.
