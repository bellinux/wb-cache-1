5|$|At a {{referendum}} held on January 14, 1895, 46 of 53 voters approved incorporation as a Borough. Citizens of Englewood Township challenged {{the creation of}} a borough, but accepted the new municipality as a township, given its more rural character. A bill supporting the creation of the Township of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 18, 1895, and the New Jersey Senate on the next day. Governor of New Jersey George Werts signed the <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law, and Teaneck was an independent municipality.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 {{legislative}} session, Rice sponsored 16 {{pieces of}} legislation, including 11 {{as the primary}} sponsor in the House of Representatives. Among {{the most prominent of}} his bills was a measure to set up a cold case unit within the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to investigate Colorado's 1200 unsolved homicides. After passage, Gov. Ritter signed the <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law. Rice also pursued legislation to cut taxes for businesses by raising the personal property tax exemption. After having passed the state house unanimously, the measure died in a Senate committee.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Reagan {{expanded}} {{the campaign to}} an international level by inviting the First Ladies of various nations to the White House for a conference on drug abuse. On October 27, 1986, President Reagan signed a drug enforcement <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law, which granted $1.7 billion in funding to fight the perceived crisis and ensured a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses.

5|$|On April 11, 2012, the Connecticut House of Representatives {{voted to}} repeal capital {{punishment}} for future cases (leaving past death sentences in place). The Connecticut Senate had already {{voted for the}} bill, and on April 25 Governor Dan Malloy signed the <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law. In August 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court declared all capital punishment inconsistent with the state constitution, effectively commuting the killers' sentences to life imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|On May 25, 2016, the Ohio General Assembly {{passed a}} bill to rename the airport from Port Columbus International Airport to its current name, in honor of {{astronaut}} and four-term U.S. senator John Glenn.

On March 21, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House {{by a vote of}} 219 to 212. Obama signed the <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law on March 23, 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{constitutional}} monarchy with a parliamentary democracy, although its constitution is not codified. Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand {{and the head}} of state. The Queen is represented by the Governor-General, whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Governor-General can exercise the Crown's prerogative powers, such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers, ambassadors and other key public officials, and in rare situations, the reserve powers (e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law). The powers of the Queen and the Governor-General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of ministers.|$|E

5|$|On 19 January 1999, the Leader of the House of Commons, Margaret Beckett, {{introduced}} the House of Lords <b>Bill</b> <b>into</b> the House of Commons. The House of Commons passed the bill {{by a vote}} of 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it was presented to the House of Lords, where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant amendment made to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the House of Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E
5|$|Talbot, a Republican, {{served in}} the Massachusetts {{legislature}} beginning in 1851, {{and sat in the}} governor's council from 1864 to 1869. In 1872, he was elected Lieutenant Governor, serving two terms under William B. Washburn. On the selection of Washburn to the United States Senate by the state legislature in early 1874, he became acting governor. One item of unfinished business Washburn left to Talbot was a bill mandating a ten-hour workday. This matter had been the subject of labor agitation in the state, and Washburn had been opposed to the bill. Talbot, despite his mill ownership, was an advocate, and signed the <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law. He also refused to authorize construction of a prison in Concord, and signed legislation allowing women to vote for members of local school committees.|$|E
50|$|An omnibus {{spending}} {{bill is a}} type of bill in the United States that packages many of the smaller regular appropriations <b>bills</b> <b>into</b> one larger single bill that could be passed with only one vote in each house. There are twelve different regular appropriations bills that need to be passed each year to fund the federal government and avoid a government shutdown; an omnibus {{spending bill}} combines one or more of those <b>bills</b> <b>into</b> a single <b>bill.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{procedure}} of Royal Assent was abolished by the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936, which Act was itself {{the last to}} receive the Royal Assent. The new Act amended the Constitution so that the Ceann Comhairle (speaker of Dáil Éireann) would sign <b>bills</b> <b>into</b> once passed by the House. Under the new 1937 Constitution of Ireland (Bunreacht na hÉireann), which came into force almost exactly one year later, the role of signing <b>bills</b> <b>into</b> law {{was given to the}} President of Ireland.|$|R
5|$|The May-Johnson bill soon {{ran into}} difficulties. Although the Interim Committee was {{discharged}} in November, it met {{one more time}} in December to discuss amendments to the May-Johnson bill. On December 20, 1945, Senator Brien McMahon introduced an alternative Senate bill on atomic energy, which quickly {{became known as the}} McMahon bill. This was initially a very liberal bill towards the control of scientific research, and was broadly supported by scientists. McMahon framed the controversy as a question of military versus civilian control of atomic energy, although the May-Johnson bill also provided for civilian control of atomic energy. In 1946, several major revisions were made to the McMahon bill in order to appease the more conservative elements in the Senate. The resulting bill passed both the Senate and the House without major modifications. On August 1, 1946, Truman signed the McMahon <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> law as the Atomic Energy Act of 1946.|$|E
5|$|Treasurer of the United States Francis E. Spinner {{has been}} {{credited}} with finding {{the solution to the}} shortage of coinage: he created postage currency (which led into the use of Fractional currency). Postage (or postal) currency was the first of five issues of US Post Office fractional paper money printed in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, and 50-cent denominations and issued from 21 August 1862 through 27 May 1863. Spinner proposed using postage stamps, affixed to Treasury paper, with his signature on the bottom (see illustration below). Based on this initiative, Congress supported a temporary solution involving fractional currency and on 17 July 1862 President Lincoln signed the Postage Currency <b>Bill</b> <b>into</b> law. The intent, however, was not that stamps should be a circulating currency.|$|E
5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of copyright was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life of the author if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a <b>bill</b> <b>into</b> Parliament to expand the scope of copyright. A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist {{for the life of the}} author, with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E

Under the new 1937 Constitution of Ireland, which came into force almost exactly one year later, the role of signing <b>bills</b> <b>into</b> law was given to the President of Ireland. This in particular {{is one of the reasons}} why there is some confusion in who was the Irish head of state from 1936 to 1949.|$|R
