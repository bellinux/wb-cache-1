25|$|Natural {{gas flowing}} in the {{distribution}} lines and at the natural gas well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate the natural gas transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize the natural gas in the transmission line as the gas travels. The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a <b>British</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>unit</b> (BTU) value between 950 and 1050BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.|$|E
