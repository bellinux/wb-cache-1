40|$|Object ive: To {{investigate}} the relationshi ps between depressive mood, <b>bonding</b> <b>failure,</b> and abusive parenting. Method: We distributed questionnaires to 1198 mothers attending a three-month postnatal health check-up {{in rural areas}} in Japan. The questionnaires assessed these three variables along with demographics. We evaluated the causal relationships by comparing different structural equation models to the data. Results: Although all the models fit the data well, the best Akaike Information Criterion was obtained from a model where both depressive mood and <b>bonding</b> <b>failure</b> predict abusive parenting, but depressive mood and <b>bonding</b> <b>failure</b> do not predict each other directly. The determinant coefficient of child abuse in the final model was 0. 13. Discussion: We found depressive mood and <b>bonding</b> <b>failure</b> during postpartum period impacted negatively on mother’s parenting behaviour. Because only 13 % of the variance of abusive parenting was explainable by this model, further study should be needed to identify other risk factors of child abuse. Similarly, midwives and public health nurse in community should pay attention to not only depression but also <b>bonding</b> <b>failure</b> to prevent child abuse. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The bonding of {{orthodontic}} brackets and their failure rates by both direct and in-direct procedures are well-documented in orthodontic literature. Over the years different adhesive materials and various indirect bonding transfer procedures have been compared and evaluated for <b>bond</b> <b>failure</b> rates. The aim {{of our study}} is to highlight {{the use of a}} simple, inexpensive and ease of manipulation of a single thermo-plastic transfer tray and the use the of a single light cure adhesive to evaluate the <b>bond</b> <b>failure</b> rates in clinical situations. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 patients were randomly divided into two groups (Group A and Group B). A split-mouth study design was used, for, both the groups so that they were distributed equally with-out bias. After initial prophylaxis, both the procedures were done as per manufactures instructions. All patients were initially motivated and reviewed for bond failures rates for 6 months. Results: <b>Bond</b> <b>failure</b> rates were assessed for over-all direct and indirect procedures, anterior and posterior arches, and for individual tooth. Z-test was used for statistically analyzing, the normal distribution of the sample in a spilt mouth study. The results of the two groups were compared and P value was calculated using Z-proportion test to assess the significance of the <b>bond</b> <b>failure.</b> Conclusion: Over-all <b>bond</b> <b>failure</b> was more for direct bonding. Anterior bracket failure was more in-direct bonding than indirect procedure, which showed more posterior bracket failures. In individual tooth <b>bond</b> <b>failure,</b> mandibular incisor, and premolar brackets showed more failure, followed by maxillary premolars and canines...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDiscrete network {{models and}} lattice models using trusses or beams {{can be used}} to {{mechanically}} model fibrous materials, since the discrete elements represent the individual fibers or yarns at the mesoscale of these materials. Consequently, local mesoscale phenomena, such as individual fiber failure and interfiber <b>bond</b> <b>failure,</b> can be incorporated. Only a few discrete network models in which <b>bond</b> <b>failure</b> is incorporated include frictional fiber sliding that occurs after <b>bond</b> <b>failure</b> has taken place, although this occurs in the mechanical behaviour of several fibrous materials. In this paper, a spring network model for interfiber <b>bond</b> <b>failure</b> and subsequent frictional fiber sliding is developed, which is formulated in a thermodynamical setting. The thermodynamical basis ensures that performed mechanical work is either stored in the network or dissipated due to <b>bond</b> <b>failure</b> and subsequent sliding. A numerical implementation of the framework is proposed in which the kinematic and internal variables are simultaneously solved, because the internal variables are directly coupled in the framework. Variations in network connectivity, bond strength, fiber length and anisotropy are implemented in the framework. The results show amongst others that the macroscopic yield point scales with the bond strength and that the macroscopic stiffness and the macroscopic yield point scale with the fiber length. The presented results also show that the macroscopic yield point becomes significantly less pronounced for an increase of the fiber length...|$|E
