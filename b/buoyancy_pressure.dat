This style of strain has been recognized in three settings: (1) deep crustal locations at greenschist and higher-grade metamorphism with fluid generation; (2) active plate boundaries where tectonic stresses can result in seismicity; and (3) hydrocarbon column <b>buoyancy</b> <b>pressure</b> reactivation of critically stressed fault-bound traps. This paper examines category 3 {{in the context of}} mechanical fault reactivation and capillary processes. For water-wetting fault rock, mechanical reactivation may be reached prior to the capillary seal capacity. However, the non-wetting fluid cannot access the fault rock pore space until the hydrocarbon column height reaches the capillary threshold pressure. At the threshold pressure, the non-wetting fluid enters the fault rock imparting a <b>buoyancy</b> <b>pressure</b> in excess of the mechanical reactivation threshold causing rupture. This suggests that in certain circumstances the mechanical fault reactivation by <b>buoyancy</b> <b>pressure</b> is more accurately predicted by the capillary threshold pressure than mechanical reactivation pressure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Mudrocks are {{effective}} top seals for hydrocarbon accumulations because they possess very low permeabilities, high capillary entry pressures, {{and are often}} laterally con-tinuous basin-wide. For leakage through the seal to take place, an additional mechanism must provide nhanced permeability in mudrocks. Tectonically induced, dilatant faulting and fracturing in brittle rocks is such a mechanism. The effectiveness of mudrocks as seals may be compromised {{by a number of}} other factors, such as tectonic fault displacements in excess of the seal thickness; tensile fracturing under extreme fluid pressure conditions; and leakage via a network of juxtaposed thin leaky beds across sub-seismic faults within the seal. Before hydrocarbon trap integrity analysis, seismic interpretations should honour the fundamental geometry of the trap as closely as possible because top seals can be reliably appraised only when basic geometries are accurately determined. Fluid pressure is a proven risk in many exploration provinces, in terms of mudrock top-seal leakage via opening mode fractures. This natural hydrofracturing can take place if <b>buoyancy</b> <b>pressures,</b> combined with fluid overpressures, exceed the minimum in situ horizontal stress, plus the tensile strength of the seal, an occurrence that leads to mechanical failure of the seal rock.

Hot smoke {{is expected to}} be exhausted out of the vent. However, directions of air flowing across the vent might be oscillating under some conditions. The ratio B of buoyancy to inertial force defined by the Grashof number over the square of the Reynolds number is the key parameter in determining airflow oscillations. In this paper, effects of <b>buoyancy,</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the combined effect of buoyancy and pressure denoted by B will be studied by simple flow equations.

Under the action of the expansive force of gaseous molecules, natural gas migrates in a piston-type and accumulates in the lower part of a structure, with gas topped by water (Pang et al. 2003). Due to the capillary pressure difference between sandstone and mudstone, natural gas migrates into lens-type sandstones with larger pores, and accumulates {{at the top of the}} lens under the action of buoyancy to form a reservoir (Chen et al. 2004).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Calibration is a {{necessary}} step in the workflow for prediction of fault seal {{because there is no}} direct way to detect the hydraulic behaviour of a fault at the scale of a hydrocarbon trap. Over the last 20 years two general approaches have been developed: (i) Measurement of hydraulic properties of fault-zone samples (lab calibration), then mapping these results onto the appropriate parts of trap-bounding faults. (ii) Design of simple algorithms which attempt to capture a salient feature of the fault zone (e. g. CSP, SSF, SGR), then looking at known trap-bounding faults to find a relationship between the algorithm and the presence or capacity of a seal (sub-surface calibration). Seal capacity is typically described by Hg–air threshold pressure in the lab or static pressure differ-ences in the subsurface (e. g. hydrocarbon <b>buoyancy</b> <b>pressure).</b> In addition to likely interpretation and geometry errors in approaches (i) and (ii), further uncertainty is introduced when converting the calibrated seal strength to potential hydrocarbon column height, because of the variability of subsurface hydrocarbon fluids (interfacial tension). Despite these potential problems, the different methodologies typically agree reasonably well in their predictions for fault-seal capacity. However, this agreement may be largely coincidental and {{is likely to be a}} response to the hetero...|$|E

From the analysis of the results we conclude how much knowledge about these topics pupils gain in the primary school. In the main part of the master thesis we analyse in detail two problems, related to <b>buoyancy</b> and <b>pressure</b> that were included in the National assessment of knowledge of physics in the year 2012. We design classes into which we distribute answers of a few hundred pupils. From the frequencies of typical incorrect answers we try to understand why these pupils did not solve the problem correctly. In the problem related to the understanding of buoyancy, most of the pupils started the wrong way from the very beginning. Instead of calculating the force of buoyancy, pupils calculated some number using a random combination of data provided and simple arithmetic operations. At the end they usually added to the numerical result the correct unite for force – the newton. We have also found out, that the majority of pupils do not write correctly the condition for the equilibrium of forces. In the problem related to the understanding of pressure, most of the pupils started correctly, but only a few obtained the correct final result. In most of the cases the reason for that was that pupils used the wrong surface in the calculation. An important finding is also that a lot of pupils equate pressure and force, which we deduce from the incorrect use of units. This indicates a lack of understanding of the concept of pressure...|$|R

There is an extensive record of publication on seals analysis and a similar history on petroleum hydrodynamics yet little work addresses the links between the two. Understanding and quantifying the effects of hydrodynamic flow {{has important implications for}} calibrating commonly used seal capacity estimation techniques. These are often based on measurements such as shale gouge, clay smear or mercury porosimitry where membrane sealing is thought to occur. For standard membrane seal analysis, seal capacity is estimated by quantifying capillary pressure-related measurements and calibrating them with a large observational database of hydrocarbon column heights and measured buoyancy pressures. The seal capacity estimation process has historically been adjusted to account for a number of different generic trapping geometries. We define the characteristics of these geometries from a hydrodynamics viewpoint in order to fine-tune the seal capacity calibration process. From theoretical analyses of several simplified trapping geometries, it can be concluded that generally, the high pressure side of the seal should be used as the water pressure gradient with which to calculate <b>buoyancy</b> <b>pressure.</b> Secondly, trap geometries where hydrocarbon is reservoired on both sides of a fault are not useful for estimating across fault seal capacity...|$|E

The HACs {{are assumed to be}} isothermal heat source and sinks with temperatures T and T (T > T). The problem is numerically investigated using the Eulerian-Lagrangian method. Two-dimensional Navier-Stokes and energy equations are solved using finite volume discretization method.

Furthermore, effects of various design parameters on the heat transfer rate and deposition of particles such as Rayleigh number (10 ≤Ra≤ 10) as well as orientation and number of the HACs are investigated. Our simulations indicate that thermophoretic force can significantly affect the distribution of particles of d= 1 μm diameter. It is also found that at low Rayleigh numbers the particle distribution is strongly non-uniform. Moreover, it was observed that by increasing number of the HACs and changing orientation of the HACs from vertical to horizontal, deposition rate of the solid particles increases significantly...|$|E
40|$|The use of Shale-Gouge-Ratio (SGR) {{methods to}} predict across-fault seal {{capacity}} {{relies on a}} calibration of the methodology against field examples. Existing calibrations have plotted across-fault pressure difference or <b>buoyancy</b> <b>pressure</b> against in situ SGR to define a fault-seal failure envelope. Recent work on hydrodynamics and seal capacity has provided insight on fine-tuning the calibration methodologies that should in turn lead to improved fault seal capacity predictions.

For a fault that defines a hydraulic head discontinuity at the reservoir scale, there exists a hydraulic head gradient or distribution within the fault-zone that is determined by the detailed permeability distribution within the fault zone. As a result, the capillary threshold pressure varies across the fault. When compared with the hydraulic head, the fault zone seal capacity can be estimated at various locations within the fault zone. Theoretical examination of membrane seal capacity for various permeability distributions can be used to understand parameters that control the location of the critical leak point for a membrane fault seal. This can also be extended to examine possible up-fault leakage. A range of permeability distributions are examined for a theoretical fault zone.
