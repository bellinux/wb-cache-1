60|$|Up {{from the}} gray rocks, rising sheer and bold and <b>bare,</b> <b>stood</b> {{the walls and}} towers of Castle Drachenhausen. A great gate-way, with a heavy iron-pointed {{portcullis}} hanging suspended in the dim arch above, yawned blackly upon the bascule or falling drawbridge that spanned a chasm between the blank stone walls and the roadway that winding down the steep rocky slope to the little valley just beneath. There {{in the lap of}} the hills around stood the wretched straw-thatched huts of the peasants belonging to the castle--miserable serfs who, half timid, half fierce, tilled their poor patches of ground, wrenching from the hard soil barely enough to keep body and soul together. Among those vile hovels played the little children like foxes about their dens, their wild, fierce eyes peering out from under a mat of tangled yellow hair.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of {{a cement}} plant at Faremont, during building of Los Angeles Aqueduct, [s. d. ].

60|$|Hitherto the lads, {{absorbed in}} their strife, had paid but little heed {{to the party}} of onlookers; but at the word they at once arrested their arms, and, <b>baring</b> their heads, <b>stood</b> still in confusion.|$|R

60|$|A single figure, at {{that moment}} on a {{slightly}} elevated ridge of the <b>bare</b> moor, <b>stood</b> out against the sky. He was walking swiftly toward her, and yet without any appearance of hurry; and from {{the direction in which}} he was coming, it was evident that he had just left Falcon's Nest. This fact and his being unknown to her sufficiently established his identity. It was her father's tenant, Mr. Bernard Brown.|$|R
6000|$|Colan <b>stood</b> <b>bare</b> and weaponless, [...] Earl Harold, as in pain, [...] Strove for a smile, put hand to head, [...] Stumbled and {{suddenly}} fell dead; [...] And the small white daisies all waxed red [...] With blood {{out of his}} brain.|$|R
6000|$|... ----"our trees so hack'd {{above the}} ground, [...] That where their lofty tops the {{neighbouring}} countries [...] crown'd, [...] Their trunks (like aged folks) now <b>bare</b> and naked <b>stand,</b> [...] As for revenge to Heaven each held a wither'd hand." [...] [1] ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{no sound}} save the moaning of {{the wind in the}} <b>bare</b> trees which <b>stood</b> {{by the side of the}} house and the patter of the fast-falling rain. I stepped into the {{carriage}} and the Count came to the window to me.|$|R
60|$|A startled exclamation {{directly}} behind him {{brought him to}} his feet in a flash, every muscle tense. He whirled his stick above his head as he turned, ready to strike, then let it fall with a clatter. For there, a <b>bare</b> yard away, <b>stood</b> Betty.|$|R

6000|$|Jack ran to {{the rise}} of ground above the camp, and looked over the cedars. [...] "Oh!" [...] he cried, and beckoned for Mescal. She ran to him, and Piute, tying Black Bolly, hurried after. [...] "Look! look!" [...] cried Jack. He pointed to a ridge rising {{to the left of the}} yellow crags. On the <b>bare</b> summit <b>stood</b> a splendid {{stallion}} clearly silhouetted against the ruddy morning sky. He was an iron-gray, wild and proud, with long silver-white mane waving in the wind.|$|R

60|$|She {{walked a}} mile and clicked the latch of a gate. A <b>bare,</b> brown cottage <b>stood</b> twenty yards back; {{an old man with}} a pearl-white, Calvinistic face and clothes dyed blacker than a raven in a coal-mine was washing his hands in a tin basin on the front porch.|$|R

60|$|Hawks {{are trapped}} by {{selecting}} a <b>bare</b> tree, that <b>stands</b> {{in an open}} space: its top is sawn off level, and a trap is put upon it: the bait is laid somewhere near, on the ground: the bird is sure to visit the pole, either before or after he has fed.|$|R

60|$|She {{reached a}} long arm and swept aside {{the curtain of}} the alcove. In there was a shrine, lit to a glow of soft colour by the light pouring through a stained-glass window. Within a deep niche in the <b>bare</b> stone wall <b>stood</b> {{an image of the}} Virgin Mary, the colour of pure gold.|$|R
60|$|The {{homestead}} {{was just}} {{on the safe side}} of civilization, outside the gate. The house <b>stood</b> <b>bare</b> from the road, approached by a straight garden path, along which at spring the daffodils were thick in green and yellow. At the sides of the house were bushes of lilac and guelder-rose and privet, entirely hiding the farm buildings behind.|$|R

Rows of trees and plants spot the fields into the foggy distance...|$|R
60|$|It {{was but a}} hurried parting in {{a common}} street, yet it was a sacred remembrance to these two common people. Utilitarian economists, skeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact, genteel and used-up infidels, gabblers of many little dog's-eared creeds, the poor you will have always with you. Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the utmost graces of the fancies and affections, to adorn their lives so much in need of ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, when romance is utterly driven out of their souls, and they and a <b>bare</b> {{existence}} <b>stand</b> face to face, Reality will take a wolfish turn, and make an end of you.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{panoramic}} view of San Francisco earthquake damage, from Nob Hill, 1906. Burnt, <b>bare</b> tree trunks <b>stand</b> on a pile of rubble in the foreground on the right.

40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of J. P. Bernal's L-shaped adobe on the F. E. "Lucky" Baldwin Ranch in Pleasanton, 1937.

The section to the right is shorter and has two metal chimneys. The wooden frame for {{what appears to be a}} chickenwire fence surrounds the perimeter, and a squat, <b>bare</b> tree <b>stands</b> in the angle made by the two sections of the adobe.

50|$|When Yogi {{finds out}} about the proposal, he informs his parents {{that he is in}} love with Indu's {{daughter}} Kajal.

6000|$|... "At last I {{reached the}} object of my quest, a dirty, fly-blown little shop in a by-way near Drury Lane, with a window full of tinsel robes, sham jewels, wigs, slippers, dominoes and {{theatrical}} photographs. The shop was old-fashioned and low and dark, and the house rose above it for four storeys, dark and dismal. I peered through the window and, seeing no one within, entered. The opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing. I left it open, and walked round a <b>bare</b> costume <b>stand,</b> into a corner behind a cheval glass. For {{a minute or so}} no one came. Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room, and a man appeared down the shop.|$|R
60|$|It was an {{impressive}} spectacle that they gazed upon. The conflagration {{was still not}} far from them, for, as a rule, a forest fire does not move very rapidly. Across the valley hung a dusky pall of smoke, and beneath it all trunks stripped to <b>bare</b> spires <b>stood</b> out black against a sea of flame. The latter, however, was of no very great extent from wing to wing, and, now that the wind had almost dropped, it made very little progress, though it crept on down the valley in a confined belt, rising and falling in pulsations with the sharp crackle of licked-up undergrowth breaking through the deep-toned roar. Saunders, lying propped up on one elbow, watched it meditatively.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you believe}} her, Captain Lingard," [...] shouted Willems from the doorway, where he {{appeared}} with swollen eyelids and <b>bared</b> breast. He <b>stood</b> for a while, his hands grasping the lintels {{on each side}} of the door, and writhed about, glaring wildly, as if he had been crucified there. Then he made a sudden rush head foremost down the plankway that responded with hollow, short noises to every footstep.|$|R
