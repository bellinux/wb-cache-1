It fruits singly or {{in small}} groups on fallen and often partially buried cones of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), European <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra) and sometimes spruce (Picea) in coniferous and mixed forests. It is found in Europe and Asia, {{where it has been}} recorded in Japan and Jordan. In Europe, the fungus usually fruits from March to June. Its occurrence is occasional.|$|E
5|$|Trappers and explorers {{arrived in}} {{southern}} Idaho {{in the early}} 19thcentury. They established immigrant trails in the region by 1849, including the Oregon and California trails. The forest was used by early settlers primarily for extractive industries. Fur trappers of the Hudson's Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin {{in the northern part}} of the forest in the 1820s, but mostly avoided it due to the scarcity of beaver. For early settlers, the welfare of their community was dependent upon timber supply, regulation of stream flow for irrigation, and use of the land for cattle range. Mining began in the 1860s, peaked in the 1880s, and fluctuated over the following century with the extraction of gold, silver, lead, and zinc. The <b>Black</b> <b>Pine</b> Division of the forest was explored in the late 1800s, and the Tallman Mine began producing gold in the 1920s with production peaking from 1949 to 1954. The <b>Black</b> <b>Pine</b> Mine again produced gold from 1992 through November 1997, when the mine's parent company, Pegasus Gold, declared bankruptcy. The location of the mine has since been reclaimed.|$|E

5|$|Suillus luteus is {{a pioneer}} species that {{typically}} establishes {{itself in the}} early stages of forest succession. The fungus forms mycorrhizal associations with various species of pine, including Scots pine (P.sylvestris), <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (P.nigra), and Macedonian pine (P.peuce) in Europe, and red pine (P.resinosa) and white pine (P.strobus) in North America. An in vitro experiment demonstrated that the species could form an ectomycorrhizal association with Aleppo pine (P.halepensis), a key species used in reforestation in the Mediterranean. A study of the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with a lodgepole pine (P.contorta) invasion front near Coyhaique, Chile, showed that many invasive trees were supported by S.luteus as the sole mycorrhizal partner.|$|E

This formation is divided into three nappes from lowest to highest, the Mahmutlar, the Sugözü, and the Yumrudağ. The similar lithology extends beneath the city in a tectonic window.

Forests of European <b>black</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus nigra) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica) cover the park's lower and middle altitudes , with several of these trees being more than 700 years old. At higher altitudes , Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) woodland is dominant, while at the greatest heights , only certain types of bushes are found in the treeless alpine meadows. Additionally, the dry places and the lower parts of the valley are characterized by the domination of Buxus sempervirens, while some individuals of Abies borisii-regis are scattered among the Pinus nigra and Fagus sylvatica forests.|$|E

40|$|Tree-ring width {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to assess the effects of air pollution on tree growth aroundindustrial complexes. Our study was conducted to elucidate the effect of air pollutants on annual ring growthin <b>black</b> <b>pines</b> (Pinus thunbergii) of age 41 ～ 48 years around Ulsan Metropolitan City. The growth data wereanalyzed by multiple regression and the results are as follows: 1. The annual ring increment of black pinesincreased with tree age until age 40 years and then decreased gradually after age 40 years. 2. The incrementof annual ring width of <b>black</b> <b>pines</b> was affected more by precipitation and evapotranspiration than air temperature. An annual ring decline appeared in the years 1968 ～ 1983, when annual ring indices below zero wereobserved. Decreased annual ring growth during this period may have been due to air pollution. 3. The heavymetal with the strongest effect on annual ring growth of <b>black</b> <b>pines</b> in the experimental stand was lead (Pb). The concentration of lead in the stand was estimated as over 6 ppm. 4. The technique of tree-ring width analysismay be useful for estimation of the extent of pollution in forest areas near industrial complexes...|$|R

25|$|In this technique, new growing {{material}} (typically a bud, branch, or root) {{is introduced}} to a prepared area under the bark of the tree. There are two major purposes for grafting in bonsai. First, a number of favorite species do not thrive as bonsai on their natural root stock and their trunks are often grafted onto hardier root stock. Examples include Japanese red maple and Japanese <b>black</b> <b>pine.</b> Second, grafting allows the bonsai artist to add branches (and sometimes roots) where they are needed to improve or complete a bonsai design. There are many applicable grafting techniques, none unique to bonsai, including branch grafting, bud grafting, thread grafting, and others.|$|E

It affects the Scots, mountain, eastern white, radiata, lodgepole and <b>black</b> <b>pines.</b> Scots pines are not generally killed by a single defoliation, but weakened trees may suffer increased attack by bark beetles, buprestid beetles, and pine weevils, which can kill trees, as can repeated defoliation.|$|R
