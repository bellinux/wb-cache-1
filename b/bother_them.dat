25|$|In 2006 {{both girls}} decided to {{concentrate}} on beach volleyball full-time, working on improving their skills {{more and more and}} also getting more experience. The first tournament of the season was an Eredivisie event in Kijkduin where they finished 2nd. On international level they started participating in higher quality tournaments like the European Championship Tour. In Hamburg they reached the 13th position. In the same weekend they travalled to Assen in their home country and in addition they won the TopTeams Cup Assen. In another 6 Eredivisie tournaments they reached one 1st place, four 2nd positions and a 3rd position, before heading to Marseille to play in a FIVB World Tour event. They reached the 41st position on the highest possible level. At the European Championship Tour event in Valencia they finished in 21st position. August 2006 {{turned out to be a}} good month for Van Iersel/Wesselink. First they travelled to South Korea to participate in an exhibition tournament where they finished 5th. A 4th position was reached a few days later in Austria during the European Championships under 23, while they had the ages of 18 and 19. The following weekend they took part in the Dutch national Championships in Scheveningen finishing 4th again, behind the three top Dutch teams for many years. With these results in mind they travelled to Poland to play the World Championships under 21 in Mysłowice. Again they faced opponents quite older than they were themselves, but this didn't seem to <b>bother</b> <b>them</b> much and they won the bronze medal. In the semi finals they lost from the eventual champions, while they had beaten the same team in the group stage earlier in the tournament. In addition they stayed in Poland to play the Warsaw FIVB World Tour event, finishing 33rd.|$|E

500|$|On September 11, 1970, Hendrix {{gave his}} final {{interview}} in his suite at the Cumberland Hotel in London, where he talked with Keith Altham, a journalist for Record Mirror. During the interview, Hendrix confirmed reports that Billy Cox, the bass player in his band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, was leaving. Cox, who had been suffering from severe exhaustion and was exhibiting symptoms of paranoia, mutually agreed with Hendrix that they should suspend their plans to collaborate musically. When Altham asked Hendrix: [...] "Do you feel any kind of compulsion to prove yourself as King Guitar", Hendrix replied: [...] "No, I don't even let that bother me. Because they {{say a lot of}} things about people that, if they let it <b>bother</b> <b>them,</b> they wouldn't even be around today... King Guitar now? Wow, that's a bit heavy."
