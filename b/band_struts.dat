5000|$|Jet Black Orchid {{was formed}} in early 2012. The three {{brothers}} had been playing music together previously under several different band names around Louisville, Kentucky and Indiana. They spent {{the early months of}} 2014 writing and recording their debut LP (self titled) in Nashville, Tennessee. In October 2014, they released their first single [...] "Curious Creature" [...] with accompanying music video off their debut LP (self titled). In spring 2015 the band embarked on a three-month North American West Coast tour followed by a homecoming show with English rock <b>band</b> The <b>Struts</b> at the Mercury Ballroom.|$|R
50|$|Another unusual {{choice as}} opening act was Skrillex, who {{performed}} in Houston, Texas on August 5. British <b>band</b> The <b>Struts</b> was handpicked {{to open the}} show in San Francisco on August 9. Similarly to Guns N' Roses, the band lists Queen and The Rolling Stones as influences on their music. At McKagan's homecoming show in Seattle on August 12, his daughter Grace's band The Pink Slips opened the event alongside Alice in Chains. Zakk Wylde has ties to Guns N' Roses back to 1995 {{when he was in}} the studio with the band. He was chosen as opener on the show of August 15. Wylde had also previously played as a guest with Guns N' Roses on stage back in 2011, where he also performed as an opening act with his band Black Label Society.|$|R
50|$|Wooden domes have a hole {{drilled in}} {{the width of}} a strut. A {{stainless}} steel <b>band</b> locks the <b>strut's</b> hole to a steel pipe. With this method, the struts may be cut to the exact length needed. Triangles of exterior plywood are then nailed to the struts. The dome is wrapped from the bottom to the top with several stapled layers of tar paper, in order to shed water, and finished with shingles. This type of dome is often called a hub-and-strut dome because of the use of steel hubs to tie the struts together.|$|R
40|$|Compression-compression {{fatigue testing}} of metallic-glass foam is performed. A stress-life curve is constructed, which reveals an {{endurance}} limit at a fatigue ratio of about 0. 1. The origin of fatigue resistance of this foam is identified {{to be the}} tendency of intracellular struts to undergo elastic and reversible buckling, while the fatigue process is understood to advance by anelastic strut buckling leading to localized plasticity (shear <b>banding)</b> and ultimate <b>strut</b> fracture. Curves of peak and valley strain versus number of cycles coupled with plots of hysteresis loops and estimates of energy dissipation at various loading cycles confirm the four stages of foam-fatigue...|$|R
