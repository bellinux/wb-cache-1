5000|$|The band's self-titled {{debut album}} {{received}} excellent reviews from both electronic and rock press alike and {{was credited with}} sounding simultaneously like [...] "they dropped {{straight out of the}} decade itself." [...] and for its excellent modern production [...] "first of all, the production on this album is absolutely pristine - every fuzzy, reverb-soaked layer of analogue synthesizer sounds perfectly placed in the mix, <b>balanced</b> <b>by</b> melodramatic <b>drum</b> patterns that always stay true to their influence rather than taking a more standard EDM trajectory." [...] mixed by producer Carl Bown [...] "It could easily earn a place in synthwave history {{as one of the first}} crossover albums". In a commentary about a band, a critic wrote, [...] "There's no doubt the level of effort they put into everything resonates deeply in the 80s retro community and beyond".|$|R
