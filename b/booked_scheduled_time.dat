40|$|This article {{addresses}} the stochastic time-dependent vehicle routing problem. Two mathematical models named robust optimal <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> model and minimum expected <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> model are proposed for stochastic time-dependent vehicle routing problem, which can guarantee delivery within the time windows of customers. The robust optimal <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> model only requires the variation range of link travel time, {{which can be}} conveniently derived from historical traffic data. In addition, the robust optimal <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> model based on robust optimization method can be converted into a time-dependent vehicle routing problem. Moreover, an ant colony optimization algorithm is designed to solve stochastic time-dependent vehicle routing problem. As the improvements in initial solution and transition probability, ant colony optimization algorithm has a good performance in convergence. Through computational instances and Monte Carlo simulation tests, robust optimal <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> model is proved {{to be better than}} minimum expected <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> model in computational efficiency and coping with the travel time fluctuations. Therefore, robust optimal <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> model is applicable in real road network...|$|R

50|$|A timing point, {{time point}} or timepoint {{is a public}} transit stop that a vehicle tries to reach at a <b>scheduled</b> <b>time.</b> A vehicle is not {{supposed}} to pass a timepoint until the <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> has arrived. These stops are contrasted with all other stops on a scheduled route, for which the transit agency does not explicitly <b>schedule</b> an arrival/departure <b>time.</b> These other stops occur between timepoint stops, so their <b>scheduled</b> <b>times</b> are implicitly between those of the timepoints though not explicitly defined. At minimum, a timepoint allows regular passengers to estimate when a bus would get to a stop before or after a timepoint.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{advances}} in storage and communication technologies have spurred {{a strong interest}} in Video-on-Demand (VOD) services. Providing the customers of VOD servers with time of service guarantees offers two major advantages. First, it makes VOD services more attractive by improving customerperceived quality of service (QoS). Second, it improves throughput through the enhanced resource sharing attained by motivating the customers to wait. In this paper, we propose a new class of scheduling policies, called Next <b>Schedule</b> <b>Time</b> First (NSTF), which provides customers with <b>schedule</b> <b>times</b> and performs <b>scheduling</b> based on these <b>schedule</b> <b>times.</b> NSTF guarantees that customers will be serviced no later than scheduled and ensures that the <b>schedule</b> <b>times</b> are very accurate estimates of the actual times of service. We present alternative implementations of NSTF and show through simulation that NSTF works as expected and delivers outstanding performance benefits. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Schedule</b> <b>time</b> is the {{difference}} between the <b>scheduled</b> local <b>time</b> at the origin and the <b>scheduled</b> local <b>time</b> at the destination and usually differs from the actual time in the air as it is affected by the local time zones. Local clock time flying westward, or [...] "chasing the sun", is slowed, while local clock time flying eastbound is sped up. However, flights over the International Date Line located at approximately 180o E in the Pacific will subtract 24 hours from the <b>schedule</b> <b>time</b> going eastwards and add 24 hours going westwards. For example, the eastward flight shown in the example from Japan to North America will have a <b>scheduled</b> <b>time</b> of arrival earlier than the departure time, while from North America to Japan the flight will take a whole day longer by local time; the actual flying time in both cases being the same or similar.|$|R
