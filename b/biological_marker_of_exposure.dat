40|$|Recent {{advances}} in cytogenetic methodology {{are beginning to}} have a major impact upon our ability to provide assessments of environmental exposure in humans. The advent of fluorescent-based techniques for `painting` whole chromosomes has made the analysis of chromosome translocations rapid, specific, sensitive and routine. Chromosome painting has been used to address a wide variety of scientific questions, resulting in an increased understanding of the biological consequences of adverse environmental exposure. This paper describes the use of chromosome translocations as a <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> and effect in humans. The relevance of translocations is discussed, as are {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} painting compared to classical cytogenetic methods for translocation evaluation. The factors to consider in the use of translocations as a retrospective indicator of exposure are then described. Several theoretical parameters that are important to the use of translocations are provided, and the paper concludes with a vision for the future of cytogenetic methodology...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPolycyclic {{aromatic}} amines (arylamines) are {{a class of}} chemical carcinogens that are prevalent in environmental and industrial settings. They are metabolically activated to covalently bond to DNA, forming mutagenic adducts. In order to study the mechanisms of their toxicity, sensitive and selective quantitative LC/MS/MS detection methods were developed to measure the N-(adenin- 8 -yl) -benzidine adduct and N-(adenin- 8 -yl) - 2 -aminofluorene in total DNA extract samples. A novel synthetic method using a palladium catalyst was previously developed to prepare authentic and deuterated arylamine-adenine adducts to serve as standards. These standards were then used to develop an HPLC electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, isotope dilution method. Sample detection limits in DNA samples were 22 pg on-column and 51 pg on-column for the N-(adenin- 8 -yl) -benzidine- and N-(adenin- 8 -yl) - 2 -aminofluorene-adenine adducts, respectively. This method has applications {{for the study of}} DNA adduct formation as a <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to carcinogens and for environmental and workplace monitoring of these {{aromatic amines}}...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study whether sewage {{workers are}} exposed to {{genotoxic}} substances. An increased risk of cancers among sewage workers has been noted. If this increased risk is due to an exposure to genotoxic agents, primarily DNA damage {{could be used as}} a <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> METHODS: In a cross sectional study, DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes from 35 sewage workers and 30 controls was compared with alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis, a technique for detecting single strand breaks and alkali labile sites in DNA. The controls were selected from among municipal workers matched for age and smoking habit. Information about occupational exposures and possible confounders was collected by means of a questionnaire. RESULTS: No increase in DNA damage was found among the sewage workers when compared with the unexposed controls. CONCLUSIONS: The failure to detect increased damage to DNA in peripheral lymphocytes by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis suggests that the sewage workers studied here were not exposed to genotoxic agents to a greater extent than other municipal workers. It may be, however, that the lymphocyte is not the appropriate target cell to study, or that sewage workers {{are exposed to}} carcinogens which do not damage the genetic material...|$|E

40|$|Abstract [An {{overview}} {{is given}} <b>of</b> <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to chemical warfare agents.

40|$|Mosquito salivary {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in several biological processes that facilitate their blood feeding and have also been reported to elicit an IgG response in vertebrates. A growing {{number of studies have}} focused on this immunological response for its potential use as a <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to arthropod bites. As mosquito saliva collection is extremely laborious and inefficient, most research groups prefer to work on mosquito salivary glands (SGs). Thus, SG protein integrity is a critical factor in obtaining meaningful data from immunological and biochemical analysis. Current methodologies rely on an immediate freezing of SGs after their collection. However, the maintenance of samples in a frozen environment can be hard to achieve in field conditions. In this study, SG proteins from two mosquito species (Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae s. s.) stored in different media for 5 days at either + 4 °C or room temperature (RT) were evaluated at the quantitative (i. e., ELISA) and qualitative (i. e., SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting) levels. Our results indicated that PBS medium supplemented with an anti-protease cocktail seems to be the best buffer to preserve SG antigens for 5 days at + 4 °C for ELISA analysis. Conversely, cell-lysis buffer (Urea-Thiourea-CHAPS-Tris) was best at preventing protein degradation both at + 4 °C and RT for further qualitative analysis. These convenient storage methods provide an alternative to freezing and are expected to be applicable to other biological samples collected in the field...|$|E
40|$|Background: Semen {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the parameters used to predict male fertility. Semen can be altered by environmental pollutants; therefore it {{could be used as a}} <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> in contaminated areas. Aim: To analyze the spermogram values in a sample of healthy young males, residing in Arica, Chile. Material and methods: One hundred and two healthy university students volunteers aged 18 to 30 years answered a questionnaire about fertility, habits and andrologic diseases and provided a semen sample. Within three hours after ejaculation, semen volume, pH, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were analyzed. Results: Six percent of volunteers had offspring, 1 % declared to be infertile, 32 % smoked and 78 % con-sumed alcohol. Semen pH was 7. 6 ± 0. 5, volume, 2. 9 ± 1. 6 ml, sperm concentration, 62. 8 ± 62. 3 x 10 (6) /ml, normal morphology, 15. 0 ± 7. 9 %, overall motility, 42. 2 ± 23. 2 % and grade A motility, 19. 2 ± 18. 6 %. The percentage of subjects that had normal semen values was 82 % for total sperm count, 76 % for sperm concentration, 72 % for volume, 64 % for vitality, 63 % for pH, 57 % for morphology, 38 % for overall motility and 26 % for grade A motility. Conclusions: This sample of healthy young males had a normal sperm count in comparison with international reports. However it is necessary to characterize the spermogram in uncontaminated areas of Chile to ensure that our results are within the expected values for the country...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} preventive measures in a graphite electrode plant aimed at reducing occupational exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). METHODS: Electrode workers (n = 146) answered a questionnaire and provided an end of shift urine sample. Urinary 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -hpur), a <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to PAHs, was measured by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with: (a) fluorescence detection. 1 - Hydroxypyrene concentrations were compared with the concentrations measured before implementing the preventive measures; and (b) those of a control group of 54 men not occupationally exposed to PAHs. RESULTS: After implementation of preventive measures, median concentrations 1 - hpur were significantly reduced in some groups of workers: by - 24 %, - 37 % and - 30 % in workers at the green electrode unit, one baking impregnation unit, and the laboratory, respectively. In workers at a second baking impregnation unit, in end product finishing and in the power station 1 -hpur concentrations were unchanged. Urinary 1 -hp concentrations were still significantly higher in each group of workers than {{in the control group}} (p < 0. 001 for any comparison). Concentrations in the workers varied with the type of job, the highest values being found in workers engaged in the power station, in the two baking impregnation units and in the green electrode unit. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing preventive measures significantly reduced exposure to PAHs at a graphite electrode plant. The reduction in median and peak concentrations of 1 -hpur, which reflects total exposure to, and internal dose of PAHs, was most evident in workers employed in the units where preventive measures had been taken. Despite an overall reduction, further preventive measures are needed to minimise exposure to PAHs and consequently the risk of adverse health effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{major public}} health {{concern is the}} degree to which {{environmental}} or occupational exposures to exogenous chemicals result in adverse health effects. <b>Biological</b> <b>markers</b> have the potential for helping to answer this important question by providing links between <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> and <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> early stages of the development of disease.

40|$|This paper reviews {{selected}} {{aspects of}} progress and setbacks in cancer risk assessment and prevention during the four decades since the founding in 1947 of the Institute of Environmental Medicine at the New York University Medical Center.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] Characterisation of the {{airborne}} concentration of 13 {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) at various workplaces in a graphite electrode and a coke production plant. Validation of the urinary excretion of 1 -hydroxypyrene (hydroxypyrene) as a <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to PAH. DESIGN [...] Cross sectional study of workers exposed to PAHs (106 in the graphite electrode producing plant and 16 in the coke works). METHODS [...] Personal air sampling during at least six hours per workshift using a glass fibre filter and a Chromosorb 102 solid sorbent tube and analysis of PAHs by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrofluorometric detection (SFD). Collection of spot urine samples {{before and after the}} shift and analysis of 1 -hydroxypyrene by HPLC and SFD. RESULTS [...] The workers most exposed to PAHs were those occupied at the topside area of the coke oven plant and those working in the blending and impregnation areas of the graphite electrode producing plant (mean airborne concentration of total PAHs: 199 and 223 micrograms/m 3 respectively). Except for naphthalene and perylene, the relative proportion of the different PAHs did not differ between the plants. Pyrene concentration in air was highly correlated with the total airborne PAH concentration (r = 0. 83, p < 0. 0001) and the correlation coefficients between hydroxypyrene concentration in postshift urine samples and pyrene or total PAHs in air were 0. 67 (p < 0. 0001) and 0. 72 (p < 0. 0001) respectively. Excretion of hydroxypyrene doubled when the exposure to pyrene in air increased 10 -fold. The half life for the urinary excretion of hydroxypyrene was around 18 hours (95 % confidence interval 16. 1 - 19. 8). Smoking habits only explained 2. 3 % of the variance in hydroxypyrene excretion compared with 45 % for the pyrene concentration in air. CONCLUSION [...] The determination of the urinary excretion of hydroxypyrene in postshift urine samples {{can be used as a}} suitable biomarker to assess individual exposure to PAHs in coke ovens and in graphite electrode manufacturing plants...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were: 1) {{to determine which}} factors and biological samples {{were associated with the}} estimated amount of total arsenic (As) consumed from water and food; 2) to determine which factors were associated with the concentration of total and speciated As ([As]) in urine; 3) to determine which factors were associated with the total [As] in nails and hair; and 4) to evaluate a novel method of quantifying As in human nails via x-ray fluorescence (XRF). In 2010, a questionnaire was administered to 179 people from two locations in Nova Scotia, Canada. The questionnaire collected information on participants’ eating and drinking habits, and key social and demographic information such as: cigarette and alcohol consumption, length of time in home, household income, etc. Water and biological samples, collected from each participant, were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to quantify the total concentration of As ([As]) and selenium (Se) in each. Total water [As] ranged from < 0. 02 – 309. 2 g/L. Total [As] of urine (adjusted by specific gravity, SG), fingernails, toenails, and hair ranged from < 0. 71 – 661. 1 g/L, from < 0. 07 – 2. 3 g/g, from < 0. 15 – 4. 1 g/g, and from < 0. 15 – 13. 2 g/g, respectively. Total urinary [As] was associated with estimated total amounts of As consumed from water and food in the last 3 days. Total fingernail [As] and water pH were also associated with the amount of As consumed from water, and income was associated with food As consumption. The depth of the well used to draw vi drinking water was associated with water As consumption and total As consumption, especially between the depths of 22 – 55 m. High Performance Liquid Chromatography was used to measure arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)), arsenobetaine (AsB), and total urinary arsenic metabolites minus arsenobetaine (TMA), in urine. Total water [As] was a strong positive predictor of all urinary As metabolite concentrations, with the exception of AsB. Consumption of seafood was positively associated with urinary concentrations of total As and AsB, but also As(III), DMA(V), and TMA, suggesting that seafood-derived As may be metabolized in the body to other As metabolites. Both total [As] and [AsB] in urine were found to be slightly higher in older participants. Participants who reported recent consumption of chicken also had slightly increased concentrations of urinary As(V). Finally, a strong positive relationship was found between water pH and MMA(V), DMA(V), and TMA concentrations in urine. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses found that water [As] and sample [Se] were predictors of [As] in hair and nails. This finding supports previous research which has found a high degree of interaction between As and Se in humans, which is important to consider when performing an As biomonitoring study. Evaluation of the XRF found the concordance correlation coefficient and kappa value were highest for fingernail samples of at least 20 mg in mass, but overall, XRF did not compare well to ICP-MS. Using a clinically relevant vii concentration of 1. 0 g/g on ICP-MS as a cut-off for indicating test positive and test negative samples, the XRF, also using a cut-off of 1. 0 g/g, was found to have 100 % sensitivity (95 % CI: 48 – 100 %) and negative predictive value (95 % CI: 63 – 100 %), however its specificity and positive predictive values were low, at 29 % (95 % CI: 17 – 43 %) and 19 % (95 % CI: 8 – 33 %), respectively. Further research involving urine as a <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to As should take specific urinary As metabolites into consideration and pay special attention to seafood consumption, which can strongly affect urinary [As], and can potentially lead to an increase in toxic inorganic As metabolites. Studies of As in hair or nails should consider the total and relative concentrations of Se in respective samples. More work is needed before the XRF can be considered a suitable replacement for ICP-MS...|$|E
40|$|Municipal {{wastewater}} effluent (MWWE) and its constituents, {{such as chemicals}} {{of emerging}} concern, pose a potential threat to the sustainability of fish populations by disrupting key endocrine functions in aquatic organisms. While studies have demonstrated changes in <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> aquatic organisms to groups of chemicals of emerging concern, the variability <b>of</b> these <b>markers</b> over time has not been sufficiently described in wild fish species. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the spatial and temporal variability <b>of</b> <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> in response to MWWE exposure and to test the consistency of these responses between seasons and among years. Rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) were collected in spring and fall seasons over a 5 -year period in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. In addition to surface water chemistry (nutrients and selected pharmaceuticals), measures were taken across levels of biological organization in rainbow darter. The measurements of hormone production, gonad development, and intersex severity were temporally consistent and suggested impaired reproduction in male fish collected downstream of MWWE outfalls. In contrast, ovarian development and hormone production in females appeared to be influenced more by urbanization than MWWE. Measures of gene expression and somatic indices were highly variable between sites and years, respectively, and were inconclusive in terms of the impacts of MWWE overall. Robust biomonitoring programs must consider these factors in both the design and interpretation of results, especially when spatial and temporal sampling of biological endpoints is limited. Assessing the effects of contaminants and other stressors on fish in watersheds would be greatly enhanced by an approach that considers natural variability in the endpoints being measured...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative {{estimates}} of human carcinogenic risk from chemical exposure are currently derived primarily from linearized multistage model {{analyses of the}} tumor response as observed in chronic laboratory animal bioassays versus administered dose. The numerous ad hoc assumptions that provide a rationale for this generic approach to carcinogenic risk assessment can only be evaluated critically when mechanistic data directly relevant to the low-dose and interspecies extrapolation problems are available. Clear needs exist to develop such ancillary data bases and the means for explicitly incorporating them into the risk estimation process. Target site dosimetry provides one useful organizing concept. Physiological response modeling can account systematically for interspecies variations in the distribution and disposition of chemicals in relation to external measures <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> Direct measurements <b>of</b> interactions of chemicals and their metabolites with specific target macromolecules can provide sensitive and biologically meaningful exposure indices. Alternatively, quantitation of toxic effects such as altered cell regulation and differentiation can serve the same purpose.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To better {{understand}} the relations between occupational exposure, blood antioxidant enzyme activities, total plasma antioxidant concentration, and the severity of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from miners without CWP exposed to low dust concentrations for > or = 4 years {{at the time of}} the study (n = 105), or exposed to high dust concentrations for > or = 14 years {{at the time of the}} study (n = 58), and from retired miners with CWP (n = 19). Miners without CWP were classified into three subgroups according to their estimated cumulative exposure to dust. Chest x ray films were obtained for each miner. Miners were classified in five subgroups according to their International Labour Organisation (ILO) profusion grades. Univariate tests were completed by multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The estimated cumulative exposure to dust was strongly positively related to erythrocyte catalase activity and strongly negatively related to Cu++/Zn++ SOD activity only in miners exposed to high dust concentrations for > or = 14 years at the time of the study (F tests p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 004 respectively). Moreover, catalase activity was strongly related to the severity of CWP expressed as five subgroups of ILO profusion grades (F test p = 0. 003); the greatest difference in the mean values was found between the group of 1 / 1 to 1 / 2 ILO profusion grades and the group of 2 / 1 to 3 / 3 ILO profusion grades. CONCLUSION: These results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that production of reactive oxygen species may be an important event in the exposure to coal mine dusts and the severity of CWP. Erythrocyte catalase and Cu++/Zn++ SOD activities are more closely related to recent exposure to high dust concentrations than to cumulative exposure, and could be considered as <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> rather than as <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> early adverse <b>biological</b> effect...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the study}} is to {{evaluate}} whether occupational exposure to urban stressors could cause alterations in thyroid hormones plasma levels (TSH, FT 3 and FT 4) in female outdoor workers vs. administrative. Materials and Methods. The study has been performed on an initial sample of 198 female subjects divided in two groups (occupationally exposed and not exposed to urban stressors). After excluding the subjects with the main confounding factors, female outdoor workers and administrative staff were matched by age, working life and drinking habit. Results. In 40 female outdoor workers mean plasma TSH levels were significantly higher compared to 40 administrative staff. The distribution of TSH values in outdoor workers and in administrative staff was significant. Plasma FT 3 and FT 4 levels were not significantly different in the two groups. Our results suggest that exposure to urban stressors (chemical, physical and psycho-social), can alter the plasma concentration of TSH. Conclusions. According to our previous research, plasma TSH levels may be used as an early <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> chronic <b>exposure</b> to urban stressors, in occupational set even before the onset of the related disorders.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Hydrocarbon {{solvents}} {{are widely}} used {{in the production of}} paints, adhesives, dyes, polymers, plastics, textiles, printing inks, agricultural products and pharmaceuticals. While the neuropathic potential of aliphatic solvents was shown in the 1970 s, {{little is known about the}} neuropathic potential of aromatic solvents. The present study examines such solvents, 1, 2 -diethylbenzene (DEB) and its metabolite 1, 2 -diacetylbenzene (DAB), to determine (a) the neuropathological evidence for peripheral neuropathy in rodents treated with 1, 2 -DAB, (b) the neurochemical basis for the neurotoxic properties of this compound, and (c) the structural requirements for nerve fiber damage. The properties of 1, 2 -DAB and 2, 5 - hexanedione (HD) are also compared. A key finding of this thesis is that 1, 2 -DAB induces a 2, 5 -HD-like pattern of nerve damage of motor and sensory axons with focal swellings containing neurofilaments. Whereas nerve damage begins distally in 2, 5 -HD intoxication, with 1, 2 -DAB treatment axonal swellings begin intraspinally and in the proximal ventral roots of motor nerve fibers. A second key finding is the reactivity of 1, 2 -DAB with amino acids, notably lysine, a property that is shared with 2, 5 -HD. 1, 2 -DAB and 2, 5 -HD react with amino acids and proteins to form blue and yellow chromophores, respectively. Relative to 2, 5 -HD, 1, 2 -DAB is three orders of magnitude more reactive in forming high-molecular-weight species. 1, 2 -DAB treatment of spinal cord slices in vitro and intact sciatic nerve in vivo showed that neurofilament proteins react more readily than beta-tubulin. The heavy and medium subunits of neurofilament protein were more reactive than the light subunit. The reactivity of these four axonal proteins was in proportion to their lysine content. These data are consistent with selective accumulation of neurofilaments in giant axonal swellings. In summary, these studies have shown a relationship between the chromogenic and neuropathic properties of two gamma-diketones, one aliphatic (2, 5 -HD) the other aromatic (1, 2 -DAB). These studies are relevant to occupational and public health for at least two reasons. First, urinary chromogens generated by neuropathic aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons could serve as <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to solvents with neuropathic potential, and second, other chromogenic solvents (such as tetralin) should be considered for neuropathic potential...|$|R

For its sensitivity and specificity, tt-MA excreted in urine is considered a good <b>biological</b> <b>marker</b> <b>of</b> benzene <b>exposure.</b> In this study, seminal tt-MA levels in occupationally nonexposed subjects (n = 32) have been determined. The seminal fluid of normozoospermic subjects contained an average tt-MA concentration (170 +/- 100 ng ml(- 1)) significantly lower than that of teratozoospermic (310 +/- 180 ng ml(- 1); P < 0. 01), oligozoospermic (400 +/- 180 ng ml(- 1); P < 0. 001), and oligoasthenozoospermic. (430 +/- 230 ng ml(- 1); P < 0. 01) subjects. A negative correlation existed between tt-MA levels and sperm concentration (r = - 0. 62; P < 0. 001), percentage of normal spermatozoa (r = - 0. 41; P < 0. 05), and percentage of vital spermatozoa (r = - 0. 89; P < 0. 001). Average tt-MA levels detected in seminal plasma were higher in smokers (350 +/- 160 ng ml(- 1)) than in nonsmokers (280 +/- 210 ng ml(- 1)) These results show that seminal plasma tt-MA content could be an important biological indicator for evaluating the negative effects of benzene on spermatogenesis...|$|R

The presentstudy was designed to evaluate the protective effect of vitamin E and vitamin C against the hemolysis induced byhydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) in camel's red blood cells in vitro, and for assessing the vulnerability of camelerythrocytes to oxidative stress (OS). Vitamin E and vitamin C were able to protect the red blood cells against theH 2 O 2 -induced hemolysis and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) formation.

40|$|IMPF: 06. 66 Background: The lack <b>of</b> robust <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> dietary <b>exposure</b> hinders the {{quantitative}} understanding of causal relations between diet and health. Objective: We {{aimed to develop}} an efficient procedure to discover metabolites in urine that may have future potential as biomarkers <b>of</b> acute <b>exposure</b> to foods <b>of</b> high public health importance. Design: Twenty-four participants were provided with a test breakfast in which the cereal component of a standardized breakfast was replaced by 1 of 4 foods of high public health importance; 1. 5 -, 3 -, and 4. 5 -h postprandial urine samples were collected. Flow infusion electrospray?ionization mass spectrometry followed by supervised multivariate data {{analysis was used to}} discover signals resulting from consumption of each test food. Results: Fasted-state urine samples provided a universal comparator for food biomarker lead discovery in postprandial urine. The filtering of data features associated with consumption of the common components of the standardized breakfast improved discrimination models and readily identified metabolites that showed consumption of specific test foods. A combination of trimethylamine-N-oxide and 1 -methylhistidine was associated with salmon consumption. Novel ascorbate derivatives were discovered in urine after consumption of either broccoli or raspberries. Sulphonated caffeic acid and sulphonated methyl-epicatechin concentrations increased dramatically after consumption of raspberries. Conclusions: This biomarker lead discovery strategy can identify urinary metabolites associated with acute exposure to individual foods. Future studies are required to validate the specificity and utility of potential biomarkers in an epidemiologic context. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} aimed at semi-quantifying the {{membrane}} density of multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) transporters in Chironomidae Orthocladiinae larvae from an urban stream by ELISA assay. The relationships between the MXR transporter membrane density and limnological parameters and pollutant concentrations, 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as per the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and seven polychlorobiphenyl congeners (PCBs), were assessed. Midge larvae were collected, and limnological parameters and pollutant concentrations were measured in three sites of a French Mediterranean urban stream, two located after sewage treatment plants, and one closed to the river mouth, and in two additional sites, one on the stream tributary, and one in a non-urbanized stream located in the same region. Results show that the PAH and PCB contamination levels are different between sites and that some congener concentrations are above their threshold toxic effect level (TEL). The MXR transporter membrane density was significantly higher in larvae from the tributary, the most polluted site, as compared with larvae from the non-urbanized stream. The MXR transporter density {{was positively correlated with}} 10 of the 16 US-EPA PAH concentrations and the increase in the MXR transporter density seems to be due to the US-EPA PAH concentrations that were above their TEL. No relations with PCB concentrations or limnological parameters were found.

The rapid development of metabolomics technology offers opportunity for the identification of urine biomarkers for the intake {{of a range of}} foods of high public health importance (2), (3). Using high mass resolution mass spectrometry and machine learning data analysis, we have discovered potential urinary biomarkers in controlled clinical studies with a range of analytical techniques (2). To have utility for population monitoring, we aim to validate biomarker performance in free-living individuals using urine samples collected in the home with a minimal impact on normal daily activities. Two complementary multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) routines using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (QQQ-MS) have been developed to quantify concurrently dietary <b>exposure</b> biomarkers <b>of</b> more than 20 foods of high public health importance in the UK. MRM quantification of metabolite levels in spot urines collected either before bed time or a first morning void identified a sub-set of potential biomarkers that demonstrated robust linkage with reported dietary intake (examples in Table 1). Figure 1 demonstrates the ability of selected biomarkers to report exposure in relation to muscle meat intake from lunch time to bedtime (Beefburger; 106 gm, Chicken breast; 130 gm; Processed Ham; 40 ? 5 gm) in 6 free-living individuals. Anserine was strongly, and specifically, associated with poultry intake, whilst the urinary outputs of 3 -methyl histidine and carnosine reflect striated muscle intake, with levels substantially reduced when meals contain lower quality, and processed, meats with reduced levels of striated muscle content.

40|$|In case <b>of</b> {{accidental}} radiation <b>exposure</b> or {{a nuclear}} incident, physical dosimetry {{is not always}} complete. Therefore, {{it is important to}} develop tools that allow dose estimates and determination that are based on <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> radiation <b>exposure.</b> Exposure to ionizing radiation triggers a large-scale activation of specific DNA signaling and repair mechanisms. This includes the phosphorylation of γH 2 AX in the vicinity of a double-strand break (DSB). A DNA DSB is a cytotoxic form of DNA damage, and if not correctly repaired can initiate genomic instability, chromosome aberrations, mutations or apoptosis. Measurements of DNA DSBs and their subsequent repair after in vitro irradiation has been suggested to be of potential use to monitor cellular responses. The bone marrow and the blood are known to be the most radiosensitive tissues of the human body and can therefore be of particular importance to find radiation-induced <b>biological</b> <b>markers.</b> In the present study, changes in H 2 AX phosphorylation and apoptosis of irradiated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed. Freshly isolated PBMCs from healthy donors were irradiated with X-rays (0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 Gy). The phosphorylation of γH 2 AX was measured at different time points (0, 0. 25, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h) after irradiation. We detected a linear dose-dependency of γH 2 AX phosphorylation measured by γH 2 AX foci scoring using immunofluorescence microscopy as well as by γH 2 AX fluorescence detection using flow cytometry. Apoptosis was detected by measuring DNA fragmentation at different time points (0, 24, 48, 72, 96 h) after X-irradiation using DNA ladder gel electrophoresis. The apoptotic DNA fragmentation increased in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, DNA DSBs and subsequent apoptotic DNA fragmentation monitoring have potential as biomarkers for assessing human exposure in radiation biodosimetry...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Bioaerosols such as grain dust (GD) elicit direct {{immunological}} reactions {{within the}} human respiratory system. Workplace-dependent exposure to GD may induce asthma, chronic bronchitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Aims: To assess the clinical impact <b>of</b> occupational <b>exposure</b> to GD {{and to determine}} quantitative <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> bioaerosol <b>exposure</b> in grain workers. Methods: This longitudinal study has been conducted from summer 2012 to summer 2013, comprising 6 groups of 30 active workers with different GD exposure patterns (4 groups of grain workers, 2 control groups). Two evaluations at high- and low-exposing seasons take place, during which an occupational and a medical history are questionnaire-assessed, lung function is evaluated by spirometry, airway inflammation is measured by exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) and specific blood IgG and IgE are titrated. Results: The preliminary results are those of 2 of the 4 exposed groups, (harvesters and mill workers), compared to the control groups, at first assessment (n= 100). Mean age is 38. 4 [years]; 98 % are male. Exposed groups differ from controls (p< 0. 05) in daily contact with animals (57 % vs. 40 %) and active smoking (39 % vs. 11 %). Grain workers have more respiratory (50 %), nasal (57 %), ocular (45 %) and dermatologic (36 %) occupational symptoms than controls (6. 4 %, 19 %, 16 %, 6. 4 % respectively, p< 0. 05). Lower mean peak-expiratory-flow (PEF) values (96. 1 ± 18. 9 vs. 108. 2 ± 17. 4 [% of predicted], p< 0. 05) and eNO values (13. 9 ± 9. 6 vs. 20. 5 ± 14. 7 [ppm], p< 0. 05) are observed in the exposed groups. Conclusion: Preliminary results show a higher prevalence of clinical symptoms and a lower mean PEF value in the groups exposed to GD...|$|R
40|$|Not {{the final}} {{published}} versionOBJECTIVE: To detect anti-HIV antibodies in cervicovaginal secretions of HIV-seronegative female sex workers and {{to evaluate whether}} {{the presence of these}} antibodies is associated with increased sexual exposure. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at a confidential clinic for female sex workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The participants were 342 HIV-seronegative female sex workers in whom a cervicovaginal lavage was collected. The main outcome measures were the detection of antibodies to HIV- 1 in cervicovaginal lavages using an in-house and a commercial (Seradyn Sentinel; Calypte Biomedical Corporation, Berkeley, California, USA) enzyme immunoassay; the detection of semen in cervicovaginal lavages; and the assessment <b>of</b> epidemiological and <b>biological</b> <b>markers</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>exposure</b> to HIV. RESULTS: Cervicovaginal anti-HIV antibodies were detected in 7. 3 and 29. 8 % of women using in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Seradyn Sentinel respectively. All cervicovaginal secretions found to be positive by in-house ELISA were also positive by Seradyn Sentinel. In a minority of women, ranging from 2. 9 % by in-house ELISA to 12. 3 % by Seradyn Sentinel, the anti-HIV antibodies were present in vaginal fluids that did not contain semen. Sexual exposure to HIV was similar in women with anti-HIV antibodies in their semen-free cervicovaginal secretions compared with women without anti-HIV antibodies in their cervicovaginal secretions. CONCLUSIONS: Cervicovaginal HIV-specific antibodies were detected in a minority of sexually exposed HIV-seronegative female sex workers in Abidjan. The lack of association between increased sexual exposure to HIV and presence of cervicovaginal HIV-specific antibodies suggests that the production of genital HIV-specific antibodies in exposed seronegative women depends on the ability of individual women to mount specific mucosal immunity to HIV antigens, the determinants of which are currently unknown...|$|R

Exposure to tobacco smoke presents an ideal environment with which to develop, characterize, and refine <b>biological</b> <b>markers,</b> especially <b>of</b> those carcinogens found in tobacco. In the present study, a sensitive gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method was developed to measure nitrosamine- hemoglobin adducts (HPB-Hb (4 -Hydroxy- 3 -pyridinyl- 1 -butanone) at trace levels in red blood cells of both African-American and Caucasian smoking and nonsmoking mothers and their infants. Gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric methods with chemical ionization (CI) of methane reagent gas in both positive and negative ion mode as well as electron ionization (EI) were studied to determine differences in sensitivity of detection among the various ionization methods. Detection limits using both positive and negative chemical ionization modes were found to be 30 femtomoles of HPB, whereas detection using electron impact modes yielded a detection limit of 80 femtomoles of HBP. Comparative derivatization of HPB was performed using O-bis(Trimethylsilyl) -trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -Pentafluorobenzoylchloride (PFBC). Both Negative CI and Positive CI modes of analysis were compared to the more widely accepted EI modes of mass spectrometri...|$|R
