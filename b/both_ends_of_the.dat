5|$|In 1917, landowners {{along the}} slough had formed three {{drainage}} districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees {{to keep the}} rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property.

The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal were at nearly the same elevation.|$|E

This is the last curve along NY441 as it follows a linear east–west routing over several small hills to a junction with NY350 west of the hamlet of Walworth, where NY441 terminates. The roadway, however, continues east to Marion as Walworth–Penfield Road, Walworth–Marion Road, and Buffalo Street, a continuous highway maintained by Wayne County as County Route205 (CR205) west of Hall Center Road and Maple Avenue and as CR207 east of those roads.|$|E
5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured.

5|$|The lack of armour on <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design sparked controversy: {{after the}} former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that {{in case of}} damage to either end the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, as it could happen only if all the bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{generalized}} RCE photodetector schematic as {{given in}} Figure 1 {{can give the}} required theoretical model of photodetection. A thin absorption region of thickness d is sandwiched between two relatively less absorbing region, substrate, of thickness L1 and L2.

5|$|A {{collision}} with Edmonton's Dan McGillis {{early in the}} 1997–98 season forced Gélinas out of the lineup with a sprained knee. He missed 16 games due to the injury and had only eight points in 24 games played. His tenure with the Canucks ended January 3, 1998. He was traded, along with Kirk McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Sean Burke, Geoff Sanderson and Enrico Ciccone. Gélinas was added to Carolina's roster to add a physical presence to the team and improve the team at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ice. He finished the season with 24 points in 40 games with the Hurricanes, and was invited to join Team Canada for the 1998 World Championship. Gélinas scored one goal for the sixth-place Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to {{walk down to the}} middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
5|$|In August 1998, {{signs were}} {{installed}} along the Meadowbrook State Parkway dedicating {{the road in}} honor of State Senator Norman J. Levy, who died in February 1998 after brain surgery. Levy had served on the State Senate Transportation Committee since 1982 and sponsored the first seat belt law in the United States, and had also {{been part of the}} negotiations that helped work resume on the Meadowbrook–Northern State interchange. The new signs were unveiled in a ceremony in the median of the parkway just south of Merrick Road.

5|$|K-383 was {{assigned}} in 1981 over the portions of former US-383 {{that had not}} run concurrently with either US-83 or US-183. The highway was originally designated as parts of US-36 and K-22 in the mid-1920s. The entire route became US-83 and was placed on much of its modern alignment in the early 1930s. replacing the original path that followed section lines. The route was redesignated US-383 in the mid-1940s and paved from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. The highway was relocated within Norton in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

5|$|The Qum-Darya bow was {{superseded}} in {{the modern}} area of Hungary by an 'Avar' type, with more and differently-shaped laths. The grip laths stayed essentially the same except that a fourth piece was sometimes glued {{to the back of}} the handle enclosing it with bone on all four faces. The belly lath was often parallel-sided with splayed ends. The siyah laths became much wider in profile above the nock and less rounded, giving a bulbous aspect. The nock was often further away from the upper end of the siyah than on Qum-Darya type examples. Additional laths were usually added to the belly and back of the siyah thus enclosing <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stave on four faces. This made a total of up to 12 laths on an asymmetrical bow with stiff, set back handle. Examples measured in situ suggest bow lengths of 120–140cm.

Red sandstone also appears at <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls, suggesting at least two more windows, and meaning that the wall would have been at least twice the length of the surviving fragment when built.
