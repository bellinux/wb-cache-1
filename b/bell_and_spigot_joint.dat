50|$|Cast iron {{proved to}} be a {{beneficial}} material for the manufacture of water pipes and was used as a replacement for the original elm pipelines laid in the ground earlier. These water pipelines were composed of individually cast pipe sections, often termed sticks, jointed together by a <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joint.</b> Here one end of the pipe stick is flared, termed the bell or socket, to enable {{the opposite end of the}} next stick, the spigot end, to be inserted to create a joint. The gaps in these joints were sealed with oakum to prevents the water leaking out. A molten-lead joint was then run around the socket to ensure that the oakum seal remained in place.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The section {{mutation}} of a pipe {{affects the}} interior flow field seriously. Numerical simulation of the two-dimensional steady gas flow field of {{two types of}} section mutation pipe was processed. By comparing it with equivalent section pipeâ€™s interior flow field, the effects of section mutation of pipe on pressure distributing and velocity distributing were analyzed. The results are commendably consistent with the theories of one-dimensional adiabatic frictional pipe flow. Ensuring {{the section of the}} compressed gas pipe to be coherent and using the <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joint</b> if necessary are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{annular space}} between <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joints</b> for cast iron pipes {{installed}} between 1850 {{and the early}} 1960 s in North America was typically caulked with lead. Lead was caulked unto place using hand-held or pneumatic hammers and special chisels. Historical anecdotal evidence suggests that some bells may have cracked during caulking, especially if the jointer was over zealous in hammering the lead in place or used pneumatic hammers with excessive pressure to produce a tight joint. This paper examines two mechanistic models, one linear and another non-linear, to estimate the levels of hoop stress induced in the bell {{as a consequence of}} lead caulking. Illustrative analyses of lead caulking joints in 16 " and 48 " diameter pipes show that the linear model tends to predict unrealistic high stresses while the non-linear model produced more realistic stresses. Tensile hoop stresses can reach as high as 25...|$|R
40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. The bell-and-spigot joints {{that connect}} pipe sections together tend to leak as these pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joints</b> from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and installing a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service to customers (which would result in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of old cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains. The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 (Program Management) and Task 2 (Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications) were completed previously. Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in test cast-iron pipe segments. Efforts in the current quarter continued {{to be focused on}} Tasks 4 - 8. Highly valuable lessons were learned from field tests of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast-iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. (These field tests were conducted and reported previously.) Several design issues were identified which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter repair robots for cast-iron pipe to assure their commercial success. For Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train), previous problems with bladder design and elastomeric material expansion in the large mains were addressed. A new bladder based on a commercially available design was obtained and tested with success. Minor improvements were highlighted during patch-setting tests and are now being pursued. For Task 5 (Design and Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera), the previous field tests showed clearly that, in mains with low gas velocities, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the system's capacity to remove debris from the immediate vicinity of the <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joints.</b> Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (the flails were found to be very effective in cleaning <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joints)</b> falls directly to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak-free repair. Similarly, it is also deemed necessary to design an assembly to capture existing servicetap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. Task 6 (Design and Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabVIEW. However, this must now be revisited to add control routines for the coupon catcher that will be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function. Task 7 (Design and Fabricate Large Diameter Live Access System) progressed to completing the detailed design for a bolt-on entry fitting for 12 -inch diameter cast-iron pipe in the current quarter. The drilling assembly for cutting an access hole through the wall of the gas main was also designed, along with a plug assembly to allow removing all tools from the live main and setting a blind flange on the entry fitting prior to burial. These designs are described in detail in the report.

Two reports, one describing the program management plan and the other consisting of the technology assessment, were submitted to the DOE COR in the first quarter. Task 2 [...] Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications and Task 3 [...] Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves are now well underway. First-quarter activities included conducting detailed analyses to determine the capabilities of coiled-tubing locomotion for entering and repairing gas mains and the first design iteration of the joint-sealing sleeve. The maximum horizontal reach of coiled tubing inside a pipeline before buckling prevents further access was calculated {{for a wide range}} of coiled-tubing string designs and pipe environments.

The field tests were conducted August 23 - 26, 2004 in Oradell, New Jersey. The field tests identified several design issues which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter cast iron repair robots to assure their commercial success. Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train) progressed {{to the design of}} the control electronics and pneumatic system to inflate the bladder robotic patch setting module in the last quarter 5. In this quarter, work has been concentrated on increasing the nitrogen bladder reservoir volume to allow at least two complete patch inflation/patch setting cycles in the event the sleeve does not set all ratchets in the same row on the first attempt. This problem was observed on a few of the repair sleeves that were recently installed during field tests with the small-diameter robotic system. For Task 5 (Design & Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera) it was observed that {{it will be necessary to}} add a stiff brush to push debris away from the immediate vicinity of the <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joints</b> in mains having low gas velocities.

Similarly, it is also necessary to design a small magnet to capture existing service tap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. These coupons were found to cause difficulty in launching and retrieving the small pipe repair robot; one coupon lodged beneath the end of the guide shoe. These new features require redesign of the pipe wall cleaning train and modification to the patch setting train.

40|$|European {{foundries}} {{master the}} art of mass-producing cast iron pipes in the early 1800 s (Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute 2006 : 1). Slow sand filters, buried pipes with <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> <b>joints,</b> steam powered pumps, and water towers make for a universally applicable technology for urban water supply. Piped water systems enjoy a long service life and modest operational costs but require high initial outlays of capital. Also, pipe laying raises complex right-of-way issues (Meidinger 1980). Around 1850 {{it is by no}} means certain that buried water infrastructure can hold its own against contending modes of urban water supply. Cost-wise it certainly cannot compete against local water sources such as shallow wells and canals. By 1900 however, piped supply is establishing itself as the dominant source of domestic water in European and North American cities. Seventy years on, piped networks are the sole source of urban domestic water. i A parallel network of buried sewers carries the large volumes of piped water away from urban homes. How do piped water and waste technologies come to dominate domestic water regimes in European and North American cities? An early literature attributed the rise of urban piped water and sewerage to an unfolding understanding of the nature of waterborne disease (Baker 1949). Subsequent investigations by urban environment historians show that public health concerns play a minor role only in early 19 th century decisions to embrace piped water infrastructure (Juuti and Katko, 2005; Millward 2004; Tarr et al. 1984; Troesken and Geddes 2003). The introduction of piped water supply, in enabling householders to install waterborne waste removal systems, may arguably even have aggravated waterborne disease (Tarr et al. 1984). ii Urban environment historians place the rise of piped water against a background of rapid industrial and population growth in European and North American towns. The environmental stress accompanying 19 th century industrialisation triggers a crisis of urban water and waste that literally overwhelms city administrations (Tarr 1996). National and state governments respond by, late in the 19 th century, enacting laws and regulations that place responsibility for solving the crisis in urban public health on the shoulders of municipal administrations. City administrations respond by committing to large-scale and centralised technologies for handling urban water and waste. Much of the research published in English focuses, rather unsurprisingly, on the United States and Britain. This article attempts to complements our understanding of the emergence of the piped water paradigm with evidence from the European continent. Here, as elsewhere, waterworks are pioneered by private entrepreneurs under municipal concession contracts. Early concessions confer a limited degree of market power to concessionaires. In most cases the concession amounts to no more than a permit to bury piped systems in municipal soil. Gradually waterworks concessions grow in scope. The public health legislation underlying these arrangements provides concessionaires with a virtual monopoly on domestic water supply in the city. The next two sections sketch the development of piped water and sewerage technologies and the increasing involvement of municipalities with piped supply. Section four turns to the central argument. I show how the deepening commitment of municipal administrations to piped water occasions a shift in the legal brief under which concessionaires operate and the consequences this has for domestic water provision in the city.

The corollary is that unrestrained <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> socket <b>joints</b> transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, thrust blocks, which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R
40|$|Cast-iron pipes {{installed}} between 1850 and {{the early}} 1960 s in North America, United Kingdom, and European countries were produced in foundries located near growing urban centers. Their considerable weight, size (especially larger-diameter pipes), and limited transportation facilities made their handling and delivery to the installation site difficult. Historical anecdotal evidence exists to suggest that some cast-iron pipes may have been damaged during delivery. This paper examines different mechanical models to examine what specific conditions {{may have led to}} pipe damage during delivery and installation. Analyses show that if pipes did incur damage, then cracks were likely to have occurred {{on the inside of the}} pipe bell or spigot ends. Furthermore, it appears that the spigot ends of smaller-diameter pipes had higher risk of damage during delivery, whereas both <b>bell</b> <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> ends faced increased risk of damage in larger-diameter pipes.

Relevant new results were obtained concerning the bending behaviour <b>and</b> resistance of <b>spigot</b> <b>joints</b> (used to connect two vertical elements) and of forkhead joints (used to connect the falsework system to the formwork system) from which no published research was found to date. Based on the results, joint models are evaluated and improved empirical analytical models are developed. Finally, probabilistic models for the most relevant variables controlling the behaviour and resistance of the cuplok joints (used to connect horizontal elements to vertical elements) will be presented that can be used in the stochastic analysis of falsework CuplokÂ® systems...|$|R
50|$|Simpson {{was born}} in Blackwell, Carlisle and began his career in 1778 as a {{millwright}} until being appointed an inspector and engineer of the Chelsea Waterworks. He later also became an engineer at Lambeth Waterworks Company. He contributed {{to the introduction of}} iron fresh water pipes and replacement of wooden mains in London and throughout the United Kingdom, testifying before a Parliamentary select committee in 1821 that he had invented a method of making <b>spigot</b> <b>and</b> socket <b>joints</b> watertight by filling them with hemp or flax and then covering them in lead. He also built a workshop to repair and maintain steam engines in 1785, which his son James Simpson took over and developed into James Simpson and Co. Ltd, later Worthington-Simpson Ltd, which after several further mergers currently trades as Flowserve.|$|R

40|$|Performance {{efficiency}} of two inch hydrocyclone has been investigated, using the Nagar Parker china clay. Raw china clay was initially washed with tap water and - 75 ?m size fraction was separated through wet sieving. Washed china clay of - 75 ?m {{was used as}} feed sample in hydrocyclone tests. Solids concentration in slurry was kept as 2. 5 %. 45 tests were conducted with different combinations of pressure, vortex finder <b>and</b> <b>spigot.</b> Three sizes of spigot viz. 3. 2, 2. 2 and 1. 5 mm and three sizes of vortex finder viz. 7. 00, 5. 5 and 3. 00 mm were used. Hydrocyclone rig was operated at five different pressures viz. 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 psi in conjunction with various combinations of vortex finder <b>and</b> <b>spigot.</b> Laser light scattering technique was used for particle size analysis of O/F (Overflow) and U/F (Underflow) products. Separation {{efficiency of}} the hydrocyclone, for various combinations of Vortex Finder, <b>Spigot</b> <b>and</b> operating pressure, was determined for two size fractions, i. e. less than ten micron and less than twenty micron, present in O/F and U/F products. From the results {{it was concluded that}} the best separation efficiency of 2 inch hydrocyclone is achieved by using the vortex finder of 7. 0 mm size <b>and</b> <b>spigot</b> of 1. 5 mm size. It was also concluded that the separation efficiency of the hydrocyclone decreases by increasing the pressure...|$|R
