25|$|According to GM, the Cruze's body {{structure}} is 65percent high-strength steel. MacPherson struts are utilized {{in the front}} suspension with a solid torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> for the rear, avoiding the cost and complexity needed for a modern multi-link independent rear suspension used by some more expensive rivals.|$|E
25|$|The chassis was a widened and {{reinforced}} Healey Silverstone box-section ladder-type steel frame. Independent front suspension, also Healey Silverstone, was by coil springs, trailing link, and a sway bar. The rear suspension featured Nash's rear end and coil springs replaced the Silverstoneâ€™s leaf springs, while the <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> was located by Panhard rod.|$|E
25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted torsion {{bars for}} the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used torsion bars in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double wishbones. Rear Toronado suspension was a simple <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} radius rod to control wheel movement).|$|E
50|$|The chassis was 6x6, {{with three}} live <b>beam</b> <b>axles,</b> adapted and {{strengthened}} for {{conditions in the}} USSR. It had a reinforced ladder frame with three live <b>beam</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on semi elliptical leaf springs, the rear tandem on quarter elliptical leaf springs with locating arms.|$|R
50|$|Multi link {{suspension}} (suspension) is fitted between the chassis {{and both the}} front and rear <b>beam</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The chassis had <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> {{front and}} rear and {{suspension}} by half elliptic leaf springs and hydraulic dampers. The brakes used a Lockheed hydraulic system.|$|R
25|$|In 2005 the Matiz {{received}} substantial modifications (M200), previewed by the Chevrolet M3X {{concept car}} shown at 2004 Paris Motor Show. The upper body was significantly revised based again on a design from Italdesign Giugiaro, the S-Tec engines were updated and the car's drag coefficient was lowered, resulting in better fuel economy. The interior was also significantly revised, one notable {{feature of this}} car being its centre-mounted instrument cluster. The platform was also revised, with a twist-beam rear suspension system replacing the previous 3-link <b>beam</b> <b>axle,</b> and the front suspension making use of cast, rather than pressed and fabricated, lower control arms.|$|E
25|$|Vista V50 is {{significant}} because it's {{one of the first}} fruits of Toyota's company-wide platform renewal efforts known as the MC. Studies for new front-wheel drive (FWD) platform and packaging layout began in 1993 and appeared on market in February 1997 in the Toyota Prius, but the Vista is the first mass-production, FWD Toyota with a new platform. Toyota claims this is the first true redesign and re-think of its FWD platforms since the 1982 Camry/Vista. With this platform, Toyota trades rear MacPherson Struts for a torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> setup. A double-wishbone setup is available for all-wheel drive. Toyota also flipped the engine orientation so that the intake manifold is in front, improving space efficiency.|$|E
500|$|The chassis {{was based}} on a pressed steel ladder frame with channel-section side members and {{fabricated}} and tubular cross members. Suspension was by semi-elliptic leaf springs and Watson Stabilator dampers front and rear, with a tubular <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> at the front and a live axle and radius rods at the rear. The standard wheelbase was , [...] with a wheelbase of [...] available for seven-passenger bodies. The front and rear tracks were both [...] wide. Center-locking wire wheels with 5" [...] x 33" [...] tires were used front and rear.|$|E
50|$|The {{ladder frame}} had a 21 ft {{wheelbase}} with two banjo style live <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> on leaf springs. Brakes were full air, the tires were 12.00x20.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} configuration {{followed the}} conventions of the time, using rigid <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> and semi-elliptic leaf springs. Braking operated on all four wheels using a cable linkage.|$|R
50|$|The US6 had {{a ladder}} frame with three <b>beam</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on semi {{elliptical}} leaf springs, the rear tandem on quarter elliptical leaf springs with locating arms.|$|R
2500|$|The body's {{sheet metal}} panel gaps were kept to [...] {{and all but}} the roof panel were {{galvanized}} steel. 46% of the Kalos' underlying structural components were produced with high-strength steel, with tailor-welded blanks used {{in the production of}} the vehicle to put strength where needed while saving weight. The front suspension used MacPherson struts with offset coil springs and a stabilizer bar, while the rear featured a semi-independent torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In September 1984 the new Fronte CB71 was introduced. Now {{only with}} the F5A {{four-stroke}} engine, it retained the suspension of the SS40 model (leaf sprung, <b>beam</b> <b>axle).</b> The Fronte was now a full five-door hatchback, on a wheelbase extended to [...] Only the 543cc F5A engine was available, with the power output back up to [...] at 6000rpm. The most expensive model, the FG, received front disc brakes (the lesser versions making do with drums all around) and a 5-speed manual transmission or 2-speed automatic. As before, the Fronte received higher gearing than the Alto, reflecting its intended usage. Top speed was , 2 more km/h than the Alto.|$|E
50|$|Magna {{was fitted}} {{with either a}} {{five-speed}} manual or a four-speed ELC automatic transmission with electronic control and overdrive (a button on the shift lever providing the ability to switch between the default three-speed mode or overdrive four-speed). The Executive and luxury Elite models, however, were available only in automatic. In terms of suspension, Magna's front comprised MacPherson struts front design and, at the rear, a three-link torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> with coil springs (specifically, a torsion <b>beam</b> <b>axle,</b> located by two trailing arms and a Panhard rod). The wagons ran a four-link <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> with coil springs.|$|E
25|$|Model T {{suspension}} {{employed a}} transversely mounted semi-elliptical spring {{for each of}} the front and rear <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} system uses Land Rover Discovery <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> front and rear. The front axles are located by radius rods and a Panhard rod. The rear axle is located by trailing arms and Watt's linkage.|$|R
5000|$|Brake {{front end}} type {{is very similar}} to that of the [...] "Amilcar". All Aurea front I <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> contain a casting of the Aurea {{radiator}} badge insignia at front centre (between I beam top and bottom web).|$|R

50|$|The W07 had a {{contemporary}} boxed chassis suspended by semi-elliptic leaf springs onto <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> front and rear. Dimensions would vary with coachwork, but the chassis had a wheelbase of 3750 mm and a front track {{equal to the}} rear track of 1500 mm.|$|R
2500|$|The M1 had {{a ladder}} frame with three live <b>beam</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms. All models had a [...] wheelbase. The M1 weighed , the -A1 [...] Brakes were full air, the tires were 11.00x20 with dual rear tires.|$|R
5000|$|All FMTV {{models are}} fitted with Meritor <b>beam</b> <b>axles,</b> the ratings and {{specifications}} {{of which have}} also evolved as the FMTV has developed. Suspension is {{by a combination of}} parabolic tapered leaf springs (inverted on the MTV rear bogie), shock-absorbers, and an anti-roll bar for the rear axle/bogie; ...|$|R
50|$|A {{live axle}} {{is a type}} of <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> in which the shaft (or shafts, since live axles, while {{connected}} to move as a single unit, are seldom one piece) also transmits power to the wheels; a <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> that does not also transmit power is sometimes called a dead axle. While typically used in vehicles with Hotchkiss drive, this suspension system can also be used with other types of power transmission.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} the <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> is its simplicity. This simplicity makes it very space-efficient and relatively cheap to manufacture. They are nearly universally used in buses and heavy-duty trucks. Most light and medium duty pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans also use a <b>beam</b> <b>axle,</b> {{at least in the}} rear. Beam axles have an important advantage for off-road applications, as they provide better vehicle articulation and durability in a high load environment.|$|E
5000|$|The 4wd F150 {{continued}} {{the use of}} the Dana 44 Twin-Traction <b>Beam</b> <b>axle</b> from the 80-91 trucks, and the Ford 8.8" [...] Rear Straight axle. The 4wd F250 carried the Dana 50 Twin Traction <b>Beam</b> <b>axle,</b> the Sterling 10.25 from the previous generation for the rear; full float on heavy duty 3/4 ton trucks and the 4wd F350 used the Dana 60 Straight Axle front, and the Sterling 10.25" [...] rear Straight axle.|$|E
50|$|A {{ladder frame}} with three live <b>beam</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms. Brakes on the M39 and M809 were {{air over hydraulic}} with drum brakes on all wheels, M939s were full air. Many trucks were available with a front-mounted 20,000 lb capacity winch.|$|R
50|$|The M1 had {{a ladder}} frame with three live <b>beam</b> <b>axles,</b> the front on leaf springs, the rear tandem on leaf springs with {{locating}} arms. All models had a 181 in wheelbase. The M1 weighed 27,330 lb, the -A1 31,200 lb. Brakes were full air, the tires were 11.00x20 with dual rear tires.|$|R
5000|$|The 1937 car had a 1525 cc {{overhead}} camshaft, four-cylinder engine. The car had {{a separate}} chassis that was conventional using <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> and semi-elliptic leaf springs all round and hydraulic brakes. The wheels {{were of the}} pressed steel type. The car was available as a standard saloon, Super saloon (from 1938) or drophead coupe.|$|R
5000|$|MacPherson struts {{are used}} in {{suspension}} at all four corners {{with the exception of}} the Sienna, which uses a rear <b>beam</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|E
50|$|With a <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> the {{camber angle}} between the wheels {{is the same}} no matter where {{it is in the}} travel of the suspension.|$|E
50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Mk3 Transit in 1986 came the next generation of the County 4x4. This would prove to be a very popular and successful version of the County Transit 4x4, and the last to use the Dana <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> layout. Later County 4x4 models switched to using an independent front suspension setup which was inherently more complex in design than the earlier <b>beam</b> <b>axle</b> models. Later panel vans also lost the twin-wheel rear axle that had been fitted on earlier LWB versions.|$|E
50|$|A {{ladder frame}} had two live <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> on leaf springs with a 155 in wheelbase. There was a 15,000 lb winch {{behind the front}} bumper and a pintle hitch at the rear. A {{civilian}} type closed cab was used, right behind the cab was an open cargo box used to carry engineer tools, outboard motors, and other equipment.|$|R
50|$|A <b>beam</b> <b>axle's</b> {{fore and}} aft {{location}} is constrained by either: trailing arms, semi-trailing arms, radius rods, or leaf springs. The lateral location is constrained by either: a Panhard rod, a Scott Russell linkage or a Watt's linkage. While shock absorbers and either leaf springs, coil springs, or air bags are used to control vertical movement.|$|R
5000|$|The EH had {{a ladder}} frame with two <b>beam</b> <b>axles</b> on leaf springs. The {{military}} models had two wheelbases, the [...] short for tractors and the [...] long for straight trucks. The variant EHUS had a shorter wheelbase at 132 in. They {{were used as}} fuel servicing trucks in the US Navy or as wreckers for the USMC. Bus chassis had a [...] wheelbase.|$|R
