5|$|The {{situation}} <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> tense {{with each}} of the sides making threats and refusing to meet with each other. Maga threatened that the north would secede if his victory was not validated, and Apithy threatened that his base of Porto-Novo would join with Nigeria. Ethnic tensions increased with these threats and with mass migration of people back to their traditional ethnic territories. Many inside the country considered Dahomey to be close to civil war.|$|E
5|$|Tournaments and hastiludes {{began in}} the 11th century as both a sport and to provide {{training}} for battle. Usually taking {{the form of a}} melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons of war. The sport of jousting grew out of the tournament and, by the 15th century, the art of tilting <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> sophisticated. In the process, the pageantry and specialization became less war-like, perhaps because of the knight's changing role in war.|$|E

5|$|Foreign comics, {{especially}} Japanese, <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> {{successful in}} Canada, and stood out for gaining {{large numbers of}} female fans, who had traditionally stayed away from comic books. They also had a significant influence on artists such as Bryan Lee O'Malley and his Scott Pilgrim series. Due to differing social norms, the content of these comics are sometimes censored or ran afoul of Canadian customs officials. Incidental nudity could be interpreted by them as child pornography and result in jail terms.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|However, the two missionaries, who {{had become}} just as much explorers as they were missionaries, <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> {{interested}} in Kilimanjaro, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition {{to the land of}} the Jagga, a people now known as the Chaga, who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based. Despite this, Krapf actually did not accompany Rebmann on the journey, so only Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on April 27, 1848.|$|E

5|$|June 12, 1899, {{was the day}} of the Gollmar Brothers Circus, {{which drew}} {{hundreds}} of visitors in addition to the town's 1,800 inhabitants. Around 3:00p.m., clouds began to build, and the sky <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> dark. As the circus ended for the day around 4:30 PM, a heavy rain, with some hail, began to fall. The rain let up around 5:00 PM, and people began to head home for the day. By 6:00 PM, the streets of New Richmond were full of tourists, travelers and residents.|$|E
5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft caught sight of the ships, and by then it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Račić {{signed a}} mutual {{cooperation}} agreement against the occupation {{forces with the}} commander of the Podrinje Partisans, Nebojša Jerković. Due to its lack of action against the Germans and puppet government, the Jadar Chetnik Detachment <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> isolated. Their leadership realised that the Partisans were getting stronger with each success against the occupiers, and the Chetnik position was becoming relatively weaker due to their inaction. Misita's decision to attack Loznica was a consequence of the cooperation agreement Račić signed with the Partisans.|$|E

5|$|The {{consumption}} of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations {{was so great}} in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it {{became one of the}} more serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public.|$|E
5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> active. His high-school debate coach, a history teacher who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the enactment of the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the enactment of this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{many more}} Arabians came to Australia, though most {{were used to}} produce {{crossbred}} horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses {{and some of them}} <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren {{showed his}} first {{paintings}} publicly in The Hague, {{where they were}} exhibited from April to May 1917 at the Kunstzaal Pictura. In December 1919, he was accepted as a select member to the Haagse Kunstkring, an exclusive society of writers and painters who met weekly on the premises of the Ridderzaal. He painted the tame roe deer belonging to Princess Juliana in his studio at The Hague, opposite the Royal Palace Huis ten Bosch. He made many sketches and drawings of the deer, and painted Hertje (The fawn) in 1921, which <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> popular in the Netherlands. He undertook numerous journeys to Belgium, France, Italy, and England, and acquired {{a name for himself}} as a talented portraitist. He earned stately fees through commissions from English and American socialites who spent their winter vacations on the Côte d'Azur. His clients were impressed by his understanding of the 17th-century techniques of the Dutch masters. Throughout his life, van Meegeren signed his own paintings with his own signature.|$|E
5|$|Baronial castles were {{of varying}} size and sophistication; some were classed as a caput, or the key stronghold {{of a given}} lord, and were usually larger and better {{fortified}} than the norm and usually held the local baronial honorial courts. The king continued to exercise the right to occupy and use any castle in the kingdom in response to external threats, in those cases he would staff the occupied castles with his own men; the king also retained the right to authorise {{the construction of new}} castles through the issuing of licenses to crenellate. It was possible for bishops to build or control castles, such as the important Devizes Castle linked to the Bishop of Salisbury, although this practice was challenged on occasion. In the 12th century the practice of castle-guards emerged in England and Wales, under which lands were assigned to local lords on condition that the recipient provided a certain number of knights or sergeants for the defence of a named castle. In some cases, such as at Dover, this arrangement <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> sophisticated with particular castle towers being named after particular families owing castle-guard duty.|$|E

5|$|The Mesolithic {{lasted from}} 9000 BCE (rapid climate warming) to 5500 BCE (arrival of first farmers from the Danube River area). It {{was the last}} period when the food {{production}} economy was entirely opportunistic, based on assimilation {{of plant and animal}} material found in nature, that is gathering and hunting. Because of warmer temperatures, complex forest ecosystems and wetlands developed and this natural diversity necessitated new hunting and fishing strategies. As new populations entered Poland from the west, hunters and fishermen working individually or in small groups had to pursue single large and small animals using traps, javelins, bows and arrows, boats and fishing equipment, and utilizing dogs. Women engaged in gathering of such products as roots, herbs, nuts, bird eggs, mollusks, fruit or honey, which possibly was even more important than hunting. Mesolithic human settlements <b>became</b> <b>quite</b> numerous {{and by the end of}} this period the economy of harvesting nature became very highly developed. Tools and devices were made of materials such as stone (flint strip mines have been found at the northern edge of Świętokrzyskie Mountains), bone, wood, horn, or plant material for rope and baskets, and included such fine utensils as fishing hooks and sewing needles. Animal figurines were made of amber. At least during the later Mesolithic, the dead were placed in graves and outfitted with familiar objects of their surroundings. One such well preserved grave of an apparent tool-maker, together with his tools and other items, was found in Janisławice near Skierniewice and dated 5500 BCE.|$|E
