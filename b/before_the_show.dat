5|$|Breeders {{would choose}} {{potential}} exhibition ducks from among newly hatched ducklings in March and April, {{and they would}} be given a great deal of extra attention. They would be fed a carefully controlled diet to get them to the maximum weight, and would be allowed out for a few hours each day to keep them in as good a physical condition as possible. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> their legs and feet would be washed, their bills trimmed with a knife and sandpapered smooth, and their feathers brushed with linseed oil. While most breeders would give the ducks a healthy meal <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> to calm them, some breeders would force-feed the ducks with sausage or worms, to get them to as heavy a weight as possible. Exhibition standards judged an Aylesbury duck primarily on size, shape and colour. This encouraged the breeding of larger ducks, with pronounced exaggerated keels, and loose baggy skin. By the beginning of the 20thcentury the Aylesbury duck had diverged into two separate strains, one bred for appearance and one for meat.|$|E

5|$|Director Michael Mayer {{heard the}} album and {{expressed}} an interest in adapting it for the stage. When he approached the band regarding a collaboration, they agreed to work with him. The band also gave Mayer a wide latitude for his adaptation after seeing his earlier work in Spring Awakening. Though additional songs were included from the Green Day catalog, Mayer added very little dialogue to the show. He felt instead that the music and lyrics were expressive enough on their own, and even removed some of the dialogue {{that was part of the}} Berkeley production <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> moved to Broadway.|$|E

5|$|The song {{appears in}} The Acoustic Album (2006). It was {{performed}} in 2006 by the New England octogenarian chorus group Young@Heart. The group's performance was led by former chorus member Fred Knittle, who suffered from congestive heart failure and breathed with assistance from an oxygen tank. The performance was originally planned to be a duet between Knittle and Bob Salvini, another former chorus member, but Salvini died shortly <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Knittle performed it as a solo, {{as a tribute to}} his friend. The performance was initially recorded for a British documentary that aired on Channel 4; footage of the performance was uploaded to YouTube in November 2006 to positive response.

5|$|They {{were met}} by nearly 400 Insane Clown Posse fans {{standing}} outside {{in front of the}} TRL studio window, all with signs supporting the duo. Thirty minutes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched to remove all the fans from the sidewalk. When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted.

MTV later informed Island Records that the heads of the network must choose the band first before it can become eligible to be featured on TRL.|$|E

5|$|According to Lloyd, OC ReMix {{has grown}} {{steadily}} over the years, {{in terms of}} both visitors and submissions. Influxes of new visitors happened whenever a piece about the site was published on a news site such as Slashdot and Electronic Gaming Monthly. The site has been covered by sites such as Electronic Gaming Monthly, G4techTV, PC Gamer magazine, 1UP.com, Game Informer, Ars Technica, Minnesota Public Radio, Hyper magazine, and others. OC ReMix does not advertise or market itself, though OverClocked ReMix makes appearances at fan conventions; its first was Otakon 2006 in Baltimore, Maryland. In April 2008, Lloyd and Oji joined Six Apart's Anil Dash, MetaFilter's Matt Haughey, Reddit's Alexis Ohanian and FARK.com's Drew Curtis for a panel discussion on virtual communities at Internet meme convention, ROFLCon, co-sponsored by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

5|$|As a {{response}} to the cancellation, fans created online petitions, called Netflix, and tweeted #RenewSense8 and other hashtags, in an attempt to bring back the show. On June 8, 2017, the show's social media accounts acknowledged the fans' efforts, and wrote that Netflix looked into the renewal of Sense8 a second time, however they concluded it wasn't possible. Smith released a letter to the fans reiterating the reason for the cancellation was low viewership, and explaining that the reason he rallied them to voice their support <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> was officially cancelled, was that once that happens, there is no going back. He praised Netflix for their support while making the show, and thanked the fans for putting up a great fight to keep it alive. On June 10, 2017, Chief Content Officer of Netflix Ted Sarandos during his talk on Produced By Conference, explicitly commented the show was cancelled because its audience, despite being very passionate, wasn't large enough to support the high production costs to travel and film around the globe.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} match, Fuerza Guerrera was {{designated}} {{the captain of}} the rudo team while Heavy Metal served as {{the captain of the}} tecnico team. To win the match, a team would either pin or force the captain to submit, or pin both of the other team members. The two captains started off the match fighting each other before Rey Misterio Jr. and Psicosis quickly took over. Under the Lucha Libre rules, a tag team partner can enter the ring when the other wrestler tags out or leaves the ring, unlike normal tag team rules. At one point, Rey Misterio Jr. threw Psicosis to the outside; Psicosis then ran away from ringside to avoid falling victim to a diving attack from his opponent. Moments later, Madonna's Boyfriend entered the ring and used his superior size to throw Rey Misterio Jr. around before Latin Lover took over for him. After about 10 more minutes of wrestling, Heavy Metal missed a dive, which Fuerza Guerrera took advantage of by locking in an arm submission hold that quickly caused Heavy Metal to tap out. In Lucha Libre, submissions quickly end the first or second fall, but in this case, the end came off so quickly that the announcers questioned if this had turned into a best-of-three falls match. This was one clear example of how plans had changed from three falls to one right <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b>|$|E

5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E
5|$|On the August 23 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Orton spoke about his match against Lesnar and {{declared}} that he and Lesnar would cross paths again, before Bray Wyatt interrupted him therefore resuming their feud. The following week, Orton accepted Wyatt's challenge for a match at Backlash. At Backlash, Orton was attacked backstage by Wyatt <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> and subsequently lost the scheduled match by forfeit. It was later revealed that Orton was not cleared to wrestle at the event due to a legitimate concussion that occurred the previous month at SummerSlam. Orton later battled Lesnar again at a house show in Chicago in a no disqualification match, but lost once more. Orton resumed his feud with Wyatt and faced off against him at No Mercy, a match he lost due to a distraction by the returning Luke Harper. On the October 11 episode of Smackdown, Orton was paired with Kane in a tag team match against Wyatt and Harper, but once again lost the match due to distraction by Harper. On the October 25 episode of SmackDown, Orton interfered on Wyatt's behalf in his match with Kane, leading to speculation that he had joined the Wyatt Family, though this was neither confirmed nor denied by WWE or Orton. On the November 1 episode of SmackDown, Wyatt and Harper helped Orton win his match against Kane, thus confirming Orton's alliance with the group, turning heel in the process {{for the first time}} since 2014.|$|E
