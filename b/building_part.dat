40|$|At present, {{the green}} {{building}} and housing industrialization are two mainstream directions {{in the real}} estate industry. The production of green <b>building</b> <b>parts</b> which combines green building and housing industrialization, two concepts, is to be vigorously developed. The key of quality assurance in the assembly project is choosing reliable and proper green <b>building</b> <b>parts</b> suppliers. This paper analyzes the inherent requirements of the green building, combined with the characteristics of the housing industrialization, and puts forward an evaluation index system of supplier selection for green <b>building</b> <b>parts,</b> which includes product index, enterprise index, green development index, and cooperation ability index. To reduce the influence of subjective factors, the improved method which merges Kent index method and catastrophe theory is applied to the green <b>building</b> <b>parts</b> supplier selection and evaluation. This paper takes the selection of the unit bathroom suppliers as an example, uses the improved model to calculate and analyze the data of each supplier, and finally selects the optimal supplier. With combination of the Kent index and the catastrophe theory, the result shows that it can effectively reduce the subjectivity of the evaluation and provide a basis for the selection of the green <b>building</b> <b>parts</b> suppliers...|$|R

25|$|These {{biological}} chemicals {{can arise}} from {{a host of}} means, {{but there are two}} common classes: (a) moisture induced growth of mold colonies and (b) natural substances released into the air such as animal dander and plant pollen. Mold is always associated with moisture, and its growth can be inhibited by keeping humidity levels below 50%. Moisture buildup inside buildings may arise from water penetrating compromised areas of the building envelope or skin, from plumbing leaks, from condensation due to improper ventilation, or from ground moisture penetrating a <b>building</b> <b>part.</b> Even something as simple as drying clothes indoors on radiators can increase the risk of exposure to (amongst other things) Aspergillus - a highly dangerous mould that can be fatal for asthma sufferers and the elderly. In areas where cellulosic materials (paper and wood, including drywall) become moist and fail to dry within 48 hours, mold mildew can propagate and release allergenic spores into the air.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} {{takes the}} form of a simple cross. Hewn from a single block of granite quarried from Haytor on Dartmoor, it stands just to the west of the cathedral, in alignment with the altar. The cross stands on a granite plinth, which itself sits on three steps. It was unveiled by Edward, Prince of Wales on 16 May 1921. After archaeological excavations took place in the 1970s, the area was remodelled to create a processional way between the memorial and the cathedral. The memorial is a grade II* listed <b>building,</b> <b>part</b> of a [...] "national collection" [...] of Lutyens' war memorials. Since 2015, all of Lutyens' memorials in England have been protected by listed building status.|$|E
500|$|While a {{computer}} science student at Purdue University, Daniel Lawrence wrote several hobbyist computer {{games for the}} university's PDP-11 RSTS/E mainframe computer, and one grew into Telengard.

He had been influenced by the pen and paper Dungeons & Dragons. At college, he ported the game to Purdue's PDP-11 RSTS/E.

500|$|One of Greenway's finest works, St James' {{is listed}} on the Register of the National estate. [...] It has been called an [...] "architectural gem" [...] and was {{featured}} by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures. From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian Australian ten-dollar note among other Greenway buildings. [...] In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp, one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate {{the opening of the}} Sydney Opera House. The Old Supreme Court Building next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's [...] "masterpiece" [...] Hyde Park Barracks, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public <b>building,</b> <b>part</b> of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building. Separated from the Mint by the present-day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House, Sydney, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament.|$|E
500|$|In the English Civil War, {{the town}} changed hands several times, and in 1645 {{the bridge was}} seized by Royalist {{soldiers}} from Raglan in a failed attempt to retake the town from the Parliamentarian forces under Colonel Kyrle. Kissack describes the engagement as [...] "the most resolute Royalist attack made (on) Monmouth", which saw eight of Kyrle's opponents killed and five captured. By 1705, the bridge and gatehouse required maintenance: the original battlements were replaced with solid walls, and the building was refitted to form a two-storey dwelling house with timber and lath extensions projecting over the river. The house was then leased to a resident gatekeeper, responsible for repairing and maintaining the <b>building.</b> <b>Part</b> of the gatehouse remained in use as a lock-up. Such multiple uses were not uncommon; the archaeologist C. J. Bond recorded that [...] "gates often included chambers {{which could be used}} for lock-ups, chapels or meeting rooms". Both the bridge and the gatehouse were again repaired between 1771 and 1775. The bill for repairs included the cost of 100 gallons of ale for the workmen employed. Trade continued to be central to the importance of the bridge. The Monmouthshire writer and artist Fred Hando records that, on a single Saturday in the early 18th century, [...] "500 horses each carrying five bushels of corn entered by way of the Monnow gate".|$|E
