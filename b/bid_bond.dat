The government {{was to provide}} the materials; but the contractor was to prepare the site and build the dam. The dam was described in minute detail, covering 100pages of text and 76drawings. A $2million <b>bid</b> <b>bond</b> was to accompany each bid; the winner would have to post a $5million performance bond.

50|$|A <b>bid</b> <b>bond</b> {{guarantees}} that the “obligee” {{will be paid}} {{the difference between the}} principal's tender price and the next closest tender price. This action is only triggered should the principal be awarded the contract but fails to enter into the contract, as agreed, with the obligee. The <b>bid</b> <b>bond</b> penalty is generally ten percent of the bidder's tender price.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>bid</b> <b>bond</b> of amount {{not above}} 10% of the {{contract}} order total amount is deposited when a contractor, {{also known as the}} “supplier" [...] or [...] "principal", is bidding on a tendered contract. The <b>bid</b> <b>bond</b> prequalifies the principal and provides the necessary security to the owner (or general contractor), also known as the “obligee”. This helps to avoid frivolous bids and guarantees that the principal will enter into the contract if it is awarded.|$|E
50|$|Contractors {{prefer the}} use of <b>bid</b> <b>bonds</b> because they are a less {{expensive}} option {{and they do not}} tie up cash or bank credit lines during the bidding process. Owners and general contractors also use <b>bid</b> <b>bonds</b> because they establish and confirm that the bidding contractor or supplier is qualified to undertake the project.|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} state {{corruption}} and political connections have strong effects on municipal bond sales and underwriting. Higher state corruption {{is associated with}} greater credit risk and higher bond yields. Corrupt states can eliminate the corruption yield penalty by purchasing credit enhancements. Underwriting fees were significantly higher during an era when underwriters made political contributions to win underwriting business. This pay-to-play underwriting fee premium exists only for negotiated <b>bid</b> <b>bonds</b> where underwriting business can be allocated {{on the basis of}} political favoritism.

40|$|We exploit unique {{features}} of the U. S. municipal bond underwriting market to assess how political integrity affects primary financial market outcomes. We show that state corruption and political connections have strong effects on several aspects of municipal bond sales and underwriting. Specifically, we find that higher state corruption is associated with greater credit risk, higher bond yields, greater use of external credit enhancement, and use of lower quality underwriters. This corruption effect is over-and-above other state financial and economic characteristics. States that are more corrupt can eliminate the corruption yield penalty by purchasing credit enhancements, effectively selling integrity-related default risk to an independent financial intermediary. Underwriting fees do not vary with cross-state corruption, but were significantly higher during an era when underwriters routinely made political campaign contributions to win underwriting business. Furthermore, this pay-to-play underwriting fee premium exists only for negotiated <b>bid</b> <b>bonds</b> where underwriting business can be allocated {{on the basis of}} political favoritism. Overall, our results show a strong impact of state corruption and political connections on economic and financial outcomes. (JEL D 73, G 20, G 22, G 24...|$|R
5000|$|A job {{requiring}} a payment and performance bond will usually require a <b>bid</b> <b>bond,</b> to bid the job. [...] When {{the job is}} awarded to the winning bid, a payment and performance bond will then be required as a security to the job completion. For example, a contractor may cause a performance bond to be issued {{in favor of a}} client for whom the contractor is constructing a building. If the contractor fails to construct the building according to the specifications laid out by the contract (most often due to the bankruptcy of the contractor), the client is guaranteed compensation for any monetary loss up to the amount of the performance bond.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{lawsuit was}} filed in March 2015, which cites defamation, fraud, false imprisonment, and {{violation}} of right to name or likeness. [...] According to the contractor, {{he began working}} on remodeling the client's’ house in July 2013. In September of that year, a building inspector flagged a framing issue, requiring an engineering proposal. The contractor alleged the clients moved into the home {{in spite of the}} fact that the repair had not been made, and then, in October 2013, stopped payment and ultimately canceled his contract. [...] Instead of receiving a check for a new client, he was instead met with the hosts as well as a [...] "bouncer" [...] that prevented him from leaving the premises. It goes on to further allege that Adam promised that by signing a release, there would be no further repercussions (along with a $10,000 payout for appearing on the show). However, that <b>bid</b> <b>bond</b> was revised by the homeowners just days later, and he was instead [...] "painted in an unfairly negative light" [...] and labeled as a [...] "criminal" [...] by hosts and clients.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{a recent}} methodology {{based on the}} variation of the 10 years <b>bond</b> <b>bid</b> yields of several Eurozone countries, in a small interval of time following a macroeconomic announcement from 4 different countries or from the Eurozone, {{in order to determine}} several things: Are foreign announcements important in terms of explaining the bond variations?

Are “good” news capable of explaining more of the variation of the bonds than “bad” news? These are all relevant questions to ask as the announcement sources and country bond combinations present in this dissertation are often ignored by the literature. This dissertation find that for this sample, announcements from the USA are the ones with the most explanatory power, explaining on average 8. 7 %, of the daily variation, furthermore we also find that Eurozone announcements have close to none explanatory power on the daily variation of the 10 years <b>bond</b> <b>bid</b> yields, lastly we find that “good” news have a greater explanatory power then “bad” news...|$|R

The trial court directed a verdict for the plaintiff. Held, reversed with directions to enter judgment for defendant. The defendant surety offered two defenses to the action on the bond contract: (1) An offer may be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted; and (2) Even if the offer was accepted, mistake vitiated the contract.
