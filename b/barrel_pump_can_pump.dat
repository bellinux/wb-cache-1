A model is developed based on system mass and energy balances coupled with kinetic equations to ascertain mixture conditions at each state point in the loop, as well as mass flow rate, minimum work input, and minimum endothermic reactor volume according to defined reservoir temperatures and desired heat load. Assuming that a pervaporation process is employed in both reaction systems to achieve the requisite mixture compositions for sustained operation, the simulations show that the chemical heat <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> 5 Wof power with endothermic reactor volumes of as little as 60 â€“ 93 cm 3, depending on the selected chemical reaction.

40|$|The {{expectations}} for {{heat transfer fluid}} (HTF) system safety and reliability are continuing to increase. The challenges are many.

In addition, one type of sealless <b>pump,</b> the <b>canned</b> motor <b>pump,</b> raises the thermal efficiency of HTF systems. Waste heat from the drive motors of most pumps is dissipated to the air. A shaft driven fan wastes additional energy to accomplish this heat transfer.

Although {{there have been}} {{significant}} progresses in microfluidic components and control devices such as fluidic diodes, switches, resonators and digital-to-analog converters, the ultimate power source still depends on bulky off-chip components, which are expensive and cannot be easily miniaturized.

In this work, we report two key active components actuated by osmotic mechanism for total integrated microfluidic system. For the proof of concept, we have demonstrated valve actuation, which can maintain stable ON/OFF switching operations under 125 kPa back pressure. We have also implemented an osmotic <b>pump,</b> which <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> a high flow rate over 30 ÂµL/min for longer than 30 minutes.

40|$|The double-stage bubble pump, using {{thermal energy}} as driving force to {{transport}} the solution, can replace the mechanical solution pump in the double-effect lithium bromide absorption chiller. By building a bench, a lot of experimental research and analysis were conducted with water and different concentrations of lithium bromide solution as the working fluid of the bubble pump. The first-stage bubble pump in the experiment pumps up by the external heat source. The heat for driving the second-stage bubble pump is provided by refrigerant steam produced from the first-stage bubble pump. The experiment data shows that the heating of refrigerant vapor {{is only one of}} the elements of pump-up phenomenon. Another is that the intermediate solution flashes to vapor to become bubbles. The pump-up phenomenon of double-stage bubble pump has much to do with the pressure difference of intermediate solution and first-stage refrigerant vapor. With water as the working fluid, when the pressure difference between refrigerant vapor and the intermediate liquefied refrigerant is 3. 5 - 3. 9 kPa, the bubble <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> up and run for some time and the start-up time decreases with the driving head. When the working fluid is lithium bromide solution, the pressure difference of the double-stage bubble pump increases with the solution concentration and is bigger than that of water. The start-up time increases with the concentrations of lithium bromide solution within the range of 45. 5 to 54 % and decreases within the range of 54 - 59. 5 %. The start-up time is largest at 54 % under this experimental condition. The experimental result is also compared with the single-stage bubble pump. The start-up time of double-stage bubble pump decreases with the driving height, which is contrary to the single-stage bubble pump...|$|R

40|$|LectureAs the {{pressure}} in older oil wells decrease over time, water injection services are becoming more prevalent on offshore platforms. Water injection is used to maintain {{the pressure}} in the wells and displace the oil from the reservoir, which improves the output and can {{extend the life of}} the formation. Formation pressures are normally high and require equal or higher pressure to force the water in. These applications are typically handled by high speed, high pressure <b>barrel</b> <b>pumps</b> that <b>can</b> see frequent start/stop cycles. The high peripheral speed and unique operation procedures for these services is a severe duty for any mechanical seal. The seawater process fluid also presents a difficult challenge due to its marginal lubrication properties. Conventional flat face technology results in very high temperatures at the seal faces, which can cause vaporization, thermal distortion and excessive face wear. These effects can be minimized by controlling the amount of heat generated as well as how the components of the seal react to increased temperature. Other specific operating conditions of water injection services must be accounted for as well. These requirements can be met by implementing a strong design evaluation including Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) as well as a test program that accurately represents the conditions in the field...|$|R

50|$|The above {{explanation}} {{is merely a}} simple introduction to vacuum pumping, and is not representative of {{the entire range of}} pumps in use. Many variations of the positive displacement pump have been developed, and many other pump designs rely on fundamentally different principles. Momentum transfer pumps, which bear some similarities to dynamic pumps used at higher pressures, can achieve much higher quality vacuums than positive displacement <b>pumps.</b> Entrapment <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> capture gases in a solid or absorbed state, often with no moving parts, no seals and no vibration.

5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, diaphragm pumps are used for metering. Diaphragm pumps have a diaphragm through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the pump head so that liquid enters through an inlet check valve during decompression and exits through an outlet check valve during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston <b>pumps.</b> Diaphragm <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. Diaphragm metering pumps are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|R
50|$|Positive {{displacement}} pumps {{are the most}} effective for low vacuums. Momentum transfer pumps in conjunction {{with one or two}} positive {{displacement pumps}} are the most common configuration used to achieve high vacuums. In this configuration the positive displacement pump serves two purposes. First it obtains a rough vacuum in the vessel being evacuated before the momentum transfer <b>pump</b> <b>can</b> be used to obtain the high vacuum, as momentum transfer pumps cannot start pumping at atmospheric pressures. Second the positive displacement pump backs up the momentum transfer pump by evacuating to low vacuum the accumulation of displaced molecules in the high vacuum <b>pump.</b> Entrapment <b>pumps</b> <b>can</b> be added to reach ultrahigh vacuums, but they require periodic regeneration of the surfaces that trap air molecules or ions. Due to this requirement their available operational time can be unacceptably short in low and high vacuums, thus limiting their use to ultrahigh vacuums. Pumps also differ in details like manufacturing tolerances, sealing material, pressure, flow, admission or no admission of oil vapor, service intervals, reliability, tolerance to dust, tolerance to chemicals, tolerance to liquids and vibration.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} provide {{adequate}} stability to vessels at sea, ballast is used to weigh the ship down and lower its centre of gravity. International agreements under the Safety Of Life At Sea (SOLAS) Convention require cargo vessels and passenger ships to be constructed so as to withstand certain kinds of damage. The criteria specify the separation of compartments within the vessel and also the subdivision of those compartments. The International agreements rely upon the states which have signed the agreement to implement the regulations within their waters and on vessels which are entitled to fly their flag.The ballast is generally seawater which is pumped into tanks known as ballast tanks. Depending {{on the type of}} vessel, the tanks can be double bottom (extending across the breadth of the vessel), wing tanks (located on the outboard area from keel to deck) or hopper tanks (occupying the upper corner section between hull and main deck). These ballast tanks are connected to <b>pumps</b> which <b>can</b> <b>pump</b> water in or out.
