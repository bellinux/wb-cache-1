5|$|In {{the video}} Rihanna and two friends {{arrive at a}} nightclub in a yellow taxi, and enter a candy store where a boy is {{standing}} with his mother. Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone where they are going, and the singer and her friends sneak into the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.|$|E
25|$|Most Indian {{shopping}} {{happens in}} open markets or numerous small grocery and retail shops. Shoppers typically wait outside the shop, ask {{for what they}} want, and can not pick or examine a product from the shelf. Access to the shelf or product storage area is limited. Once the shopper requests the food staple or household product they are looking for, the shopkeeper goes to the container or shelf or to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> brings it out and offers it for sale to the shopper. Often the shopkeeper may substitute the product, claiming that it is similar or equivalent to the product the consumer is asking for. The product typically has no price label in these small retail shops; all packaged products must display the maximum retail price (MRP) above which the product cannot be sold. It is a criminal offence to sell a product beyond the MRP of a product. The shopkeeper can price the food staple and household products arbitrarily, and two consumers may pay different prices for the same product {{on the same day}} but never will those price be above the maximum retail price. Price is rarely negotiated between the shopper and shopkeeper. The shoppers usually do not have time to examine the product label, and do not have a choice to make an informed decision between competitive products.|$|E
500|$|Hurricane Babe {{produced}} 14 tornadoes between September5 and 7 {{along its}} track in several states. Louisiana recorded the most, with six touchdowns, including one F2 that injured {{one person and}} caused $2.5million (1977USD; $ USD) in damages near Hammond in Tangipahoa Parish. A country store sustained severe damage from the tornado, {{with most of the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> destroyed. Six wood-frame homes were also knocked off their cinder block supports. Another F2 touched down in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama; however, minimal damage was recorded along its [...] track. Another F2 briefly touched down in Harrison County, Mississippi on September6. It struck an unoccupied elementary school, wrecking six classrooms and leaving $500,000 (1977USD; $ USD) in damages. [...] Throughout the storm's path, damages amounted to $10million (1977USD; $ USD) with an additional $3million (1977USD; $ USD) from tornadoes. [...] There was no loss of life due to Babe.|$|E
50|$|Much like Woolco, Big W {{stores were}} found on retail parks around the UK and {{supplied}} goods from the 4 main Kingfisher brands.

However, {{as the years went}} on and many larger stores were either closed or converted, fewer Metropolitan Stores had cafes in them. They served a fairly standard menu of hot and cold drinks, hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, and such other sandwiches as grilled cheese, hot turkey and turkey club sandwiches.|$|R
2500|$|In 2000, Knopfler {{appeared}} on Parkinson on BBC One and explained again where the lyrics originated. According to Knopfler, {{he was in}} New York and stopped by an appliance store. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> they had a wall of TVs which were all tuned to MTV. Knopfler {{said there was a}} man working there dressed in a baseball cap, work boots, and a checkered shirt delivering boxes who was standing next to him watching. As they were standing there watching MTV, Knopfler remembers the man coming up with lines such as [...] "what are those, Hawaiian noises?...that ain't workin'," [...] etc. Knopfler asked for a pen to write some of these lines down and then eventually put those words to music.|$|E
2500|$|The two then fled to {{a nearby}} Walmart, where Jerad fired {{a shot at the}} ceiling and ordered shoppers to leave. Joseph Wilcox, who was {{carrying}} a concealed weapon, drew his weapon and confronted Jerad, but passed Amanda as he did so, not realizing that she was armed and Jerad's accomplice; Amanda shot and killed Wilcox. Police later responded to 9-1-1 calls and arrived at the Walmart, engaging the Millers in a gunfight, during which Amanda was wounded. The Millers moved toward the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> where they tried to protect themselves from gunfire using several items from the store as a barricade. Police eventually shot and killed Jerad, while Amanda shot and critically wounded herself in the head. She was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where she died. Initial reports inaccurately indicated that Amanda shot Jerad repeatedly in the chest after he had [...] "laid down" [...] in front of her, killing him, before committing suicide.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2011 Joplin tornado in which the walls of a Home Depot {{collapsed}} in Joplin after being hit by an EF5 tornado, The Kansas City Star, citing engineers, criticized Home Depot's practice of using tilt-up construction in hundreds of its big-box stores (other nearby big-box stores in Joplin, including a Walmart and Academy Sports, which had concrete block construction, lost their roofs but the walls remained intact). In tilt-up construction the concrete is poured onsite, lifted into place, and then attached to the roof. The engineers told the Star that the practice, while normally safe and efficient, is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted (as happened in Joplin) the walls collapse in a domino effect. [...] Seven people were killed {{in the front of the}} store when the 100,000-pound walls collapsed on them, while 28 people in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> survived when those walls collapsed outward. Only two of the slab walls in the Home Depot survived. In contrast, 3 people died in the Walmart but 200 survived. Engineers noted that when concrete block construction fails, structural elements break in pieces and usually not in huge slabs. [...] Home Depot said it fundamentally disagreed with the engineers quoted by the Star and said it would use tilt-up construction when it rebuilds the Joplin store.|$|E

So I would have to fix the movies when they broke and of course, I ended up watching a lot of movies. Well, I saw these ladies doing Adult Films back then and felt that was a nasty representation of women. I thought to myself that I can do it and do it better than that. That is how I came into the industry.|$|R

50|$|In {{early days}} many Woolworths stores had cafes in them. However, {{as the years}} went on, and many larger stores were either closed or downscaled, fewer stores had cafes in them. When <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> finally ceased trading in 2008/9, only around 10% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> had cafes in them.

60|$|The fracas {{was taking}} place in the garden, behind the living rooms that were at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> that fronted on the street with the proud sign above: AH KIM COMPANY, GENERAL MERCHANDISE. The garden was a {{miniature}} domain, twenty feet square, that somehow cunningly seduced the eye into a sense and seeming of illimitable vastness. There were forests of dwarf pines and oaks, centuries old yet two or three feet in height, and imported at enormous care and expense. A tiny bridge, a pace across, arched over a miniature river that flowed with rapids and cataracts from a miniature lake stocked with myriad-finned, orange-miracled goldfish that in proportion to the lake and landscape were whales. On every side the many windows of the several-storied shack-buildings looked down. In the centre of the garden, on the narrow gravelled walk close beside the lake Ah Kim was noisily receiving his beating.|$|E

6000|$|On Wednesday all was changed. From {{the town}} of Nolan, eight miles away, came a story which put a quite {{different}} light on the matter. Nolan consisted of a school house, a blacksmith's shop, a [...] "store" [...] and a half-dozen dwellings. The store was kept by one Henry Odell, a cousin of the elder May. On {{the afternoon of the}} Sunday of May's disappearance Mr. Odell and four of his neighbors, men of credibility, were sitting in the store smoking and talking. It was a warm day; and both the front and the back door were open. At about three o'clock Charles May, who was well known to three of them, entered at the front door and passed out at the rear. He was without hat or coat. He did not look at them, nor return their greeting, a circumstance which did not surprise, for he was evidently seriously hurt. Above the left eyebrow was a wound--a deep gash from which the blood flowed, covering the whole left side of the face and neck and saturating his light-gray shirt. Oddly enough, the thought uppermost in the minds of all was that he had been fighting and was going to the brook directly at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> to wash himself.|$|E
60|$|I {{began my}} {{business}} career {{on the following}} Monday morning. At breakfast, held earlier than usual on my account, my mother's sympathy was the more eloquent for being unspoken, while my father wore an air of unwonted cheerfulness; charging me, when I departed, to give his kindest remembrances to my Cousin Robert Breck. With a sense of martyrdom somehow deepened by this attitude of my parents I boarded a horse-car and went down town. Early though it was, the narrow streets of the wholesale district reverberated with the rattle of trucks and echoed with the shouts of drivers. The day promised to be scorching. At {{the door of the}} warehouse of Breck and Company I was greeted by the ineffable smell of groceries in which the suggestion of parched coffee prevailed. This is the sharpest remembrance of all, and even to-day that odour affects me somewhat in the manner that the interior of a ship affects a person prone to seasickness. My Cousin Robert, in his well-worn alpaca coat, was already seated at his desk behind the clouded glass partition next the alley at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> and as I entered he gazed at me over his steel-rimmed spectacles with that same disturbing look of clairvoyance I have already mentioned as one of his characteristics. The grey eyes were quizzical, and yet seemed to express a little commiseration.|$|E
60|$|It very {{frequently}} happens that {{one member of}} a committee is the brain, {{and the other members}} form the body of it. It was so in this case. Ezra Graves typified all of prudence there was about it, which, it must be admitted, was a great deal. He it was who had weighed in the balance the fifteen applicants and found them wanting. Another member of the committee was that comfortable Mr. Dodd, with the tuft of yellow beard, the hardware dealer whom we have seen at the baseball game. Mr. Dodd was not a person who had opinions unless they were presented to him from certain sources, and then he had been known to cling to them tenaciously. It is sufficient to add that, when Cynthia Wetherell's name was mentioned to him, he remembered the girl to whom Bob Worthington had paid such marked attentions on the grand stand. He knew literally nothing else about Cynthia. Judge Graves, apparently, knew all about her; this was sufficient, at that time, for Mr. Dodd; he was sick and tired of the whole affair, and if, by the grace of heaven, an applicant had been sent who conformed with Judge Graves's multitude of requirements, he was devoutly thankful. The other member, Mr. Hill, was a feed and lumber dealer, and not a very good one, for he was always in difficulties; certain scholarly attainments were attributed to him, and therefore he had been put on the committee. They met in Mr. Dodd's little office <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> and in five minutes Cynthia was a schoolmistress, subject to examination by Mr. Errol.|$|E
