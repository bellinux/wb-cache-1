5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> to influence them.|$|E
5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a neutron bomb directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter and seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E

25|$|On December 3, 2010, Russian court sentenced Sergei Demchenko, a Latvian businessman, {{to three}} years of imprisonment. He earlier made a plea bargain with Russian Prosecution Service so the trial was with no contest. Amongst those {{publicly}} known to be arrested {{in relation to the}} hijack, Demchenko appears to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who was {{not a member of the}} boarding group. Circumstances around Demchenko's trial are rather vague.

25|$|On July 17, 2016, Gavin Eugene Long shot six police {{officers}} in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, {{in the wake of}} the shooting of Alton Sterling. Three died and three were hospitalized, one critically; of the officers who died, two were members of the Baton Rouge Police Department, while the third worked for the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office. Long, who associated himself with organizations linked to black separatism and the sovereign citizen movement, was shot and killed by a SWAT officer during a shootout with police at the scene. Police arrested and questioned two other suspects, but Long was confirmed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> involved in the shooting.|$|E
25|$|A {{demolition}} team {{is about}} to bring down a building when one worker is drawn to an area not marked on the blueprints. Inside the area they find a path to the building's foundation, and in the darkness, a boy (Spencer List). The boy is taken to a children's hospital and the Fringe division is contacted. The construction workers examined where the boy was found and determined it had been sealed off for seventy years and could not determine how the boy got inside. The boy does not speak, and Walter Bishop (John Noble) explains some of his medical conditions {{as a result of}} living underground for several years. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> that the boy reacts to, and she helps to coax him to help in his treatment. At one point, she encourages him to eat by sharing candy with him, but he only places the yellow pieces {{in the form of an}} arrow for her.|$|E

Many other observers were around [...] away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations.

500|$|Feynman {{was working}} in the {{computing}} room when he was informed that Arline was dying. He borrowed Fuchs' car and drove to Albuquerque where he sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would screen out the harmful ultraviolet radiation. On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary [...] "purple splotch" [...] afterimage of the event.|$|E

500|$|Carey plays a fictionalized {{version of}} himself. Drew is an {{assistant}} director of personnel at the Winfred-Lauder department store. Carey explained [...] "I wanted a white-collar job with no authority and a bad boss. Someone {{to do all the}} work and get no credit. He could've worked in a bank, in insurance." [...] Carey said it was [...] "a no-brainer" [...] on settling on the character, saying [...] "It's just me." [...] While Christa Miller was trying out for the role of Drew's close friend Kate O'Brien, ABC thought she might be too inexperienced for the role and they asked to see her appearance in the Seinfeld episode [...] "The Doodle". The episode had yet to be aired and Miller had to beg the show's co-creator Larry David for a rough cut to show to ABC. Miller went on to secure the role of Kate and Helford considered her to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> right for the role.|$|E
500|$|At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer {{is eating}} doughnuts. One of them splatters onto the nuclear reactor core's {{temperature}} dial, which is nearing the red zone. Homer fails {{to see the}} warning and the plant approaches a nuclear meltdown. He seems to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who can stop it, though he has no skills and cannot remember any of his training (due to being distracted and occupied with a Rubik's Cube at the time). In desperation, he chooses a button at random with a counting rhyme, which miraculously averts the meltdown. Springfield is saved and Homer is hailed as a hero. Mr. Burns names Homer [...] "Employee of the Month". Homer's family is also proud of him, especially Lisa, who starts {{to see him as}} a role model. Meanwhile, Homer himself is troubled by the fact that his so-called heroism was nothing but luck, and his gloomy mood deepens when he receives a congratulatory phone call from Magic Johnson, who tells Homer [...] "People like that are eventually exposed as the frauds they are".|$|E
500|$|James Montogomery from MTV commented: [...] " [...] all pulsing sirens, wobbly {{bass and}} four-on-the-floor beat, with an {{expansive}} electro chorus {{that sounds like}} a truckload of Nintendo Entertainment Systems exploding in unison (only sexier)." [...] Frase McAlpine from BBC gave the song three out five stars and said: [...] "I can't <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> in the world who is slightly disappointed that this song isn't a jaunty '80 syn-disco rave up, in which Madge skips around in a big pink wig, like she used to in the olden days." [...] He went on to add that [...] "Celebration" [...] is a decent dance track for Madonna to play on her tours. Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media complimented the song, calling it [...] "personality-driven pop" [...] in which Madonna has never sounded more convincing. Deusner added that the track sounds like [...] "it's conjuring several of Madonna's younger selves" [...] in its modest goal to just make people move. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph said that the song is infinitely forgettable. Popjustice named the song one of the best 100 singles of 2009. Louis Virtel of The Backlot included the song at number sixty-five on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs," [...] referring to the track as a [...] "rollicking dance jam" [...] that is a [...] "perfect companion piece to [...] other testament to celebration, Holiday.” At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination in the Best Dance Recording category.|$|E

500|$|In {{an early}} promotional interview, Nas {{claimed that the}} name [...] "Illmatic" [...] (meaning [...] "beyond ill" [...] or [...] "the ultimate") was a {{reference}} to his incarcerated Queensbridge friend, Illmatic Ice. Nas later described the title name as [...] "supreme ill. It's as ill as ill gets. That shit is a science of everything ill." [...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic. In a 1994 interview for The Source, which dubbed him [...] "the second coming", Nas spoke highly of the album, saying that [...] "this feels like a big project that's gonna affect the world [...] We in here on the down low [...] doing something for the world. That's how it feels, that's what it is. For all the ones that think it's all about some ruff shit, talkin' about guns all the time, but no science behind it, we gonna bring it to them like this." [...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but even then I thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big."

2500|$|The {{play was}} {{eventually}} adapted {{for a film}} released in February 1990, with screenplay and direction by Stoppard.

It just seemed that I'd <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>person</b> who could treat the play with the necessary disrespect."
