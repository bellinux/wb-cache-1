2500|$|The Gulfstream II is a twin-jet {{swept wing}} {{corporate}} transport powered by two Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engines {{and designed to}} provide high speed and long range capability without sacrificing the airport performance, reliability, and other operational advantages of its predecessor, the turboprop Gulfstream I. Preliminary design of the wing was influenced by both cruise and low speed considerations. The aft-mounted engine location was selected after extensive analysis and design iterations considering aerodynamic, structural, and ground clearance requirements. Airfoil geometry was developed to maximum sweep benefit from the selected planform. [...] The interference problem at the wing-body juncture was treated by modification of the airfoil shape and thickness over the inner third of the wing span. The basic airfoils for the main area of the wing {{are similar to those}} of the Grumman A-6 Intruder aircraft and utilize NACA 6-series thickness distributions combined with an in-house mean line. A <b>buffet</b> <b>boundary</b> commensurate with the M=.85 speed capability was attained by incorporating a row of co-rotating vortex generators on the outer wing panel. In developing the wing contours, attention was paid to the aircraft's low speed requirements by tailoring the leading edge radius to preclude leading edge separation. The high lift configuration, consists of a one piece, single-slotted Fowler flap of 30% chord. [...] Stall initiation on the basic wing was found to occur at midspan but spread rapidly to the tip, particularly at large flap deflections. The addition of an upper surface fence at about midspan provided a strong pitch down at the stall, without sacrificing maximum lift, and also afforded an adequate margin between initial and tip stall.|$|E

The effects of leading-edge chord-extensions and several pylon-mounted underwing external stores were investigated. Analysis of the measurements indicated that the standard deviation of the wing bending moment was a qualitative indication of buffeting intensity. Quantitative application of the measurements was lbited by model response in vibration modes having no counterpart in flight and by possible effects of model structural damping. The addition of leading-edge chord-extensions caused practically no change in the <b>buffet</b> <b>boundary</b> but caused an appreciable tncrease in model buffeting response at angles of attack well above the <b>buffet</b> <b>boundary.</b> The addition of any of the external stores caused only small changes in model buffeting response at positive angles of attack but caused notice-able increases in response at negative angles of attack. This comparison might be influenced by the effect of store mass on the frequency and shape of the model vibration modes.

Potential advantages of the Augmentor-Wing are considered and the testing of three high-speed models in a trisonic pressurized wind tunnel (possessing a two-dimensional transonic insert) is discussed.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the KC- 135 Winglet Flight Research and Demonstration Program was to obtain experimental flight test data to verify the theoretical and wind tunnel winglet aerodynamic performance prediction methods. Good agreement between analytic, wind tunnel and flight test performance was obtained when the known differences between the tests and analyses were accounted for. The flight test measured fuel mileage improvements for a 0. 78 Mach number was 3. 1 percent at 8 x 10 (5) pounds W/delta and 5. 5 percent at 1. 05 x 10 (6) pounds W/delta. Correcting the flight measured data for surface pressure differences between wind tunnel and flight resulted in a fuel mileage improvement of 4. 4 percent at 8 x 10 (5) pounds W/delta and 7. 2 percent at 1. 05 x 10 (6) pounds W/delta. The performance improvement obtained was within the wind tunnel test data obtained from two different wind tunnel models.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{positive effects}} of ground proximity on the aerodynamic performance of a wing or aerofoil have long been established, but at transonic speeds the formation of shock waves between {{the body and the}} ground plane would have significant consequences. A numerical study of the aerodynamics of an RAE 2822 aerofoil section in ground effect flight was conducted at freestream Mach numbers from 0 · 5 to 0 · 9, at a range of ground clearances and angles of incidence. It was found that in general the aerofoil 2 ̆ 7 s lifting capability was still improved with decreasing ground clearance up until the point at which a lower surface shock wave formed (most commonly at the lowest clearances). The critical Mach number for the section was reached considerably earlier in ground effect than it would be in freest ream, and the <b>buffet</b> <b>boundary</b> was therefore also reached at an earlier stage. The flowfields observed were relatively sensitive to changes in any given variable, and the lower surface shock had a destabilizing effect on the pitching characteristics of the wing, indicating that sudden changes in both altii 11 de and attitude would be experienced during sustained transonic flight close to the ground plane. Since ground proximity hastens the lower surface shock formation, no gain in aerodynamic efficiency can be gained by flying in ground effect once that shock is present...|$|E

40|$|Different {{devices for}} the {{application}} of shock and boundary layer control on transportation aircraft wings have been investigated on 2 -d airfoils and on a swept wing model. A cavity in the surface underneath the foot of the shock covered with a perforated plate reduces shock strength and hence wave drag, but viscous drag increases such that a net drag reduction can not be achieved in most cases. The application of additional boundary layer suction reduces the additional viscous drag, but not enough to result in a significant gain in total drag. On the contrary a contour bump underneath the shock, applied alone or in combination with suction, reduces very effectively wave drag without increasing viscous drag so that under off-design conditions up to 24 % total drag reduction has been measured for a 2 -d airfoil and somewhat lower values for the swept wing. This effect has been well predicted by numerical methods. Both devices, especially the perforation, have a positive influence on the <b>buffet</b> <b>boundary.</b> Trailing edge devices such as conventional and Gurney-type flaps also effect wave drag by redistributing the pressure on the wing or airfoil. Combining them with a contour bump has been investigated numerically.

The airplanes are the X- 5 (590 wing sweep), XF- 92 A, YF- 102 with cambered wing, YF- 102 with symmetrical wing, D- 558 -ii, X- 3, and X-LE. The effects {{of some of}} the basic configuration differences on the lift and drag characteristics are demonstrated.

No such relationship was found between the drag-rise Mach number and its normally related parameters. A comparison of flight and wind-tunnel data shows a generally reasonable agreement, but Reynolds number differences can cause considerable variations in the drag levels of the flight and wind-tunnel tests. Maximum lift-drag ratios vary widely in the subsonic region as would be expected from differences in aspect ratio and wing thickness ratio; however, the variations diminish as the Mach number is increased through the transonic region.

40|$|During {{conceptual}} design a problem arises when predicting the <b>buffet</b> onset <b>boundary.</b> Due {{to the pressure}} on payload-range and cruise altitude capability, improvement on the <b>buffet</b> onset <b>boundary</b> is often of great importance. It {{is one of the}} primary constraints in establishing the low and transonic speed performance capabilities of transport aircraft. Buffeting, a high-frequency instability caused by airflow separation or shock wave oscillation, {{can be seen as a}} random forced vibration. Depending on the angle of attack and freestream velocity, the separations in the flow can result in an aerodynamic excitation. The main motivation for this thesis research is to create a more advanced but fast transonic buffet onset prediction tool to permit greater design freedom during the {{conceptual design}} phase. This implies this tool should be faster than conventional tools, it should be reliable and able to deal with unconventional configurations. In addition, it should be built in a modular way so it is easy to use, alter and replace parts of the tool. The transonic buffet prediction tool was demonstrated using the Fokker 100 wing-fuselage combination test case. A modular transonic buffet onset prediction tool was successfully developed by combing a Vortex-Lattice method, 2 -dimensional Euler code, a critical pressure rise separation criterion and the Matrix-V code program. It is approximately 90 % faster with respect to the use of only the Matrix-V code and it is reliable in the region left of the coffin corner at high CL and low Mach number combinations. The expected error in the regime which can be correctly predicted by this tool is in the order of 0. 05 With respect to further use of this tool, it is most interesting to see how this transonic buffet prediction tool behaves when less conventional wing geometries such as a flying wing, blended wing body, or Prandtl plane are tested.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation of buffet flows using various turbulence models, including linear and non-linear low-Re eddy-viscosity models (EVM). The {{accuracy of the}} models is assessed against experimental data for transonic flows around the NACA- 0012 aerofoil. The study shows that non-linear two-equation models in conjunction with functional cμ coefficient for the calculation of the eddy-viscosity (henceforth labelled NL-cμ), provide satisfactory results for transonic buffet flows. The computations also reveal that the Spalart–Allmaras one-equation model provides comparable results to the NL-cμ models, while larger inaccuracies are introduced by linear and non-linear models based on constant cμ coefficient. Moreover, the <b>buffet</b> onset <b>boundaries</b> are similarly predicted by the one-equation and NL-cμ models.

40|$|Existing {{aerodynamic}} design {{methods have}} generally {{concentrated on the}} optimization of airfoil or wing shapes to produce a minimum drag while satisfying some basic constraints such as lift, pitching moment, or thickness. Since the minimization of drag almost always precludes the existence of separated flow, the evaluation and validation of these design methods for their robustness and accuracy when separated flow is present has not been aggressively pursued. However, two new applications for these design tools {{may be expected to}} include separated flow and the issues of aerodynamic design with this feature must be addressed. The first application of the aerodynamic design tools is the design of airfoils or wings to provide an optimal performance over a wide range of flight conditions (multipoint design). While the definition of 'optimal performance' in the multipoint setting is currently being hashed out, it is recognized that given a wide enough range of flight conditions, it will not be possible to ensure a minimum drag constraint at all conditions, and in fact some amount of separated flow (presumably small) may have to be allowed at the more demanding flight conditions. Thus a multipoint design method must be tolerant of the existence of separated flow and may include some controls upon its extent. The second application is in the design of wings with extended high speed <b>buffet</b> <b>boundaries</b> of their flight envelopes. Buffet occurs on a wing when regions of flow separation have grown to the extent that their time varying pressures induce possible destructive effects upon the wing structure or adversely effect either the aircraft controllability or the passenger comfort. A conservative approach to the expansion of the <b>buffet</b> flight <b>boundary</b> is to simply expand the flight envelope of nonseparated flow under the assumption that buffet will also thus be alleviated. However, having the ability to design a wing with separated flow and thus to control the location, extent, and severity of the separated flow regions may allow aircraft manufacturers to gain an advantage in the early design stages of an aircraft, when configuration changes are relatively inexpensive to make. Continuing the work begun last year, an airfoil design package has been modified to provide some control over the existence and extent of flow separation. This package consists of a 2 -D Navier-Stokes flow solver which is coupled to the CDISC (constrained direct/iterative surface curvature) design method. The first modification is a prediction method for determining whether separation is likely based solely upon a given pressure distribution. If separation is predicted but is undesirable, the new routines will modify the pressure distribution to alleviate the problem. This new pressure distribution is then used in the design method to generate a new aerodynamic shape. Since separation may be acceptable in some cases, particularly if the separation does not extend to the trailing edge, another added logic estimates the extent of separation based upon a correlation with calculated separated flow cases. If the flow behind a shock induced separation is not predicted to reattach before the trailing edge, the logic weakens the shock strength and otherwise alters the pressure distribution in order to promote reattachment. This later addition is as yet unreliable due to secondary separation effects, but additional work is being pursued to improve the method...|$|R

This latter stability boundary is identified as a jump phenomenon.

In view of the above factors, symmetric 13; supercritical airfoils which are shock-free at a design free stream Mach number and lift coefficient would be beneficial for application in combat aircraft and helicopter rotors. This paper describes the design and detailed off-design characteristics of two symmetric supercritical airfoils. The off design performance of these airfoils, one derived 13; from a NACA 0012 baseline and operating at free stream 13; Mach number M= 0. 752 and incidence a= 1. 1 xB 0;, and the 13; other from NACA 0007 and operating at M= 0. 78 and 13; a=l. 50, have been compared with baseline airfoils. 13; The comparisons which are in terms of drag rise and <b>buffet</b> onset <b>boundaries</b> 'indicate that the lifting symmetric supercritical airfoils thus obtained are superior to the baseline airfoils...|$|R
40|$|A code {{based on}} the cell-centered {{explicit}} finite volume method with Runge-Kutta time 13; stepping scheme and acceleration techniques like local time-stepping, implicit residual 13; smoothing and multigrid {{has been used to}} estimate the. shock-induced buffet onset of 13; NACA 0012 airfoil. Such methods are basically meant to compute steady flows. The flow, 13; with shock-induced oscillations isc;'totally unsteady phenomenon and its detailed study 13; must be made using time-accurate computations. However, if the purpose is just to 13; estimate the shock-induced buffet onset, like the information that the aerodynamic design 13; engineer may desire to get, it may be enough to estimate the <b>buffet</b> onset <b>boundary</b> 13; without getting into the details of its time-accurate nature. This estimation is obtained in a far too lesser computational time as the code is highly accelerated. Estimate of an 13; important aerodynamic parameter such as this, obtained so quickly, is of great help to the 13; aerodynamic engineer. The justification to use a steady state code to compute an 13; unsteady flow phenomenon is that a basically unsteady flow will remain unsteady and its nature is not altered by using steady state method.

40|$|Shock wave/boundary layer {{interactions}} arising in the {{transonic flow}} over airfoils are studied numerically using {{different levels of}} turbulence modeling. The simulations employ standard URANS models suitable for aerodynamics and hybrid RANS-LES methods. The use of a compressibility correction for one-equation closures is also considered. First, the intermittent shock-induced separation occurring over a supercritical airfoil at an angle of attack close to the <b>buffet</b> onset <b>boundary</b> is investigated. After a set of URANS computations, a scale-resolving simulation is performed using the best statistical approach {{in the context of}} a Delayed Detached-Eddy Simulation (DDES). The analysis of the flow topology and of the statistical wall-pressure distributions and velocity fields show that the main features of the self-sustained shock-wave oscillation are predicted by the simulations. The DDES also captures secondary flow fluctuations which are not predicted by URANS. An examination of the unsteady RANS-LES interface shows that the DDES successfully prevents modeled-stress depletion whether the flow is attached or separated. The gray area issue and its impact on the results are also addressed. The conclusions from the supercritical airfoil simulations are then applied to the numerical study of a laminar transonic profile. Following a preliminary characterization of the airfoil aerodynamics, the effect of the boundary layer transition location on the properties of two selected shock wave/boundary layer interaction regimes is assessed. In transonic buffet conditions, the simulations indicate a strong dependence of the shock-wave motion amplitude and of the global flow unsteadiness on the tripping location...|$|R
40|$|A {{water flow}} loop {{facility}} is designed, built and commissioned {{to investigate the}} effects of flow unsteadiness on the mean and turbulent characteristics of smooth and rough wall channel flows. Measurements of flow and turbulence are made by means of non-intrusive measurement techniques such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). The main objective of these investigations is to advance our understanding on the behaviour of turbulence under transient conditions. The unsteady flows considered, consist of an excursion of flow rate from an initial turbulent state to another over smooth or rough surfaces. A systematic study of turbulence under various initial and final conditions reveals novel insights into the turbulence dynamics of unsteady flows. It is shown that the unsteady flows behave strikingly similar to the so-called boundary layer bypass transition due to free-stream-turbulence. Consistent with the direct numerical simulations (DNS) of He and Seddighi (J. Fluid Mech., 715 : 60 - 102), the process begins with the elongation of streaks much similar to the Klebanoff modes in the <b>buffeted</b> laminar <b>boundary</b> layer in a bypass transition. During the second stage, the formation and propagation of the isolated turbulent spots eventually lead to a complete breakdown of the organised streaky structures resulting in a new turbulent flow corresponding to the final Reynolds number. The present investigation covers a range of initial and final Reynolds numbers over smooth and rough surfaces to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in transient flows. The mean velocity profiles obtained from various unsteady cases are shown to correlate with each other during the pre-transition regime, coinciding with the Stokes solution for unsteady laminar boundary layer flows. The fluctuating velocity profiles are also correlated with each other during this period. The response of the perturbing wall-normal fluctuating velocity is shown to mark the onset of transition, providing a good measure {{for the duration of}} the pre-transition phase. It is shown that an equivalent critical Reynolds number can be defined to express the duration of the pre-transition regime in unsteady flows. The critical Reynolds number is shown to have a power-law relationship with the initial free-stream turbulence intensity levels. The unsteady rough flows investigated herein encompass a hydrodynamically smooth initial flow that is increased to either a transitionally or fully rough final state. The measurements of the fluctuating streamwise velocities in the wall region reveal a similar transition-like behaviour to the smooth-wall flows. It is shown that the particular roughness pattern investigated herein causes a significant decrease in the duration of the pre-transition regime, promoting an early transition. For relatively high intensity levels, an inner-scaled non-dimensional time correlates the period of the pre-transition regime. In addition to the experimental investigations, numerical simulations are performed to assess the applicability and robustness of various turbulence models under unsteady conditions. For this purpose, performance of a number of low-Reynolds number turbulence models is evaluated against DNS data. All models are applied to an unsteady flow comprising a ramp-type excursion of flow rate inside a channel. The flow rate is increased linearly with time from an initial Reynolds number of Re_ 0 = 9, 308 (based on hydraulic diameter and bulk velocity) to a final Reynolds number of Re_ 1 = 29, 650. The acceleration rate is varied to cover low, intermediate and high accelerations. It is shown that among the models investigated, the k−e models of Launder and Sharma (Lett. Heat Mass Transfer, 1 (2), 131 - 137) and Chang et al. (J. Fluids Eng., Trans. ASME, 117 (3) : 417 - 423) and gamma-Re of Langtry and Menter (AIAA Journal, 47 (12) : 2894 - 2906) capture well the key flow features of these unsteady turbulent flows. These three models yield predictions of wall shear stress that agree well with the corresponding DNS data, though for the case of high acceleration, the model of Chang et al. exhibits instabilities...|$|R
