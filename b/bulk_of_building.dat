6000|$|It {{was drawing}} on to sundown when I met a stout, dark, sour-looking woman coming trudging down a hill; and she, when I had put my usual question, turned sharp about, {{accompanied}} {{me back to}} the summit she had just left, and pointed to a great <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> standing very bare upon a green {{in the bottom of the}} next valley. The country was pleasant round about, running in low hills, pleasantly watered and wooded, and the crops, to my eyes, wonderfully good; but the house itself appeared to be a kind of ruin; no road led up to it; no smoke arose from any of the chimneys; nor was there any semblance of a garden. My heart sank. [...] "That!" [...] I cried.|$|E
60|$|I {{sometimes}} fancy {{that every}} great city {{must have been}} built by night. At least, it is only at night that every part of a great city is great. All architecture is great architecture after sunset; perhaps architecture is really a nocturnal art, like the art of fireworks. At least, I think many people of those nobler trades that work by night (journalists, policemen, burglars, coffee-stall keepers, and such mistaken enthusiasts as refuse to go home till morning) must often have stood admiring some black <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> with a crown of battlements or a crest of spires and then burst into tears at daybreak to discover {{that it was only}} a haberdasher's shop with huge gold letters across the face of it.|$|E
40|$|Many countries, {{especially}} in the developing world, {{did not meet the}} UN target of 2002 to achieve sustainable development because the issue of existing buildings which form the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>building</b> stock were not adequately addressed. This paper did a literature review on how existing buildings could be sustained through improvement as against maintenance and rebuild; it revealed that the maintenance of unsustainable buildings could at best be returned to their unsustainable original standard at construction, while rebuild is costlier and less environmental friendly. Improvement is noted to be cheaper and more environmental friendly than rebuild, and will also reduce maintenance cost. The paper also reviewed some improvement models that can be applied for elimination of perceived waste and inefficiencies in existing buildings for sustainability...|$|E
5000|$|The abbey was disestablished in 1799 {{during the}} French Revolution, {{and within a}} few decades the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> its <b>buildings</b> had been demolished.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> was {{demolished}} in November 2009. [...] Behind the preserved facade was {{a convenience}} store, {{associated with a}} petrol station, next door.|$|R
5000|$|Steyr has a {{district}} heating system which supplies the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> and industry with renewable energy. The thermal energy {{comes from the}} biomass heating plant Steyr.|$|R
50|$|The {{local school}} system {{maintains}} {{an elementary school}} in the village, but the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> making up the campus are clustered {{on the east side}} of Craftsbury Common.|$|R
5000|$|The {{redevelopment}} is {{in progress}} and includes the demolition of four story wing <b>of</b> original 1960's <b>building.</b> The 13 storey tower which forms the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> is being refurbished and will return {{as part of the}} redevelopment.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> in the {{district}} {{were built in the}} 1880s. These are typically two-story late Victorian brick commercial structures. Many of these have original upper facades, but store entrance levels have been remodeled. A last group <b>of</b> <b>buildings</b> in {{the district}} were built in the very early 1900s.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> in the {{district}} were built between 1880 and 1930 as the city grew in stature. Sustained by the railroads, coal and mining, Evanston's central business district reflected the area's prosperity. A later oil boom brought further development.|$|R
25|$|The majestic Stalinallee in Berlin, also {{completed}} in 1961, was conceived in 1952, and didn't {{have too much}} to lose: the scale and <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> these <b>buildings</b> are definitely Stalinist, but the modest finishes are similar to Jugendstil and Prussian Neoclassicism. The street would later be extended in an International Style idiom and renamed Karl-Marx-Allee.|$|R
50|$|The Hurt Building was {{constructed}} during a turbulent economic period between 1913 and 1926 that {{was marred by}} four recessions as well as World War I, which delayed {{the construction of the}} wings and light court <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> until 1924. Nonetheless, the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> was completed in 1913, with a courtyard and the entry rotunda pushing the final completion to 1926.|$|R
5|$|Willsmere {{was finally}} closed in December 1988 and {{sold by the}} Government of Victoria in the late 1980s. An {{extensive}} conservation analysis was completed in 1988 that recommended the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the original <b>buildings</b> be conserved.|$|R
50|$|The present Equitable Building was {{completed}} in 1915 on the same plot, and was designed by Ernest R. Graham & Associates. The massive <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the newer <b>building</b> was a major impetus behind the city's 1916 Zoning Resolution.|$|R
50|$|Residential {{development}} {{was produced by}} the Institute Hiprobud in the 1963. Saltivka's panel residential buildings are typically {{in the form of}} 9, 12 and 16 floors, and rarely, 5-floor buildings. Separate high-rise buildings were constructed from 1967 and construction on the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> in Saltiva began in the 1970s. The most recent constructions (in 1984-1993), built up areas of northern Saltivka streets and the Krasnodar Street.|$|R
5000|$|The Kaleva Temple is {{a two-story}} {{sandstone}} commercial block, essentially rectangular in plan {{but with an}} angled entrance at the east side. [...] The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> is constructed from rough-cut sandstone, with smooth stone trim in the facade. [...] The center of the facade projects slightly, and this projection is surmounted with a cornice cap with pedimented peak, inscribed with the construction completion date of 1910.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicular}} and silhouette viewpoints involve sculptural {{issues of}} mass and profile which directly {{relate to the}} technologically scaled <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> high-rise <b>buildings</b> as a global condition. In this case of the TAC House, the approximate outline <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> {{and the types of}} construction/cladding alternatives were either predetermined by the city planners or actual construction economics. Their design approach couples constructed images of commercial modernism in both its ‘low’ and ‘high’ styles as the basis of a mass modulating collage.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s, three {{specialist}} teaching {{buildings were}} built from designs by architects Gordon and Day. [...] They were St Leonard's Land (Physical Education), Chessel's Land (Visual Arts) and St Mary's Land (Science and Technical). The design <b>of</b> these <b>buildings</b> was representative <b>of</b> 1960s modernist architecture and somewhat out of {{sympathy with the}} surrounding areas of the Old Town. The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> wereon land formerly occupied by the Edinburgh and Leith Brewery and before that by the Old Edinburgh Playhouse.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2016, the {{exterior}} <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> had completed renovations. Black cornices that were removed in prior years were recreated based on period photos. [...] The renovation {{was awarded a}} Lieutenant Governor's Ontario Heritage Award for Excellence in Conservation. A major addition during the renovation was {{the addition of a}} glassed-in rooftop restaurant on the building's north side. While the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> is four stories high, the rooftop restaurant and the hotel tower are on higher levels.|$|R
25|$|The Visalia Town Center Post Office, {{designed}} by Fresno-native architect William D. Coates, {{conforms to the}} standard symmetry used in most post offices of the time, but has unusually sophisticated terracotta detailing in shapes directly derivative of 1920s Art Deco motifs. Decorative dark-brown brick contrasts the light-tan brick used for the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building's</b> walls. The interior ornamentation is lavish, and includes cast aluminum, marble, and a decorative multi-colored terrazzo floor.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} few decades this section of the station was {{extensively}} rebuilt to provide four platforms. The current Metropolitan line layout largely dates from 1925, and the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the surface <b>buildings,</b> designed by architect Charles Walter Clark, also date from this period.|$|R
5000|$|Cannon Industries, {{famous for}} {{producing}} gas and electric cookers, {{was based in}} Coseley from 1861 until the closure of its Havacre Lane factory in 1993. However, the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the factory <b>buildings</b> were retained as Cannon Business Park, a mix of industrial and commercial ventures.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> {{the church}} <b>building</b> {{dates from the}} late 13th century, though there is {{evidence}} of earlier work. The Priory buildings were constructed, at least in part, from stones derived from Hadrian's Wall, including a number of Roman inscriptions that were built into its fabric.|$|R
5000|$|The {{district}} encompasses all of {{the historic}} central business district in Boyne City, {{as well as the}} adjacent Pearl Street residential neighborhood, where many of the community’s industrial and commercial leaders lived {{around the turn of the}} century. The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>buildings</b> were constructed during Boyne City's heyday in 1900-1910. Just 5% were constructed before 1900, and 7% in the 1920s and 1930s. The remainder <b>of</b> the contributing <b>buildings</b> in the district were constructed from World War II up through the early 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} design {{called for a}} more extreme building. This 35 story, 638 foot (194 m) tower would utilize many of the existing caissons of the former U.S. Gypsum <b>Building.</b> The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> would be supported by a 120-foot (37 m) base and 20 large diagonal braces connected {{from the corners of}} the base {{to the bottom of the}} office structure. The effect would have been a nearly symmetrical shape and a building that seemingly looked unstable.|$|R
50|$|In {{the era of}} the {{downtown}} movie palaces, theatres were typically built with a narrow entrance on the main thoroughfare, with a long foyer leading to the auditorium well at the rear. This enabled the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> to be constructed on cheaper land well away from the thoroughfare. Toronto's Loews and Pantages theaters, also designed by Thomas Lamb, were classic examples of this trend, with both theatres having narrow frontages on Yonge Street and auditoriums on a rear side street.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{is considered one}} of the finest Greco-Roman buildings in the Southern Hemisphere. It has an 'A' classification from the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, designating it as a building whose preservation is of the utmost importance. Of particular interest is the interior plasterwork which incorporates Maori details in an amalgamation of Neo-Greek and art-deco styles. Likewise the exterior bas-reliefs depicting 20th-century armed forces and personnel are in a style which mixes Neo-Greek with Art-Deco. The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> is English Portland Stone with detailing in New Zealand granite from the Coromandel.|$|R
50|$|One side of {{the main}} street {{in the village of}} Templepatrick {{consists}} of the 18th Century demesne wall of Castle Upton. An impressive fortified gateway in the wall at the centre of the village leads up to the castle. The core of the main house is a tower house, originally thought {{to be part of a}} Commanderie of the Knights of Saint John (Hospitallers) with walls up to five feet thick, and the main <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> was created in 1611 by Sir Robert Norton and originally known as Castle Norton.|$|R
5000|$|The works took {{advantage}} of the Davis Silos (an abandoned grain silo complex, formerly part of Rosario's port facilities, now moved south). The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> consists <b>of</b> eight large concrete silos, painted in different colors, with a diameter of 7.5 metres. The idea, according to the official site of the museum, was [...] "to integrally preserve the building, exalting the unique features of concrete, stressing austerity as a value." [...] There is a glass elevator outside the building, for a view of the river scenery and the nearby islands.|$|R
60|$|The dark <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> a <b>{{building}}</b> struck their sight at the top, {{and they}} ran to it. Just now Mr. Wrenn {{was ready to}} devour alive any irate householder who might try to turn them out. He found the building to be a ruined stable--the door off the hinges, the desolate thatch falling in. He struck a match and, holding it up, standing straight, the master, all unconscious for once in his deprecating life of the Wrennishness of Mr. Wrenn, he discovered that the thatch above the horse-manger was fairly waterproof.|$|R
25|$|The {{courtyard}} doughnut {{shape is}} critical to the two main design priorities: daylighting and natural ventilation. Natural daylighting was achieved through the shallow floor plate depths and high ceilings allowing for light to penetrate the interior of the offices from both the exterior <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> and the core open-air courtyard. Daylighting models were tested at the University of Washington’s Integrated Design Lab to ensure even lighting and minimizing glare to users working on computers. Within the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building,</b> daylight sensors are on all lighting within 15 feet of the windows and Energy Star equipment is provided to reduce the plug load.|$|R
50|$|A new {{facility}} at Ridge Hill Hospital was officially opened on 18 October 2006 by local MP Ian Pearson. Some {{of the original}} Ridge Hill Hospital buildings are still in use, although others were demolished in 2007 and several are still standing disused. The road link to Wordsley Hospital was severed when the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the Wordsley <b>buildings</b> were demolished in 2007.|$|R
50|$|The New Building is a two-storeyed brick {{building}} with timber verandahs, rendered concrete lintels and a fibro-cement tiled gambrel roof. It has a rectangular plan, with its long axis running east-west, and is sited {{immediately to the}} north <b>of</b> the main <b>building.</b> It has been cut into an escarpment, the result being a reduction <b>of</b> the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> {{in relation to the}} Main Building. It has one storey above ground level to the south, and two storeys above ground level to the north, with unobstructed views over the sports field, Victoria Park and Kelvin Grove. The escarpment has been retained with a brick batter wall.|$|R
50|$|The library {{building}} is a fieldstone structure, roughly divided into three sections. The most prominent section is the crenellated tower, which projects forward and left <b>of</b> the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building,</b> and has three narrow casement windows on the front, staggered in height. To its right, {{in the center of}} the main facade, is an arched entrance bay, topped by an elevated parapet with crenellations and flanked on the right by a narrow casement window and a buttress. To the far right is a section lower in height, also topped with crenellations, dominated by a large many-paned window.|$|R
50|$|Terrace on the Park is {{a banquet}} hall in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The {{building}} was {{constructed by the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey {{to serve as the}} heliport for the 1964 New York World's Fair. It is located to the south of the New York Hall <b>of</b> Science. The <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> the <b>building</b> is suspended in the air by four supports. It has an excellent view of New York City including the Manhattan skyline. The outside walls of the main floor are mostly accessible windows that allow guests a clear view in every direction.|$|R
5000|$|While {{there are}} slight variations, the main <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> its <b>buildings</b> follow a similar theme with a complex {{geometrical}} design featuring {{a mix of}} zinc, perforated zinc, glass and sandstone tiles over a metal exoskeletal frame in a complex geometrical pattern composed entirely of scalene triangles. The aperiodic tiling pattern {{is based on the}} pinwheel tiling developed by John Conway and Charles Radin. The triangle is formed with dimensions 1,2, [...] This [...] "fractal facade" [...] is contrasted with sections featuring use of metal like surfaces including randomly slotted metallic screens and transparent glass walls tinted with a slightly green tinge.|$|R
