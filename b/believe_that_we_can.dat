Argyle took the lead in the first-half from a fine individual goal from Wright-Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail-Smith. Four days later, the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager, with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach. He said: [...] "I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season. I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done. I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that."

As objects of historical inquiry merely, we cannot conceive any questions less interesting than those relating to mechanical operations generally, nor any honors less worthy of prolonged dispute than those which are grounded merely on the invention or amelioration of processes and pigments. The subject can only become historically interesting when the means ascertained to have been employed at any period are considered in their operation upon or procession from the artistical aim of such period, the character of its chosen subjects, and the effects proposed in their treatment upon the national mind.

The purpose with the study is to find out the causes to the moose explosion and what it has led to in today’s forests. A questionnaire has been sent out to sawmills in the region Dalarna with the purpose of finding out if sawmills receive moose-damaged timber and what they think about how they foresee future development. There were two causes of the moose explosion, that had effects on the moose population. The first cause was that the moose hunters wanted to raise the moose population, and by raising the calf shooting and by saving the cows they succeeded. The second cause was changing methods in Swedish forestry. Extensive clear-cuttings led to much more food for the moose and the population grew. The moose ravages in the forests have a large negative effect on the forest. The growth in the stands decline and the number of stems per hectar drop significantly. The moose grazing on pines leads to different types of damages, trunk break, treetop grazing and bark eating. These damages on the pine leads to technical damages which leads to that the price on the log drops. The questionnaire shows that four of five sawmills has not noticed the moose explosion. The fifth sawmill writes that they don’t know. Three out of seven sawmills doesn’t see the moose as a threat. On the question of what they think about the future seven people answered. Four people <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> handle the problem in a good way and that business will continue {{in the same way as}} it has been.
