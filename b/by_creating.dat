5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río.

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> the American Customs Board.

Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes.

5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or <b>by</b> <b>creating</b> money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
