Taking in consideration that lack of irrigation can lead to bone necrosis. When finished, the flap is repositioned and sutured. The alveolar mucosa covering bone should have uniform thickness, density and compressibility to evenly distribute the masticatory forces to the underlying bone.|$|E
30|$|The patient {{underwent}} implant {{therapy in}} stages under general anesthesia with immediate load protocol. Intravenous access was obtained, {{and the patient}} was anesthetized under general anesthesia by our anesthesiologist. Carpules of 2 % lidocaine with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine, 4 % articaine hydrochloride with 1 : 100, 000 epinephrine (Septocaine), and 0.5 % bupivacaine hydrochloride with 1 : 200, 000 epinephrine (Marcaine) were used as needed. For each site, a 15 blade was {{used to make a}} sulcular incision from the mesial to the distal aspect of the tooth. A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated with a periosteal elevator exposing the buccal alveolus. Buccal bone was removed using a surgical fissure bur to allow for osteotomes and elevators to atraumatically elevate and deliver the teeth, while preserving lingual, mesial, and distal walls. Next, a straight elevator was positioned between the alveolus and the root surface. The tooth was elevated, and the periodontal ligament was separated from the alveolus. The tooth was extracted using a no. 150 upper universal forcep. The socket was curetted and irrigated with copious amounts of normal saline solution. A <b>bone</b> <b>file</b> and rongeur were used to smoothen the alveolus.|$|E

2500|$|After {{losing the}} Noons fight via-doctor {{stoppage}} {{due to a}} cut, Diaz had surgery and had the <b>bone</b> <b>filed</b> down on his eyebrows to prevent any bad cuts in future bouts. Diaz came into his next fight at EliteXC's [...] "Return of the KING" [...] event in Honolulu, Hawaii against Muhsin Corbbrey 9 pounds over the weight limit. Diaz earned a tough win over Corbbrey, following the main event an altercation between Nick and his brother Nate broke out with KJ Noons and his corner. EliteXC executives asked Diaz {{to come to the}} ring and make a statement about a possible title rematch with Noons. Noons, a native of Hawaii, asked the crowd their opinion, resulting in an echo of boos for Diaz. After Nick spoke over the microphone to Noons, saying, [...] "don't be scared homie," [...] Karl Noons, KJ's father, lunged at him prompting Nate Diaz to throw a water bottle at Karl. The Diaz brothers were quickly escorted out of the cage by a group of security staff. During interviews the next day Nick claimed Karl was intoxicated and overreacting. Meanwhile, Karl claimed his incident was prompted by the thrown bottle. Video replay of the event showed Nate throwing the bottle after Karl jumped at Nick. No one was injured as the Diaz brothers left the arena entrance [...] "flipping the bird" [...] to the fans and Noons' corner.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Clinical {{medicine}} {{shows that}} the scaffold of artificial human bone must have a certain porosity, good connectivity and adequate mechanical strength. Controlled porosity, pore size, shape and interconnectivity of the scaffold heavily influence the structural strength, transport properties, and the micro-environment for cells and tissue in-growth. In this paper, finite element analysis software was used. A micro-porous unit with mechanical properties similar to the natural bone was produced. Then the interconnected scaffold of tissue with a specific porosity and gradient pore was built according to the optimized micro-porous unit. It was confirmed that the porosity and elastic modulus of the mold were {{within the bounds of}} human bone. Analysis using ADINA 8. 3 ensured that the mold had satisfactory mechanical properties of <b>bone.</b> Finally, STL <b>files</b> were generated by the software and the mold was manufactured using SLS...|$|R

40|$|Aim. Inverted papillomas (IPs), {{although}} histologically benign, are aggressive lesions {{that may}} recur after excision. This study describes the surgical experience of 32 patients with IP of paranasal sinuses treated at our institution, and it recurrence rate after (at least) {{a year of}} follow-up. Methods. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting with IP of paranasal sinuses. Patient charts were reviewed for age, extent of tumor, location(s), follow-up, surgery technique and histopathologic diagnosis. 32 patients comprised {{the focus of this}} study. For all patients it was performed a pre-surgery TC, and for 5 more patients it was necessary to perform a Magnetic Resonance (MR) with gadolinium. Results. Twenty-one open surgeries, 9 endoscopic approach and 4 combined approach (open and endoscopic) were performed for IPs, with a minimum of 1 years’ follow-up. Our results highlighted that the global percentage of success 12 months after the treatment was 93 % and it did not vary according to the tipology of approach used if a radical escission of the lesion is achieved. More in depth, among 32 cases, only 2 patients were found to have recurrences and were treated with coronal and endoscopic approach. Conclusion. It is fundamental to underline that surgery must be carried on in a radical manner to treat these neoplasms that tend to recur. The ideal approach is frequently determined intraoperatively, based on the IP attachment sites. A complete removal of the lesion and <b>bone</b> peripheral border <b>filing</b> are essential to perform a correct and definitive treatment. Also, endoscopic approach can be taken into account when tumors are localised median to a sagittal plan crossing the orbit median wall and when they did not massively compromised paranasal sinus walls...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Case-finding {{strategies}} to identify women with {{high risk for}} osteoporotic fractures have recently been proposed, but little information about such an approach in general practice is known. AIM: To study {{the validity of the}} proposed case-finding strategy for osteoporosis. DESIGN OF STUDY: Survey using case-finding strategy. SETTING: Seven hundred and twelve women aged between 55 and 84 years, randomly selected from a general practice in The Netherlands. METHOD: Of the 712 randomly selected women, 449 women participated. Information was obtained from a questionnaire, direct questioning, and computerised patients <b>files.</b> <b>Bone</b> mineral density of the femoral neck was measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and vertebral morphometry was performed on lateral X-rays of the spine. Osteoporosis was defined by a bone mineral density T-score of less than 2. 5 and/or the presence of severe vertebral deformities. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for the whole set of risk factors; those significantly associated with osteoporosis and in logistic models. RESULTS: Clinical risk factors were present in 55 % of the women and identified 68 % of the women with osteoporosis. Three risk factors [...] a low body mass index, fragility fractures, and severe kyphosis and/or loss of height [...] were associated significantly with osteoporosis; they were present in 33 % of the women and identified 60 % of those with osteoporosis. A logistic model based on age and fragility fractures selected 32 % of the women and identified 76 %. CONCLUSION: No single risk factor could assist in identifying women with osteoporosis. A simplified case-finding strategy using only three risk factors, that is suitable for primary care, reduces the number of women to be evaluated by two-thirds; however, this is at the cost of missing the diagnosis in 40 % of the women with osteoporosis. Addition of spine radiographs to the case-finding approach helped to obtain a better risk profile of the women and had also practical consequences for the management of some. We propose that radiographs should be included in any case-finding strategy...|$|R
30|$|The {{ability to}} {{radiolabel}} hematopoietic cells without interfering with their viability, chemotaxis, or {{ability to differentiate}} is a powerful method to understand the migration of such cells in vivo {{under a variety of}} conditions [16, 17]. Because PET cameras are more efficient than gamma cameras, it is possible to reduce the radioactivity needed to visualize hematopoietic cells in the body thereby causing less damage to the cells. In this study, 89 Zr-oxine BM cell labeling was used to examine the migration of BM cells to an acute tibial injury. Based on the previous extensive 89 Zr-oxine radiotoxicity evaluations on the BM cells [17], 89 Zr-oxine labeling doses were carefully controlled to be within the optimized range to avoid altering viability, proliferation, and more importantly, differentiation function of the cells. 89 Zr was stably retained with the BM cells [17]. Two scenarios were employed: d 1 -fracture in which BM cell transfer preceded the fracture by 1  day and d 0 -fracture in which the fracture preceded the transfer of BM cells. With the d 1 -fracture regimen, we examined the effect of the fracture on the bone marrow cells already distributed to the organs and reached the steady state. The d 0 -fracture regimen, on the other hand, addressed the effect of fracture on the circulating bone marrow cells. In both conditions, 89 Zr-oxine-labeled cells accumulated at the site of tibial injury, peaking by approximately 24  h at 0.7 – 1.7 % of the administered cells. While representing a minority of injected cells, this small number of cells is readily detected on PET imaging (Figs. 1 b, c and 3 a, b) with extremely high signal-to-background SUV ratios (Additional file 1 : Figures S 1 a, b and S 2 a, b). As about 17 % of the transferred cells migrated to the <b>bone</b> marrow (Additional <b>file</b> 1 : Figures S 1 c, d and S 2 c, d), the percentage of cells accumulated at the injury was equivalent to as high as 4 – 10 % of the cells in the bone marrow. After reaching the peak accumulation, the BM cells at the fracture gradually decreased. This is likely because the death of some cells that failed to engraft, even if they migrated to the injury sites. The distribution of the cells to the BM, spleen, and liver, observed within 24  h in both fracture models, was almost identical to that in non-fractured control mice.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Until recently, lithic tool-use {{experiments}} in Australia {{were dominated by}} flaked stone with relatively few studies of ground-stone. This paper reports on a workshop, during which tool-use experiments were designed to document the wear traces associated with grinding various materials, different processing techniques and sandstones of different hardness. The specific variables were selected to build a use-wear and residue reference library applicable to archaeological grinding implements proposed for detailed functional analysis. Materials/Methods: Experimental sandstone grinding implements were used primarily to process organic and inorganic materials, documented ethnographically. Other materials were processed to investigate characteristics of seeds that were unavailable locally. Upper and lower stones were used together to grind seeds and bone; and abrading stones were used to <b>file</b> <b>bone,</b> stone and wood, and to grate haematite. The experimental stones came from five geographic regions in Australia, each associated with the archaeological assemblages proposed for study. Usewear was sampled with polyvinyl siloxane peels, which were examined under a stereomicroscope and a metallographic microscope. Residues were extracted with two solvents (water and a tri-mixture of acetonitrile, ethanol and water), and subsequently mounted on slides and examined under transmitted light microscopy. The slide preparations were stained to highlight constituent plant and animal tissues. Results: The hardness/softness of the sandstone {{and the degree of}} grain cementation have a strong influence on the development and appearance of use-wear. On the hard sandstone, the processing time affected polish formation. Use-wear patterns were distinctive of the broad categories of processed material (seed, bone, stone, haematite and wood). Key use-wear features relating to activity and processed material are reflected in the degree of grain rounding and grain levelling, the presence of macroscopic surface striations and the occurrence of micro-fractures, polish and striations observed at high magnification. Residues included collagen and cellulose fibres, starch granules, phytoliths, resins, bone fragments and pigment crystals. As for use-wear, the residues were also distinctive of the broad categories of processed material. Staining was particularly useful to distinguish plant and animal tissues. Conclusions: The experiments provided insights into the wear formation on sandstones of different hardness and degree of cementation. Stained cellular structures provide a reliable basis for distinguishing the investigated plant and animal tissue subjected to mechanical damage, resulting from grinding and pounding. Studies are underway to further test the viability of residue identification on ethnographic specimens of varying ages, and experimental grinding stones greater than 30 years. The residue and usewear experiments build on previous studies and help form the basis of a systematic and collaborative use-wear and residue reference library for ground-stone tools in Australia. Future experiments will focus on the wider range of plant taxa processed by grinding and documented ethnographically...|$|R
