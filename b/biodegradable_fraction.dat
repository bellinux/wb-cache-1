40|$|AbstractControlling {{the safe}} {{disposal}} of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), especially the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction,</b> {{is an important}} goal of waste management. This study reports the effects of using composting to biostabilize the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of MSW sourced from an Advanced Waste Treatment plant in Australia. The impact of biostabilization on the initial aerobic degradation of the material showed a reduction in oxygen consumption of 30 % (230 g O 2 /kg loss of ignition (LOI)) in immature compost and 45 % (181 g O 2 kg− 1 LOI) in mature compost {{when compared with the}} input material (330 gO 2 /kg LOI). Anaerobic tests showed a reduction in biodegradability of 40 % in the immature compost with biogas production 250 L/kg LOI compared with 50 % in mature compost with biogas production of 218 L/kg LOI. The results confirm that the biostabilization of the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of MSW diverted from landfill can result in a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emission...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the qualification {{of heat and}} electricity produced in plants using waste as a fuel. It also concerns the issues related with the possibilities {{of participation in the}} system of emissions trading. The basis for such considerations is the content of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> in waste, which is treated as “biomass”, based on the definitions set out in relevant legislation. It is necessary to determine content of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> in waste in order to establish the purposes. Two ways of settling share of energy from renewable energy sources were introduced. The first, was based on direct measurement of the share of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> in the tested waste. On the other hand, the second is involved with certain types of waste. Thus, the share of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> is determined by flat-rate value. An applicable auction system does not guarantee the financial support for electricity produced from renewable energy sources, even if it is classified so. A company selling heat to end users is obliged to purchase the heat from renewable energy sources, including thermal treatment plants using municipal waste. The maximum level that the company is obliged to purchase is equal to the customers’ demand. Both the municipal waste incineration and hazardous waste incineration plants are exempted from the obligations provided in the Act on system of emission trading. This applies only to the waste incineration plants, which incinerate only the municipal waste or hazardous waste and the plants which are processing waste, not producing of heat. When an installation uses alternative fuel, it is not automatically excluded from participation in the system of emission trading. For <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of alternative fuel, the emission factor equal to 0 can be used. For the remaining alternative fuels, an emission factor determined on the basis of laboratory tests must be assigned. In order to demonstrate that an alternative fuel contains biomass, it should be analysed through laboratory testing. The energy recovery from the waste containing biodegradable fractions should be carried out maintaining formal and legal requirements for waste incineration...|$|E
40|$|Pollution {{of rivers}} is {{attributed}} to point and non-point sources and marine pollution originates mainly from land-based sources. Therefore {{in order to control}} the quality of the water a few parameters have been chosen as the index for determining the water pollution. Amongst the parameters, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, (BOD) {{is one of the most}} important and frequently used parameters for estimating the level of water pollution. BOD measures the amount of oxygen consumed by microorganism to utilize biodegradable organic matter. The decomposable reaction of the organic depends on nature and temperature of the waste and the ability of the organism in the system to utilize the waste. From a previous study done Chapra (AUTHOR) recommended that BOD to be speciated into two categories, fast BOD and slow BOD where the former BOD would represent the readily <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> and the latter, the slowly <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction.</b> These can be achieving by unfiltered sample and filtered sample. The unfiltered sample are presenting readily <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> while slowly fraction can be obtain by subtracting the unfiltered BOD measurement with filtered BOD measurement. It is believed in the filtered sample, fast BOD reaction occurred.

Modeling and simulation of composting of agro-wastes based on experimentally measured carbon dioxide production would reduce the experimental effort, time, and other physical resources in design of optimized compost process for disposal of agro-waste. In this study modeling and simulation of composting of a mixture of agro-wastes like sugarcane bagasse, soya husk, wood straw, mixed with food waste is presented. This approach requires estimates of initial values of different carbon fractions. The effect of such estimates on prediction of carbon dioxide production is also studied in this work.

This {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} two problems: (1) verification of the bisubstrate concept proposed by Dold, Ekama and Marais (1980), in which the biodegradable component of wastewater consists of readily and slowly biodegradable fractions, and (2) physical separation techniques for estimating the readily <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction.</b> Intensive research, since 1970, into the behaviour of activated sludge systems at the University of Cape Town has culminated {{in the formulation of}} a general kinetic model, by Dold and Marais (1986). The model is highly complex, incorporating a number of different processes; however extensive simulation {{studies have shown that the}} model simulates the behaviour of activated sludge systems very closely. A crucial concept incorporated in the general model is that the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of a wastewater can be subdivided into two fractions with sharply different characteristics (bisubstrate concept), a readily <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> which is directly utilized by the organism mass at a high rate and a slowly <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> which requires to be solubilized extracellularly to readily biodegradable material for subsequent use by [...] the organism. Solubilization is hypothesized to be a relatively slow process. These characteristics were inferred from the oxygen utilization rate response of a system fed in a cyclic square wave fashion. No work has been done to verify if substrates of specific chemical structures can be allocated to one or the other of the fractions. One of the objectives of this {{investigation was}} to check if pure and mixtures of specific selected substrates reflected these fractions when fed to activated sludge systems. Glucose and maize starch were selected as representative of readily biodegradable and slowly biodegradable substrate respectively. Systems were run under steady state and square wave cyclic state with glucose only, starch only and glucose/starch mixtures. From the steady state response the specific yield values could be determined and the reliability of the data checked by doing mass balances on the COD. From the cyclic response the specific rate constants for growth and solubilization respectively could be determined by trial simulation using the general model and specifying the concentrations of readily and slowly biodegradable fractions equal to the stoichiometric concentrations of glucose and starch in the feed. The constants thus determined were compared with the "standard" constants for municipal wastewaters...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} the performance of a conventional and a modified plug-flow digester for scraped dairy cattle manure based on results from 12 -month studies to characterize the performance of each design with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production and utilization. Both are full-scale digesters located on commercial dairy farms. The primary objective of this comparison was to determine if either design approach provides superior performance with respect to waste stabilization and biogas production. The modified plug-flow digester was found to provide a higher reduction in total volatile solids (TVS), 39. 6 versus 29. 7 percent, a higher biogas yield, 3. 08 versus 2. 21 m 3 per cow-day, and higher electricity production, 13, 896 versus 9, 380 kJ per cow-day. However, these differences were found to be directly related to the difference in the readily <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of influent TVS, 47 versus 30 percent and were reflected in the rate of electricity generated, 13, 896 kJ per cow-day from the modified versus 9, 380 kJ per cow-day from the conventional plug-flow digester design. In contrast, specific biogas and methane yields on a kg TVS destroyed basis were essentially the same for both digester designs as was the thermal efficiency of converting biogas to electricity. This comparison suggests that neither design is superior. The observed differences in TVS reduction, biogas yield, and electricity generated appear to be solely a reflection of the difference in the readily <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of influent TVS. This suggests that an estimate of the readily <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of influent TVS is a necessary prerequisite for a reliable prediction of anaerobic digester performance...|$|E
30|$|This is {{the case}} of composts {{produced}} from urban wastes such as MSW that may be the cause of negative effects when added to soil due to the presence of high concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements (Smith 2009; Lopes et al. 2011; Paradelo et al. 2011). Among these, Pb, Cu, and Zn often reach high concentrations in composts due to the inadequate separation of MSW <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> from non-degradable or inert materials rich in metals, as well as to their presence in vegetables and other human food materials (Chaney et al. 2001), and they could be accumulated in soils up to excessive levels after repeated compost applications.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was the {{evaluation}} of fluxes of organic carbon and biodegradability of waste waters during rain events in order to better predict the impacts of combined sewer overflows (CSO). The combined sewer system studied was located in a densely populated urban catchment adjacent to Paris. Five subcatchments of different size, have been monitored during several rain events for suspended solids, conductivity, ammonium, chemical and biological oxygen demand. In addition, two of these subcathments have been evaluated for dissolved and particulate organic carbon, their <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions,</b> and the total bacterial biomass. Several indexes, indicate a lower degradability of waste water during dry weather at the downstream stations, accompanied by an increase of bacterial size and bacterial biomass.

40|$|The {{biodegradability}} {{of water}} samples is usually estimated with bioassays under oxic conditions. In order to overcome {{some of the}} drawbacks linked to the incubation of the samples in aerobic batches, a new protocol is proposed and tested, {{which is based on}} an organic carbon (OC) balance after a 45 days incubation under anoxic conditions with excess nitrate. The <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> of organic matter obtained with the anoxic protocol are slightly lower than those obtained under oxic conditions. Several possible reasons for a systematic underestimation of the biodegradable organic matter under anoxic conditions are evaluated and discussed: a reduced microbial metabolic potential, significantly reduced degradation rates for the slowly biodegradable organic matter, an additional production of refractory organic compounds during the incubation, or the inhibition of the recycling of the organic matter stored in bacterial biomass. Nevertheless, the 7 % difference observed on the biodegradable total OC estimations keeps low enough so that the anoxic protocol can be proposed as a convenient alternative to the oxic one. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|The <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of products, {{wastes and}} {{residues}} from agriculture (including green waste and animal manures), forestry and related food processing wastes, {{as well as}} the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of industrial and municipal wastes that cause pollution problems threatening human and environmental health could be used to produce a valuable product, biochar using Elsa pyrolysis technology. Biochar contains essential plant nutrients such as potassium, carbon, and magnesium as well as properties (alkaline pH and high CEC) that could be optimized for used as a soil amendment to improve the fertility of poor and acidic soils and increase crop yields. Biochar issued from coffee, groundnut and rice husk are the most appropriate due to their high K, Ca, Mg, and Na contents. The high carbon content further shows that biochar has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere. Therefore, recycling of crop wastes to biochar is strongly recommended to smallholder farmers for use in agriculture to improve fertility and crop productivity while mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration.|$|E

40|$|The Landfill Directive {{will require}} the {{pre-treatment}} of MSW prior to landfilling. The removal of progressively increasing proportions of the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> from landfilled waste, and the UK Government’s commitment to increase recycling of key waste fractions, will lead to an inevitable change, from the disposal of raw MSW, to the disposal of MSW treatment residues, to landfill.

The question that this research project has sought to answer is “how long will active management be required for different MSW treatment residues?” The term equilibrium status {{has been used to}} define the end point beyond which management of wastes is no longer necessary. Calculating the equilibrium status of waste involves an assessment of the landfill gas emissions, leachate quality and hydraulic status of the landfill.

40|$|The {{extensive}} use of nanoparticles (NPs) has started receiving increased attention because of the knowledge gaps regarding their fate in {{the environment and the}} possible impact on the environment and human health. The production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO 2 -NPs) is increasing and it is expected that, due to their great number of applications, their concentration in waste streams will increase in the future. The presence of NPs in waste streams may affect the treatment process (e. g., composting) and, if they are not successfully removed from the waste streams, their presence in the treated waste (e. g., compost) may present an environmental risk. Composting of the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a widely used waste management practice, mainly because it is a cost-effective treatment technology and the final product (i. e., compost) presents several benefits to the environment, particularly as a soil conditioner. The overall aim of this thesis is to assess the effect of Ag-TiO 2 NPs and AgNPs that may be present in the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> of municipal solid waste on composting and subsequent soil application of compost. For that purpose in-vessel composting of artificial municipal solid waste contaminated with commercial nanoparticles was investigated at laboratory scale, simulating a range of relevant concentration levels. Subsequently, the fate of NPs present in mature compost use as a top-layer soil conditioner was investigated using a column approach at laboratory scale. The toxicity effect of NPs present mature compost on plant growth was further investigated. The impact of NPs during composting was assessed by monitoring the temporal dynamics of organic matter (OM) using Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The fate of NPs following application of contaminated mature compost as a top-soil conditioner and potential release to groundwater was investigated using a column leaching experiment while the phytotoxicity of mature compost contaminated with NPs was assessed using a seed germination bioassay. Finally, to investigate further possible environmental impacts due to the application of mature compost contaminated with NPs to soils, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted.

The fate of bulk OM and PhACs during an MAR is important to assess post-treatment requirements. Biodegradable OM from EfOM, originating from biological wastewater treatment, was effectively removed during soil passage. Based on a fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (F-EEM) analysis of wastewater effluent-dominated (WWE-dom) surface water (SW), protein-like substances, i. e., biopolymers, were removed more favorably than fluorescent humic-like substances under oxic compared to anoxic conditions. However, there was no preferential removal of biopolymers or humic substances, determined as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) observed via liquid chromatography with online organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) analysis. Most of the selected PhACs exhibited removal efficiencies of greater than 90 % in both SW and WWE-dom SW.

It was observed that biogas production was optimized when waste and inoculum were mixed in a ratio of 5 : 1. At temperature, total solid and pH of 35 oC, 10 % and of 7. 5 respectively. The maximum accumulative methane production is 450 mL/gm V. S. First order model was developed to assess the kinetics of the biodegradation process used to adequately describe the cumulative methane {{production from}} these digesters. It was observed that the rates of substrate biodegradability and removal of the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> of the substrate could be obtained by plotting 1 /t (ln(dyt/dt)) against the inverse of time of digestion. This modified first order model also showed that the digester containing waste and inoculum in the ratio of 5 : 1 had the highest short term anaerobic biodegradability index (STABI) of 2. 0424 and R 2 = 0. 9385 In addition, The modified Gompertz equation was used to adequately describe the cumulative biogas production from these digesters. The kinetic parameters viz., biogas yield potential (B), the maximum biogas production rate (Rb) and the duration of lag phase (λ) were estimated at optimum condition obtained. The highest biogas yield of 450 mL/gm V. S and kinetic parameters B, Rb and λ were 455. 6523 mL/gm V. S, 35. 161 mL/gm V. S d- 1, 5. 0542 d respectively where R 2 0. 9997.

40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} a {{manometric}} respirometric measuring system {{was applied to}} practical environmental cases related to wastewater management and biodegradation studies of oil-contaminated soils and materials used in landfill structures. Pollution of groundwater, surface water and soils is a worldwide problem. Therefore, tests simulating the biodegradation behaviour of organic compounds in water media and soils have become increasingly important. Respirometric methods provide direct measurement of the oxygen consumed by micro-organisms in biodegradation processes from an air or oxygen-enriched environment in a closed vessel. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a crucial environmental parameter {{used to measure the}} quality of water and treatment results in wastewater. Generally, BOD is measured with standardised methods, which are usually time-consuming as well as laborious. In this work the manometric respirometric test was compared with conventional BOD tests by determining the BOD of pulp and paper mills as well as domestic wastewater samples. The effect of different factors such as type, amount and pre-treatment of inoculum and the effect of dilution of a sample on the BOD values were also tested. A right dilution was noticed to be the most significant factor affecting the BOD values of the industrial wastewater samples. The mathematic estimation of the BOD 7 values from the respirometric data was proved to work reliably after a 2 – 3 day incubation period. Characterisation of organic fractions of the pulp and paper mill wastewater was carried out with methods including filtration, long term BOD measurements and COD analyses. The most significant observation in characterisation analyses was that a remarkable part of the detected oxygen demand was consumed for the biotransformation of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> into new inert decomposition products, not only for mineralisation of the <b>biodegradable</b> COD <b>fraction.</b> Biodegradation behaviour of the peat samples with different decomposition rates was studied in order to evaluate the applicable peat types {{that can be used in}} landfill structures. Only minor (BOD/ThOD <  0. 4 %) biodegradation was observed with compaction peat samples, and the stable state, in which biodegradation stopped, was achieved during a two month period. The manometric respirometric method was also applied for the biodegradation studies in which the effect of the modification of soil properties on biodegradation rates of bio-oils was tested. Modified properties were the nutrient content and the pH of the soil. Fertiliser addition and pH adjustment increased both the BOD/ThOD% values of the model substances and the precision of the measurement. The manometric respirometric method was proved to be an advanced method for simulating biodegradation processes in soil and water media...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the possibility of replacing the conventional biomass with biodegradable municipal solid waste, which provides an alternative solution for preventing the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> of municipal solid waste (BMSW) going into landfill required by EU Landfill Directives (1999 / 31 /EC) was carried out. However, as every type of energy have some advantages as well as disadvantages. The use of BMSW as biomass sources {{for the production of}} bio-ethanol was investigated. The experimental results have shown that more than 90 % of the cellulose from the waste can be converted to glucose which can be easily fermented to ethanol production. The potential impacts on related environmental issues, such as sustainable waste management, climate change, water issues, land use and biodiversity, are discussed. Sustainable waste management solutions are also discussed under different environmental, economic, and social scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In current {{landfills}} {{breakdown of}} {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) occurs slowly and the landfill leaves a legacy of care, management, monitoring and potential catastrophic failure over several generations. Social concern over these long term issues, with their legislative and economic implementation, increasingly favour practices which promote short stabilisation times and minimise environmental impact. This paper describes experiments carried out on mixed and unsorted municipal solid waste (MSW) in which 75 % of the rapidly <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction</b> was degraded in about 2 months with an average yield of 0. 18 m(3) CH 4 /kg volatile solids at s. t. p. The experiments served to demonstrate that with proper leachate management very rapid decomposition of waste {{can be accomplished by}} taking the waste through a series of controlled degradation stages.

40|$|Waste {{handling}} is a {{major challenge}} in today’s society. The amount of waste is increasing despite numerous, waste-system related improvements. In other domains of interest for sustainable development, researchers have recently started to investigate the user’s role instead of keeping a systems perspective that excludes the human factors. To investigate the use of existing waste-sorting infrastructure available at apartment buildings, this paper reports on a case study carried out in two buildings in Gothenburg/Sweden. Results from the study reveal mismatches between user needs and what the system offers. The aim was to identify a strategy that housing companies could take to allow for more effective sorting of household waste in rental housing areas, with special focus on the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fraction.</b> The resulting strategy consists of practical solutions that can be implemented by housing companies with similar conditions...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the optimum way of recovering energy from the <b>biodegradable</b> <b>fractions</b> of municipal waste. A part-life cycle study was carried out on the following wastes; paper, food waste, garden waste, wood, non-recyclable mixed municipal waste and refuse derived fuel. The energy recovery processes considered were incineration, gasification, combustion in dedicated plant, anaerobic digestion and combustion in a cement kiln. Methods. The LCA was carried out using WRATE, an LCA tool designed specifically for waste management studies. Additional information on waste composition, waste collection and the performance of the energy recovery processes was obtained from a number of UK-based sources. The results take account of the energy displaced by the waste to energy processes and also the benefits obtained by the associated recycling of digestates, metals and aggregates as appropriate. Results and discussion. For all the waste types considered the maximum benefits in terms of climate change and non-renewable resource depletion would be achieved by using the waste in a cement kiln as a substitute fuel for coal. When considering the impacts in terms of human toxicity, aquatic ecotoxicity, acidification and eutrophication, direct combustion with energy recovery was the best option. The results were found to be highly sensitive to the efficiency of the energy recovery process and the conventional fuel displaced by the recovered energy. Conclusions and recommendations. This study has demonstrated that LCA can be used to determine the benefits and burdens associated with recovering energy from municipal waste fractions. However, the findings were restricted by the lack of reliable data on the performance of waste gasification and anaerobic digestion systems and on the burdens arising from collecting the wastes. It is recommended that further work is carried out to address these data gaps. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{avoid the}} risk of {{bacterial}} reviviscence in a supply network, the water produced must contain very little dissolved organic matter and particular {{care must be taken}} to eliminate the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) which the bacteria can consume. Biological contactors, such as granular activated carbon (GAC) filters once colonized by bacteria, will no longer adsorb DOC but the biomass they fix can be used, within a water treatment system, to reduce the <b>biodegradable</b> carbon <b>fraction.</b> Consequently, the process appreciably. affects the quality of the water produced. Following studies on pilot and full-scale plants, we have assessed the operating parameters which must be applied in the process using the following methodologies: estimation of the bacterial activity in the filter - estimation of the biomass quantities fixed in the pilot plant - the kinetics of the biological processes involved. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods were}} used to {{estimate}} the ultimate biodegradability of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. These methods included: long-term batch digestion studies, measurement of lignin content, and chemostat studies. The ultimate bio-degradability values obtained from these methods were compared to a field operation using a pilot scale, high-solids, complete-mix, thermophilic, anaerobic digestion process. The biodegradability obtained from the pilot study, at a mass retention time of 30 days, was approximately 83 and 81 % of the estimated values obtained from the lignin content and the batch study, respectively. In addition, {{it has been shown}} that the contents of the biodegradable volatile solids affects the prediction of biogas production rate, the computation of the organic loading rate, and feedstock C/N ratio.
