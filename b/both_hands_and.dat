By a belief recorded in the Homolje region, ale that charge to the Moon also display shapeshifting abilities: they repeatedly shift from their basic shape of two-headed snakes to six-fingered men who hold iron pitchforks, black young bulls, big boars, or black wolves, and back.|$|E

25|$|Not surprisingly, Knibb {{was highly}} {{popular with the}} slaves. Not long {{afterwards}} the church in Falmouth needed a minister and Knibb's name was put forward. The missionary who chaired the meeting recorded that when he proposed Knibb should be their new minister {{and asked for a}} show of hands, the entire membership stood up, held up <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> wept.|$|E
25|$|Enough hand {{antiseptic}} {{or alcohol}} rub {{must be used}} to thoroughly wet or cover both hands.

25|$|Even in {{informal}} situations, {{drinking alcohol}} {{starts with a}} toast (kanpai, 乾杯) when everyone is ready. Do not start drinking until everybody is served and has finished the toast. It is not customary to pour oneself a drink; rather, {{people are expected to}} keep each other's drinks topped up. When someone moves to pour one's drink, one should hold one's glass with <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> thank the pourer.|$|E
25|$|In July 1969, Taylor headlined a six-night {{stand at}} the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

Shortly thereafter, he broke <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> both feet in a motorcycle accident on Martha's Vineyard {{and was forced to}} stop playing for several months. However, while recovering, he continued to write songs and in October 1969 signed a new deal with Warner Bros. Records.|$|E

25|$|The term sock puppet {{refers to}} {{multiple}} pseudonyms in {{use by the}} same person on a particular message board or forum. The analogy of a sock puppet is of a puppeteer holding up <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> supplying dialogue to both puppets simultaneously. A typical use of a sockpuppet account is to agree with or debate another sockpuppet account belonging to the same person, {{for the purposes of}} reinforcing the puppeteer's position in an argument. Sock puppets are usually found when an IP address check is done on the accounts in forums.|$|E
25|$|Ball: It is made {{of either}} rubber or {{synthetic}} material (pliable plastic) provided it possesses the same elasticity as rubber. It is from 18 to 20cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any colour and should rest in the gymnast's hand, not the wrist. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing, and rolling. The gymnast must use <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> work on the whole floor area while showing continuous flowing movement. The ball is to emphasize the gymnast's flowing lines and body difficulty.|$|E
25|$|On September 18, 2010 Victor faced former WBA Light Welterweight Champion Vivian Harris on the Shane Mosley vs. Sergio Mora undercard at Staples Center. He was on ESPN's SportsNation {{to promote}} the fight with Harris. Victor landed 25-of-54 power punches. He dropped Harris with <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> landed some nasty power punches. That short right really showed off the unique power possessed by Ortiz. Ortiz knocked Harris down {{three times in the}} second round en route to a knock out win with :45 seconds left in the third round.|$|E

It is from 18 to 20cm in diameter and must have a minimum weight of 400g. The ball can be of any color. The ball should rest in the gymnast's hand and not rest against the wrist or {{be able to be}} grasped. Fundamental elements of a ball routine include throwing, bouncing or rolling. The gymnast must use <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> work on the whole floor area whilst showing continuous flowing movement.

25|$|A drum kit — {{also called}} a drum set, trap set, or simply drums — is a {{collection}} of drums and other percussion instruments, typically cymbals, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player, with drumsticks held in <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> the feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. A drum kit consists of a mix of drums (categorized classically as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 2) and idiophones - most significantly cymbals, but can also include the woodblock and cowbell (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1). In the 2000s, some kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and entirely electronic kits are used.|$|E
25|$|After {{these events}} Psylocke's powers changed once again; she now possessed both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, {{but with her}} psionic {{potential}} divided between them, neither ability is {{as strong as it}} once was. The following days saw Betsy travel back in time alongside Beast's X-Club. Psylocke also led the X-Club in a mission to raise Asteroid M, which was {{at the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean, to serve as the X-Men's new base of operations and a haven for mutantkind, called Utopia. Soon after, Psylocke went to Japan with Wolverine to re-inter her former body. Upon arriving, she was ambushed by the Hand, who destroyed her original body at the behest of Matsu'o Tsurayaba. Enraged, Psylocke tracked Matsu'o down, finding him terribly disfigured as the result of Wolverine's yearly revenge on Matsu'o for his role in the murder of Mariko Yashida. Matsu'o, now missing <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> other body parts, desired an honorable death and wanted Psylocke to grant him that honor since he could not hold a blade to perform seppuku himself. This put Psylocke at odds with Wolverine, who felt that Matsu'o's punishment was not over yet. Psylocke engaged Wolverine in a brutal fight which ended in a truce. With Wolverine's permission, Psylocke finished Matsu'o off mercifully, using her telepathy to project illusions into his mind of his body restored and of Kwannon embracing him. Psylocke quickly killed him with her psi-blade.|$|E

500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards with <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> wagged {{them back}} and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time I had a few friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew {{that they would be}} watching and I wanted to let them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E
500|$|The panel used a DC-3 {{aircraft}} with a cockpit {{identical to}} that of VH-AET to carry out four flight tests with the gyroscope caged. [...] When the automatic pilot was engaged the control wheel moved forward so strongly it was torn from the pilot's hands, and regaining control required use of <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> significant force. [...] Initial tests showed that when the pilot was unprepared, up to 600ft (183m) could be lost before he identified the problem and disengaged the automatic pilot. [...] On the fourth test the pilot restricted the height loss to 300ft (91m). The panel considered the most likely explanation of the accident was inadvertent engagement of the automatic pilot with the gyroscope caged.|$|E
500|$|The final debate {{took place}} October 28 at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, to an {{overflow}} crowd {{in excess of}} a thousand. Voorhis went on the attack, charging Nixon with misrepresenting the [...] "46votes" [...] to avoid real debate and any discussion of where Nixon himself stood on issues. The Republican candidate stated that he was fighting for [...] "the person on a pension {{trying to keep up}} with the rising cost of living... the white-collar worker who has not had a raise... Americans have had enough, and they have come to the conclusion that they are going to do something." [...] Nixon sat down to thunderous applause, and the San Gabriel Sun described Voorhis: [...] "He pauses, breathes heavily, scans the audience with tired eyes, adjusts his glasses nervously with <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> then strikes the podium with an open hand." ...|$|E
