5|$|Cleveland {{brought his}} {{opposition}} to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos {{in his first two}} months in office. The first to attract attention was his veto of a <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents. The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced. Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjustâ€”Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again. Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons. After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.|$|E

5|$|During his tenure, McCreary {{represented}} Kentucky's agricultural interests, {{introducing a}} <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> create the United States Department of Agriculture. A bill containing {{most of the}} same provisions as the one McCreary authored was passed later in the session. He also proposed a successful amendment to the Wilsonâ€“Gorman Tariff Act that excluded farm implements and machinery from the tariff. An advocate of free silver, he was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison to be a delegate to the International Monetary Conference held in Brussels, Belgium, in 1892. As chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he authored a <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> establish a court that would settle disputed land claims stemming from the Gadsden Purchase and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. He advocated {{the creation of a}} railroad linking Canada, the United States, and Mexico. In 1890, he sponsored a bill authorizing the first Pan-American Conference and was an advocate of the Pan-American Medical Conference that met in Washington, D.C., in 1893. He authored a report declaring American hostility to European ownership of a canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and sponsored legislation authorizing the U.S. president to retaliate against foreign vessels that harassed American fishing boats.|$|E
5|$|During the 1894 {{legislative}} session, Brown advocated and won {{passage of}} several government efficiency measures, including a <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> transfer certain state governmental expenses to the counties, a <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> reform state printing contracts, and measures clarifying laws governing asylums and charitable institutions. The most significant bill, {{and the one}} that generated the most debate, was a law giving married women individual property rights {{for the first time in}} state history. Other measures passed during the session included a basic coal safety measure, a common school statute, a measure prohibiting collusive bidding on tobacco, new regulations on grain warehouses, and a law providing free turnpikes. Measures advocated by Brown but not enacted by the Assembly included broadening the powers of the state railroad commission, establishing the offices of state bank inspector and superintendent of public printing, and reforming prison management, including separate detention of adolescent criminals. Brown also lobbied for the abolition of the state parole board; when the Assembly refused, Brown vowed to ignore the board's recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{and state}} {{officials}} became concerned about ticket scalping and fraud related to sales of the tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the <b>bill</b> <b>to</b> die in the closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
