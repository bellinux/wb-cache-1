40|$|According {{to many in}} the {{bankruptcy}} field, small <b>business</b> <b>debtors</b> are increasingly turning to state debtor-creditors laws {{as an alternative to}} federal bankruptcy relief. One particularly popular state law is the assignment for the benefit of creditors. The conventional wisdom is that these procedures provide a state law alternative to liquidate a business. This article reports the results of an original empirical study that challenges this conventional wisdom. Gathering data from every assignment for the benefit of creditors in a major metropolitan area over a three-year period, this study shows that debtors and their secured creditors are using these procedures not just to liquidate a business but also to sell the business as a going concern, free and clear of interests. These going concern sales, particularly when sold to insiders of the debtor, are actually more like corporate reorganization than liquidation. These findings raise important questions about the role of these state law alternatives and the way they interact with the federal bankruptcy laws. These questions, in turn, may help inform debates about reforming {{the bankruptcy}} laws, particularly as applied to small <b>business</b> <b>debtors...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Another type of {{bankruptcy}} case is reorganization under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. In a chapter 11 case, unless the court orders otherwise, the debtor retains operating {{control of the}} debtor's assets as a [...] "debtor in possession" [...] and is allowed {{a period of time}} within which to propose a [...] "plan of reorganization" [...] to address creditor claims. The procedures for chapter 11 reorganization cases are complex and were widely understood to apply only to <b>business</b> <b>debtors</b> - that is, business entities such as corporations, and individuals who were the owners of a business enterprise. However, the Code did not expressly state that chapter 11 excluded individuals who were not engaged in business from filing a chapter 11 case.|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} {{businesses}} experiencing financial distress increased significantly {{during the past}} several years. The number of Chapter 11 reorganization cases likewise rose. And many of these business failures were spectacular, leaving little value for creditors and even less for shareholders. Consequently, how the <b>business</b> <b>debtor’s</b> limited asset pie is divided and who gets to allocate the pieces are very relevant and important questions. The U. S. Bankruptcy Code generally contemplates the appointment of a committee of the debtors’ unsecured creditors to serve as a fiduciary for all general unsecured creditors and as a statutory watchdog over the debtor and its assets. The creditors’ committee typically includes seven to nine of the debtor’s largest unsecured creditors, and it receives access to much of the debtor’s proprietary and confidential information, as well as a seat at the plan of reorganization negotiation table. Serving {{as a member of the}} creditors’ committee often gives a creditor a say in how the asset pie is divided. Whether that creditor uses its committee seat for the benefit of all creditors or simply to further its own agenda is an open question. This Article presents the first in-depth empirical analysis of the activities of creditors’ committees in, and their impact on, Chapter 11 reorganization cases. The primary data examine approximately 296 Chapter 11 cases in six different jurisdictions. This analysis is supplemented by survey data collected from individuals who have served on creditors’ committees or worked as a professional to <b>business</b> <b>debtors</b> or creditors’ committees. The data support several strong associations between the presence of a creditors’ committee and, for example, whether the debtor reorganizes or pursues a sale of substantially all of its assets and the ultimate percentage recovery distributed to general unsecured creditors. Overall the article provides critical data and analyses to help policymakers, judges and Chapter 11 participants refine the role of creditors’ committees to maximize their utility...|$|R
40|$|The Slovak {{insolvency}} law reform, which came into effect on 1 January 2006, introduced {{a brand new}} restructuring option for <b>business</b> <b>debtors.</b> In this thesis, we present the first complex empirical analysis of all restructuring attempts allowed in the period 2006 - 2010. Results, based on {{a large amount of}} data, which we gathered for this purpose, suggest that the restructuring option is much more viable than the composition option under the previous Bankrupcty and Composition Act. The system is characterized by very high success rates (in terms of plan confirmation) and speedy proceedings. The size of the debtor affects neither the prospects for success, nor the length of proceedings significantly. We conclude that, even though a lot of improvements still need to be done, the reform moved the Slovak {{insolvency law}} closer to the standards of the best-performing jurisdictions.

40|$|Economic {{rehabilitation}} is {{the notion}} underlying Canada’s Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (BIA), providing consumer debtors with {{an opportunity for a}} “fresh start” through the mechanism of bankruptcy or making a proposal to their creditors for payment of their debts on terms that allow them to rehabilitate their financial status. This article undertakes a comparison of consumer proposals and consumer bankruptcies, examining 5, 773 individual insolvencies in the past two years, with a view to discerning choices by individual insolvent debtors of insolvency proceeding. It compares causes of financial distress, income levels, quantum of debt and the assets of those filing proposals or bankruptcies. The data indicate that overextension of credit is a primary cause of insolvency, being 20 % to 24 % the primary cause across all cohorts. Home mortgage liability is significant for the Division I proposal debtors, but less significant for bankrupts, many of whom do not have equity in homes. Credit card debt is a serious problem across all groups. Credit card debt, unlike fixed loans such as mortgages, can quickly escalate, is owed at much higher interest rates that can rapidly compound financial distress, and the lack of a defined payment plan, other than a minimum payment, means that consumer debtors are not encouraged to pay these debts first, leading to longer term financial distress. Yet, to date, insolvency policy does not really factor the nature of this debt into policy development. Job loss and seasonal employment together are a significant cause of insolvency across Division II consumer proposal debtors (26 %), Division II <b>business</b> proposal <b>debtors</b> (33 %), and bankrupts (28 %), but less so for Division I proposal debtors (16 %). These data suggest that there are broader economic and social challenges that need to be addressed, as financial distress is often beyond the control of the individual debtor. To date, there is little linkage in Canada between economic stimulus and employment policy development and insolvency law policy development. Medical reasons are also a significant cause for Division II <b>business</b> proposal <b>debtors</b> (15 %) and bankruptcy (11 %), compared with the other cohorts. However, it is uncertain whether medical bills and lack of coverage, or medical problems resulting in inability to earn sufficient income are the real source of the financial distress. Equally, medical debt may be masked if consumer debtors have paid for medical bills by credit card on exit from hospital or particular outpatient services, as is the normal practice in some regions. The study offers both observations on the data and recommendations for future research and policy development...|$|R
