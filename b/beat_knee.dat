A clinical study was made among 598 coal-face workers at one large colliery: 579 were examined of whom 233 showed evidence of past or present <b>beat</b> <b>knee.</b> A considerable preponderance of non-inflammatory lesions, most commonly in the pre-patellar bursa, was demonstrated. It was concluded that the single common factor in the causation of non-inflammatory or acute recurrent bursitis was the trauma of kneeling. Experimental investigation of the pressures exerted showed great variations in the pressure on the knee as a whole and on different parts of its weight-bearing surfaces. The view that these localized and extreme variations in pressure may lead to rupture of a vessel found confirmation in the aspiration of blood from the bursae of 29 out of 30 patients. Histological sections from chronically enlarged bursae showed intense fibrosis in the wall of the bursa and sometimes deposition of haemosiderin. In the management of a new case of acute simple bursitis immediate aspiration of the blood and the instillation of hyalase proved successful in all 12 cases. Aspiration was also successful in certain cases of acute recurrent simple bursitis. Surgical removal of chronically enlarged fibrotic bursae allowed eight out of 12 patients to return to the coal-face. It is suggested that in order to reduce the incidence of <b>beat</b> <b>knee</b> the use of a knee pad that will not only protect the skin of the front of the knee from trauma by coal particles but will also cushion the knee from the effects of extreme variations in pressure may be desirable. Concern with the incidence of <b>beat</b> <b>knee</b> in kneeling miners has stimulated renewed interest in the condition during the past 10 years (Watkins...|$|E
40|$|Liddell, F. D. K. (1973). Brit. J. industr. Med., 30, 1 - 14. Morbidity of British {{coal miners}} in 1961 - 62. The British coal mining {{population}} in 1961 is described, {{in terms of}} the 29 084 men covered in a 5 % sample census, by age, type of employment, coalfield, size of community, degree of mechanization, and other factors. Over a quarter of the men were in jobs not considered specific to coalmining, although nearly half of such men were working underground. The Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance provided records of over 34 000 spells of incapacity due to sickness for these men. Miners were found to suffer much more incapacity for work than men in other employment, even in those non-mining tasks considered to be very arduous. Among miners at the face, elsewhere underground, and on the surface, the lowest paid had the highest rate of incapacity. Incapacity from most causes was also found to vary between coalfields and with size of residential community, and to depend on the men's financial responsibilities, category of pneumoconiosis, and depth of working, but not on the degree of mechanization. A relationship was observed between seam height and the incidence of new spells of <b>beat</b> <b>knee...</b>|$|E

The seizure afforded him a mask behind which he could roll his eyes impartially between, above, and beyond his two tormentors.|$|R

Half-a-dozen men of various ages, from between twenty and thirty to fifty, all shabbily dressed, most of them with clay pipes in their mouths, were listening {{with a look of}} concentrated intelligence to a man in a pepper-and-salt dress, with blonde hair, short nose, broad forehead and general breadth, who, holding his pipe slightly uplifted in the left hand, and <b>beating</b> his <b>knee</b> with the right, was just finishing a quotation from Shelley (the comparison of the avalanche in his [...] "Prometheus Unbound") ...|$|R

The dancers move to their left with a side-shuffle step to reflect the long-short pattern of the drum <b>beat,</b> bending their <b>knees</b> to emphasize the pattern.|$|R
50|$|In an {{astonishing}} 29-match unbeaten {{run at the}} start of the next season, Jones bagged 14 goals as Leeds coasted to the title, but he was now beginning to have problems with one of his knees and spent the summer of 1974 having intensive physiotherapy. In early 1975, he began playing reserve football again, but in constant pain. With Joe Jordan in the number nine shirt and scoring frequently, and the team (despite Revie's departure in the summer to take over the England job) reaching its first European Cup final, Jones was a dejected spectator who did not figure in the team all season. He watched disconsolately as Leeds lost the European Cup final to Bayern Munich and then retired at the age of 30, unable to <b>beat</b> his <b>knee</b> problem. His Leeds career ended with 111 goals from 312 appearances. Allan Clarke, Jones strike partner, admitted that it was never the same for him after Jones retired.|$|R

50|$|A fouetté turn (or fouetté en tournant) {{begins with}} the {{performer}} standing on one flat foot in plié (with knee bent). The working leg is extended and whipped around {{to the side and}} then, once extended to maximum turnout, bent and pulled in to a passe or retiré position. The foot <b>beats</b> behind the <b>knee</b> and then {{to the front of the}} knee of the supporting leg before extending back out to the front. At the same time, the supporting foot transitions to relevé (heel raised), in ballet often rising to en pointe (on toe tips). These movements create the angular momentum needed for one turn, which is executed by rotating in place on the supporting foot.|$|R

5000|$|There is a {{specific}} performance move of Lindemann's, dubbed [...] "The Till Hammer". This move is where he bends his <b>knees,</b> <b>beats</b> his thigh with a fist in a hammering motion while turning his {{head from side to}} side. On occasion, Flake has been seen to parody the move onstage. Unlike most frontmen, Lindemann stated {{in an interview that he}} does not like being looked at while on stage, and would wear sunglasses to block out views of the audience. The main purpose of the band's signature pyrotechnics has also been stated to actually be a tool in taking the audience's attention away from Lindeman, whilst doubling as a spectacle for the audience. Lindemann also opts to look at the back to the mixing booth, or does hand gestures during guitar solos to distract the audience from looking directly at him. Due to his onstage anxiety, Lindemann usually gets his bandmates to use a rubber dinghy to crowd-surf during shows, as it gets the audience's attention away from the stage for several minutes at a time. In 2011, Roadrunner Records listed Lindemann at number 50 of the 50 greatest metal frontmen of all time. In 2013, Lindemann's second poetry book, In stillen Nächten was published. He commented on the poetry, saying [...] "The vast majority of my poems could have been written a few hundred years earlier." ...|$|R
