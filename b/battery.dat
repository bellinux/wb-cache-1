5|$|From 1888 to 1910, a {{new series}} of fortifications were built to house breech-loading guns. These were Della Grazie <b>Battery,</b> Spinola <b>Battery,</b> Garden <b>Battery,</b> Wolseley <b>Battery,</b> Pembroke <b>Battery</b> and Fort Benghisa. The latter was the last {{polygonal}} fort to be built in Malta.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{claims that}} the <b>battery</b> can provide up to 10hours of video, 140hours of audio playback, or one month on standby; people say the <b>battery</b> lasts about 8hours doing normal tasks. Like any {{rechargeable}} <b>battery,</b> the iPad's <b>battery</b> loses capacity over time. However, the iPad's <b>battery</b> is not user-replaceable. In a program similar to iPod and iPhone battery-replacement programs, Apple promised to replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished unit for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. User data is not preserved/transferred. The refurbished unit comes with a new case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Defence of Tigné Point {{was further}} {{enhanced}} {{with the construction}} of Cambridge <b>Battery</b> between 1878 and 1886. Garden <b>Battery</b> was then built between 1889 and 1894, covering the area between Cambridge <b>Battery</b> and Fort Tigné. Barrack blocks were constructed {{on the rest of the}} peninsula in the early 20th century.|$|E
50|$|These <b>batteries</b> include but are {{not limited}} to: car <b>batteries,</b> golf cart <b>batteries,</b> UPS <b>batteries,</b> {{industrial}} fork-lift <b>batteries,</b> motorcycle <b>batteries,</b> and commercial <b>batteries.</b> These can be regular lead-acid, sealed lead-acid, gel type, or absorbed glass mat <b>batteries.</b> These are recycled by grinding them, neutralizing the acid, and separating the polymers from the lead.

5|$|General Motors {{explained}} the modifications {{will enhance the}} vehicle structure that surround the <b>battery</b> and the <b>battery</b> coolant system to improve <b>battery</b> protection after a severe crash. The safety enhancements consist of strengthening an existing portion of the Volt’s vehicle safety structure to further protect the <b>battery</b> pack in a severe side collision; add a sensor in the reservoir of the <b>battery</b> coolant system to monitor coolant levels; and add a tamper-resistant bracket {{to the top of}} the <b>battery</b> coolant reservoir to help prevent potential coolant overfill. The additional side safety structural pieces have a total weight of , and their function is to spread the load of a severe side impact away from the <b>battery</b> pack, reducing the possibility of intrusion into the pack.|$|E

50|$|Even just {{a single}} string of <b>batteries</b> wired in series can have adverse {{interactions}} if new <b>batteries</b> are mixed with old <b>batteries.</b> Older <b>batteries</b> tend to have reduced storage capacity, and so will both discharge faster than new <b>batteries</b> and also charge to their maximum capacity more rapidly than new <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
5|$|If the {{landings}} {{had gone}} to plan, the 11th Battalion {{was supposed to be}} crossing the plateau heading north. The 10th Battalion, south of the plateau, was to capture a Turkish trench and artillery <b>battery</b> behind Gun Ridge. The 9th Battalion, furthest south, was to attack the artillery <b>battery</b> at Gaba Tepe, and the 12th Battalion was the reserve, with 26th Jacob's Mountain <b>Battery</b> to establish their gun line on the plateau. Unknown to the ANZACs, the Turks had an artillery <b>battery</b> sited on 400 Plateau.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, {{the castle}} was {{transferred}} {{back to the}} Ministry of Works and repaired; the Dartmouth Point <b>Battery,</b> by {{now known as the}} Old <b>Battery,</b> was leased back to the town for use as a restaurant; and the site was reopened to the public. In the 21st century it is managed by English Heritage, with the Grand <b>Battery</b> displayed as it would have appeared in the 19th century; it received 37,940 visitors in 2007. The 14th-century gun tower is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building, the 19th-century gun <b>battery</b> as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013 Mitsubishi Motors {{reported}} {{two separate}} incidents with lithium-ion batteries used in its plug-in electric cars, {{one with an}} i-MiEV {{and the other with}} an Outlander P-HEV whose <b>battery</b> pack overheated and melted some of the <b>battery</b> cells. The <b>battery</b> packs are produced by GS Yuasa, the same company that supplies the batteries for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, whose entire fleet was grounded in January 2013 for lithium-ion <b>battery</b> problems. The lithium-ion <b>battery</b> of an i-MiEV caught fire at the Mizushima <b>battery</b> pack assembly plant on March 18 while connected to charge-discharge test equipment. Mitsubishi did not issue a recall, but halted production and sales of the two models until it determined the causes of the <b>battery</b> problems. According to Mitsubishi, the problem with the i-MiEV <b>battery</b> pack is related to a change in the GS Yuasa manufacturing process, and the carmaker notified fleet-vehicle operators with i-MiEVs whose batteries were made under the same process as those that overheated, and is working on a possible fix.|$|E

5|$|Independent {{companies}} {{also provide a}} <b>battery</b> replacement service, returning the original unit with new <b>battery</b> but original case.

5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of <b>battery</b> electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion <b>battery</b> can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer <b>battery,</b> lithium iron phosphate <b>battery,</b> and the nanowire <b>battery.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Volt's <b>battery</b> is {{guaranteed}} by General Motors {{for eight years}} or , and will cover all 161 <b>battery</b> components. GM estimates that the Volt batteries will degrade by 10 to 30% after 8 years or 100,000 miles. GM has applied for a patent that may allow technicians to quickly and cheaply recover some {{of the performance of}} degraded <b>battery</b> packs. The Volt’s <b>battery</b> management system runs more than 500 diagnostics at 10 times per second, allowing it {{to keep track of the}} Volt’s <b>battery</b> pack in real-time, 85% of which ensure the <b>battery</b> pack is operating safely and 15% monitor <b>battery</b> performance and life.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{arrived at}} the <b>battery</b> at 04:00.

The battalion was divided into four assault groups, one for each of the casemates of the <b>battery,</b> and was ready by 04:30, when the gliders carrying the sappers arrived over the <b>battery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>battery</b> {{life of the}} {{new models}} also {{received}} mixed reception, with outlets reporting inconsistent <b>battery</b> life and inaccurate estimates of time remaining on <b>battery</b> by the operating system. Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated <b>battery</b> time remaining entirely in a macOS update. Consumer Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable <b>battery</b> life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and Consumer Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. Consumer Reports performed the tests again with a patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.|$|E
