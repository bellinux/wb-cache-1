Its spontaneous fission ruled out the use of plutonium in a gun-type nuclear weapon. Oppenheimer's Los Alamos Laboratory met the challenge <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> and building an implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|E
5|$|After graduating Coffin {{was unable}} to find work with {{established}} architectural firms, due to widespread prejudice against a woman working in a male-dominated field.

There is much confusion among pharmaceutical scientists in generic drug industry about the appropriate element and terminology of quality <b>by</b> <b>design.</b> This paper discusses quality <b>by</b> <b>design</b> for generic drugs and presents a summary of the key terminology. The elements of quality <b>by</b> <b>design</b> are examined and a consistent nomenclature for quality <b>by</b> <b>design,</b> critical quality attribute, critical process parameter, critical material attribute, and control strategy is proposed. Agreement on these key concepts will allow discussion of the application of these concepts to abbreviated new drug applications to progress...|$|R
5|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, {{the response of}} the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.|$|E

Enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Development of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.|$|E

The design of the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge.

In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the council}} had hesitated in abolishing the mass, the {{decrease}} {{in the exercise of}} traditional piety allowed pastors to be unofficially released from the requirement of celebrating mass. As individual pastors altered their practices as each saw fit, Zwingli was prompted to address this disorganised situation <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> a communion liturgy in the German language. This was published in Aktion oder Brauch des Nachtmahls (Act or Custom of the Supper). Shortly before Easter, Zwingli and his closest associates requested the council to cancel the mass and to introduce the new public order of worship. On Maundy Thursday, 13 April 1525, Zwingli celebrated communion under his new liturgy. Wooden cups and plates were used to avoid any outward displays of formality. The congregation sat at set tables to emphasise the meal aspect of the sacrament. The sermon was {{the focal point of the}} service and there was no organ music or singing. The importance of the sermon in the worship service was underlined by Zwingli's proposal to limit the celebration of communion to four times a year.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead start <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> the characters, and {{attempted}} to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E

5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E

5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many of {{the sets}} {{featured}} on the show which were filmed on a Fox soundstage, the shot of the buried alien space craft was actually filmed in the hills near Simi Valley, California. Carter wanted a full-scale mock-up of the alien ship {{to be buried in}} the ground. This was unusual for the show; usually, {{a small portion of the}} ship would have been buried in the ground and the rest would have been filled in either via digital graphics, or with a scale model. In this episode, however, all of the shots of the alien ship, sans the take off, were done practically. To create the otherworldly glow of the ship, over 100 lamps were hidden within the craft. In addition, the ship itself was covered in glyphs that are supposed to be part of an unknown alien language. This was accomplished <b>by</b> <b>designing</b> fictional characters and programming them into a computer. These were then printed as letters which could be applied to the ship's hull.|$|E
