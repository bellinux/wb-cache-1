40|$|The {{influence}} of noise is unavoidable in all living systems. Its {{impact on a}} model of a biological clock, normally running in regular oscillating modes, is examined. It is shown that in a specific system in which endogenous rhythmicity is produced by a <b>beat</b> <b>oscillator</b> acting on a feedback coupled metabolic pool system, noise can act coherently to produce unexpected dynamic behaviour, running from regular over pseudo-regular to irregular time-structures. If the biological system consists of a set of identical weakly coupled cells, stochasticity may lead to phase decoupling producing irregular spatio-temporal patterns. Synchronization via phase resetting can be achieved by external short-time temperature pulses. Explicit results are obtained for the well-studied circadian photosynthesis oscillations in plants performing crassulacean acid metabolism. Because of the generic structure of the underlying nonlinear dynamics they can, however, be regarded as a general property of the {{influence of}} noise on nonlinear excitable systems with fixed points occuring close to limit cycles...|$|E

50|$|It is {{designed}} to mimic the tone generated by a typical radio receiver when a CW signal is converted to the intermediate frequency (IF), then mixed with the <b>Beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) frequency to generate a difference frequency, which is audible over the radio receiver loudspeaker or headphones.|$|R
5000|$|A tonewheel or {{tone wheel}} {{is a simple}} {{electromechanical}} apparatus for generating electric musical notes in electromechanical organ instruments such as the Hammond Organ. [...] by Rudolph Goldschmidt and was first used in pre vacuum tube radio receivers as a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) to make continuous wave radiotelegraphy (Morse code) signals audible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{receiver}} {{was ahead}} of its time, because when it was invented there was no oscillator capable of producing the radio frequency sine wave fO with the required stability. [...] Fessenden first used his large radio frequency alternator, but this wasnt practical for ordinary receivers. The heterodyne receiver remained a laboratory curiosity until a cheap compact source of continuous waves appeared, the vacuum tube electronic oscillator invented by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner in 1913. [...] After this it became the standard method of receiving CW radiotelegraphy. The heterodyne oscillator is the ancestor of the <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) {{which is used to}} receive radiotelegraphy in communications receivers today. The heterodyne oscillator had to be retuned each time the receiver was tuned to a new station, but in modern superheterodyne receivers the BFO signal beats with the fixed intermediate frequency, so the <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> can be a fixed frequency.|$|R
50|$|Reduction of {{the carrier}} level permits higher power {{levels in the}} {{sidebands}} than would be possible with conventional AM transmission. Carrier power must be restored by the receiving station to permit demodulation, usually {{by means of a}} <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> (BFO). Failure of the BFO to match the original carrier frequency when receiving such a signal will cause a heterodyne.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of product}} detector mixes (or heterodynes) the RF or IF signal with a locally derived carrier (the <b>Beat</b> Frequency <b>Oscillator,</b> or BFO) {{to produce an}} audio frequency copy of the original audio signal and a mixer product at twice the original RF or IF frequency. This high-frequency component can then be filtered out, leaving the original audio frequency signal.|$|R
2500|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} IF SSB signal, the single sideband must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of baseband frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> (BFO). In other words, it is just another stage of heterodyning.(mixing down to base band). For this to work, the BFO frequency must be exactly adjusted.|$|R
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator.</b>|$|R
50|$|See HF/DF for a {{discussion}} of SIGINT-captured information with a MASINT flavor, such as determining the frequency to which a receiver is tuned, from detecting the frequency of the <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> of the superheterodyne receiver. This may also be considered unintentional RF radiation (RINT). The local oscillator intercept technique, Operation RAFTER was first made public by a book by a retired senior officer in Britain's counterintelligence service, MI5. The book also discusses acoustic methods of capturing COMINT.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Beat</b> {{frequency}} <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) - This is {{an electronic}} oscillator {{which is only}} found in communications receivers, used in the reception of radiotelegraph (CW) or single-sideband modulation (SSB). It produces a fixed frequency offset from the IF which is mixed with the IF in the demodulator. The IF and BFO frequencies produce a heterodyne (beat) in the audio range which sounds like a musical tone in the speaker. In CW the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code are audible as beeps.|$|R
2500|$|On reception, the FSK {{signal is}} {{converted}} to the original tones by mixing the FSK signal with a local oscillator called the BFO or <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator.</b> These tones are fed to the demodulator part of the modem, which processes them {{through a series of}} filters and detectors to recreate the original digital signal. The FSK signals are audible on a communications radio receiver equipped with a BFO, and have a distinctive [...] "beedle-eeeedle-eedle-eee" [...] sound, usually starting and ending on one of the two tones ("idle on mark").|$|R
50|$|Many {{manufacturers}} {{of these new}} devices brought their own ideas to the market. White's Electronics of Oregon began in the 1950s by building a machine called the Oremaster Geiger Counter. Another leader in detector technology was Charles Garrett, who pioneered the BFO (<b>Beat</b> Frequency <b>Oscillator)</b> machine. With the invention {{and development of the}} transistor in the 1950s and 1960s, metal detector manufacturers and designers made smaller lighter machines with improved circuitry, running on small battery packs. Companies sprang up all over the USA and Britain to supply the growing demand.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{advantage}} of the circuit was that the tube {{could be made to}} oscillate, and thus a single tube could serve as both a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> and a detector, functioning as a heterodyne receiver to make CW radiotelegraphy transmissions audible. [...] This mode was called an autodyne receiver. To receive radiotelegraphy, the feedback was increased until the tube oscillated, then the oscillation frequency was tuned {{to one side of the}} transmitted signal. The incoming radio carrier signal and local oscillation signal mixed in the tube and produced an audible heterodyne (beat) tone at the difference between the frequencies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electromagnet}} {{is excited}} by stable radio-frequency alternating current {{produced by a}} local isochronous electro-mechanical oscillator known as a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> or BFO. [...] It consists of two chambers {{in the center of}} which is placed a vibrating membrane. This is inclosed in a magnetic field, consisting of a powerful coil encircling the device, and which is excited by a direct current. The membrane is caused to vibrate by passing interrupted, compressed air through the two chambers. In the process of vibration, an electromagnetic force is produced in a coil secured to the vibrating disc.|$|R
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator,</b> {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{improvement}} in stability {{and a small}} {{improvement in}} available gain {{is the use of}} a separate oscillator, which separates the oscillator and its frequency {{from the rest of the}} receiver, and also allows the regenerative detector to be set for maximum gain and selectivity - which is always in the non-oscillating condition. [...] A separate oscillator, sometimes called a BFO (<b>Beat</b> Frequency <b>Oscillator)</b> was known from the early days of radio, but was rarely used to improve the regenerative detector. When the regenerative detector is used in the self-oscillating mode, i.e. without a separate oscillator, it is known as an [...] "autodyne".|$|R
5000|$|In electronics, the dynatron oscillator, {{invented in}} 1918 by Albert Hull at General Electric, is an {{obsolete}} vacuum tube electronic oscillator circuit {{which uses a}} negative resistance characteristic in early tetrode vacuum tubes, caused by a process called secondary emission. [...] It was the first negative resistance vacuum tube oscillator. [...] The dynatron oscillator circuit was used to a limited extent as <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillators</b> (BFOs), and local oscillators in vacuum tube radio receivers {{as well as in}} scientific and test equipment from the 1920s to the 1940s but became obsolete around World War 2 due to the variability of secondary emission in tubes.|$|R
5000|$|In a radio receiver, a <b>beat</b> {{frequency}} <b>oscillator</b> or BFO is {{a dedicated}} oscillator {{used to create}} an audio frequency signal from Morse code radiotelegraphy (CW) transmissions to make them audible. The signal from the BFO is mixed with the received signal to create a heterodyne or beat frequency which is heard as a tone in the speaker. BFOs are also used to demodulate single-sideband (SSB) signals, making them intelligible, by essentially restoring the carrier that was suppressed at the transmitter. BFOs are sometimes included in communications receivers designed for short wave listeners; they are almost always fitted to amateur radio station receivers, which often receive CW and SSB signals.|$|R
50|$|Although four-, six-, {{and even}} a few rare eight-tube radios were produced, they were not common. The four-tube version with vacuum tube {{rectifier}} was of inferior performance, as they typically had no IF amplifier tube, although some four-tube designs with a selenium rectifier in place of the rectifier tube avoided this problem. The six-tube versions added either a RF amplifier tube, a push-pull audio power amplifier tube, or a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> tube (to listen to Morse code or single-sideband modulation transmissions). However, these radios cost significantly more and sold in smaller quantities. The eight-tube versions cost even more, adding two or more of the features of the six-tube versions and sometimes an extra IF amplifier tube.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advantage}} of the dynatron circuit was that it could oscillate over a very wide frequency range; from a few hertz to 20 MHz. [...] It also had very good frequency stability compared to other LC oscillators of that time, and was even compared to crystal oscillators. The circuit became popular after the advent of cheap tetrode tubes such as the UY222 and UY224 around 1928. [...] It was used in <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillators</b> (BFOs) for code reception and local oscillators in superheterodyne receivers {{as well as in}} laboratory signal generators and scientific research. RCA's 1931 prototype television used two UY224 tubes as dynatron oscillators to generate the vertical deflection (28 Hz) and horizontal deflection (2880 Hz) signals for the CRT's deflection coils.|$|R
5000|$|In {{military}} {{communications and}} amateur radio the terms [...] "CW" [...] and [...] "Morse code" [...] {{are often used}} interchangeably, despite the distinctions between the two. Aside from radio signals, Morse code may be sent using direct current in wires, sound, or light, for example. For radio signals, a carrier wave is keyed on and off to represent the dots and dashes of the code elements. The carrier's amplitude and frequency remains constant during each code element. At the receiver, the received signal is mixed with a heterodyne signal from a BFO (<b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator)</b> to change the radio frequency impulses to sound. Though most commercial traffic has now ceased operation using Morse it is still popular with amateur radio operators. Non-directional beacons used in air navigation use Morse to transmit their identifier.|$|R
5000|$|In SSB, {{the carrier}} is suppressed, {{significantly}} reducing the electrical power (by up to 12 dB) without affecting {{the information in}} the sideband. This makes for more efficient use of transmitter power and RF bandwidth, but a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> must be used at the receiver to reconstitute the carrier. If the reconstituted carrier frequency is wrong then the output of the receiver will have the wrong frequencies, but for speech (SSB is not used for music) small frequency errors are no problem for intelligibility. Another way to look at an SSB receiver is as an RF-to-audio frequency transposer: in USB mode, the dial frequency is subtracted from each radio frequency component to produce a corresponding audio component, while in LSB mode each incoming radio frequency component is subtracted from the dial frequency.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1915 the tikker was {{replaced}} by a better means of accomplishing the same thing; the [...] "heterodyne receiver" [...] invented by Reginald Fessenden in 1902. In this an electronic oscillator generated a radio signal at a frequency fo offset from the incoming radio wave carrier fC. This was applied to the rectifying detector with the radio carrier. In the detector the two signals mixed, creating a heterodyne (beat) signal at the difference fC - fC between these frequencies, which was in the audio frequency range. The heterodyne provided the audible tone in the earphone whenever the carrier was present. After vacuum tube oscillators were invented in 1913 by Alexander Meissner the heterodyne receiver replaced the tikker. Today the heterodyne method is still used to receive CW signals, and the <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) is a standard part of all communications receivers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "heterodyne" [...] or [...] "beat" [...] {{receiver}} has a {{local oscillator}} {{that produces a}} radio signal adjusted to be close in frequency to the incoming signal being received. When the two signals are mixed, a [...] "beat" [...] frequency equal {{to the difference between}} the two frequencies is created. By adjusting the local oscillator frequency correctly, the beat frequency is in the audio range, and can be heard as a tone in the receiver's earphones whenever the transmitter signal is present. Thus the Morse code [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] are audible as beeping sounds. This technique is still used in radio telegraphy, the local oscillator now being called the <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> or BFO. Fessenden coined the word heterodyne from the Greek roots hetero- [...] "different", and dyn- [...] "power" [...] (cf. δύναμις or dunamis).|$|R
5000|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} IF SSB signal, the single sideband must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of baseband frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> (BFO). In other words, it is just another stage of heterodyning.(mixing down to base band). For this to work, the BFO frequency must be exactly adjusted. If the BFO frequency is off, the output signal will be frequency-shifted (up or down), making speech sound strange and [...] "Donald Duck"-like, or unintelligible. For audio communications, {{there is a common}} agreement about the BFO oscillator shift of 1.7 kHz. A voice signal is sensitive to about 50 Hz shift, with up to 100 Hz still bearable. Some receivers use a carrier recovery system, which attempts to automatically lock on to the exact IF frequency. The carrier recovery doesn't solve the frequency shift. It gives better S/N ratio on the detector output.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{synchronization}} of coupled self-oscillators by external force is studied. The charts of Lyapunov's exponents in the "frequency - amplitude" parameter plane are obtained {{within the framework}} of the phase approximation. We identified the characteristic configurations of the domains of complete synchronization, two- and three-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations and different variants of partial synchronization of oscillators by an external force. The differences between regimes of mode locking and <b>beats</b> of partial <b>oscillators</b> are revealed and discussed. To visualize and analyze the domains of resonant two-frequency tori we construct the charts, in which regions of dynamics with different winding numbers are represented by colors...|$|R
40|$|This {{test was}} held in a sound-poof room, and {{the sources of the}} sound were all of pure tone. The {{audiometer}} receivers were connected to a double audiometer. The examinee had an apparent source of sound and the intensity difference and the time difference varied between both ears. The angular displacement of the apparent source was measured in contrast to the pure tone from a loud speaker connected to a <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> and was audible through spaces between the receivers and the ears. It was ascertained that the value of displacement was proportional to the logarithm of the ratio of intensities. (Stewsat's logarithmic law) Stewart's constant is different according to individuals. The constant does not vary with the increasing frequency. The value of the angular displacement was proportional to the difference of the lengths of two sound-ways. The relation of the angular displacement (θ) with the time difference (T) and intensity difference (I) were as follows; θ=f(1) (I) +f(2) (T) Intensity difference must be of extensively great quantity to remove the apparent source. Time difference is {{the most important factor in}} actual localization. Intensity have more influence upon localization in acoustically fatigued Person and in patients with deafness...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, {{developers}} {{were looking at}} using a different technique in metal detection called pulse induction. Unlike the <b>beat</b> frequency <b>oscillator</b> or the induction balance machines which both used a uniform alternating current at a low frequency, the pulse induction machine simply magnetized {{the ground with a}} relatively powerful, momentary current through a search coil. In the absence of metal, the field decayed at a uniform rate, and the time it took to fall to zero volts could be accurately measured. However, if metal was present when the machine fired, a small eddy current would be induced in the metal, and the time for sensed current decay would be increased. These time differences were minute, but the improvement in electronics made it possible to measure them accurately and identify the presence of metal at a reasonable distance. These new machines had one major advantage: they were mostly impervious to the effects of mineralization, and rings and other jewelry could now be located even under highly mineralized black sand. The addition of computer control and digital signal processing have further improved pulse induction sensors.|$|R
