5|$|After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is {{restored}} to freedom {{and returned to}} his family, leaving <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Solomon never met again.|$|E
5|$|After {{problems}} with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal 'V' formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.|$|E

5|$|The {{nostrils}} in most bony fish {{differ from}} those of tetrapods. Normally, bony fish have four nares (nasal openings), one naris <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> on each side. As the fish swims, water flows into the forward pair, across the olfactory tissue, and out through the posterior openings. This is true not only of ray-finned fish but also of the coelacanth, a fish included in the Sarcopterygii, the group that also includes the tetrapods. In contrast, the tetrapods have only one pair of nares externally but also sport a pair of internal nares, called choanae, allowing them to draw air through the nose. Lungfish are also sarcopterygians with internal nostrils, but these are sufficiently different from tetrapod choanae that they have long been recognized as an independent development.|$|E
5|$|Inception was {{released}} in both conventional and IMAX theaters on July16,2010. The film had its world premiere at Leicester Square in London, United Kingdom on July8,2010. In the United States and Canada, Inception {{was released}} theatrically in 3,792 conventional theaters and 195 IMAX theaters. The film grossed $21.8million during its opening day on July16,2010, with midnight screenings in 1,500 locations. Overall the film made $62.7million and debuted at No.1 on its opening weekend. Inceptions opening weekend gross made it the second-highest-grossing debut for a science-fiction film {{that was not a}} sequel, remake or adaptation, behind Avatar $77million opening weekend gross in 2009. The film held the top spot of the box office rankings in its second and third weekends, with drops of just 32% ($42.7million) and 36% ($27.5million) respectively, before dropping to second place in its fourth week, <b>behind</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> Guys.|$|E
5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen {{right behind}} him. A ten-rider group {{broke away from}} the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear {{derailleur}} failed and it took more than a minute for his team to bring him a replacement bike, putting him a long way <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E

5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the steep slope difficult, but L Company was on top by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire from the UN aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire on the crest and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid afternoon when a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain and surprised a platoon of L Company with an attack from <b>behind.</b> <b>The</b> <b>other</b> two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and drift down the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E
5|$|The Leafs {{finished}} {{in first place}} {{at the end of}} the regular season. Kennedy had finished the regular season third in points on the team <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two star centers Apps and Bentley, but it was Kennedy who was to dominate the playoffs. In the first round Toronto played Boston and eliminated the Bruins in five games. Kennedy set up the tying goal which led to an overtime win in game 1 and scored four times in the second game. But it was in the fifth and deciding for which he received greatest praise for his fore-checking tenacity and clutch goalscoring. First, with Toronto down 2–1 and the Bruins having the better of the play, he out-fought two Boston players for possession to get the puck to Bentley who in turn set up Lynn for the tying goal. Then later, Kennedy was carrying the puck into the Boston end. He passed to Meeker, who returned the pass, Kennedy faked once, moved in front of the net, forced goaltender Brimseck to go down, then lifted the puck over him. In the finals, Toronto swept Montreal in four straight games to win the Stanley Cup. Kennedy scored twice in the Cup-winning game and finished leading all players in the playoffs in points with eight goals and five assists and he was also not given a single penalty in the entire playoffs. His checking and work in the corners has been credited as critical to the victory.|$|E

25|$|The piloted machine had wire-braced tandem wings (one <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>other).</b> It had a Pénaud tail for {{pitch and}} yaw control but no roll control, {{depending}} instead on the dihedral angle of the wings, as did the models, for maintaining roughly level flight.|$|E
25|$|Hill {{signed a}} minor league deal {{to return to the}} Red Sox on February 9, 2014. The deal {{included}} an invitation to spring training.

He was assigned to Pawtucket where he had a 3.23 ERA in 25 games.|$|E
25|$|The year's only blemish was a {{scoreless}} tie {{against the}} rival Georgia Bulldogs in inches of mud. John G.

Georgia outplayed Tech throughout. Georgia was once on Tech's 8-yard line, in the first quarter, but Walter Neville fumbled and Tommy Spence recovered.|$|E

25|$|So Thommo begins - {{the high}} {{stepping}} gait of a thoroughbred, bowling hand bobbing at waist {{level and the}} ball visible. It is conventional and comforting because facing a strange bowler {{for the first time}} invariably generates edginess. Then, in the split second before delivery, at gather, Thommo drags one leg <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in a sort of Swan Lake crossover, sways back and hides the ball behind his right knee - unconventional and very unsettling.|$|E
25|$|Tajiks {{began to}} be conscripted into the Soviet Army in 1939 and during World War II around 260,000 Tajik {{citizens}} fought against Germany, Finland and Japan. Between 60,000(4%) and 120,000(8%) of Tajikistan's 1,530,000 citizens were killed during World War II. Following the war and Stalin's reign {{attempts were made to}} further expand the agriculture and industry of Tajikistan.
