5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding {{was associated with the}} preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{may also}} occur after {{the creation of}} a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This is used in the treatment of refractory ascites, <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> oesophageal varices and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol.|$|E

5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract bleeding, and various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Thoroughbred {{racehorses}} {{perform with}} maximum exertion, which {{has resulted in}} high accident rates and health problems such as <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the lungs. Other health concerns include low fertility, abnormally small hearts and a small hoof-to-body-mass ratio. There are several theories for the reasons behind the prevalence of accidents and health problems in the Thoroughbred breed, and research is ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Chris Sabin's jaw {{was broken}} {{in the final}} round match. Sabin needed serious medical {{assistance}} afterwards backstage due to excessive <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the mouth. Sabin had to cancel an August 19 Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) appearance as a result. Shelley was also injured while taking part in the tournament. He suffered a legitimate back injury, but ended up appearing at the PWG show that Sabin was forced to miss. There, he aggravated the injury further, forcing him to miss two Ring of Honor shows for which he was scheduled.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1996 {{at around}} 10:30pm local time (UTC+7), Udin {{received}} two visitors outside {{his home in}} Bantul, off Parangtritis Road. The visitors claimed to want to leave a motorcycle with him for safekeeping, and reportedly had come the day before as well. While his wife Marsiyem was preparing tea, the men attacked him with a metal rod, striking {{him in the head}} and stomach. The assailants then escaped on a motorcycle they had parked in front of his home. Marsiyem found Udin unconscious on the ground, <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> his ears.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis {{can affect}} the nails and {{produces}} a variety {{of changes in the}} appearance of finger and toe nails. Nail psoriasis occurs in 40–45% of people with psoriasis affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80–90% in those with psoriatic arthritis. These changes include pitting of the nails (pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70% with nail psoriasis), whitening of the nail, small areas of <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> capillaries under the nail, yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot, thickening of the skin under the nail (subungual hyperkeratosis), loosening and separation of the nail (onycholysis), and crumbling of the nail.|$|E

5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs was so bad that the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|Following Olivia's disappearance, Peter discovers a {{surveillance}} camera in her apartment. He takes its memory device, {{which has been}} overwritten numerous times like a palimpsest, to Walter Bishop's (John Noble) laboratory, using forensic tools to examine previous images on the disc. Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) and Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick) take Nina into custody, learning that someone with Nina's bio-metric signature had accessed the Massive Dynamic supply of Cortexiphan {{over the last few}} months; Nina is surprised by this but refuses to talk. As they work, Walter accuses Peter of taking advantage of Olivia's state, even if unintentionally, imprinting his memories of Olivia of the original timeline onto her. They identify a face belonging to Leland Spivey (Monte Markham), a man with ties to Jones and Nina, and Peter suspects that they are dosing Olivia with Cortexiphan for nefarious purposes. Their work is disrupted by the sudden appearance of the Observer September (Michael Cerveris), <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> a chest wound.|$|E

50|$|This was {{his last}} lecture, and after it his faculties {{gradually}} decayed. He became drowsy after dinner, and his nose used to <b>bleed</b> <b>from</b> time to time. In 1813, he had an apoplectic attack.|$|R
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, Frank {{began to}} find that Judy was more {{aggressive}} towards the Japanese and Korean guards. Although he'd normally send her into the jungle to avoid them, on one occasion, the guards gave chase and shot at the dog. He later found Judy <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the shoulder {{where she had been}} grazed by the bullet. He covered the wound with some palm fronds, but could do nothing else to treat or reward her. After moving camps once more, Judy was sentenced to death by the Japanese as part of a plan to control a lice breakout. She disappeared for three days, with guards conducting sweeps in an attempt to find her. She only reappeared when the Japanese forces abandoned the camp.|$|E
5|$|London {{then began}} a tag team with Billy Kidman on January 29, 2004. On the July 8 episode of SmackDown!, the duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz. They defended the title against the Dudleys and the Basham Brothers on several {{occasions}} before losing the championship to René Duprée and Kenzo Suzuki on September 9, due to Kidman leaving London to fight by himself. Kidman's heel turn led to a feud between the two, which culminated at No Mercy where Kidman defeated London with a shooting star press. After the match, London was <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the mouth and being stretchered when Kidman pulled {{him back into the}} ring with the stretcher and delivered another shooting star press to London's injured ribs. This storyline was put in place after London had broken his nose wrestling Booker T and needed time off to recuperate. London returned on November 25, wrestling on Velocity {{until the end of the}} year.|$|E
50|$|Further {{controversy}} {{stems from}} the product's adherence to centuries-old misunderstandings of virginity. The medical community has established that not all women are born with a hymen, and those who are, do not necessarily <b>bleed</b> <b>from</b> intercourse.|$|R
50|$|Only 35% of TIF {{patients}} {{exhibit the}} pathognomonic warning signs which include sentinel bleeding, a small <b>bleed</b> <b>from</b> the tracheostomy {{in the preceding}} the TIF, and pulsations of the tracheostomy tube that coincides with the heartbeat.|$|R
30|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented which automatically sets the attack, release, threshold, and hold parameters of a noise gate applied to drum recordings which contain <b>bleed</b> <b>from</b> secondary sources. The gain parameter which controls {{the amount of}} attenuation applied when the gate is closed is retained, to allow the user to control {{the strength of the}} gate. The gate settings are found by minimising the artifacts introduced to the desirable component of the signal, whilst ensuring that the level of bleed is reduced by a certain amount. The {{algorithm is}} tested on kick drum recordings which contain <b>bleed</b> <b>from</b> hi-hats, snare drum, cymbals, and tom toms.|$|R
5|$|Sonderkommandos (special work crews {{forced to}} work at the gas chambers) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber. The victims' glasses, {{artificial}} limbs, jewelry, and hair were removed, and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down. If the gas chamber was crowded, which they typically were, the corpses were found half-squatting, their skin discolored pink with red and green spots, with some found foaming at their mouths, or <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> their ears. The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators, and the ashes were buried, thrown in the river, or used as fertilizer. With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland, the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944. In November 1944, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship, pitting the {{champion}} Samoa Joe against the challenger Booker T, who was accompanied by Sharmell. The duration of the contest was 12 minutes and 44 seconds. Early in the bout, Booker T hit Joe {{in the face with}} a steel chair, resulting in Joe <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> the forehead. Later on, Booker T slammed Joe back-first onto two chairs with his signature Book End maneuver, however, Joe kicked out of a pinfall attempt. Joe gained the pinfall victory to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after bashing Booker T over the head with a guitar that had appeared in the ring after the lights had suddenly went off and back on.|$|E
5|$|Frequent nosebleeds can be {{prevented}} in part by keeping the nostrils moist, and by applying saline solution, estrogen-containing creams or tranexamic acid; these have few side effects and may have a small degree of benefit. A number of additional modalities {{has been used to}} prevent recurrent bleeding if simple measures are unsuccessful. Medical therapies include oral tranexamic acid and estrogen; the evidence for these is relatively limited, and estrogen is poorly tolerated by men and possibly carries risks of cancer and heart disease in women past the menopause. Nasal coagulation and cauterization may reduce the <b>bleeding</b> <b>from</b> telangiectasias, and is recommended before surgery is considered. However, it is highly recommended to use the least heat and time to prevent septal perforations and excessive trauma to the nasal mucosa that are already susceptible to bleeding. Sclerotherapy is another option to manage the bleeding. This process involves injecting a small amount of an aerated irritant (detergent such as sodium tetradecyl sulfate) directly into the telangiectasias. The detergent causes the vessel to collapse and harden, resulting in scar tissue residue. This is the same procedure used to treat varicose veins and similar disorders.|$|E
50|$|Uprising is {{the third}} studio album by Scottish metalcore band <b>Bleed</b> <b>from</b> Within, {{released}} on 25 March 2013 through Century Media Records. It is the band's first record to feature guitarist Martyn Evans, who replaced founding guitarist Dave Lennon in 2011.|$|R

5000|$|In June <b>Bleed</b> <b>from</b> Within {{supported}} Megadeth {{on their}} four date {{tour of the}} United Kingdom. The band stated their excitement about the opportunity to support Megadeth, with Kennedy commenting [...] "As a metal band, to go and support any of the Big 4 is something I never, ever though would happen". Their performances with Megadeth were met with widespread critical acclaim despite reports of ambivalent crowd reactions with Malcolm Dome commenting that [...] "You have {{to feel sorry for}} <b>Bleed</b> <b>From</b> Within ... they get no more than polite attention from the crowd, and they deserve more". Later in the month, the band was awarded British publication Metal Hammer's Golden Gods Awards for 'Best New Band'.|$|R
