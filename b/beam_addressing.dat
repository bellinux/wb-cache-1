40|$|We {{investigate}} {{laser ablation}} of crystalline silicon induced by a femtosecond optical vortex <b>beam,</b> <b>addressing</b> how beam properties {{can be obtained}} by analyzing the ablation crater. The morphology of the surface structures formed in the annular crater surface allows direct visualization of the beam polarization, while analysis of the crater size provides beam spot parameters. We also determine the diverse threshold fluences for the formation of various complex microstructures generated within the annular laser spot on the silicon sample. Our analysis indicates an incubation behavior of the threshold fluence {{as a function of the}} number of laser pulses, independent of the optical vortex polarization, in weak focusing conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the coherent optical bichromatic force on a molecule, the polar free radical strontium monohydroxide (SrOH). A dual-frequency retro-reflected laser <b>beam</b> <b>addressing</b> the X̃^ 2 Σ^+Ã^ 2 Π_ 1 / 2 electronic transition coherently imparts momentum onto a cryogenic beam of SrOH. This directional photon exchange creates a bichromatic force that transversely deflects the molecules. By adjusting the relative phase between the forward and counter propagating laser beams we reverse {{the direction of}} the applied force. A momentum transfer of 70 ħ k is achieved with minimal loss of molecules to dark states. Modeling of the bichromatic force is performed via direct numerical solution of the time-dependent density matrix and is compared with experimental observations. Our results open the door to further coherent manipulation of molecular motion, including the efficient optical deceleration of diatomic and polyatomic molecules with complex level structures...|$|E
40|$|Nanoscale {{resolution}} cathodoluminescence (CL) {{has been}} used to demonstrate and investigate the functionality of nanoparticle-based components for future nanophotonic phase-change memory and optical antenna applications. An integrated experimental system based on a scanning electron microscope was developed for the fabrication and in situ characterization of nanoparticles. It was equipped with an atomic beam source for gallium nanoparticle growth, a liquid-nitrogen-cooled cryostat to control substrate temperature in the range from 90 to 315 K and a spectroscopic CL detection system to enable the analysis of electron-beam-induced light emission from nanoparticles across the wavelength range from 350 to 1150 nm. A new technique of light-assisted, size-controlled growth of gallium nanoparticles from an atomic beam has been developed. Through coupling to surface plasmons in nanoparticles, infrared radiation controls the adsorption/desorption rate of gallium atoms on the particles' surface. The experiments revealed a decrease in mean particle diameter (from 68 to 45 nm) with increasing infrared excitation intensity (from 160 to 630 W·cm- 2) during deposition, and the production of larger particles with a narrower size distribution for longer deposition times. Gallium nanoparticle phase-change memory provides an important possibility to achieve small element size and low energy consumption. For the first time, {{it has been shown that}} information can be written into the structural phase of bistable gallium nanoparticles by electron beam excitation and readout achieved via measurements of their CL emission. Change of up to 20 % in CL emission intensity was observed following low fluence (> 35 fJ/nm 2) electron-beam-induced, solid-to-liquid phase switching of a monolayer of 60 nm particles. Selective electron <b>beam</b> <b>addressing</b> and CL readout of individual memory elements (comprising less than 50 particles each), within a gallium nanoparticle film, have been also demonstrated. Numerical modeling of CL emission from gallium nanoparticles, performed using the boundary element method, qualitatively reproduces the experimentally observed effects. Optical antennae are expected to become essential elements of future nanophotonic circuits. For the first time, it has been demonstrated that electron-beam-excited pairs of coupled gold nanorods can act as transmitting optical antennae; i. e. they can efficiently convert the energy from a nanoscale excitation (created by a focused 40 keV electron beam) into far-field visible radiation. Enhanced light emission was observed for electron beam injection points in the vicinity of the junction between coupled nanorods, illustrating the increased local density of electromagnetic states in such areas...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{implementation}} of an optical tweezer system for controlled transport of ultracold atoms along a narrow, static confinement channel. The tweezer system is based on high-efficiency acousto-optical deflectors and offers two-dimensional control over beam position. This opens up the possibility for tracking the transport channel when shuttling atomic clouds along the guide, forestalling atom spilling. Multiple clouds can be tracked independently by time-shared tweezer <b>beams</b> <b>addressing</b> individual sites in the channel. The deflectors are controlled using a multichannel direct digital synthesizer, which receives instructions on a sub-microsecond time scale from a field-programmable gate array.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the major}} {{problems}} that actual logic programming systems have to address is whether and how to prune undesirable parts of the search space. A region of the search space would definitely be undesirable if it can only repeat previously found solutions, {{or if it is}} well-known that the whole computation will fail. Or it may be the case that we are interested in a subset of solutions. In this work we discuss how the <b>BEAM</b> <b>addresses</b> pruning issues. The BEAM is an implementation of David Warren’s Extended Andorra Model. Because the BEAM relies on a very flexible execution mechanism, all cases of pruning discussed above should be considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} analytical investigations on the flexural behaviour of rectangular concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube (CFFT) beams with steel rebar. Eight full-scale CFFT beams and two control reinforced concrete (RC) beams were tested under a four-point bending. Several parameters as the FRP tubes thickness, fiber laminates, and steel reinforcement were studied. The experimental results indicate outstanding {{performance of the}} CFFT beams {{in terms of strength}} and ductility compared to the RC beams. Some CFFT beams attained flexural strength and ductility 540 % and 1430 % higher than that of the RC beams, respectively.

40|$|In this paper, {{we compare}} the {{accuracy}} and resolution of a 3 D-laser scanner prototype that tracks {{in real-time and}} computes the relative pose of objects in a 3 D space. This 3 D-laser scanner prototype was specifically developed to study {{the use of such}} a sensor for space applications. The main objective of this project is to provide a robust sensor to assist in the assembly of the International Space Station where high tolerance to ambient illumination is paramount. The laser scanner uses triangulation based range data and photogrammetry methods (spatial resection), to calculate the relative pose of objects. Range information is used to increase the accuracy of the sensing system and to remove erroneous measurements. Two high-speed galvanometers and a collimated laser <b>beam</b> <b>address</b> individual targets mounted on an object to a resolution corresponding to an equivalent imager of 1000010000 pixels.

50|$|If, {{however, the}} laser is {{approximately}} on resonance, these two <b>beams</b> <b>address</b> the same atoms, those with velocity vectors nearly {{perpendicular to the}} direction of laser propagation. In the two-state approximation of an atomic transition, the strong pump beam will cause many of the atoms {{to be in the}} excited state; when the number of atoms in the ground state and the excited state are approximately equal, the transition is said to be saturated. When a photon from the probe beam passes through the atoms {{there is a good chance}} that, if it encounters an atom, the atom will be in the excited state and will thus undergo stimulated emission, with the photon passing through the sample. Thus, as the laser frequency is swept across the resonance, a small dip in the absorption feature will be observed at each atomic transition (generally hyperfine resonances). The stronger the pump beam, the wider and deeper the dips in the Gaussian Doppler-broadened absorption feature become. Under perfect conditions, the width of the dip can approach the natural linewidth of the transition.|$|R
