5|$|That night, Lisa prays to God and assures him she has {{not turned}} her back on him, but plans to seek a new path to him. While on a walk around town passing many sacrilegious signs, she finds Springfield's Buddhist temple. Inside she sees Lenny and Carl meditating, and Hollywood actor Richard Gere teaches the core {{concepts}} of Buddhism to her. An intrigued Lisa takes a pamphlet on Buddhism and studies it at home. It convinces her of the virtues of the faith, and Lisa announces out her window she has become, and forever will be, a Buddhist. Lisa plants her own bodhi tree in the <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> <b>and</b> begins to meditate, but Marge grows increasingly worried about Lisa's soul and tries to convince her to come back to Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Like Christian IV before him, Gustavus Adolphus came {{to aid the}} German Lutherans, to {{forestall}} Catholic suzerainty in his <b>back</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>and</b> to obtain economic influence in the German states around the Baltic Sea. He was {{also concerned about the}} growing power of the Holy Roman Empire, and like Christian IV before him, was heavily subsidized by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of Louis XIII of France, and by the Dutch. From 1630 to 1634, Swedish-led armies drove the Catholic forces back, regaining much of the lost Protestant territory. During his campaign, he managed to conquer half of the imperial kingdoms, making Sweden the continental leader of Protestantism until the Swedish Empire ended in 1721.|$|E
25|$|Shelter and {{transport}} – In the U.S., the trend towards building houses that were larger-than-needed, by a nuclear family, {{began in the}} 1950s; decades later, in the year 2000, that practice of conspicuous consumption resulted in people buying houses that were double the average size needed to comfortably house a nuclear family. The negative consequences of either buying or building an oversized house was either the loss of or {{the reduction of the}} family's domestic recreational space—the <b>back</b> <b>yard</b> <b>and</b> the front yard; the spending of old-age retirement funds to pay for a too-big house; and over-long commuting time, from house to job, and vice versa, because the required plot of land was unavailable near a city.|$|E

[...] Aguilar's testimony was corroborated by Romero Diaz, who stated that Aguilar did not have a gun. [...] Judge Charles P.

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the <b>back</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>and</b> did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E

2500|$|According to Tarantino, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of making the film was [...] "trying to take myself to a different place as a filmmaker and throw my hat in the ring with other great action directors", as opposed to the dialogue scenes he was known for. The House of Blue Leaves sequence, in which the Bride battles dozens of yakuza soldiers, took eight weeks to film, six weeks over schedule. Tarantino wanted to create [...] "one of the greatest, most exciting sequences in the history of cinema". The crew eschewed computer generated imagery in favor of traditional practical effects used in 1970s Chinese cinema, particularly by director Chang Cheh, including the use of fire extinguishers and condoms to create spurts and explosions of blood. Tarantino told his crew: [...] "Let's pretend we're little kids and we're making a Super 8 movie in our <b>back</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>and</b> you don't have all this shit.

2500|$|Joseph Romano was {{an elderly}} man living with his two nieces, Pauline and Mary Bruno. On August 10, 1918, Pauline and Mary awoke {{to the sound of}} a commotion in the {{adjoining}} room where their uncle resided. [...] Upon entering the room, the sisters discovered that their uncle had taken a serious blow to his head, which resulted in two open cuts. [...] The assailant was fleeing the scene as they arrived, yet the girls were able to distinguish that he was a dark-skinned, heavy-set man, who wore a dark suit and slouched hat. [...] Romano, although seriously injured, was able to walk to the ambulance once it arrived, yet died two days later due to severe head trauma. The home had been ransacked, yet no items were stolen from Romano. Authorities found a bloody axe in the <b>back</b> <b>yard,</b> <b>and</b> discovered that a panel on the back door had been chiseled away. [...] The Romano murder created a state of extreme chaos in the city, with residents living in constant fear of an axeman attack. Police received a slew of reports, in which citizens claimed to have seen an axeman lurking in New Orleans neighborhoods. [...] A few men even called to report that they had found axes in their back yards. John Dantonio, a then-retired Italian detective, made public statements in which he hypothesized that the man who had committed the axeman murders was the same who had killed several individuals in 1911. The retired detective cited similarities in the manner by which the two sets of homicides had been committed, as reason to assume that they had been conducted by the same individual. Dantonio described the potential killer as an individual of dual personalities, who killed without motive. [...] This type of individual, Dantonio stated, could very likely have been a normal, law-abiding citizen, who was often overcome by an overwhelming desire to kill. [...] He later went on to describe the killer as a real-life [...] "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde".|$|E
