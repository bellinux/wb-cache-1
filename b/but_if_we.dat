The heathen Easter had {{much in common with}} May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages there seem to have lingered among the people Easter-games so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate : I allude especially to the custom of Easter eggs, and to the Easter tale which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.|$|E

25|$|Heidegger himself, who is {{supposed}} to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, {{we will not be able}} to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in Being and Time or why he left it unfinished.|$|E
25|$|This, as designed, {{would be}} called a chapel were it part of a college, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> may not aspire to this, yet I have thought {{that it might be}} known as ‘the Hall.’ As such the {{endeavor}} has been to design a harmonious, impressive room, in a style permeated with history and romance; a place which, of all others, will stand out clearly in the loving memory of the student in after years for his Alma Mater. Its walls, columns and arches should bear the trophies won in athletic and scholastic contests, there to be preserved and handed down as part of the glorious history of the school.|$|E
25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} two-dimensional electron gas {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample.|$|E

500|$|The sleeve artwork for Achtung Baby was {{designed}} by Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers, along with Shaughn McGrath. To parallel the band's change in musical direction, Averill and McGrath devised sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with {{the seriousness of the}} individual, mostly monochromatic images from previous U2 album sleeves. Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, [...] "dance-music oriented sleeves. We just did them to show how extreme we could go and then everyone came back to levels that they were happy with. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> hadn't gone to these extremes {{it may not have been}} the cover it is now." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{reflected}} on the film's themes, writing [...] "Little Miss Sunshine shows us {{a world in which}} there's a form, a brochure, a procedure, a job title, a diet, a step-by-step program, a career path, a prize, a retirement community, to quantify, sort, categorize and process every human emotion or desire. Nothing exists that cannot be compartmentalized or turned into a self-improvement mantra about 'winners and losers.'" [...] Brian Tallerico of UGO.com also focused on the film's themes: [...] "Little Miss Sunshine teaches us to embrace that middle ground, acknowledging that life may just be a beauty pageant, where we're often going to be outdone by someone prettier, smarter, or just plain luckier, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> get up on that stage and be ourselves, everything will turn out fine." ...|$|E

500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to please you, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are badly off we must blame you for causing us to give up so much of our lands to our enemies." ...|$|E
500|$|The Democratic {{press was}} unimpressed by Harrison's nomination, and {{attacked}} {{him for not}} publishing his views on the main issues of the day, dubbing him [...] "General Mum". The New York Herald mocked the aging general, [...] "Mrs. Harrison of Ohio is undoubtedly a very excellent matron for her time, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> must take a woman president, let's have youth and beauty, and not age and imbecility." [...] John de Ziska, Washington correspondent for the Baltimore Republican (a Democratic paper) who wrote under the initial Z, alleged that one particularly embittered Clayite had wondered how to [...] "get rid of" [...] Harrison, and the paper printed Z's suggestion: [...] "Give him a barrel of hard cider, and settle a pension of two thousand a year on him, and my word for it, he will sit {{the remainder of his}} days in his log cabin by the side of a 'sea coal' fire, and study moral philosophy." [...] This gibe was quickly reprinted by other Democratic papers.|$|E
500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning.

Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised.

500|$|The Chinese {{government}} subsequently repudiated the Cultural Revolution. A major document {{presented at}} the September 1979 Fourth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee, gave a [...] "preliminary assessment" [...] of the entire 30-year period of Communist rule. At the plenum, party Vice Chairman Ye Jianying declared the Cultural Revolution [...] "an appalling catastrophe" [...] and [...] "the most severe setback to [...] socialist cause since [...]" [...] The Chinese government's condemnation of the Cultural Revolution culminated in the Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China, adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. This stated that [...] "Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great proletarian revolutionary, strategist and theorist.

500|$|Negative reviews {{focused on}} the lack of {{character}} depth or atmosphere. Jaime N. Christley, writing in Slant Magazine, commented, [...] "It goes in for the idea of texture, tics, and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity. ... It hardly seems interested in its characters or in any depiction of their work, settling instead for types of characters and kinds of scenes, correctly placed among the pendulum swings of Watney's dramatic journey." [...] In The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek stated that the actors [...] "are treated as accessories", and that the director is [...] "workmanlike in his approach to science, which always trumps magic in The Martian — that's the point. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't feel a sense of wonder at the magnitude and mystery of space, why even bother?" [...] In Cinemixtape, J. Olson commented: [...] "Ridley Scott and company have concocted the most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science. Not only is The Martian not in the same class as Scott’s two masterpieces – Alien and Blade Runner – it’s not even on the same continent." ...|$|E
500|$|Raymond Fiore of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a B and commented, [...] "If Aaliyah had lived {{to make another}} CD, it might have sounded like Goodies," [...] and said that other album cuts [...] "prove she's no one-track pony." [...] Noting the singles [...] "Goodies," [...] "1, 2 Step," [...] and [...] "Oh" [...] as {{standout}} tracks, Allmusic gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "The voice doesn't blow you away, but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a goodie, she does have a few treats in store." [...] Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, [...] "The talent is obviously there <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> are to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about [...] "the other chicks" [...] then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best." [...] Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that [...] "Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of four minutes and twenty-eight seconds. According to the sheet music {{published}} by Musicnotes.com, [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is a CCM and alternative CCM set in common time in the key of F major with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Mark Hall's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of F5. The song has regarded as a re-invention of [...] "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee" [...] and Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, the song alters {{the format of the}} former, rearranging the song's overall structure while adding a chorus. [...] "Joyful, Joyful" [...] is led by a [...] "driving" [...] and [...] "pulsing" [...] string section that has been compared to Coldplay's [...] "Viva la Vida". Mark Hall felt that the band's arrangement brought out the message of one of the song's final verses ("God our Father/Christ our brother/all who live in love are thine/teach us how to love each other/and fill us to the joy divine"); Hall described the message by saying [...] "God's our father and Christ's our brother, we have this connection with God. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can't love each other, the joy isn't completed. Its not real joy yet until we know how to love the people that are around us".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{box office}} success of J. J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot and the {{announcement}} that actors Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto had tentatively agreed to appear in two sequels, Internet rumors began circulating about {{the plot of the}} second film. Abrams hinted that because of the alternate timeline created in the first film, reintroducing Khan into Star Trek lore remained a possibility. Abrams told MTV, [...] " [...] exist—and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, I would argue that a person's character is what it is," [...] Abrams said of the notion that his Khan could be just as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. [...] "Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan is out there... even if he doesn't have the same issues." [...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E
