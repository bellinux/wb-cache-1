2500|$|According to Williams Belle, the philosophies and {{theories}} behind parkour {{are an integral}} aspect of the art, one that many non-practitioners have never been exposed to. Belle says he trains people because he wants it [...] "to be alive" [...] and [...] "for people to use it". Châu Belle explains it is a [...] "type of freedom" [...] or [...] "kind of expression"; that parkour is [...] "only a state of mind" [...] rather than a set of actions, {{and that it is}} about overcoming and adapting to mental and emotional obstacles as well as physical barriers. Traceur Dylan <b>Baker</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "Parkour also influences one's thought processes by enhancing self-confidence and critical thinking skills that allow one to overcome everyday physical and mental obstacles". A study by Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence (Neuropsychiatry of Childhood and Adolescence) in France found traceurs seek more excitement and leadership situations than gymnasts do.|$|E
2500|$|Hemingway biographer Carlos <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> Hemingway {{captured}} {{the theme of}} [...] "the three ages of man," [...] and in writing the book he finally objectified his own youthful traumatic war experiences. [...] Baker sees a thematic parallel between Thomas Mann's Death in Venice and Across the River and into the Trees, presented {{in a series of}} commonalities and differences. Death in Venice is set in the summer on Venice's Lido; Hemingway puts Cantwell in Venice in the winter. Mann's protagonist is a writer; Hemingway's a soldier. Both face death, and in the face of death seek solace in a much younger character. Cantwell reminisces about the past while Renata (an 18-year-old countess with whom Cantwell spends the last days of his life) lives in the present. Cantwell says that [...] "Every day is a new and fine illusion" [...] where a kernel of truth can be found. Cantwell is a character in opposition: a tough soldier yet a tender friend and lover. The two Cantwells at times overlap and bleed into one another. Hemingway added yet another layer in the characterization: 50-year-old Cantwell [...] in his dying day is [...] "in an intense state of awareness" [...] of his younger self of 1918 to the point that meld – yet retain the differences wrought by time.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{a bargain}} is a bargain. I reckon I can stand it twelve times a year. What a {{sensation}} it'll {{make the first}} Sunday I go! And old Susan <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> I'm going to hell, hey? Do you believe I'll go there--come, now, do you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Tea and Coffee, without hot water.--In Unyoro, Sir S. <b>Baker</b> <b>says,</b> {{they have}} no idea of using coffee as a drink, but simply chew it raw as a stimulant. In Chinese Tartary, {{travellers}} who have no means of making a cup of tea, will chew the leaves as a substitute. Mr. Atkinson told me how very grateful he had found this makeshift.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bob's sister's goin' to {{show him}} how to sing a couple of songs, an' he's goin' to write 'em out on paper so's to have a book to sell," [...] added Reddy, delighted at the {{surprise}} expressed in Toby's face. [...] "Nahum <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> if we {{have any kind of}} a show he'll bring up some lemonade an' some pies to sell, an' pass 'em 'round jest as they do in a reg'lar circus." ...|$|E
5000|$|For example, a first at-bat {{introduction}} {{would have}} <b>Baker</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Now batting for the Phillies, number 11, shortstop Jimmy Rollins!"

50|$|Dare is the {{producer}} or devisor of various (mainly comedy) programmes mainly for BBC Radio and television, including The Mary Whitehouse Experience, Dead Ringers, The Now Show, The Late Edition, I've Never Seen Star Wars and The Secret World, and Brian Gulliver's Travels. He was also {{the producer}} of 8 series of ITV's Spitting Image. A running gag on the radio version of Dead Ringers was Jon Culshaw, {{in the style of}} Tom <b>Baker</b> <b>saying</b> Dare's name in an exaggerated fashion {{at the end of the}} credits.|$|R
60|$|It was {{absolutely}} necessary, {{he said to}} himself, that he should know on what ground he stood; absolutely necessary, also, {{that he should be}} able to talk to some one on the subject. So he wrote to Miss <b>Baker,</b> <b>saying</b> that he intended to do himself the pleasure of renewing his acquaintance with her at Littlebath, and he determined to see Arthur Wilkinson on his way. These were the days in which Wilkinson was taking pupils at Oxford, the days in which he used to think so much of Adela Gauntlet.|$|R
6000|$|Bark Cloth is used {{in several}} parts of the work. It is simply a piece {{of some kind of}} peculiarly fibrous bark; in Unyoro, Sir S. <b>Baker</b> <b>says,</b> the natives use the bark of a species of fig-tree. They soak it in water and then beat it with a mallet, {{to get rid of all}} the harder parts;--much as hemp is prepared. [...] "In {{appearance}} it much resembles corduroy, and is the colour of tanned leather: the finer qualities are peculiarly soft to the touch, as though of woven cotton." ...|$|E
6000|$|Drinking, when riding or walking.--It is {{an awkward}} matter to drink when jolting on wheels, on horseback, or on foot. I adopted {{the plan of}} {{carrying}} a piece of small india-rubber tubing 6 or 8 inches long, and when I wished to drink, I removed the stopper and inserted the tube, just as an insect might let down its proboscis, and sucked the contents. Sir S. <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> {{of the people of}} Unyoro, [...] "During a journey, a pretty, bottle-shaped, long-necked gourd is carried with a store of plantain-cider; the mouth of the bottle is stopped with a bundle of the white rush shreds, through which a reed is inserted that reaches to the bottom: thus the drink can be sucked up during the march, without the necessity of halting; nor is it possible to spill it by the movement of walking." ...|$|E
5000|$|January 9-14: At Geneva talks, <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "regrettably" [...] Iraqi Foreign Minister Aziz has {{indicated}} no softening in Iraq's position. Peace talks break down, {{but there is}} still talk of a peaceful solution to the crisis.|$|E
2500|$|After King's assassination, {{his widow}} Coretta Scott King {{approached}} Baker in the Netherlands {{to ask if}} she would take her husband's place {{as leader of the}} Civil Rights Movement. After many days of thinking it over, <b>Baker</b> declined, <b>saying</b> her children were [...] "too young to lose their mother".|$|R
60|$|What was Miss <b>Baker</b> to <b>say</b> to this? She {{had not the}} {{slightest}} intention of making Miss Todd a confidante in the matter: certainly not now, as that lady was inclined to behave so very improperly with Sir Lionel; and yet {{she did not know}} how to answer it.|$|R
5000|$|Winston 500 - The {{starting}} {{field of}} 50 was expanded to 60 by track management, and it proved controversial {{in the subsequent}} 500, as early in the race Ramo Stott blew his engine on the backstretch and two separate packs of cars hit the oil and crashed; Wendell Scott's car was blasted by several other cars and Scott suffered serious injuries; Buddy Baker and Cale Yarborough were eliminated;, and when {{they got out of}} their cars they had to dodge additional crashing cars. Bobby Allison ripped the track for the enormity of the field - [...] "They (filled the field) all right, all over the backstretch." [...] David Pearson lost the lead draft (<b>Baker</b> <b>saying</b> Pearson fouled out the spark plugs on his Mercury and got them replaced under the lengthy yellow), and with all legitimate challengers eliminated he led 111 laps to an easy win, his fifth of the season and fifth in his consecutive starts.|$|R
5000|$|The JazzTimes {{review by}} Duck <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> [...] "The {{measured}} pace is certainly an intelligent {{response to the}} sax-percussion instrumentation, in which the temptation is to fill up the space instead of letting it become part of things as it does here." ...|$|E
50|$|In May 2011, Blottr beat BBC and SkyNews {{by three}} {{hours in a}} story about a London bomb threat. During the London riots of August 2011, founder Adam <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> the site broke the news of riots in Ealing and Woolwich before {{mainstream}} news outlets.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> {{the film}} {{was meant to be}} a comedy but the {{director}} [...] "lost his courage at the last minute... it would have been wonderful as a comedy but he cut out all the funny scenes and put a serious ending on it." ...|$|E
50|$|Guitar man Nick Azarcon {{started playing}} the guitar {{at the age}} of 12, {{influenced}} by bands that included U2, Echo and the Bunnymen, the Police, and the Cult, and later Rage Against the Machine, Jeff Buckley, Weather Report, Richie Kotzen, and Chet <b>Baker.</b> Azarcon <b>says</b> joining SinoSikat? right after he graduated Architecture at UP Diliman proved a challenge for him due to the band's consistently genre-crossing repertoire.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2015 Baker {{announced}} he would be touring in 2016 with {{a new version of}} Ginger Baker's Air Force. The band booked a world tour under the name Ginger Baker's Air Force 3. It is unclear at this time who the other musicians in the band are but <b>Baker's</b> blog <b>says</b> the band will be him [...] "showcasing new talent and collaborating with old friends." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Iraq Study Group {{examined}} {{a number of}} ideas, including one that would create a new power-sharing arrangement in Iraq that would give more autonomy to regional factions. On October 9, 2006, the Washington Post quoted co-chairman <b>Baker</b> as <b>saying</b> [...] "our commission believes that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives, {{the ones that are}} out there in the political debate, of 'stay the course' and 'cut and run'".|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} for PopMatters Gabriel <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> [...] "Generally well-balanced, eminently exploratory, and {{surprisingly}} funky, Crown Trunk Root Funk {{is a successful}} product from a musician just as adept in the studio as he is on a New York club stage or at any other venue." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "In Baker’s wall-size Portrait of a Whatever Agricultural Excursion (2005), what {{at first}} {{appears to be}} an {{abstract}} pastiche of fluid shapes is, upon closer examination, an overturned race car. As her work has evolved over the past several years, <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> she is less conscious of ‘riding the boundary’ between the historically disparate modes. I used to see them as two different things that I would bring together, but now I feel like they’ve dissolved into one another." ...|$|E
5000|$|Baker {{was born}} in Grand Rapids, Michigan on December 20, 1949. [...] He grew up in Michigan and in Tucson, Arizona, in a house {{designed}} by his self-educated father, Bernard Baker. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy, Thomas Jefferson College, University of Michigan, and University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a master's degree in architecture. [...] <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> {{that he decided to}} become an architect as a child, when his father gave him a book on famous architects.|$|E
6000|$|... 'May be so. Ah, <b>Baker,</b> we <b>say</b> sudden death, don't we? But there's no {{difference}} in their nature between sudden death and death of any other sort. There's {{no such thing as}} a random snapping off of what was laid down to last longer. We only suddenly light upon an end--thoughtfully formed as any other--which has been existing at that very same point from the beginning, though unseen by us to be so soon.' ...|$|R
5000|$|On the {{political}} aspect, the city witnessed {{a number of}} events. Personalities visited the capital, such as former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Pope John Paul II. The former visit came amidst the historical setting {{after the fall of}} communism, as hundreds of thousands were chanting in Skanderbeg Square <b>Baker's</b> famous <b>saying</b> of [...] "Freedom works!". Pope John Paul II became the first major religious leader to visit Tirana, though Mother Teresa had visited few years prior.|$|R
5000|$|Crawford makes a cameo in the 1977 episode [...] "Hustle" [...] of CHiPs, {{which is}} also about the California Highway Patrol. After chatting about Highway Patrol, Officer Jon <b>Baker</b> (Larry Wilcox) <b>says,</b> tongue-in-cheek, [...] "they don't make TV shows like that anymore." ...|$|R
50|$|Once Upon A Twilight was {{initially}} pressed in mono only, as the stereo mix commissioned in America was delayed. An anecdote recorded by rock historian Glenn A. <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> that Linda Ronstadt and her band, the Stone Poneys (including Anglophile songwriter Andrew Gold and future Eagle Glenn Frey), were recording in an adjacent studio and {{heard some of}} the mixing sessions. Impressed with the quality of the songs and performances, Ronstadt and her manager apparently lobbied to secure American release for the Twilights on Capitol records.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> {{he focuses}} on [...] "deep politics" [...] and engages in [...] "forensic journalism" [...] in which he digs deeper into stories than the {{mainstream}} media. Journalist Bill Moyers calls him an “indefatigable researcher from whom I could learn something about a subject that I hadn’t known. A Columbia Journalism Review profile observed that his critics reject his view that mainstream journalism fails to dig, say that [...] "reporters are warned not to go farther than the evidence warrants, {{and they say that}} what Baker sees as audacity is just a cover for sloppy reporting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Vincent Baker {{began using}} [...] "lumpley" [...] email {{addresses}} and URLs in kill puppies for satan (2002); {{he had used}} the name on various online systems, and it would quickly become the name of Baker's indie publishing company too. Baker produced 40 or 50 copies {{of the game and}} sold them all, which would give them the money for his next project; <b>Baker</b> <b>says</b> that he hasn't put a dime into Lumpley since that initial investment. The Cheap and Cheesy Fantasy Game (2001) was the first game by Baker that called itself [...] "a lumpley game." [...] Lumpley Games published Baker's Dogs in the Vineyard (2004). In 2010, Baker replaced the Forge GenCon booth with a small booth for just himself and Lumpley Press.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2011, she explained that [...] "Like many of her works, <b>says</b> <b>Baker,</b> 'Circle Mirror' grew out of research, contemplation and 'fragments of ideas.' She wanted to watch amateurs learn to act. In a windowless room in a community center." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the storyline, several adverts, both {{digital and}} radio, were {{produced}} {{to highlight the}} issue of domestic violence. The soap also created a timeline on their official Facebook page to highlight key moments in the storyline. Lee Mason, the drama commissioning editor at Channel 4, commented that {{the aim of the}} adverts was to [...] "help broaden the awareness of the 'This Is Abuse' campaign with our younger audience." [...] Another advert later aired, showing Patrick rape Maxine. The advert's intention was to highlight that rape can happen within relationships, with Crime Prevention Minister Norman <b>Baker</b> <b>saying</b> that the advert [...] "will encourage teenagers to re-think their views about rape, consent, violence and abuse." [...] Chief Executive Officer of the NSPCC, Peter Wanless said that [...] "too many young people assume violence or emotional abuse is a normal part of relationships. It's vital that we get the message across that it isn't right." [...] Although, the majority of the storyline was well received, Daniel Kilkelly criticized the lack of fallout against Patrick, saying that [...] "most of the village barely batted an eyelid" [...] and that the only reaction was [...] "Darren, who inexplicably decided that this was the best possible moment for Patrick to become his best friend." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first season}} of The Mentalist {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with critics being {{divided on the}} procedural format but praising the performance of Simon Baker. On Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 had an overall rating of 56% from 18 critics, with the consensus saying [...] "The setup and episodic storytelling is far from original, but The Mentalist distinguishes itself from other procedurals mostly due to the talents of Simon Baker." [...] On Metacritic, season one has a score of 65/100, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Robert Bianco of USA Today felt the pilot episode lacked in originality but praised <b>Baker,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "The Mentalist may be a copy, but it's a well-done copy sparked by an actor who has come into his own as a TV star." [...] Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said [...] "the CBS show has very little dramatic heft or distinction, but it's wily and brisk enough to engage you for an hour." [...] Gilbert also praised the chemistry between Baker and Tunney, but criticized the crime cases, feeling they were predictable and at times uninteresting. Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times praised Baker as [...] "virtually irresistible" [...] and said [...] "...psychological sleight of hand can't fill an hour every week. For that you need complicated, interesting crimes and complicated, interesting characters solving them. The Mentalist seems prepared to deliver just that." ...|$|R
