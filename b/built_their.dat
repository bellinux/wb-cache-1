5|$|Apart {{from the}} knights' fortifications, {{over the years}} various {{individuals}} or families <b>built</b> <b>their</b> own fortifications. These were mainly fortified residences or private watchtowers. A notable surviving example is Mamo Tower, built in 1657 in Marsaskala.|$|E
5|$|Several of the castle's former {{residents}} <b>built</b> <b>their</b> houses {{outside the}} fortress and a village called al-Husn has since developed. Many of the al-Husn's roughly 9,000 Muslim residents benefit economically from the tourism {{generated by the}} site.|$|E
5|$|In 1599, a {{partnership}} {{of members of}} the company <b>built</b> <b>their</b> own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of the parish tithes in Stratford.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, Bolckow and Vaughan <b>built</b> <b>their</b> first blast {{furnaces}} at Witton Park, founding the Witton Park Ironworks. The works used coal from Witton Park Colliery to make coke, and ironstone from Whitby on the coast. The pig iron produced at Witton was transported to Middlesbrough for further forging or casting.|$|E
5|$|It {{is certain}} {{that most of the}} Christian {{residents}} of Jifna in the 12th century were local inhabitants. Apart from local Christians there was also a Frankish settlement, as is attested by the ruins of a maison forte (manor) built in {{the lower part of the}} village. In Jifna, like in many other sites in Palestine, the Crusaders <b>built</b> <b>their</b> settlement in the heart of the local Christian settlement.|$|E
5|$|The Maya <b>built</b> <b>their</b> {{cities with}} Neolithic technology; they <b>built</b> <b>their</b> {{structures}} from both perishable materials and from stone. The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style. Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available. The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure. There was great variety {{in the quality}} of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality. Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone. In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed. Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco. Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools. The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs. Heavy loads were lifted with rope, but probably without employing pulleys.|$|E

5|$|When Thomas Rogers died in 1856, his son Jacob S. Rogers reorganized RK, with Ketchum and Grosvenor {{remaining}} as investors, as the Rogers Locomotive & Machine Works. Rogers <b>built</b> <b>their</b> first 2-6-0, {{which is}} {{sometimes referred to}} as the first 2-6-0 built in the United States, in 1863 for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company. The company continued manufacturing both locomotives and textile machinery for nearly another 20 years.|$|E
5|$|A {{recommendation}} from Burstall helped Baxter secure a research engineer position with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in Billingham, where a new chemical factory {{had been established}} to make sodium hydroxide. Here he met Lilian May Thatcher, {{who worked as a}} stenographer in nearby Stockton-on-Tees. The two became engaged, but before they could marry, Alexander Fleck had Baxter transferred to ICI's new General Chemicals Division in Widnes as head of the Central Laboratory. Baxter and Lilian were married in the register office in Stockton-on-Tees on 17 August 1931. Three years later they designed and <b>built</b> <b>their</b> own home in Farnworth, where they lived until 1949. They had four children: a daughter, Valerie; an adopted son, Peter; and sons Dennis and Roderick.|$|E
5|$|After initial preparations, the Americans and French <b>built</b> <b>their</b> first {{parallel}} {{and began}} the bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than ever, the British position began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then <b>built</b> <b>their</b> headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels back towards the Terran headquarters.|$|E
5|$|An inscribed block {{dating to}} the later Ramesside period (1292–1077 BC) and now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, was {{uncovered}} by Lepsius {{in a house in}} Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, partially lost, but probably Sneferu is then followed by Djedefre, Menkaure, Menkauhor and finally Neferkare. The owner of the tomb stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief {{dating to the}} same period shows a similar scene. It was inscribed on the lintel of the tomb chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom <b>built</b> <b>their</b> pyramids at Saqqara: Djoser, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.|$|E
5|$|Chief Keokuk gave {{a generous}} portion {{of land to}} Antoine Le Claire's wife, Marguerite, the granddaughter of a Sauk chief. Le Claire <b>built</b> <b>their</b> home on the exact spot where the {{agreement}} was signed, as stipulated by Keokuk, or he would have forfeited the land. Le Claire finished the 'Treaty House' {{in the spring of}} 1833. He founded Davenport on May 14, 1836, naming it for his friend Colonel George Davenport, who was stationed at Fort Armstrong during the war. The city was incorporated on January 25, 1839. The area was successively governed by the legislatures of the Michigan Territory, the Wisconsin Territory, Iowa Territory and finally Iowa.|$|E

5|$|From its {{beginnings}} in the 1930s, ski flying has developed its own distinct history and {{given rise to}} all of the sport's world records. The first hill designed specifically for ski flying was built in Slovenia in 1934, after which both Germany and Austria <b>built</b> <b>their</b> own hills in 1950. This was followed by Norway in 1966, the United States in 1970, and the Czech Republic in 1980. From the 1960s to 1980s, a friendly rivalry between the European venues saw world records being set regularly, together with hill upgrades and evolutions in technique to fly longer distances.|$|E
5|$|Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab <b>built</b> <b>their</b> {{fortunes}} in Pittsburgh. Also {{based in}} Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements {{as the air}} brake and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks {{played a key role}} in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund technological advances. For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.|$|E
5|$|No Doubt became {{frustrated}} {{at the lack}} of progress they were making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band. Instead, they <b>built</b> <b>their</b> own studio in their garage on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California Although the band had knowledge that they didn't want any songs to be released in an Interscope-distributed album, they recorded The Beacon Street Collection in their studio and Clear Lake Audio in one long weekend. Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.|$|E

5|$|Sunken battlecruisers {{are large}} capital ships {{built in the}} first half of the 20th century that were either {{destroyed}} in battle, scuttled, or destroyed in a weapon test. They were similar in size and cost to a battleship, and typically carried the same kind of heavy guns, but battlecruisers generally carried less armor and were faster. The first battlecruisers were developed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armored cruiser, at the same time the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The original aim of the battlecruiser was to hunt down slower, older armored cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire. However, as more and more battlecruisers were <b>built,</b> <b>their</b> opponents became ships of their own type, not slower, weaker vessels.|$|E
5|$|The Jeffersonian Republicans opposed {{banks and}} cities, and favored France. They <b>built</b> <b>their</b> own {{national}} coalition {{to oppose the}} Federalists. Both sides gained the support of local political factions; each side developed its own partisan newspapers. Noah Webster, John Fenno, and William Cobbett were energetic editors for the Federalists; Benjamin Franklin Bache and Philip Freneau were fiery Republican editors. All the newspapers were characterized by intense personal attacks, major exaggerations and invented claims. In 1801, Hamilton established a daily newspaper, the New York Evening Post and brought in William Coleman as editor. It is still publishing (as the New York Post).|$|E
5|$|The Protestants {{were another}} group that began {{settling}} in Brazil {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century. The first Protestants were English, and an Anglican church was opened in Rio de Janeiro in 1820. Others were established afterwards in São Paulo, Pernambuco and Bahia provinces. They were followed by German and Swiss Lutherans who settled in the South and Southwest regions and <b>built</b> <b>their</b> own houses of worship. Following the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, immigrants from the southern United States seeking to escape Reconstruction settled in São Paulo. Several American churches sponsored missionary activities, including Baptists, Lutherans, Congregationalists and Methodists.|$|E
