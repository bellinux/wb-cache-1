5|$|The {{main body}} of Texian soldiers, under Collinsworth, became disoriented {{in the dark and}} wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a {{mesquite}} thicket. While working their way <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> road, the Texians met Ben Milam, a Texas colonist who had recently escaped from prison in Monterrey. Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard.|$|E
5|$|During the day, {{the storm}} crossed 180°, {{entering}} the western Pacific basin and being re-designated as a typhoon. The storm tracked steadily northwestward, attaining a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a high-end Category 3 storm, before turning <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> east. The storm gradually weakened, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September17 and again crossing the International Date Line. The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters. Throughout its existence, Hurricane/Typhoon Della traveled roughly , the longest known track of any Pacific hurricane at the time.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} break through to Berlin, Wenck's XII Army made a {{fighting}} retreat <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> Elbe and American lines after providing the IX Army survivors with surplus transport. By 6 May many German Army units and individuals had crossed the Elbe and surrendered to the US Ninth Army. Meanwhile, the XII Army's bridgehead, with its headquarters in the park of Schönhausen, came under heavy Soviet artillery bombardment and was compressed into an area eight by two kilometres (five by one and a quarter miles).|$|E

5|$|None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit {{together}} precisely, suggesting {{the presence of}} a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backwards) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend.|$|E
5|$|Ryu has {{the ability}} to jump on and off ladders and walls, and by using the {{directional}} pad, he can climb up or down ladders. Ryu can spring off walls by holding the directional pad in the opposite direction he is facing and pressing the jump button. He cannot attack while on walls or ladders. Players can use this technique to get Ryu to climb up spaces between walls and columns by holding down the jump button and alternating between left and right on the directional pad. Ryu can also vertically climb a single wall by springing off it and then quickly pressing the directional pad <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian expedition, led by Commandant Louis-Napoléon Chaltin, {{reached the}} {{position}} after a month-long advance north-east towards the Mahdist stronghold. The rebels, numbering two-thousand, {{had established a}} two-mile line {{across a range of}} hills, giving their numerically superior forces a tactical advantage over Chaltin's eight-hundred men. After a failed flanking maneuver by the Mahdists, Chaltin's forces stormed the heights and dislodged the rebel defenders. The Congolese companies pursued the retreating Mahdists <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> town of Rejaf, where a final defense was made and similarly defeated.|$|E

25|$|Wauna {{was able}} to extricate No Wonder that Saturday night, by <b>backing</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> {{stranded}} boat, while spinning the stern-wheel at full speed, and thereby making a channel deep enough for No Wonder to pass through.|$|R
5|$|Throughout the day {{large numbers}} of fans, both English and Turkish, were seen {{throughout}} the city and at the airport. Later, {{large numbers of}} Galatasaray fans congregated in Copenhagen's City Hall Square, raising the Turkish flag in the square. Arsenal fans congregated in nearby bars. Galatasaray fans attempted to provoke the Arsenal fans in the bars, and the two sides began chanting at each other until bottles were thrown from both sides around 16:00. The Danish police then moved in to separate the fans, and moved the Galatasaray fans <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> square.|$|E
5|$|While the Australians in AO Columbus had {{successfully}} interrupted the pre-positioning of communist forces {{on one of}} the main approaches to Saigon, in hindsight they had been deployed too late to interfere seriously with the offensive. Over the period 9−12 February 1 ATF redeployed, moving south <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> fire support bases. The remaining companies of 3 RAR subsequently relieved 7 RAR and moved north on 11 February, while 2 RAR/NZ returned to Nui Dat on 13 February. FSB Harrison was abandoned and all command and support elements concentrated at FSB Andersen. Contact was minimal during this period, with just three Viet Cong killed.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, Selver roams {{through the}} forest for five days before coming upon an Athshean settlement. After {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} many days of travel, Selver describes {{to the people of the}} town the destruction of his town, known as Eshreth, by the Terrans, who then built their headquarters at the site. He also tells them about the enslavement of hundreds of Athsheans at the various camps. He says that the Terrans are crazy because they do not respect the sanctity of life in the same way that the Athsheans do, which was why he led the attack against camp Smith. After some discussion, the people of the town send messengers to other towns sharing Selver's story, while Selver himself travels <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> Terran headquarters.|$|E

5|$|After this, the 22nd Brigade moved <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> {{junction}} of Holland and Ulu Padan Roads. Moving while under heavy fire, the battalion established itself {{in its new}} position before 9:00am, but in the confusion of the move, some men found themselves separated from the main body and cut off. In the afternoon, after the brigade position was reoriented to the west, the battalion was placed in reserve. The battalion's positions in the north, situated on the high ground, experienced heavy attack from Japanese aircraft and artillery, as the brigade—supported by Australian and British artillery—fought off two regiments from the Japanese 18th Division {{during the course of}} the night of 11/12 February.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Bannockburn, however, Arundel's loyalty began to shift <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> king. Edward's {{rapprochement}} towards the earl had in fact started earlier, when on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel's royal debts. The most significant factor in this process though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king's new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking {{over control of the}} government, and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel's situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found himself back in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards in the form of official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|As Minerve turned <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> British convoy {{with the}} {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had both been seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Come in,' said a man's voice, {{in reply}} to Sam's rap at the door. Sam made his best bow, {{and stepped into}} the {{presence}} of a lady and gentleman seated at breakfast. Having officiously deposited the gentleman's boots right and left at his feet, and the lady's shoes right and left at hers, he <b>backed</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R
5|$|As {{the forward}} {{companies}} {{began to move}} <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There {{they were able to}} reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed. McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps {{on the left}} and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|At Kalai the {{battalion}} {{moved into the}} Kamandran Mission where they received intelligence reports of a force of about 200 Japanese occupying a position at Gogbulo creek. Fighting patrols were sent out, but no contact was made, although evidence of occupation was found indicating that the Japanese were moving back to a defensive position {{to the north of}} Mavelo river. Before they could launch an assault, however, {{the battalion}} was relieved by the 19th Battalion and on 28 February the 19th crossed the Mavelo. Following this the Japanese withdrew <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> mountains around the Waitavalo and Tol Plantations, and in early March an attempt was made to force a crossing on the Wulwut river. After initially being turned back by intense Japanese mortar and machine-gun fire, the 19th made a successful second attempt, forcing the Japanese back further towards Mount Sugi and Bacon Hill.|$|E
60|$|Instinctively she recoiled and <b>backed</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> house {{immediately}} on her left.

5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were too costly to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E
5|$|Crossing {{the river}} by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs {{up to the}} main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too {{dangerous}} and this road must be followed {{most of the way}} from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back {{to the level of the}} railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tides.|$|E
5|$|During the Duke's {{march to}} the Danube Emperor LeopoldI offered to make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the small principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically agreed to this elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the {{campaign}} of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw <b>back</b> <b>towards</b> <b>the</b> Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, Allied indecision and considerable Dutch hesitancy (concerned as they were {{for the security of}} their homeland), prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage. The French and the Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in their belief that Blenheim had been a lucky strike and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.|$|E
