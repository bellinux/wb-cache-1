5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
50|$|Fred Davis {{scored the}} first century of the tournament, a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 102, {{on the second day}} of his match against Walter Donaldson. Donaldson made a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 120 the {{following}} day. In the next match Joe Davis made a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 131 against Donaldson.|$|R
2500|$|In the 20th century, the {{different}} state rail systems became more integrated, initially creating more <b>breaks</b> <b>of</b> gauge. In 1917, the Federal Government's standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway was completed between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta. [...] However, this required a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge at Kalgoorlie to reach Perth and <b>breaks</b> <b>of</b> gauge at both Port Augusta and Terowie to reach Adelaide. In 1927, {{the last section}} of the Sydney–Broken Hill line was completed between Trida and Menindee meeting the South Australian Railways line at a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge and requiring a further <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge at Terowie to reach Adelaide.|$|R
5000|$|As Hamley Bridge is only 40 mi {{from the}} capital and major port, this <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge soon became a sore point, leading {{lobbying}} over decades to extend the narrow gauge {{all the way to}} the capital and that port. Trains reaching Hamley Bridge may have travelled 600 mi from Oodnadatta, thus illustrating the poor design <b>of</b> this <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge. The <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge at Hamley Bridge was very cramped and poorly sited due to rivers, bridges, gradients and curves, which were difficult to improve upon. There were also shunting delays and a shortage of trucks. A counter proposal to ease congestion at the inadequate facilities at the Hamley Bridge <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge was to shift the <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge northwards to Balaklava, was strongly opposed.

5|$|Bond's number—007—was {{assigned}} by Fleming {{in reference to}} one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which was coded 0075, and {{which was one of}} the factors that led to the US entering the war.|$|E
5|$|Exportation of merinos without royal {{permission}} {{was also}} a punishable offense, thus ensuring a near-absolute monopoly on the breed until the mid-18th century. After the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the export ban, fine wool sheep began to be distributed worldwide. The export to Rambouillet by Louis XVI in 1786 {{formed the basis for}} the modern Rambouillet (or French Merino) breed. After the Napoleonic Wars and the global distribution of the once-exclusive Spanish stocks of Merinos, sheep raising in Spain reverted to hardy coarse-wooled breeds such as the Churra, and was no longer of international economic significance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, high scores in cricket matches were {{becoming}} more common as pitches improved, and in the summer of 1880, Roe gave a prelude to his record <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the following year when he hit 223 in a one-day match against his former school. In competitive, albeit second-class, county cricket, his scores remained significantly lower. Nor did he impress in the trial matches at Cambridge in his second year, resulting in him not appearing for the university that season.|$|E
50|$|Joe Davis {{scored the}} first century of the tournament on 8 November in his match against John Pulman. Pulman potted a red before Davis cleared {{the table with a}} <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 130. Davis scored a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> exactly 100 against Sidney Smith on 3 January. George Chenier scored a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 107 on 19 January in his match against Davis.|$|R
50|$|Hamley Bridge {{ceased to}} be a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge station in 1927 when narrow gauge lines as far north as Gladstone were {{converted}} to broad gauge, Gladstone becoming a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> gauge station in lieu.|$|R

5|$|With the English Reformation and the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> {{communion with}} the Roman Catholic Church, recusant {{scholars}} from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling {{especially at the}} University of Douai. The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.|$|E

Since 1977, {{players from the}} Negro Leagues have been considered by the Veterans Committee, and nine more individuals have been approved by that body. In 2005, the Hall announced {{the formation of a}} Committee on African-American Baseball, which held a 2006 election for eligible figures from the Negro Leagues and earlier 19th-century teams; 17 additional Negro League figures were chosen in that election, including executive Effa Manley, the first woman inducted.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the third}} round Dott failed to get revenge for his World Championship loss, as he was {{defeated}} 3–5 by O'Sullivan. After beating Davis 5–1, Hunter said he wished Davis would speed up his play. In the match Hunter made his fourth century <b>break</b> <b>of</b> the tournament and had <b>breaks</b> <b>of</b> 71, 66, 43, and 53. Hendry was defeated 3–5 by McCulloch by losing five {{of the last six}} frames, and said he was not the player he was. His <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 67 in the last frame was eclipsed by McCulloch's 72, who also made a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 105 in the match. <b>Breaks</b> <b>of</b> 133 and 103 plus further runs of 41, 70, and 87 enabled Perry to beat Robertson 5–3 from 1–3 down. Selby saw off Ebdon 5–3 and said [...] "Hopefully there's more to come." [...] Maguire defeated Bond 5–1, while Wattana beat Lee and Judge beat Fu by the same scoreline.|$|R
5|$|During the Second World War, Turing {{worked for}} the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that {{produced}} Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing {{played a pivotal role}} in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1523 Anne was {{secretly}} betrothed to Henry Percy, {{son of the}} 5th Earl of Northumberland, but the betrothal was broken by Cardinal Wolsey in January 1524 and Anne was sent back home to Hever Castle. In February/March 1526, Henry VIII began his pursuit of Anne. She resisted his attempts to seduce her, refusing to become his mistress, which her sister Mary had been. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to annul his marriage to Queen Catherine so he {{would be free to}} marry Anne. When it became clear that Pope Clement VII would not annul the marriage, the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the Catholic Church's power in England began. In 1532, Henry granted Anne the Marquessate of Pembroke.|$|E
5|$|Endurance {{departed}} from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5 December, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, first year ice was encountered, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19 January 1915, Endurance became frozen fast in an ice floe. On 24 February, realising {{that she would}} be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. She drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the ice and its later movements put extreme pressures on the ship's hull.|$|E
50|$|Joe Davis made a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 143 in {{the third}} frame of his match against Walter Donaldson. He potted all the red, 12 blacks, 2 pinks and a blue {{and then all the}} colours. He made a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 101 the {{following}} day.|$|R
50|$|The highest <b>break</b> <b>of</b> {{the tournament}} was 138 made by both Mark King and Ding Junhui. This {{was the first}} time that the highest <b>break</b> <b>of</b> the tournament was lower than 140 since 1987, when it was 127 made by Steve Davis.|$|R

5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Gaozong and the {{emergence}} of the Mongols, the Song dynasty formed a military alliance with the Mongols in the hope of finally defeating the Jin dynasty. Several tens of thousands of carts full of grain were sent to the Mongol army during the siege. Following the destruction of the Jurchens in 1234, the Southern Song generals broke the alliance, proceeding to recapture the three historical capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang and Chang'an. However, the cities, ravaged by years of warfare, lacked economic capacity and yielded little defensibility. This <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> alliance meant open warfare between the Mongols and the Song Chinese. Ögodei Khan's forces conquered fifty-four out of Sichuan's fifty-eight total districts by 1236, while ordering the slaughter of over a million people that inhabited the city of Chengdu, which was taken by the Mongols with ease.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E

50|$|The highest <b>break</b> <b>of</b> {{the tournament}} was 138 made by John Spencer in his match against David Taylor. Earlier {{in the week}} Eddie Charlton had {{compiled}} a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> 137; however, it did not count as a record because the table was not up to standard.|$|R
5|$|Kinetic {{measurements}} taken {{under various}} solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often {{shed light on}} this chemical mechanism, as they reveal the rate-determining step or intermediates in the reaction. For example, the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate-determining step. Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium, its stable isotope. The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced, due to a primary kinetic isotope effect, which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen. It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions, such as 13C/12C and 18O/16O, but these effects are more subtle.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
5|$|Quite often {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding the <b>breaking</b> <b>of</b> the record. Sports collectible dealers and buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia associated with such milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive {{to the way in}} which their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria that special balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E
