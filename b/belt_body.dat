5000|$|A now-abandoned {{hypothesis}} for {{the origin}} of the Moon was actually called the [...] "double-planet hypothesis"; the idea was that the Earth and the Moon formed in the same region of the solar system's proto-planetary disk, forming a system under gravitational interaction. This idea, too, is a problematic condition for defining two bodies as [...] "double planets" [...] because planets can [...] "capture" [...] moons through gravitational interaction. For example, the moons of Mars (Phobos and Deimos) are thought to be asteroids captured long ago by Mars. Such a weak definition would also deem Neptune-Triton a double planet, since Triton was a Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>body</b> the same size and of similar composition to Pluto, later captured by Neptune.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} quality {{literature}} {{reveals that the}} most important aspect of granting Six Sigma Black Belt (SSBB) certification is the candidate’s ability to successfully complete the required project with the most skillful use of Six Sigma techniques. However, no standardized project evaluation instrument exists, and therefore, it is left up to the experience and subjective interpretation of the trainer to determine if a candidate has mastered the necessary skills to earn certification. This issue has created great controversy in the quality profession, and leaders have called out for the creation of a Six Sigma common core body of knowledge and a standardized project evaluation instrument. This research presents the results of an international survey of Master Black Belts to understand their perceptions of the American Society for Quality’s (ASQ) Certified Six Sigma Black <b>Belt</b> <b>body</b> of knowledge major topics for use in evaluating a Black Belt candidate’s project. The study found that a master Black Belt’s experience in evaluating projects is a statistically significant factor. Those having this specific experience placed a much higher importance on the ASQ’s Certified Six Sigma Black <b>Belt</b> <b>body</b> of knowledge (BoK) topics of Business Process Management and analysis than those having lesser experience. Conversely, the study also found no significant influence based upon where trainers received their certification or by the amount of experience they had in conducting projects. These important empirical findings will provide foundational information for other quality researchers to continue the development of a Six Sigma common core body of knowledge and a standardized project evaluation instrument...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} petrology, O isotopic composition, and Al-Mg isotope system-atics of a {{chondrule}} fragment from the Jupiter-family comet Wild 2, returned to Earth by NASA’s Stardust mission. This object shows {{characteristics of a}} type II chondrule that formed from an evolved oxygen isotopic reservoir. No evidence for extinct 26 Al was found, with (26 Al / 27 Al) 0 < 3. 0 × 10 − 6. Assuming homogenous distribution of 26 Al in the solar nebula, this particle crystallized at least 3 Myr after the earliest solar system objects—relatively late compared to most chon-drules in meteorites.

40|$|The region beyond Neptune's orbit is {{populated}} by numerous bodies with semimajor axes from 31 to 48 AU. This region, {{known as the}} Kuiper belt, should contain primitive bodies, perhaps among the most primitive objects in the solar system. These bodies could be remnants {{of the solar system}} formation. They seem to be dark, volatile-rich objects showing a strong relationship with comets: the Kuiper belt is probably the source of most short-period comets and Centaurs. The Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) could still contain ices and organic compounds in unaltered proportions with respect to those of their formation. Thermal models of bodies moving in Kuiper belt orbits have been developed to follow their evolution and differentiation and to better understand the relations between them and the short-period comets and Centaurs. In these models, we assume that KBOs are porous bodies composed of ices and dust. The solar energy is very low, between 30 and 50 AU, and radiogenic heating becomes a nonnegligible source of energy for differentiation. The radioactive elements, if they exist in sufficient quantity, may modify the original composition of cometary nuclei. In the models reported here, we have assumed that the radiogenic elements stored in the refractory component are K- 40, Th- 232,U- 235, and U- 238, in meteoritic proportions. In some models, we have also included the short-lived radio nuclide Al- 26. The aim of this work is to see how an undifferentiated Kuiper <b>belt</b> <b>body</b> can change its internal structure under the combined effect of radiogenic heating and solar irradiation. Moderate heating can permit the sublimation of the most volatile ices both from the interior and from the surface, depending on the dominant heat source. The main result is that Kuiper belt objects can be strongly volatile depleted. From the surface down to several hundred meters below the surface, the most volatile ices (like CO) can be completely absent...|$|E

40|$|Space {{weathering}} {{is defined}} as the physical and optical changes incurred by material exposed to the space environment. Through studies of lunar soils, these changes are becoming well understood. However, the effects of space weathering are dependent on the physical environment to which the host materials are exposed, and thus, the effects will likely vary from body to body. The optical effects of space weathering result from nanophase iron (npFe(sup 0)) created during micrometeorite bombardment and solar wind sputtering. In the asteroid <b>belt,</b> <b>bodies</b> are farther from the sun than our Moon, and are widely known to incur less solar wind implantation and sputtering. The velocity of impacts is smaller resulting in less melting and vaporization, and therefore fewer space weathering products. The impact rate in the asteroid belt is greater, which will result in more comminution, further diluting any weathering products. Ergo, asteroidal regoliths should contain fewer space weathering products than lunar soils. However, even very small degrees of space weathering can have dramatic consequences for the optical properties of soils. A discussion on the optical effects of space weathering is presented...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} are {{a crucial}} tool {{to understand the}} relationship between debris discs and planetary companions. As debris disc observations are now reaching unprecedented levels of precision over a wide range of wavelengths, an appropriate level of accuracy and consistency is required in numerical simulations to confidently interpret this new generation of observations. However, simulations throughout the literature have been conducted with various initial conditions often with little or no justification. In this paper, we aim to study the dependence on the initial conditions of N-body simulations modelling the interaction between a massive and eccentric planet on an exterior debris disc. To achieve this, we first classify three broad approaches used in the literature and provide some physical context for when each category should be used. We then run a series of N-body simulations, that include radiation forces acting on small grains, with varying initial conditions across the three categories. We test the influence of the initial parent <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> width, eccentricity, and alignment with the planet on the resulting debris disc structure and compare the final peak emission location, disc width and offset of synthetic disc images produced with a radiative transfer code. We also track the evolution of the forced eccentricity of the dust grains induced by the planet, as well as resonance dust trapping. We find that an initially broad parent <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> always results in a broader debris disc than an initially narrow parent <b>body</b> <b>belt.</b> While simulations with a parent <b>body</b> <b>belt</b> with low initial eccentricity (e ~ 0) and high initial eccentricity (0 < e < 0. 3) resulted in similar broad discs, we find that purely secular forced initial conditions, where the initial disc eccentricity is set to the forced value and the disc is aligned with the planet, always result in a narrower disc. We conclude that broad debris discs can be modelled by using either a dynamically cold or dynamically warm parent belt, while in contrast eccentric narrow debris rings are reproduced using a secularly forced parent <b>body</b> <b>belt...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fluvial {{meander belt}} sediments form {{some of the}} most architecturally complex {{reservoirs}} in hydrocarbon fields due to multiple scales of heterogeneity inherent in their deposition. Currently, characterization of meander <b>belt</b> <b>bodies</b> largely relies on idealized vertical profiles and a limited number of analogue models that naively infer architecture from active river dimensions. Three-dimensional architectural data are needed to quantify scales of grain-size heterogeneity, spatial patterns of sedimentation and bar preservation in a direct relationship with the relevant length scales of active river channels. In this study, three large flume experiments and a numerical model were used to characterize and construct the architecture (referred to as ‘archimetrics’) and sedimentology of meander belt deposits, while taking reworking and partial preservation into account. Meander belt sandbody width-to-thickness ratios between 100 and 200 were observed, which are consistent with reported values of natural meander belts. For the first time, the relief of the base of a meander belt is quantified, enabling improved estimates of connectedness of amalgamated meander belts. A key observation is that the slope and number of lateral-accretion packages within natural point bar deposits can be well predicted from fairly basic observables, a finding subsequently tested on several natural systems. Probability curves of preserved architectural characteristics for three dimensions were quantified allowing estimates of bar dimensions, baffle and barrier spacing distributions and container dimensions. Based on this, a set of rules were identified for combining reservoir parameters with the identified probability curves on sandbody dimensions and character, to help create more realistic geomodels for estimating exploration success on the basis of seismic and core data...|$|R
