2500|$|The current working {{uniform of}} the Coast Guard is the Operational Dress Uniform (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round {{primarily}} as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU {{is similar to the}} Battle Dress Uniform of other armed services, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn tucked in. The second generation ODU is worn untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the left shirt pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style <b>ball</b> <b>cap</b> is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with [...] "U.S. Coast Guard." [...] Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the U.S. Public Health Service and the NOAA Corps to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular Navy Working Uniform Type I.|$|E
