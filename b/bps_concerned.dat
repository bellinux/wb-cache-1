40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the model of a biogas station. The {{introduction}} provides a description of principle employed in this model. The model works with data reflecting the quantity and type of the input biomass to determine the potential energy and offer a selection from various co-generation units. Other important input parameters comprise fermentors and mainly the material composition of their walls to help with determination of heat losses. The input parameters are accompanied by the energetic balance model for a Biogas Station (<b>BPS)</b> <b>concerned.</b> The next section of this paper provides verification of the model with respect to an actual BPS subject {{to a series of}} measurements. These measurements focus on electric and heat parameters. The outcome from these measurements was then used to obtain the energetic balance figure. The comparison of measurement results against the model produces slight deviations of the model from the real biogas station only. This paper has been processed pursuant to a long-term research on biogas stations. The biogas station model will be developed further to obtain a more detailed energetic balance for the biogas station...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a partial {{description of the}} main differences between European Portuguese (EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (<b>BP)</b> <b>concerning</b> {{the use of the}} «gerúndio». Two rather distinct syntactic and semantic uses of this verb form are focussed: the periphrastic «gerúndio » and the adverbial «gerúndio». The periphrastic «gerúndio » occurs in combination with auxiliary verbs, forming complex sequences of two verbal elements. In modern EP, it tends to fall into disuse after some auxiliary verbs, the uninflected infinitive (preceded by a preposition) emerging instead. This paper identifies and briefly characterises the contexts where this competition «gerúndio»-infinitive takes place. The second kind of «gerúndio » occurs in adverbial clauses, where it may be associated with a wide spectrum of interpropositional semantic values, like cause, result or mood, just to name a few. After a brief semantic characterisation of the adverbial «gerúndio», the main differences between EP and BP involving its use will be described. Among them, those concerning the use of gerundive clauses preceded by the preposition em and, once again, those involving the competition «gerúndio»-infinitive, stand out...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the general setting for the application of techniques from geometric mechanics and dynamical systems to the problem of asteroid pairs. The paper also gives some preliminary results on transport calculations and the associated problem of calculating binary asteroid escape rates. The dynamics of an asteroid pair, consisting of two irregularly shaped asteroids interacting through their gravitational potential is an example of a full-body problem or FBP in which two or more extended bodies interact. One of the interesting features of the binary asteroid problem is that there is coupling between their translational and rotational degrees of freedom. General FBPs have a wide range of other interesting aspects as well, including the 6 -DOF guidance, control, and dynamics of vehicles, the dynamics of interacting or ionizing molecules, the evolution of small body, planetary, or stellar systems, and almost any other problem in which distributed bodies interact with each other or with an external field. This paper focuses on the specific case of asteroid pairs using techniques that are generally applicable to many other FBPs. This particular full two-body problem (F 2 <b>BP)</b> <b>concerns</b> the dynamical evolution of two rigid bodies mutually interacting via a gravitational field. Motivation comes from planetary science, where these interactions play a key role in the evolution of asteroid rotation states and binary asteroid systems. The techniques that are applied to this problem fall into two main categories. The first is the use of geometric mechanics to obtain a description of the reduced phase space, which opens the door to a number of powerful techniques, such as the energy-momentum method for determining the stability of equilibria and the use of variational integrators for greater accuracy in simulation. Second, techniques from computational dynamic systems are used to determine phase space structures that are important for transport phenomena and dynamic evolution...|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} soft-sediment deformation structures (clastic dykes, load structures, diapirs, slumps, nodulizations or mudcracks) {{identified in}} three sections (Concud, Ramblillas and Masada Cociero) in the Iberian Range, Spain. These sections were logged from boreholes and outcrops in Upper Pliocene-Lower Pleistocene deposits of the Teruel-Concud Residual Basin, close to de Concud normal fault. Timing of the succession and hence of seismic and non-seismic SSDSs, covering a time span between ~. 3. 6 and ~. 1. 9. Ma, has been constrained from previous biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic information, then substantially refined {{from a new}} magnetostratigraphic study at Masada Cociero profile. Non-seismic SSDSs are relatively well-correlated between sections, while seismic ones are poorly correlated except for several clusters of structures. Between 29 and 35 seismic deformed levels have been computed for the overall stratigraphic succession. Factors controlling the lateral and vertical distribution of SSDSs are their seismic or non-seismic origin, {{the distance to the}} seismogenic source (Concud Fault), the sedimentary facies involved in deformation and the observation conditions (borehole core vs. natural outcrop). In the overall stratigraphic section, seismites show an apparent recurrence period of 56 to 108. ka. Clustering of seismic SSDSs levels within a 91 -ka-long interval records a period of high paleoseismic activity with an apparent recurrence time of 4. 8 to 6. 1. ka, associated with increasing sedimentation rate and fault activity. Such activity pattern of the Concud Fault for the Late Pliocene-Early Pliocene, with alternating periods of faster and slower slip, is similar to that for the most recent Quaternary (last ca. 74. ka <b>BP).</b> <b>Concerning</b> the research methods, time occurrence patterns recognized for peaks of paleoseismic activity from SSDSs in boreholes are similar to those inferred from primary evidence in trenches. Consequently, apparent recurrence periods calculated from SSDS inventories collected in borehole logs close to seismogenic faults are comparable to actual recurrence times of large paleoearthquakes...|$|R

While Buddhism and psychotherapy can provide valuable insights for each other, the interchange should not be undertaken in a way that romanticizes or devalue one tradition {{at the expense of the}} other. Of the modern psychotherapies, Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) is increasingly employed as a paradigm through which to apply Buddhist practices and ideas in counseling.

40|$|Objective: This review aims to {{determine}} whether, {{and to what}} extent, dietary caffeine may be a risk to cardiovascular health. Methods: A critical review of the relevant experimental and epidemiologic literature was conducted, with particular reference to studies of caffeine and blood pressure (BP). Results: There is extensive evidence that caffeine at dietary doses increases <b>BP.</b> However, <b>concern</b> that the drug may contribute to cardiovascular disease {{appears to have been}} dampened by (1) the belief that habitual use leads to the development of tolerance, and (2) confusion regarding relevant epidemiologic findings. When considered comprehensively, findings from experimental and epidemiologic studies converge to show that BP remains reactive to the pressor effects of caffeine in the diet. Overall, the impact of dietary caffeine on population BP levels is likely to be modest, probably in the region of 4 / 2 mm Hg. At these levels, however, population studies of BP indicate that caffeine use could account for premature deaths in the region of 14 % for coronary heart disease and 20 % for stroke. Conclusions: Current evidence supports the conclusion that the BP-elevating effects of dietary caffeine may be contributing appreciably to population levels of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Accordingly, strategies for encouraging reduced dietary levels of caffeine deserve serious consideration. Ke...|$|R

We have previously shown that the only patient for which hexokinase deficiency has been so far investigated at molecular level is a double heterozygote carrying a T 1667 →C substitution on one HK type I allele and a 96 <b>bp</b> deletion (<b>concerning</b> nucleotides 577 to 672 in the HK cDNA sequence) in the other allele. To investigate whether these mutations found in the patient with the hexokinase variant referred to as `HK-Melzo' could be associated with hexokinase deficiency, we have expressed in E. coli the wild-type human hexokinase type I and two different mutants carrying the T→C nucleotide substitution at position 1667 and the nt 577 – 672 deletion, respectively. Wild-type human recombinant hexokinase is expressed in bacterial cells as a soluble catalytically active enzyme that, upon purification to homogeneity, exhibited the same kinetic properties of human placenta hexokinase type I. Both mutant hexokinases were also expressed as soluble recombinant proteins under the same conditions, but they showed an impaired catalytic activity {{with respect to the}} wild-type enzyme. In particular, the T 1667 →C substitution, causing the amino acid change from Leu 529 to Ser, is responsible for the complete loss of the hexokinase catalytic activity, while the 96 bp deletion causes a drastic reduction of the hexokinase activity. Taken together, both mutations explain the hexokinase deficiency found in the patient with the `HK-Melzo' variant. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Context. The {{solar corona}} is heated to high {{temperatures}} {{of the order}} of 10 ^{ 6 } K. The coronal energy budget and specifically possible mechanisms of coronal heating (wave, DC-electric fields, [...] ) are poorly understood. This is particularly true as far as the formation of X-ray bright points (<b>BPs)</b> is <b>concerned.</b> Aims. Investigation of the energy budget with emphasis on the relative role and contribution of adiabatic compression versus current dissipation to the formation of coronal BPs. Methods. Three-dimensional resistive MHD simulation starts with the extrapolation of the observed magnetic field from SOHO/MDI magnetograms, which are associated with a BP observed on 19 December 2006 by Hinode. The initial radially non-uniform plasma density and temperature distribution is in accordance with an equilibrium model of chromosphere and corona. The plasma motion is included in the model as a source of energy for coronal heating. Results. Investigation of the energy conversion due to Lorentz force, pressure gradient force and Ohmic current dissipation for this bright point shows the minor effect of Joule heating in comparison to the work done by pressure gradient force in increasing the thermal energy by adiabatic compression. Especially at the time when the temperature enhancement above the bright point starts to form, compressional effects are quite dominant over the direct Joule heating. Conclusions. Choosing non-realistic high resistivity in compressible MHD models for simulation of solar corona can lead to unphysical consequences for the energy balance analysis, especially when local thermal energy enhancements are being considered.

RESULTS: A review of existing data from randomized controlled trials confirms that solid evidence on optimal BP and LDL-C targets is missing, possible interactions between BP and LDL-C lowering treatments have never been directly investigated, and evidence in favour of a beneficial effect of BP or LDL-C lowering on cognitive decline is, at best, very weak.

40|$|Abstract Background Much of the {{literature}} on panic disorder (PD) -bipolar disorder (<b>BP)</b> cormorbidity <b>concerns</b> BP-I. This literature emphasizes the difficulties encountered in pharmacologic treatment and outcome when such comorbidity is present. The present report explores these issues with respect to BP-II. Methods The sample comprised 326 outpatients (aged 34. 5 ± 11. 5 years old; 222 females) with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 3 rd edn, revised (DSM-III-R) PD-agoraphobia; among them 52 subjects (16 %) were affected by lifetime comorbidity with BP-II. Patients were evaluated by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Panic-Agoraphobia Interview, and the Longitudinal Interview Follow-up Examination (Life-Up) and treated according to routine clinical practice at the University of Pisa, Italy, for a period of 3 years. Clinical and course features were compared between subjects with and without BP-II. All patients received the clinicians' choice of antidepressants and, {{in the case of the}} subsample with BP-II, mood stabilizers (for example, valproate, lithium) were among the mainstays of treatment. Results In comparison to patients without bipolar comorbidity, those with BP-II showed a significantly greater frequency of social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol-related disorders, and separation anxiety during childhood and adolescence. Regarding family history, a significantly greater frequency of PD and mood disorders was present among the BP-II. No significant differences were observed in the long-term course of PD or agoraphobic symptoms under pharmacological treatment or the likelihood of spontaneous pharmacological treatment interruptions. Conclusion Although the severity and outcome of panic-agoraphobic symptomatology appear to be similar in patients with and without lifetime bipolar comorbidity, the higher number of concomitant disorders in our PD patients with BP-II does indicate a greater complexity of the clinical picture in this naturalistic study. That such complexity does not seem to translate into poorer response and outcome in those with comorbid soft bipolarity probably reflects the fact that we had brought BP-II under control with mood stabilizers. We discuss the implications of our findings as further evidence for the existence of a distinct anxious-bipolar diathesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cell wall {{polysaccharide}} composition {{changed over}} seed development. Differences between B and <b>BP</b> only <b>concerned</b> the fruit growth period. Coffea arabica var. Laurina, {{also known as}} 'Bourbon Pointu' (BP), is a natural mutant of Coffea arabica var. Bourbon (B). BP {{is known for its}} high organoleptic quality, which is today compared with the well-known 'Blue Mountain'. Cell wall composition of seeds could explain the better cup quality of BP. To test this hypothesis, we investigated possible impacts of the laurina mutation on the cell wall composition of seeds over a time course, and more precisely on polysaccharides. The identification of cell wall polysaccharides (CWP) was deduced from permethylation analysis, whereas cell wall monosaccharide (CWM) composition was estimated using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and H 2 SO 4. The observation of CWM over time allowed defining three phases. The phi 1 phase, from the 8 th to 14 th week after flowering (WAF), was characterized by the predominance of arabinogalactans, arabinoxylans and arabinans. The phi 2 phase, from the 14 th to 20 th WAF, was mainly characterized by the increased importance of highly branched galactomannans at the expense of arabinoxylans. Lastly, galactomannans constituted the main CWP present in the third phase (from the 20 th to the 32 nd WAF), associated with arabinogalactans and arabinans. Variations in CWP composition were connected to fruit and seed development. The end of the phi 1 phase coincides {{with the end of the}} fruit growth, i. e., with the end of the endosperm development. During the phi 2 phase, endosperm becomes milky and then hard due to the galactomannan deposition. Moreover, the phi 3 phase corresponded to the fruit maturation stage in which CWM composition did not change over time. Galactomannans were less substituted and constitute the main seed CWP. Lastly, the evidence of laurina mutation impact on cell wall polysaccharides of seeds was only observed during the fruit growth period. Consequently, the difference of cup quality between B and BP would not be due to CWP composition at the end of the phi 3 phase, i. e., when coffee beans are harvested...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE:: Multiple {{systematic}} reviews {{address the}} effect of antihypertensive treatment in people with diabetes. Here, we summarize current systematic reviews concerning antihypertensive treatment effect at different blood pressure (BP) levels, and relative treatment effect of different antihypertensive agents. METHODS:: We searched MEDLINE, BIOSIS, DARE and CDSR during years 2005 – 2016. Eligibility criteria, number of trials and participants, outcomes analysed, statistical methods used for data synthesis, and principal results were extracted for each review. Review quality was assessed using the assessment of multiple systematic reviews tool. RESULTS:: We found four reviews <b>concerning</b> <b>BP</b> treatment level. These consistently showed that {{the effect of}} antihypertensive treatment on mortality, cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease was attenuated at lower BP levels. If SBP was more than 140 ?mmHg, treatment reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular disease, stroke, myocardial infarction and heart failure. If SBP was less than 140 ?mmHg, treatment increased the risk of cardiovascular death. We found eight reviews concerning choice of agent. We found no difference between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and diuretics in preventing all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, combined cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease and end-stage renal disease. Minor differences exist for stroke and heart failure. Data were limited on people with type 1 diabetes and very elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. None of the reviews concerning choice of agent included all relevant trials.

This study characterized benzo[a]pyrene (BP) metabolism in human epidermis of normal and psoriatic individuals. The basal level of the cytochrome P- 450 -dependent microsomal enzyme aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) and epoxide hydrolase (EH) were measured in freshly keratomed epidermis from 12 normal individuals and from uninvolved skin sites of 12 patients with psoriasis. The induction response of AHH following the in vitro addition of the PAH benz[A]anthracene (BA) was also assessed. The basal activity (mean ± SE) of AHH in normal epidermis was 62. 1 ± 5. 6 units (fmol 3 -hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, 3 -OH-BP/min/mg protein) whereas the activity in uninvolved skin of psoriatic individuals was 62. 9 ± 5. 1 units (NS), Epoxide hydrolase activity was 25. 1 ± 1. 1 (pmol BP 4, 5 -diol/min/mg protein) units in normal epidermis and 24. 8 ± 2. 1 units in epidermis from patients with psoriasis (NS). Following addition of BA (100 μM), in vitro, AHH activity in normal epidermis increased by a mean value of 165 % whereas activity in nonlesional epidermis of psoriatic individuals increased 320 %. Kinetic studies in normal epidermis revealed that the AHH reaction was linear up to 60 min and to 50 μg protein, had a pH optimum of 7. 4, and the Km for BP was 0. 62 MM. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirmed that the pattern of metabolism of BP was quite similar in epidermal microsomes prepared from normal and psoriatic individuals, insofar as the formation of diols, phenols, and quinones was concerned. These studies indicate that human epidermis is capable of metabolizing BP and that there is no significant difference between normal individuals and patients with psoriasis insofar as basal AHH activity or total <b>BP</b> metabolism is <b>concerned.</b> Furthermore, the epidermal enzyme system in patients with psoriasis has a greater responsiveness to environmental PAH than does that of normal individuals...|$|R

After making a brief introduction to the subject, in Chapter I it gives infonnation about the historical background of the BP by stressing the importance of the Mediterranean basin and the European CommunitylUnion's approach to the Mediterranean from 1960 s until today. Chapter II examines Turkey in the framework of the Mediterranean Policy by giving the evolution of EU-Turkey relations since the Cold War. Chapter III analyses the objectives of the EU in the <b>BP</b> as they <b>concern</b> Turkey, first by comparing European, American and Turkish perceptions of security and cooperation in the Mediterranean in the post-Cold War period, then by explaining the structure of the Barcelona Declaration and Turkey's position in this structure. Chapter IV examines whether the EU reached its objectives mentioned in the previous chapter. It mainly argues that due to some problems, the EU could not reach its aims laid down in the Barcelona Declaration. Chapter V analyses Turkish perceptions of Mediterranean security and cooperation in the Barcelona Process by emphasising that Turkey is not enthusiastic toward the Euro-Mediterranean Process. Chapter VI examines the BP in detail from the point of view of Turkish foreign policies. Chapter VII analyses the EU's policy towards Turkey and Turkey's policy towards the EU in the Process. It also argues that, although the Helsinki Summit in December 1999 provided a turning point in EU-Turkey relations by recognising Turkey as a candidate for accession, this could not help the BP to become an effective process for Turkey.

MethodsFifty-five dialyzed uremics were studied by continuous ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, which started before a single hemodialysis (HD) session, continued for 24 hours after HD ended, and was repeated for 15 minutes before the beginning of the next HD. Clinical pre-HD and post-HD routine BP measurements taken the month preceding BP monitoring were retrieved, and echocardiography was performed. ResultsLVH was present in 46 out of 55 patients, and clinical pre-HD arterial hypertension was present in 36 out of 55. There were discrepancies between clinical and monitored <b>BPs,</b> mostly <b>concerning</b> diastolic pre-HD <b>BP</b> since BP readings were lower than monitored BP records (P < 0. 0002). Although both clinical and monitored BPs bore strong direct correlations with the left ventricular mass (LVM), the closest correlations were those for monitored BP. Four groups of patients were identified by BP monitoring: group A (N = 14), with persistently normal BP, and group D (N = 13), with persistently supranormal BP levels. There were also two other groups (group B, N = 19; and group C, N = 9), whose BP values were high before HD, normalized after HD, and then increased again either soon after HD (group C) or later on following HD (group B). Monthly averaged clinical pre-HD mean BP values differed significantly among the four groups [91 ± 10 (SD) mm Hg in group A, 101 ± 7 in group B, 106 ± 6 in group C, and 106 ± 7 in group D; P < 0. 0001, analysis of variance], as did their corresponding LVMs [132 ± 27 g/m 2 body surface area (BSA), 156 ± 26, 201 ± 51, and 200 ± 36; P < 0. 0001]. There were also differences in dialytic age, which was significantly longer in group A patients (109 ± 54 months), who also tended to have higher, although not significantly higher, Kt/Vurea values. No differences, however, were detected among the groups as far as type, dosages, and number of antihypertensive drugs given to each individual patient. ConclusionsThe high prevalence of LVH in the dialysis population might be the result of inadequate diagnosis and therapy of arterial hypertension. Arterial hypertension, in fact, was insufficiently treated in our dialysis center, since patients with varying degrees of severity of both arterial hypertension and LVH were kept on antihypertensive therapy of similar strength. Undertreatment may have resulted from not having recognized and/or from having underestimated the severity of arterial hypertension since some clinical BPs were measured incorrectly. Reluctance to use more aggressive antihypertensive therapy might also result from the deceptive feeling of “normalized” BP that one has following volume unloading with dialysis. This causes both the BP to run out of control between dialyses and LVH to worsen...|$|R
40|$|BioProtein® (BP) is a {{trademark}} for single cell (bacteria) protein, based on conversion of methane, {{with the addition}} of ammonia and oxygen, to a protein source. BP is produced by Norferm AS in Norway, and has been authorized by the EU as a protein source in animal feeds since 1995, for fattening pigs (8 %), calves (8 %) and salmon (19 - 33 %). Significant immune effects were revealed in a toxicity study performed in rats fed a nucleic acid reduced BP product (NABP) and thereafter, similar, but less severe effects were also found after feeding with untreated BP. Additional studies confirmed increased mesenteric lymph node weights in cats and foxes. Due to the undesirable effects and also due to applications for extended use, BP has been assessed by the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) and EU’s Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1995, by SCAN in 2001 and 2003 and by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2005. The EU memberstates United Kingdom, France and Finland have also conducted assessments. The EU approval from 1995 remains unchanged. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority requested the Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety (VKM) to assess the risk of using BP as a protein source in feedingstuffs, both for the animal categories already authorized and for extended use to pet animals, chickens and pigs from weaning to slaughter. The Norwegian Scientific Committee for Food Safety was asked to consider all existing documentation. Based on all documentation enclosed with the request from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and published scientific articels, an opinion on the safety of BP assessed by the VKM panel on Animal Feed was published on 20 March 2006 (05 / 608 -final-rev 1). The Producer made a complaint regarding this opinion and claimed that not all documents on BP had been evaluated. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority then requested VKM to revise its opinion on the risk of using BP as a protein source in feedingstuffs, based on 17 documents previously not available to VKM, in addition to the 20 documents included in the opinion published on 20 March 2006. BP is composed of a protein with a somewhat different amino acid compostion compared with fish meal, but BP and fish meal have more similarities in amino acid content than soybean meal. BP has relatively high level of nucleic acids, phospholipids, lipopolysaccarides and minerals. Effect studies with BP have been conducted in rats/mice, pigs, chicken, cats, foxes, and salmon. Most of the concern regarding the side effects of BP in feed is related to the immune response. The main findings include changes in weight and morphology of mesenteric lymph nodes, followed by induction of specific antibodies. Histopathological examination after feeding with NABP also revealed changes in the intestines and several internal organs indicating systemic effects. The Producer claims that the immune response seen in BP-fed mice/rats is most likely a normal response to ingestion of large doses of a foreign antigen, and further, that oral tolerance towards this protein is induced over time. However, these interpretations are not adequately supported by the supplied documentation. A tendency towards adaption might be indicated in some of the studies, other results argue against tolerance induction. It is unclear whether the content of phospholipids, lipopolysaccarides, nucleic acids or the protein structure, or the combination of these compounds is responsible for the immunological changes observed. However, the particulate structure of BP has been shown to influence the observed immune response as the systemic immune response was avoided by ingestion of BP free of whole cells. The studies conducted in target species have not included adequate examinations of the immune effects from ingestion of <b>BP.</b> <b>Concerning</b> terrestrial species, no histopathological effects were revealed in the pig, chicken, cat or fox studies. However, increased mesenteric lymph nodes were reported in cats and foxes fed BP. In the remaining studies the main focus has been on production parameters; weight gain, feed intake, feed efficiency, metabolism of nutrients, observation of clinical health, and product quality. When the contents of amino acids were balanced, the inclusion of low levels of BP (9 %) tended to stimulate growth in pigs and the same tendency was found in chicken with 6 % BP. Higher feed levels of BP tended to cause a reduction in growth. In salmon, a dose dependent improvement of growth was reported in a short term experiment (8 weeks). However, in longer term experiments with salmon, depressed growth and increased liver weight were observed in freshwater at 19 % BP with no-effect-level at 10 %. In seawater studies, a tendency of reduced growth was found in salmon fed with 20 % BP in the diet, and BP levels of 27 % and higher levels resulted in significantly reduced body weight. Furthermore, levels of 27 % BP and above in fish feed reduced specific immune responses, but increased lymphocyte response, and also tended to improve the survival after bacterial and viral infections. At 37 % BP in the diet histopathological changes in the distal intestine, and reduced storage of glycogen and increased lipid deposition and liver weight were observed. No negative effects were seen in salmon in seawater at a feed level of 13. 5 % BP. The results indicate negative effects in salmon at BP levels in fish feed considerably lower than those currently approved (19 and 33 %, in feed for salmon in fresh and sea water, respectively). To conclude, in terrestrial target species documented effects of BP include reduced weight gain and increased weight of mesenteric lymph nodes. In the more thoroughly studied species the rat, findings incluse histopathologic effects in mesenteric lymph nodes, changed humoral immune responses, increased weight of other lymphoid tissue (spleen), increased level of neutrophile granulocytes, and slight leakage of hepatic and renal tubuli enzymes. In terrestrial target species, 6 % BP in the feed is considered to be the highest inclusion level not to cause such effects. The results from the rat studies show a similar no-effect-level. In salmon, reduced weight gain, liver storage effects, changed humoral and celluar immune responses and histopathological effects in the intestine are documented. A 10 % level of BP in fish feed is the highest level tested without causing such effects. There are relatively few valid studies for the risk assessment of BP in target species, and the designs of the assessed studies are very variable. Thus, there are qualitative and quantitative uncertainties concerning the effects of BP in target species. The Panel on Animal Feed is of the opinion that an inclusion level of BP of 6 % in the diets to terrestrial target animals and a 10 % maximum inclusion level in salmon feed (both for fresh- and seawater stages) would reduce the risk of potentially adverse effects in the animals. The risk associated with the human consumption of products from animals fed on BP is considered negligible. However, the production of single cell protein for feed production represents a relatively new scientific approach which implies precautionary handling...|$|R
40|$|Trabalho Final de Mestrado Integrado, Ciências Farmacêuticas, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2014 INTRODUCTION The {{worldwide}} {{prevalence of}} Hypertension {{is estimated to}} be 30 to 40 % of the total population. In Portugal, 42. 4 % of adult population is hypertensive. Being a chronic and usually asymptomatic disease, blood pressure (BP) monitoring can promote patients awareness, adherence to medication and other healthy lifestyle behaviours. Nowadays, BP measurements take place not only in the clinical setting as many patients also have monitoring devices at home. This study aims to understand <b>BP</b> monitoring practices <b>concerning</b> frequency and place of measurement, reason for measuring and measuring device. METHODS This study is part of the baseline phase of the HiDia project, an interventional study that aimed to evaluate the effect of an educational and behavioural intervention on the promotion of hypertension control among patients followed-up at the primary care level, in Lisbon region. Non-controlled hypertensive patients were selected from a convenience sample of primary care centres, among a list of patients with systolic blood pressure = 140 mmHg or diastolic = 90 for individuals without diabetes, and systolic blood pressure = 130 mmHg or diastolic = 80 when having diabetes mellitus. At the baseline interview, socio- demographic and clinical variables were obtained and held three BP measurements. For the characterization of BP monitoring practices, variables as local, and frequency of BP measurement, as well as reasons and having a measuring device, were collected. It was used R software for different statistical tests performed: Chi-squared test, Student t test and Mann-Whitney test, when the requirements for using Student t test were not fulfilled, and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Mean SBP values obtained in the face-to-face interview was 141. 8 (ñ 17. 6) and mean DBP was 82. 2 (ñ 11. 2). From the total participants in this study 108 (42. 5 %) had a controlled BP. Most (54. 9 %) participants referred to measure BP usually at home. The pharmacy was indicated by 25. 9 % of the people. <b>Concerning</b> frequency of <b>BP</b> measurement, 38. 8 % participants measured it once or more per week. The majority of people had a blood pressure monitoring device in the beginning of this study. Most people that measure BP (98. 6 %) at home do possess a BP measurement device. Most people who measure BP once or more per week were males, have a BP monitoring device and did not report to have high cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS According to the European Society of Hypertension, to hypertensive patients, it is considered frequent to measure BP once or twice a week. In this study, 38. 8 % of participants measured BP once or more per week. As for the location of BP measurements, most people frequently performed it at home. This {{can be seen as a}} way of maintain and improve self-management of hypertension...|$|R

"The April 20, 2010, {{explosion and}} collapse of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in the release of millions of barrels of oil into Gulf waters. The response to this disaster involved the efforts {{of tens of thousands of}} workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and tar ball removal from beaches, oil skimming and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors. The Deepwater Horizon oil release was an unprecedented event in the United States in many respects, requiring response work across a vast area of multiple jurisdictions. The type, location, and quantities of oil released; the types and quantities of dispersant used; and climatic and geographical conditions differentiate this release from past oil spills. On May 28, 2010, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a request for a health hazard evaluation (HHE) from <b>BP</b> management <b>concerning</b> health effects experienced by responders to the oil release. The request was prompted by the May 26, 2010, hospitalization of seven fishermen who were working in BP's Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program in the Gulf of Mexico. The fishermen had been hospitalized for symptoms that were initially believed to be related to exposures experienced during their response activities, particularly booming and skimming oil. In response to this request, we began an investigation on June 2, 2010, with an opening meeting held at the BP Operations Center in Houma, Louisiana. In attendance were representatives from NIOSH, BP, the Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health (CTEH), O'Brien's Response Management, the U. S. Coast Guard (USCG), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Objectives of this opening meeting were to discuss the initial investigations conducted by CTEH and OSHA into the events surrounding the hospitalization of the fishermen and to plan the NIOSH investigation. These plans included interviews, health symptom surveys, and on-site industrial hygiene assessments of response work activities similar to those performed by the fishermen. As the plans were developing, BP requested that we expand the scope of the HHE to include all major offshore response activities. In addition to oil booming and skimming conducted by workers on VoO vessels, these activities included aerial and vessel-based dispersant releases, in-situ surface oil burning, containment and recovery work at the oil source, and other related offshore oil removal activities. In the weeks that followed, teams of NIOSH industrial hygienists, medical officers, and other occupational health specialists conducted on-site investigations at locations throughout the Gulf region to collect quantitative and qualitative data on potential worker exposures, health symptoms, work practices and procedures, and work organization. On June 22, 2010, NIOSH received a request from BP for a second HHE to investigate potential hazards associated with onshore response work activities. In response to this request, teams of NIOSH personnel evaluated practices and procedures including wildlife cleanup operations, beach cleanup operations, and decontamination and waste management activities throughout the states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. In contrast to the offshore evaluations, which relied on traditional industrial hygiene exposure assessment methodologies and quantitative exposure monitoring to identify potential hazards, the onshore assessment relied on qualitative assessment techniques, including the use of professional judgment and expertise during observations of onshore work activities. Health symptom surveys, however, were similar to those used for the offshore evaluations. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. These assessments were not intended to describe or investigate potential long-term or chronic health effects. The results of these investigations were reported in a series of nine interim reports and report summaries posted on the NIOSH website. The full reports were distributed electronically to key contacts for each work activity evaluated. Included in the reports were conclusions regarding the extent of hazards and exposures identified as well as recommendations for improving workplace conditions. Furthermore, all exposure and health symptom survey data were compiled in electronic spreadsheets and posted on the NIOSH website. This information can be accessed at [URL] Additional information about other components of the NIOSH Deepwater Horizon response activities outside of the HHE investigation, including response worker rostering efforts, analyses of injury and illness data, and guidance and educational materials developed for the response can be found on the NIOSH website at [URL]. This final report summarizes our evaluations made during the course of the offshore and onshore HHE investigations and describes the conditions and characteristics encountered during the event. Overarching conclusions and recommendations drawing from the entirety of the HHE investigations are also presented. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Bradley S. King, John D. Gibbins. "HETA 2010 - 0115. ""August 2011.
