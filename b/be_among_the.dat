5|$|Morphological {{studies have}} been {{inconclusive}} about the evolutionary relationships of the tasselled wobbegong, but overall have gauged it to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> more derived wobbegong (Orectolobidae) species.

This result supports the synonymization of Eucrossorhinus with Orectolobus. Molecular clock estimation placed the speciation of the tasselled wobbegong at 11–6 Ma, coinciding with a period of significant geological rearrangement {{and the formation of}} coral reef habitats in the region.|$|E
