40|$|The EU is {{developing}} a <b>border</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> aiming at an “integrated and global response ” to the challenges posed by the phenomenon of irregular immigration through the common external borders. “The Southern maritime borders ” constitute {{one of the main}} targets addressed by this strategy. On November 2006, the European Commission published a communication calling for the reinforced management of the EU’s Southern maritime borders and for the maximisation of the capacities of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union – FRONTEX. This paper provides some reflections about these current policy approaches by looking at the nature, scope and practical implications of the implementation of the Integrated <b>Border</b> <b>Management</b> <b>strategy</b> and its relationship with a common EU immigration policy. After assessing the latest policy developments in these areas, we raise a number of questions about some of the functions and capacities carried out by FRONTEX, and present a series of vulnerabilities characterising the joint operations coordinated by this Community body taking th...|$|E

The Stockholm Programme endorsed by the European Council on December 2009 and the European Commission’s action plan implementing it published in April 2010 have {{brought back to the}} EU policy agenda the feasibility of setting up a European system of border guards as a long-term policy vision. This Working Document examines the origins of this proposal and aims at thinking ahead by asserting that any future discussion and study in this context should be refocused by initially addressing two central questions: First, what kind of ‘border guard ’ and what kinds of ‘border controls ’ does the EU need in light of the current EU acquis on external border crossings and the Schengen Borders Code? Second, what would be the ‘added value ’ of any new institutional arrangement at the current stage of European integration? The answer to these questions could presage the establishment of a common European border service aimed at i) guaranteeing a uniform implementation and high-standard application of EU border law and the materialisation of a European approach to external border controls; ii...|$|E

40|$|Islands play a {{significant}} role in international irregular maritime migration. Frequently they are part of maritime interstitial spaces between states, and their location, combined with institutional membership, makes them part of international migration routes and subject to <b>border</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies.</b> In this paper borders are analysed as social institutions used for regulating relative permeability through rules of entry and exit for persons, goods and capital. Borders institutionalize territoriality and are politically implemented by states. They are selective, also in migration, and irregular border transit is not always indicative of an inability to control. The Canary Islands are used as an illustrative example of how <b>border</b> <b>management</b> at the southern edge of the European Union has evolved towards more coercive deterrence and tighter surveillance. The Canary Islands experienced irregular maritime immigration from the west African coasts during the first decade of the 21 st century and most of these migrants intended to use the islands as transit space towards the European continent. Increasing surveillance in countries of origin, enforcement of border controls and stricter return policies were used to stop flows. The so-called “cayuco crisis” in 2006 induced institutional change in <b>border</b> <b>management</b> and forced the active involvement of the EU through FRONTEX...|$|R
40|$|The {{analytical}} and statistical services of <b>border</b> <b>management</b> organizations in Central and Eastern European countries have registered and accumulated a vast {{body of knowledge}} on the demographics and mechanisms of illegal migration over the last one-and-a-half decade. This paper attempts to tap this resource by summarising {{the results of a}} yearly survey among border guards of 17 countries. A set of quantitative indicators of illegal migration is developed, presented and interpreted, based on the answers of the border services to a series of quantitative and qualitative questions. This empirical material is used to evaluate the dynamics and pattern of illegal migration in Central and Eastern Europe on the one hand, and to examine the development of <b>border</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> on the other. The impacts of legal and institutional reforms are investigated in light of the temporal and spatial variations of border apprehension statistics. The interdependence of the two processes is reviewed {{from the point of view}} of national <b>border</b> <b>management</b> authorities, perhaps the most authoritative source of information on the issue. The results of the authors’ annual survey indicate that the progressive development of migration control mechanisms at national and international levels seems to have a significant impact on irregular migration flows as most indicators of illegal migration have significantly decreased after the turn of the century. At the same time, the geographical distribution of illegal migration flows in Central and Eastern European countries has become more complex over the years...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{proposals}} of the European Commission for a European <b>Border</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Strategy</b> {{are based}} on an almost blind faith {{in the use of}} large-scale databases, identification measures and biometrics for immigration and border control purposes. It is clear that these measures entail a risk to the protection of not only the right to privacy and the right to data protection, but also to the freedom of movement and the principle of non-discrimination. This paper by Evelien Brouwer, lecturer at the Law School of Utrecht University, considers the human rights implications of the Schengen Information System (SIS). Describing the case of Mr. and Mrs. Moon, who have been reported as “inadmissible ” in the SIS for more than ten years, the difficulties for third-country nationals trying to remedy a false or unlawful SIS report are highlighted. The Moon case illustrates that the outcome of national proceedings dealing with an SIS alert can be very different. The author concludes with recommendations to guarantee individuals ’ rights to effective remedies and to improve the position and powers of national courts.

40|$|MM thesis - P&DMThe {{state of}} South Africa’s borders and ports of entry (i. e. the land borders, {{airports}} and harbours) {{indicates that there}} are serious challenges. It seems that {{little research has been}} conducted on the key challenges faced in the safeguarding and protecting borders in South Africa. There is a need to investigate why there is lack of a collective approach to border control by all the departments tasked with border control and it is imperative to come up with strategies of redressing the key challenges of border management in order to mitigate the security threats and risks. The purpose of this research is to investigate, the key challenges of South African borders (at the land borders, airports and harbours). This research was qualitative in design. The research intends to explore the challenges in detail, paying attention to destabilizing factors posing threats to national security. Also ensuring that departments and agencies responsible for border control aims at the development and harmonization of migration. This study recommends challenges on border security management are identified to ensure that the National integrated <b>border</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategy</b> is strengthened, and that a working balance between security, trade facilitation, tourism promotion, economic development in Republic of South Africa (RSA) and within the SADC region is created.

40|$|International <b>border</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> {{have become}} the favoured {{practice}} to counter global threats, notably terrorism, migration flows and ‘weak states’. This article shows how border security assistance is translated and has political consequences in contexts where sovereignty is contested. It first offers a new conceptualization of contemporary security assistance {{as a form of}} ‘statebuilding lite’. These practices are void of comprehensive strategies for broader security governance, and are decentralized, pragmatic and ad hoc. The modus operandi is one whereby each donor develops its own niche, and directly supports specific agencies in the target state. Secondly, the article demonstrates how these tendencies play out in the {{one of the most important}} contemporary cases. Assistance to Lebanon since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war is particularly revealing, since Lebanon has received large numbers of Syrian refugees crossing its borders; witnessed rekindling of sectarian violence; and harbours Hezbollah, whose military operations in support of the Assad regime in Damascus draws Lebanon directly into the Syrian conflict. The ensuing situation, where vast amounts of security assistance reach Lebanon's many security agencies in complex ways, can best be described as a security assistance ‘bonanza’. In a micro-study of how the Lebanese Army, police, intelligence and customs agencies have engaged with an EU <b>border</b> <b>management</b> project, the article analyses how discourses of ‘integration’ have encountered the hybrid Lebanese context. It asserts that in the absence of a domestic political strategy, the state reverts back to basic modes of security-driven governance, aided by the readily available security assistance by actors with primarily strategic priorities. Drawing on the case of Lebanon allows us to fundamentally re-think how contemporary security assistance is practiced, and permits conceptualizations of global–local security linkages in a post-national world...|$|R

40|$|Both {{globalization}} and the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks spawned heated debates about border security. It is widely agreed {{that in a}} globalizing world borders should be as open as possible and {{much has been written}} in recent years about the value of 'soft' borders in maintaining good relations between neighboring states, creating borderland prosperity and developing successful open market economies. The reality, {{in many parts of the}} world, is that borders are hardening rather than softening as states, more than ever; seek to protect themselves from perceived external threats and to ensure that their frontiers are secure. Thus, today, managing borders and maintaining their security is a complex and challenging task for states. The aim of this thesis is to examine the implications of the re-emergence of security as a key dimension of boundary management and to seek answers to questions such as "Can borders actually be made secure?" and "If so, what <b>border</b> <b>management</b> <b>strategies</b> are available and how are they working in practice?" mostly, in Mongolia. According to the Mongolian National Security Concept of 1993, one of the nine securities of Mongolia, the security of Mongolian existence is defined by the guarantee of its independence, sovereignty, inviolability of state borders and territorial integrity. In the last 15 years, necessity of improvement in state border protection has arisen as a result of the changed foreign policy and socio-economic situation, military and political circumstances of the world and regions and the trends of the relations with neighboring countries. The thesis explores the effects of the policy options on the prevention of terrorism within Mongolian borders. It also explores the effects of those policy options on the movement of people across international borders. The scope is limited to border security policy and the implications are drawn for Mongolian policy makers. Three case studies are included from the Border Protection services of (1) the United States, (2) the Russian Federation and (3) the People's Republic of China. It is generally accepted both practically and theoretically that secure state borders are an integral part of national sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of any nation. In the Information Technology dominated new century, the guarantee of national state borders' security and protection may be ensured if the specific national traditional ways of ensuring border security are creatively adjusted to modern international standards and to the latest scientific and technological trends...|$|R
