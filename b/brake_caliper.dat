25|$|The <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> is the {{assembly}} which houses the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually made of plastic, aluminium or chrome-plated steel.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower unsprung weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front braking power necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The rear <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
25|$|Following the LFA's release at the Tokyo Motor Show, Lexus {{unveiled}} a website with a 'LFA configurator' which allowed users to select {{exterior and interior}} colors, <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> colors, seats, steering wheel leather, and other interior designs. In total, there were over 30billion possible configurations. Each LFA was hand-built by a dedicated production team of engineers and specialists at Toyota's Motomatchi plant in Aichi, Japan.|$|E

25|$|The rotor {{is usually}} made of cast iron, but may {{in some cases}} be made of {{composites}} such as reinforced carbon–carbon or ceramic matrix composites. This {{is connected to the}} wheel and/or the axle. To retard the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads, mounted on the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper,</b> is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically against both sides of the rotor. Friction causes the rotor and attached wheel to slow or stop.|$|E
25|$|Before the South African Grand Prix, Hunt {{was confronted}} by customs {{officials}} who searched his luggage, finding no illegal substances except a publication that contravened the strict obscenity laws of South Africa. Hunt was later released, and tested at Kyalami where his McLaren M26 suffered a loose <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> which cut a hole {{in one of the}} tyres. He recovered and put the car on pole position. The race saw Hunt suffer a collision with Jody Schekter's Wolf and another with Patrick Depailler's Tyrrell, but he still managed to finish 4th.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Honda only offered one model, {{designated}} as the Hawk, now simply designated CB400T. The CM400E took {{over the role of}} the cheaper Hawk I. It is similar to the European CB400NA. It has the same European styling and six-speed manual gearbox, although the pegs, footrest and gear lever are in the same position as the earlier Hawk variants. The bike became electric start only. Smaller 30mm Keihin CV carburettors with accelerator pumps were fitted to comply with US emissions controls. The 1981 model is similar to the European CB400NB and has a dual piston front <b>brake</b> <b>caliper,</b> plastic front fender and a different tank shape.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Mark Webber, both Mercedes drivers expressed delight at their result. Hamilton in particular described his race as [...] "great" [...] {{and added that}} he [...] "loved {{the fact that we}} had to come through from far behind." [...] Sebastian Vettel meanwhile was satisfied with his start, but lamented the red flag situation and said that Ferrari had not expected Mercedes to opt for the harder tyre compound and go until the end of the race. He later added that he was confident that Ferrari had closed the gap to Mercedes and would be able to compete for the championship throughout the season. Nico Rosberg later revealed that the team had been close to retiring his car due to persisting brake issues caused by debris caught in the <b>brake</b> <b>caliper.</b> However, he was able to manage the brake temperatures to secure victory. Rosberg also apologised to his teammate for making contact and forcing him wide at the start.|$|E

500|$|The suspension, which {{controls}} the relative {{motion of the}} chassis and the wheels, {{is similar to that}} of the BT48: it features double wishbones front and rear, with the springs and dampers mounted on the chassis out of the airflow and activated by pullrods. Anti-roll bars are fitted front and rear. The BT49's disc brakes are mounted outboard, within the wheel hubs, and are activated by a single four piston <b>brake</b> <b>caliper</b> for each wheel. For most of the BT49's career, it used conventional steel brakes. Lighter reinforced carbon-carbon discs and pads, a technology that Brabham had introduced to Formula One in 1976, were used in 1981 and 1982; The wheels are of [...] diameter, although occasionally [...] wheels were used at the front. The car initially raced on Goodyear tyres, but the team had to adapt the BT49 to Michelin's new radial tyres for part of the 1981 season when Goodyear temporarily withdrew from Formula One. Slick tyres were used in dry conditions and treaded tyres in the wet.|$|E
