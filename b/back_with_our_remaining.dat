Suddenly the firing ceased and again a trumpet called. Now they charged us in column, a thousand or more Tlascalans leading the van, followed by the Spanish force.

Crime scene investigators can then move in and process the site for evidence. Following the securing and processing of the clan lab {{we move into the}} next phase, which is categorizing the chemicals and wastes and removing the gross contamination from the site. This article discusses the different methods used to make the illegal drugs at clandestine laboratories, the chemicals involved in those methods, and the hazards associated with those chemicals. In our original article we noted that clan labs can manufacture stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens, and narcotics. However, in 2004 the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) found that ninety eight percent (98 %) of seized laboratories were producing methamphetamine. 1 Obviously, the health and safety concerns vary based on the type of drug manufactured and the production method used, but given this fact we will focus on methamphetamine production methods...|$|R
40|$|As he {{explains}} {{in the first}} note, Miller wrote {{the first version of}} his contribution {{on the basis of the}} version of my paper “Beauty, a road to the truth(?) ”, as it was in July 2000. The final version (Kuipers 2002) 1, is not only revised to some extent in the light of Miller’s comments but it is also substantially enlarged, in particular Section 2 (“Aesthetic induction and exposure effects”). This explains why Miller in his final version does not touch upon this specimen of “naturalized philosophy, ” based on results in experimental psychology. My reply will deal <b>with</b> <b>our</b> <b>remaining</b> disagreements regarding the nature and role of empirical and aesthetic criteria in the evaluation of scientific theories. But I would first like to express my appreciation for his exposition of four theories of truth approximation in his Section 1. Tables 0 and 1 are of course attractive from my point of view. They suggest that my approach is a kind of improvement not only of Popper’s original approach but also of the two parallel improvements of that approach by Harris and Miller. Technically, they represent a very informative structuring of the possibilities for “content theories ” of verisimilitude, as Zwart (1998 / 2001) calls them. However, although Miller apparently can appreciate my approach to truth approximation in general, he is rather reserved in two respects: the role I assign to empirical successes and my analysis of aesthetic considerations...|$|R

As the Dominion of Newfoundland was a self-governing country equal to Canada until 1949, there are large, though uncoordinated, feelings of Newfoundland nationalism and anti-Canadian sentiment among much of the population. This {{is due in part}} to the perception of chronic federal mismanagement of the fisheries, forced resettlement away from isolated settlements in the 1960s, the government of Quebec still drawing inaccurate political maps whereby they take parts of Labrador, and to the perception that mainland Canadians look down upon Newfoundlanders. In 2004, the Newfoundland and Labrador First Party contested provincial elections and in 2008 in federal ridings within the province.

We address the two components of this problem by describing a distri-buted algorithm to create consistent checkpoints, {{as well as a}} rollback-recovery algorithm to recover the system to a consistent state. In contrast to previous algorithms, they tolerate failures that occur during their executions. Furth-ermore, when a process takes a checkpoint, a minimal number of additional processes are forced to take check-points. Similarly, when a process rolls back and restarts after a failure, a minimal number of additional processes are forced to roll <b>back</b> <b>with</b> it. <b>Our</b> algorithms require each process to store at most two checkpoints in stable storage.
