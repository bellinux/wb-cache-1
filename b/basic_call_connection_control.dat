40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the problem of}} providing <b>call,</b> <b>connection,</b> channel, and service control in broadband and intelligent networks to support {{a wide variety of}} services. A formal methodology called Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) is used to analyze this problem. Three types of OOA models are constructed: Information Model, State Models, and Object Communication Model. From these models, a distributed call processing architecture that proposes separate servers for <b>call</b> <b>control,</b> <b>connection</b> <b>control,</b> channel control, and service control, is derived. Based on the events used for inter-object communication in the Object Communication Model, service-specific and control-function specific Application Service Elements are defined as client-server based protocols...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} a set {{of functional}} objectives for signaling architectures and protocols to support services in broadband and Intelligent Networks. Using a formal methodology called Object-Oriented Analysis, we define <b>call,</b> <b>connection,</b> and channel objects. Based on these object definitions and relationships, a need for separation of <b>call</b> and <b>connection</b> <b>control</b> in such networks is motivated. A multi-network functional architecture treating users as entities belonging in subscriber networks, and servers as entities separated from switches, is described. Service-specific client-server based protocols are identified as being well-suited for inter-entity communication in this architecture. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} offer {{multimedia}} {{services to the}} user, a powerful signaling system for broadband networks is required. Our work aims at an overall signaling architecture with totally independent <b>call</b> and <b>connection</b> <b>control.</b> This paper focusses on MCMP (multicast connection management protocol), a <b>connection</b> <b>control</b> solution {{that can be used}} in this context. MCMP offers a uniform interface to the terminals and network nodes. Its distinction between signaling and transport entities allows the mapping to different broadband technologies. Multicast <b>connections</b> can be <b>controlled</b> dynamically. This includes the change of topology andQoS parameters of the connections during their lifetime. Multicast routing is done by a distributed shortest path tree based solution, which has several advantages over Steiner tree routing...|$|R
40|$|The {{category}} of affine <b>connection</b> <b>control</b> systems is one whose objects are control systems whose drift vector field is the geodesic spray of an affine <b>connection,</b> and whose <b>control</b> vector fields are vertical lifts to the tangent bundle of vector fields on configuration space. We initiate {{an investigation of}} morphisms (feedback transformations) in this category, including the study of subsystems and factor systems. 1 Introduction It is apparent {{that the study of}} what we will in this paper <b>call</b> "affine <b>connection</b> <b>control</b> systems" has a significant role to play in the field of mechanical control systems. In a series of papers, e. g., [11, 12, 10, 4], the author and various coauthors have shown how the affine connection framework is useful in looking at mechanical systems whose Lagrangian is the kinetic energy with respect to a Riemannian metric, possibly in the presence of constraints linear in velocity e. g., [10, 9]. In such an investigation, {{there appears to be no}} particular advantage t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Within the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), <b>call</b> and <b>connection</b> <b>control</b> {{information}} {{as well as}} user-to-user information are carried by a separate signalling network, {{which is based on}} the CCITT Common Channel Signalling System No. 7. This signalling system was mainly designed for outband transmission of signalling and control information within telephone networks and within the ISDN. In order to provide high overall system performance and reliability, efficient procedures are necessary to cope with failure and congestion situations. The main subject of this report is the modelling of overload situations and the performance evaluation of appropriate overload control mechanisms in the Common Channel Signalling System No. 7.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel effective scheme of config-uring Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs), <b>called</b> Master-driven <b>Connection</b> <b>Control</b> (MaCC). WPANs {{are based on}} a new wireless technology, which enables portable and mobile computing devices, and consumer electronic ap-pliances to communicate with each other. Assuming that WPANs operate in a master-slave style, we exploit the information about master-slave relationships for identify-ing a network topology. Specifically, MaCC provides the minimum-hop paths that cannot be obtained by flooding algorithms. MaCC has several prominent features: self-direction of every node, adaptive formation of networks, and minimization of hop counts for routing control. In this paper, we describe the details of MaCC and analyze its overhead under initialization, routing discovery, and recon-figuration. The results show control messages propagated in a MaCC network at route discovery are reduced to less than one half those in a network utilizing pure flooding. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{model with}} MSML {{is that the}} Media Server is an appliance that is specialized in controlling/manipulating media streams (usually RTP), and the application server is a separate unit that deals with making and breaking <b>call</b> <b>connections,</b> and <b>controlling</b> the application (or business) logic, so for example the application server would deal with the billing engine and logging systems. The application server establishes a control 'tunnel' (through SIP or IP), which it uses to exchange requests/responses with the media server. In the case of MSML media servers, the messages are coded in MSML, which is a control language using the syntax of XML. MSML is designed so that an application server can interact {{with a number of}} different media servers at the same time, and of course these can be distributed across a wide geography, {{as long as they are}} reachable via IP. The converse is true, that a media server can have more than one application server talking to it, so this allows for resilience to failure.|$|R
50|$|CAMEL Phase 1 defined {{only very}} <b>basic</b> <b>call</b> control services, but {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} a CAMEL <b>Basic</b> <b>call</b> state model (BCSM) to the Intelligent Network (IN). Phase 1 gave the gsmSCF the ability to bar calls (release the <b>call</b> prior to <b>connection),</b> allow a <b>call</b> to continue unchanged, or to modify a limited number of call parameters before allowing it to continue. The gsmSCF could also monitor the status of a call for certain events (<b>call</b> <b>connection</b> and disconnection), and take appropriate action on being informed of the event. Phase 1 was defined as part of Release 96 in 1997.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} {{on one particular}} aspect of providing communication security: firewalls between domains of trust. We argue that signaling support for providing scalable security services is a design requirement. On this basis we outline a reference model for firewall technology. It captures {{the current state of}} the art and proves suitable for connection-oriented high-performance networks. The architecture is an improvement in network management and provides a controlled exposure of the internal network structure to the outside, and transparency to the user. Its components are endpoint authentication, <b>call</b> admission <b>control,</b> <b>connection</b> authentication, audit, and a distributed architecture with centralized policy. The paper discusses implications of this reference model for the design of signaling protocols...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Actual <b>call</b> <b>connection</b> time (ACCT) is {{the total}} time that a mobile user engages in {{communications}} over a wireless net-work during a <b>call</b> <b>connection.</b> Due to limited network resources of wireless mobile networks, a <b>call</b> <b>connection</b> may be prematurely disconnected and the ACCT for the call in general {{may not be the}} same as the requested <b>call</b> <b>connection</b> time (RCCT). The ACCT depends not only on the RCCT, but also on the network resource allocation scheme and network traffic. In this paper, we charac-terize the ACCT and related performance metrics for wireless mo-bile networks under a newly proposed general channel allocation scheme. This scheme generalizes the nonprioritized scheme, the re-served channel scheme, the queueing priority scheme and the sub-rating scheme {{in such a way as}} to reduce the blocking probability of the handoff calls while keeping the ACCT as long as possible. Explicit formulae for the distribution and the expectation of the ACCT are obtained. The call completion probability, the call drop probability, and the average actual <b>call</b> <b>connection</b> times for both the complete calls and the incomplete calls are derived. The results can form the basis for designing better billing rate schemes by dif-ferentiating incomplete calls and complete calls.

40|$|A {{system of}} the subject {{invention}} includes a mobile telecommunications switching office (MTSO), several base stations and mobile units. The base stations serve respective sectors or cells to establish radio communications with mobile units in their sectors or cells. The base stations {{are connected to the}} MTSO which performs switching to establish <b>call</b> <b>connections</b> between mobile units and/or between units served by an external network to which the MTSO is connected. The MTSO uses dynamic channel allocation to designate base stations to serve a <b>call</b> <b>connection</b> in active mode and in standby mode for a particular channel. Therefore, if communication with the base station serving a <b>call</b> <b>connection</b> in active mode is disrupted by a building, terrain or an equipment failure, for example, the MTSO can set the base station currently in active mode to standby mode, and can set the base station currently in standby mode, to active mode to serve the <b>call</b> <b>connection</b> on the channel. Thus, the use of sectors or cells in active and standby modes, allows for relatively reliable communications through macro-diversity. Also, the ping-pong effect occurs relatively infrequently because the sectors or cells are switched between active and standby modes as a mobile unit moves along a sector or cell boundary, rather than requiring a handoff to another channel as required in conventional systems. Further, through use of dynamic channel allocation, handoffs in the traditional sense are relatively rare in the {{system of the}} subject invention. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
