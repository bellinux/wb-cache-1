500|$|The {{character}} that became Ibuki has been originally {{conceived as a}} ninja boy before the gender was swapped, and the male version's design might have been re-used for Ibuki's sparring partner Yūta Homura. Super Street Fighter IV main battle planner said Ibuki is an [...] "orthodox ninja at first glance, but her character {{is one of a}} normal girl, so we are trying to bring out her feminine side in her lines and dialogue as well as in her proportions." [...] The game's director said she was probably the most difficult character to make while trying to best show [...] "her charm, even behind the mask," [...] as [...] "Ibuki is cute even at a first glance, so that might <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> focus on, but we've also put a lot of effort into her motions and her design." [...] Ibuki's English voice actress Kat Steel, hired for her knowledge of the character displayed during the audition, wrote it [...] "was a treat because her character is sassy, mischievous, and oh so girlish!" [...] For Street Fighter X Tekken, Capcom abortively planned to give Ibuki some attacks featuring Don.|$|E
500|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott {{said that}} the film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think it is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E

For nearly two years after the relaunch, Wally's fate remained unknown, although early on, Batiuk wrote on his blog that what happened to Wally [...] "may not <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> think happened."

2500|$|Dyer, {{who is from}} East London where EastEnders is set, had {{previously}} been offered {{a role in the}} soap in 2009, but turned it down, fearing the level of publicity it would bring. He also said he turned down a 10-episode role in EastEnders because it was an [...] "obvious gangster bully" [...] who would be [...] "blown up by Phil Mitchell". Dyer also revealed that he was approached to play Carl White, but turned it down. He said, [...] "if I'd gone down that route, then I wouldn't be playing the role I am now." [...] Dyer confirmed on 19 October 2013 that he had already started filming his role, stating, [...] "I've already got my kit off for the cameras—we had a funny sex scene early on. But I don't get my bollocks out, you'll be glad to hear." [...] Richie, experienced at playing a landlord in the show, mentored Dyer and helped him on the pub set because he [...] "couldn't even open the f***ing till". He was also trained in how to use a beer engine. After Dyer had been filming for a month, he stated that he was [...] "bringing something to soap land that's never been seen before" [...] and said that taking over The Queen Victoria was [...] "a big responsibility" [...] that he was ready for, adding [...] "I don't want to let them down". He said that his character's entrance to the show was [...] "flawless, but it's not going to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> expect", and felt that he would have the same impact as original landlord Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). He also thought that his role would be controversial, because of the baggage that comes with him as an actor. Inside Soap said that the success of Mick, the Carter family and the pub all rest on Dyer's shoulders, of which Dyer said put pressure on him but he added that [...] "there should be pressure coming into a show like this. I didn't want to come in as some peripheral character". He hoped that people would find Mick believable and loveable.|$|E
