5000|$|A conoscope is an {{apparatus}} {{to carry out}} conoscopic observations and measurements, often realized by a microscope with a <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> for observation of the direction's image. The earliest reference {{to the use of}} conoscopy (i.e., observation in convergent light with a polarization microscope with a <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens)</b> for evaluation of the optical properties of liquid crystalline phases (i.e., orientation of the optical axes) is in 1911 when it was used by Mauging to investigate the alignment of nematic and chiral-nematic phases.|$|E
5000|$|Émile Bertrand (1844-1909) was a French mineralogist, {{in honour of}} whom bertrandite {{was named}} by Alexis Damour. [...] He also gave his name to the <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> or phase telescope.|$|E
50|$|Bertrand lenses find use in {{creating}} interference figures and assisting in aligning a microscope to generate interference figures. The name <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> commemorates French mineralogist Emile Bertrand (1844-1909), {{for whom the}} mineral Bertrandite is also named.|$|E
50|$|To {{view the}} figure, the light rays leaving the {{microscope}} must emerge {{more or less}} in parallel. This is typically achieved either by pulling out the eyepiece altogether (if possible), or by placing a <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> (Emile Bertrand, 1878) between the objective lens and the eyepiece.|$|E
50|$|A phase {{telescope}} or <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> is {{an optical}} device used in aligning the various optical {{components of a}} light microscope. In particular it allows observation of the back focal plane of the objective lens and its conjugate focal planes. The phase telescope/Bertrand lens is inserted into the microscope in place of an eyepiece to move the intermediate image plane {{to a point where}} it can be observed.|$|E
50|$|Ulexite also {{displays}} {{concentric circles}} of light if {{held up to}} a light source, a strange optical property first observed by G. Donald Garlick (1991). This effect can also be produced by shining a laser pointer at a slightly oblique angle through a piece of ulexite. This optical behavior {{is a consequence of}} the different refractive indices of ulexite in different directions of polarization. Microscopic analysis of ulexite also yields cones of light that clearly emerge from each grain that is thicker than 0.1 mm under the <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The two Nicol prisms (occasionally {{referred}} to as nichols) of the petrographic microscope have their polarizing planes oriented perpendicular to one another. When only an isotropic material such as air, water, or glass exists between the filters, all light is blocked, but most crystalline materials and minerals change the polarizing light directions, allowing some of the altered light {{to pass through the}} analyzer to the viewer. Using one polarizer makes it possible to view the slide in plane polarized light; using two allows for analysis under cross polarized light. A particular light pattern on the upper lens surface of the objectives is created as a conoscopic interference pattern (or interference figure) characteristic of uniaxial and biaxial minerals, and produced with convergent polarized light. To observe the interference figure, true petrographic microscopes usually include an accessory called a <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens,</b> which focuses and enlarges the figure. It is also possible to remove an eyepiece lens to make a direct observation of the objective lens surface.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{preparation}} method of ordered multilayer films of submicrometer- and micrometer-sized monodisperse latex {{particles in the}} broad range of 0. 2 - 2. 5 mum is reported. The films were prepared from aqueous suspensions by vertical deposition at elevated temperatures. Both hydrophobic polystyrene and hydrophilic core-shell particles allowed good array formation. Three-dimensional lattices were proved by transmission and reflectance vis-NIR-IR spectroscopy. Well-developed Bragg peaks up to 5000 nm have been registered. An observation of Fabry-Perot resonance signals in the spectra also confirms the good array quality. Optical properties of the gratings were investigated by laser diffraction and by diffraction using an optical microscope equipped with a <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens...</b>|$|E
40|$|Ordered {{monolayer}} and multilayer {{films of}} monodisperse 0. 2 - 6 mu m latex particles were manufactured using different preparation techniques: Langmuir-Schafer deposition, natural sedimentation, slow drying in high humidity atmosphere, flow cell and vertical deposition. The {{structures of the}} films were investigated. Diffraction properties were studied using a laser beam as a probe and by the diffraction optical microscopy with <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens.</b> For the first time, the stop-bands were observed in the NIR region up to 3200 nm in the reflectance spectra. The array quality is confirmed by the observation of Fabry-Perot fringes {{in the vicinity of}} the main Bragg peak. The size of ordered area was estimated by microscope spectroscopy and 2 -D fast Fourier transformation (2 D-FFT) of optical microscopic pictures...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePolarization {{microscopy}} is {{a suitable}} tool for studying strain in appropriately cut SiC single-crystals. Both the outline shape examined by electron microscopy and the induced interference pattern observed by polarization microscopy {{were used to}} study the variation and character of macro-defects present in SiC wafers. While voids are usually in a relaxed state, hollow-core dislocations are characterised by large interference halos up to ~ 100 µm in diameter. Conoscopy, i. e. evaluation of the interference pattern created by inserting an Amici <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens,</b> is suitable to examine these optical phenomena in more detail and to gain additional knowledge on the inclination of cut wafers towards the c-axis. The discrepancy between simulated interference patterns for (0001) -SiC and the observed ones strongly indicates that pipes are no pure screw dislocations as commonly thought, but must have an edge component...|$|E
40|$|Total {{internal}} reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and its variants are key technologies for visualizing {{the dynamics of}} single molecules or organelles in live cells. Yet, truely quantitative TIRF remains problematic. One unknown hampering the interpretation of evanescent-wave excited fluorescence intensities is the undetermined cell refractive index (RI). Here, we {{use a combination of}} TIRF excitation and supercritical angle fluorescence emission detection to directly mea-sure the average RI in the 'footprint' region of the cell, during imaging. Our RI measurement is based on the determination on a back-focal plane image of the critical angle separating supercritical and undercritial fluorescence emission components. We validate our method by imaging mouse embryonic fibroblasts. By targeting various dyes and fluorescent-protein chimerae to vesicles, the plasma membrane as well as mitochondria and the ER, we demonstrate local RI measurements with subcellular resolution on a standard TIRF microscope with a removable <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> as the only modification. Our tech-nique has important applications for imaging axial vesicle dynamics, mitochondrial energy state or detecting cancer cells. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, 3 table...|$|E
40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonance}} enhanced transmission through metal-coated nanostructures {{represents a}} highly sensitive yet simple method for quantitative measurement of surface processes and is particularly {{useful in the}} development of thin film and adsorption sensors. Diffraction-induced surface plasmon excitation can produce enhanced transmission at select regions of the visible spectrum, and wavelength shifts associated with these transmission peaks can be used to track adsorption processes and film formation. In this report, we describe a simple optical microscope-based method for monitoring the first-order diffracted peaks associated with enhanced transmission through a gold-coated diffraction grating. A <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> is used to focus the grating’s diffraction image onto a CCD camera, and the spatial position of the diffracted peaks can be readily transformed into a spectral signature of the transmitted light without the use of a spectrometer. The surface plasmon peaks appear as a region of enhanced transmission when the sample is illuminated with p-polarized light, and the peak position reflects the local dielectric properties of the metal interface, including the presence of thin films. The ability to track the position of the plasmon peak and, thus, measure film thickness is demonstrated using the diffracted peaks for samples possessing thin films of silicon oxide. The experimental results are then compared with calculations of optical diffraction through a model, film-coated grating using the rigorously coupled wave analysis simulation method...|$|E
40|$|Surface plasmon {{resonance}} (SPR) {{has achieved}} widespread {{recognition as a}} sensitive, label-free, and versatile optical method for monitoring changes in refractive index at a metal-dielectric interface. Refractive index deviations of 10 - 6 RIU are resolvable using SPR, and the method {{can be used in}} real-time or ex-situ. Instruments based on carboxymethyl dextran coated SPR chips have achieved commercial success in biological detection, while SPR sensors can also be found in other fields as varied as food safety and gas sensing. Chapter 1 provides a physical background of SPR sensing. A brief history of the technology is presented, and publication data are included that demonstrate the large and growing interest in surface plasmons. Numerous applications of SPR sensors are listed to illustrate the broad appeal of the method. Surface plasmons (SPs) and surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) are formally defined, and important parameters governing their spatial behavior are derived from Maxwell 2 ̆ 7 s equations and appropriate boundary conditions. Physical requirements for exciting SPs with incident light are discussed, and SPR imaging is used to illustrate the operating principle of SPR-based detection. Angle-tunable surface enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) of polymer vibrational modes via grating-coupled SPR is demonstrated in Chapter 2. Over 10 -fold enhancement of C-H stretching modes was found relative to the absorbance of the same film in the absence of plasmon excitation. Modeling results are used to support and explain experimental observations. Improvements to the grating coupler SEIRA platform in Chapter 2 are explored in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 3 displays data for two sets of multipitch gratings: one set with broadly distributed resonances with the potential for multiband IR enhancement and the other with finely spaced, overlapping resonances to form a broadband IR enhancement device. Diffraction gratings having multiple periods were fabricated using a Lloyd 2 ̆ 7 s mirror interferometer to perform multiple exposures at multiple angles before developing. Precise control of the resonance position is shown by locating three SPR dips at predetermined wavenumbers of 5000, 4000, and 3000 cm- 1, respectively. A set of three gratings, each having four closely spaced resonances is employed to show how the sensor response could be broadened. The work in Chapter 3 shows potential for simultaneous enhancement of multiple vibrational modes; the multiband approach might find application for modes at disparate locations within the IR spectrum, while the broadband approach may allow concurrent probing of of broad single modes or clusters of narrow modes within a particular neighborhood of the spectrum. Chapter 4 uses the rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) method to numerically explore another facet of the nanostructure-based tunability of grating-baed SPR sensing. The work in this chapter illustrates how infrared signal enhancement could be tailored by through adjustment of the grating amplitude. Modeled infrared reflection absorption (IRRAS) spectra and electric field distributions were generated for several nanostructured grating configurations. It was found that there exists a critical amplitude value for a given grating pitch where the plasmon response achieves a maximum. Amplitudes greater than this critical value produce a broader and attenuated plasmon peak, while smaller amplitudes produce a plasmon resonance that is not as intense. Field simulations show how amplitudes nearer the critical amplitude resulted in large increases in the electric field within an analyte film atop the sensor surface, and the relative strength of the increased field is predictable based on the appearance of the IRRAS spectra. It is believed that these larger fields are the cause of observed enhanced absorption. Published reports pertaining to interactions of SPs with molecular resonance and to diffraction-based tracking of plasmons without a spectrometer are included in the Appendix to this thesis. In the first of the two reports, it is shown that plasmons coupling to dye molecular resonance can be quenched due to the effects of the high extinction coefficient of the dye. In the second report, the thickness of nanometer-scale SiO films on a gold-coated grating is evaluated by tracking the plasmon using a <b>Bertrand</b> <b>lens</b> and camera. Model results show close agreement with observations in both works. This work aims to show the versatility of SPR sensing in multiple applications. The inherent angle- and wavelength-tunability of plasmon responses is a distinct advantage for sensing phenomena over a wide range of conditions. SPR sensing is also highly dependent on the nanostructure at and near the metal-dielectric interface. The thickness of thin metal coatings, as well as the pitch, amplitude, and shape of metallic gratings all affect the behavior of SPPs in profound ways. Gratings provide an especially information-rich avenue for SPR sensing, as data is contained in multiple diffracted orders over a wide range of angles and wavelengths...|$|E
