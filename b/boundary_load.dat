40|$|Abstract − <b>Boundary</b> <b>load</b> flow exemplifies a {{class of}} power (load) flow models that {{explicitly}} incorporates uncertainties in system data. Its importance for operation and control of modern power systems is increasing due to changes in ways the system is operated following deregu-lation and due {{to the emergence of}} new types of sources (e. g., distributed generation). Modeling based on interval computations is a rigorous mathematical tool for worst-case analysis of uncertain systems. This paper proposes an optimization-based approach to minimizing uncertainty spread in a <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> flow model. The approach combines interval computations with a linear program-ming-based heuristic that is effective in avoiding the ex-cessive conservativism often associated with direct inter-val computations. We consider the case of uncertainty in both measurements (e. g., SCADA) and network parame-ters. The method is potentially applicable to large-scale power systems, and we study its performance on a two benchmark examples: New England/New York intercon-nection with 68 nodes and standard IEEE test system with 300 nodes...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a systematic method for identifying {{the worst case}} <b>load</b> among all <b>boundary</b> <b>loads</b> of fixed energy. Here the worst case load is defined {{to be the one}} that delivers the largest fraction of input energy to a prescribed subdomain of interest. The worst case load is identified with the first eigenfunction of a suitably defined eigenvalue problem. The first eigenvalue for this problem is the maximum fraction of boundary energy that can be delivered to the subdomain. We compute worst case <b>boundary</b> <b>loads</b> and associated energy contained inside a prescribed subdomain through the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem. We apply this computational method to bound the worst case load associated with an ensemble of random <b>boundary</b> <b>loads</b> given by a second order random process.

40|$|International audienceLet S be a 2 -D elastic {{structure}} {{submitted to}} a fixed <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> f and containing a crack C. In {{the framework of the}} linear fracture theory, a common tool used to describe the smooth evolution of C is the so-called energy release rate defined as the variation of the mechanical energy with respect to the crack dimension. Precisely, the well-known Griffith's criterion postulates the evolution of the crack if this rate positive measure of the singularity which depends quadratically on the displacement field reaches a critical value. In this work, we numerically investigate whether or not this rate may be reduced by applying an additional <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> with a support disjoint from the support of the initial load f possibly responsible of the growth. We first introduce a well-posed relaxed formulation of this optimal location problem, and then compute explicitly the variation of the relaxed energy release rate with respect to the location of the additional force and also with respect to its intensity, taken into account the contact condition on the crack lips. Numerical simulations, based on a gradient descent method permit to optimize the support and amplitude of the extra load and so to reduce significantly the energy release rate. The optimal extra force highlights the balance between the opening and the in-plane shear modes. The case of a multi-crack structure is considered as well...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Risk is {{the central}} issue in {{planning}} under uncertainty and the load flow is central tool in power system planning. The uncertainty considered here is of non-statistical nature and best modeled using fuzzy set theory. Two methods are generally used for obtaining solutions from load flow when this type of uncertainty is involved. The first one, recently developed, finds the <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> flow solutions and produces accurate results. The second one is the linearized fuzzy load flow, which gives only approximate results. The fuzzy results obtained are aggregated in a form of system inadequacy indices that are further used to express risk. A comparison between the two methods is made.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general framework for obtaining analytic solutions for finite elastic isotropic solid cylinders subjected to arbitrary surface load. The method of solution uses the displacement function approach to uncouple the equations of equilibrium. The most general solution forms {{for the two}} displacement functions for solid cylinders are proposed in terms of infinite series, with z- and θ-dependencies in terms of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, and with r-dependency in terms of Bessel and modified Bessel functions of the first kind of fractional order. All possible combinations of odd and even dependencies of θ and z are included; and the curved <b>boundary</b> <b>loads</b> are expanded into double Fourier Series expansion, while the end <b>boundary</b> <b>loads</b> are expanded into Fourier-Bessel expansion. It is showed analytically that only one set of the end boundary conditions needs to be satisfied. A system of simultaneous equations for the unknown constants is given independent {{of the type of}} the <b>boundary</b> <b>loads.</b> This new approach provides the most general theory for the stress analysis of elastic isotropic solid circular cylinders of finite length.

Borehole instability or borehole breakouts induced by stress redistribution could negate the effectiveness of seals or plugs. Breakout fractures along the wall of repository excavations or exploratory holes could provide a preferential flowpath for groundwater or gaseous radionuclides to bypass the plugs. After plug installation, swelling pressures exerted by a plug could induce radial cracks or could open or widen preexisting cracks in the rock {{at the bottom of}} the breakouts where the tangential compressive stresses have been released by the breakout process. The purpose of the work reported here is to determine experimentally the {{stability of}} a circular hole in a welded tuff sample subjected to various external <b>boundary</b> <b>loads.</b> Triaxial and biaxial borehole stability tests have been performed on densely welded Apache Leap tuff samples and Topopah Spring tuff samples.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we prove a {{two-dimensional}} existence result for a variational model of crack growth for brittle {{materials in the}} realm of linearized elasticity. Starting with a time-discretized version of the evolution driven by a prescribed <b>boundary</b> <b>load,</b> we derive a time-continuous quasistatic crack growth in the framework of generalized special functions of bounded deformation (GSBD). As the time-discretization step tends to $ 0 $, the major difficulty lies in showing the stability of the static equilibrium condition, which is achieved by means of a Jump Transfer Lemma generalizing the result of Francfort and Larsen [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 56 (2003), 1465 [...] 1500] to the GSBD setting. Moreover, we present a general compactness theorem for this framework and prove existence of the evolution without the necessity of a-priori bounds on the displacements or applied body forces...|$|E
30|$|Silicon {{fractures}} under {{tensile stress}} at a certain load. In maximum tensile stress areas, silicon bond breakage appears to stem from tensile stress caused by diamond tip friction[27]. Therefore, the reaction of silicon may {{take place at the}} rear edge of the sliding contact area where the elongation stress is the highest. At loads of over 8 μN, protuberance height increased rapidly at 13.8 -GPa contact pressure and 1.8 -GPa tensile stress. Therefore, this protuberance-related phenomenon occurred through a mechanochemical reaction where adsorbates, such as water and oxygen, reacted with the silicon. The local destruction of interatomic bonds seems to increase at over 6 μN because of the concentrated stress and reaction of the newly formed surface with surrounding materials. This <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> that increases and decreases the etching depth is nearly 6 μN. At this load, the contact pressure and tensile stress are 12.5 and 1.5  GPa, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a bi-dimensional crack domain Ω {{submitted to a}} <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> and composed of two isotropic elastic materials. In {{the framework of the}} linear fracture theory, a common tool used to describe the smooth evolution of any crack is the so-called energy release rate defined as the variation of the mechanical energy with respect to the crack dimension. Precisely, the well-known Griffith’s criterion postulates the evolution of the crack if this rate reaches a critical value. In this work, we consider the shape design problem which consists in optimizing the distribution of the two materials in Ω in order to reduce this rate. Since this kind of problem is usually ill-posed, we first derive a relaxation by using the classical non-convex variational method. The computation of the quasi-convexified of the cost is performed by using div-curl Young measures, leads to an explicit relaxed formulation of the original problem, and exhibits fine microstructure in the form of first order laminates. Finally, numerical simulations suggest that the optimal distribution permits to reduce significantly the value of the energy release rate...|$|E

40|$|In [1] an {{algorithm}} of {{the layer}} growing/removing method is presented for the determi-nation of residual stresses {{in the case}} of the isotropic non-homogeneous cylinder with a central hole. In the present paper the method is extended to the orthotropic non-homo-geneous cylinder. It is assumed that elastic parameters depend on the radius only. Layer growing/removing may occur either on the cylinder’s external or internal surface. One proceeds from a generalized algorithm [2] by employing differential approach. The sug-gested algorithm presents interest above all in studying residual stresses in composite cylinders and growth stresses in trees. According to the general algorithm the mechanical effect of formation of an elementary boundary layer is reduced to radial <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> and axial edge load. These loads are expressed through the circumferential initial stress and axial initial stress of the surface layer, assuming that initial stress changes only in the radial direction.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{illustrates}} {{an application}} of the so-called dimensional reduction modelling approach to obtain a mixed, 3 D, linear, elastic beam-model. We start from the 3 D linear elastic problem, formulated through the Hellinger–Reissner functional, then we introduce a cross-section piecewise-polynomial approximation, and finally we integrate within the cross section, obtaining a beam model that satisfies the cross-section equilibrium and {{could be applied to}} inhomogeneous bodies with also a non trivial geometries (such as L-shape cross section). Moreover the beam model can predict the local effects of both boundary displacement constraints and non homogeneous or concentrated <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> distributions, usually not accurately captured by most of the popular beam models. We modify the beam-model formulation in order to satisfy the axial compatibility (and without violating equilibrium within the cross section), then we introduce axis piecewise-polynomial approximation, and finally we integrate along the beam axis, obtaining a beam finite element. Also the beam finite elements have the capability to describe local effects of constraints and loads. Moreover, the proposed beam finite element describes the stress distribution inside the cross section with high accuracy. In addition to the simplicity of the derivation procedure and the very satisfying numerical performances, both the beam model and the beam finite element can be refined arbitrarily, allowing to adapt the model accuracy to specific needs of practitioners...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} render objects {{invisible}} with a cloak that fits all objects and sizes is a long-standing goal for optical devices. Invisibility devices demonstrated so far typically comprise a rigid structure wrapped around an object {{to which it}} is fitted. Here we demonstrate smart metamaterial cloaking, wherein the metamaterial device not only transforms electromagnetic fields to make an object invisible, but also acquires its properties automatically from its own elastic deformation. The demonstrated device is a ground-plane microwave cloak composed of an elastic metamaterial with a broad operational band (10 - 12 GHz) and nearly lossless electromagnetic properties. The metamaterial is uniform, or perfectly periodic, in its undeformed state and acquires the necessary gradient-index profile, mimicking a quasi-conformal transformation, naturally from a <b>boundary</b> <b>load.</b> This easy-to-fabricate hybrid elasto-electromagnetic metamaterial opens the door to implementations of a variety of transformation optics devices based on quasi-conformal maps.

As a first simple and instructive case, this article treats the sit-uation of an imposed uniform uniaxial tension load in 2 D. If the weight ε of the perimeter is small, optimal geometries exhibit very fine-scale struc-ture which cannot be resolved by numerical optimization. Instead, we prove how the minimum energy scales in ε, which involves the construc-tion {{of a family of}} near-optimal geometries and thus provides qualitative insights. The construction is based on a classical branching procedure with some features unique to compliance minimization. The proof of the energy scaling also requires an ansatz-independent lower bound, which we derive once via a classical convex duality argument (which is restricted to 2 D and the uniaxial load) and once via a Fourier-based refinement of the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds for the effective elastic moduli of composite materials. We also highlight the close relation to and the differences from shape optimization with a scalar PDE-constraint, and a link to the pattern formation observed in intermediate states of type-I superconductors. 1 Problem formulation and discussion The aim {{of this article is to}} gain some insight into optimal geometries of elas-tically loaded structures, that is, geometries which achieve an optimal balance between some measure of structural rigidity, material weight, and structural complexity.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} fracture response of aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes under internal gaseous detonation loading {{has been carried}} out. The pressure load, with speeds exceeding 2 km/s, {{can be characterized as}} a pressure peak (ranging from 2 to 6 MPa) followed by an expansion wave. The unique combination of this particular traveling load and tube geometry produced fracture data not available before in the open literature. Experimental data of this type are useful for studying the fluid-structure-fracture interaction and various crack curving and branching phenomena, and also for validation for multi-physics and multi-scale modeling. Axial surface flaws were introduced to control the crack initiation site. Fracture threshold models were developed by combining a static fracture model and an extensively studied dynamic amplification factor for tubes under internal traveling loads. Experiments were also performed on hydrostatically loaded preflawed aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes for comparison. Significantly different fracture behavior was observed and the difference was explained by fluid dynamics and energy considerations. The experiments yielded comparison on crack speeds, strain, and pressure histories. In other experiments, the specimens were also pre-torqued to control the propagation direction of the cracks. Measurements were made on the detonation velocity, strain history, blast pressure from the crack opening, and crack speeds. The curved crack paths were digitized. The Chapman-Jouguet pressure, initial axial flaw length, and torsion level were varied to obtain different crack patterns. The incipient crack kinking angle was found to be consistent with fracture under mixed-mode loading. High-speed movies of the fracture events and blast wave were taken and these were used in interpreting the quantitative data. Numerical simulations were performed using the commercial explicit finite-element software LS-Dyna. The detonation wave was modeled as a traveling <b>boundary</b> <b>load.</b> Both non-fracturing linear elastic simulations and elastoplastic simulations with fracture were conducted on three-dimensional models.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{proposed}} work is to develop and to test a solution technique for non destructive identification. With reference to some recent experiences [1 - 5], the Authors present a numerical procedure for identifying the position {{and the size of}} an inclusion on the basis of boundary measurements at some sensor points for given static loadings. The matrix and the inclusion are supposed linear elastic and in frictionless unilateral contact at the interface. The problem is stated as a 2 D optimisation problem where the design variables are the co-ordinates of the centre and the area of the hole-inclusion system. The measure of the difference between the computed and observed displacements at some sensor points of the external boundary is minimised in order to provide the geometrical configuration of the inclusion. The minimisation is performed by using a first-order non-linear unconstrained optimisation technique in which the cost function gradient is computed by the implicit differentiation method. Most published work deals with cavity and crack identification in different fields [3 - 9]. In this paper, a circular inclusion is considered within a linear elastic solid subject to given <b>boundary</b> <b>load</b> and displacement conditions. The direct static frictionless unilateral contact problem, formulated in terms of boundary variational inequalities with contact tractions as physical variables, is discretised by means of the standard Boundary Element Method (BEM) based on collocations and solved as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) with a non-symmetric coefficient matrix. The choice of boundary element techniques is generally acknowledged as more appropriate for this kind of inverse problems since {{only a small number of}} data, the ones concerning the hole-inclusion surfaces, need to be stored and adapted along the required repetitive procedure. Quadratic boundary elements are used with the example presented. For the presence of the unilateral constraints, the error function is a non-convex and nondifferentiable function of the matrix-inclusion parameters and its sensitivity can be calculated only along given direction...|$|E
