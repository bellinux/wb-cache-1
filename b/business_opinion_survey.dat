50|$|The {{economy of}} the United Kingdom has also been hit by rising oil prices and the credit crisis. Sir Win Bischoff, {{chairman}} of Citigroup, spoke of his belief that house prices in Britain would fall constantly for two years {{from the end of}} 2007. The Ernst & Young Item club predicted growth of only 1.5 percent in 2008, slowing to 1 percent in 2009. They also predicted consumer spending would slow to only 0.2 percent, and forecast a two-year drop in investment.

The impact of unexpected changes in the money market interest rate on the pattern of industrial production – based on qualitative <b>business</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>survey</b> data – has been computed for 164 local industries. The perceived output effects of monetary impulses go up for local industries with higher investment expenditures and less liquid firms. The hypothesis that small firms bear a disproportionate burden of monetary policy does not find support in this sample. monetary policy shocks, business opinion surveys, heterogeneity...|$|E
40|$|Business {{confidence}} announcements attract widespread attention, yet {{relatively little}} is known about the series itself. What, for example, does an improvement or deterioration in business confidence mean? We consider this question using a panel of firm-level responses to a <b>business</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>survey</b> that includes a question on business confidence. We relate the confidence responses of the firms to microeconomic and macroeconomic variables that have a direct interpretation and, as a result, determine the variables that firms associate with business confidence. Our analysis of firm-level data reveals that what firms associate with business confidence changes over time and means different things to different firms. Consequently, it is not immediately apparent what a change in business confidence actually means. business confidence; business surveys; polychoric correlation; New Zealand...|$|E

40|$|This paper models {{industrial}} {{new orders}} across European Union (EU) countries for various breakdowns. A common modelling framework exploits soft (<b>business</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>surveys)</b> {{as well as}} hard data (industrial turnover). The estimates show for about 200 cases that the model determinants significantly help in explaining new orders monthly growth rates. An alternative estimation method, new orders estimated in terms of three-month on three-month growth rates, different model specifications and out-of-sample and real-time forecasting all show that the model results are robust. We present real-time outcomes of a European Central Bank (ECB) indicator on industrial new orders at an aggregated euro area level. This indicator is largely based on national new orders data and on estimates yielded by the model for those countries that no longer report new orders at the national level. Finally, we demonstrate the leading content of the ECB indicator on industrial new orders for industrial production...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{discontinuation}} of {{the official}} statistics on industrial new orders by Eurostat in mid- 2012, this paper introduces the ECB indicator on euro area industrial new orders, which aims to fill the new statistical gaps for euro area total new orders {{as well as for}} various breakdowns. Despite the discontinuation of the data collection at European level, a large number of euro area countries are expected to continue with the data collection nationally. For those countries which have discontinued the collection of national data, model-estimates are used in calculating the ECB indicator on euro area industrial new orders. New orders are modelled across EU countries using 2 ̆ 01 csoft 2 ̆ 01 d data (<b>business</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>surveys)</b> as well as 2 ̆ 01 chard 2 ̆ 01 d data (industrial turnover) and applying a common modelling framework. The model determinants significantly explain the monthly growth rates in new orders across approximately 200 estimated equations. Various tests show that the estimates are robust. This paper demonstrates that, besides the leading information content of industrial new orders for euro area industrial production, the monitoring of the ECB indicator on new orders is useful for cross-checking developments in industrial production in real time...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} informational content of New Zealand data {{releases}} using a parametric dynamic factor model estimated with unbalanced real-time panels of quarterly data. The data are categorised into 21 different release blocks, {{allowing us to}} make 21 different factor model forecasts each quarter. We compare three of these factor model forecasts for real GDP growth, CPI inflation, non-tradable CPI inflation, and tradable CPI inflation with real-time forecasts made by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand each quarter. We find that, at some horizons, the factor model produce forecasts of similar accuracy to the Reserve Bank’s forecasts. Analysing the marginal value {{of each of the}} data releases reveals the importance of the <b>business</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>survey</b> data – the Quarterly Survey of Business Opinion and the National Bank’s Business Outlook survey – in determining how factor model predictions, and the uncertainty around those predictions, evolves through each quarter. ...|$|E
40|$|Irish {{manufacturing}} industry suffered a fall in its sales volume in 1975 over it's 1974 level. In {{an effort to}} clarify {{the relative importance of}} price competitiveness vis a vis other factors, the authors conducted a survey amongst firms in Irish {{manufacturing industry}} in December 1975. The results indicate what managers of firms perceived as the reasons for their poor sales performance. The questions put, of their very nature require subjective answer. Thus, managers, when faced with a leftward shift in their firms demand curve, were asked to distinguish the separate effects of a fall in consumer demand, and of any loss of price competitiveness. An effort was also made to assess the degree of price responsiveness of demand amongst sectors in both domestic and export markets. The normal caveats about this type of subjective enquiry of course apply. The survey covered those firms which participate in the monthly CII/ESRI <b>Business</b> <b>Opinion</b> <b>Survey.</b> Of a total of 320 questionnaires despatched, 218 usable replies were received, a response rate of just over 68 %. For the purposes of the survey the firms were classified in accordance with the ten sector classification used by the CSO in the Quarterly Industrial Enquiry. The actual processing and calculation of the results was carried out by computer, each firm's replies being weighed by that firm's turnover weight as used in the CII/ESRI survey. Sectoral output weights were derived from the finer sectoral classification of the same survey...|$|E
50|$|As mayor, Gordon {{worked with}} city council to {{establish}} {{a climate in which}} collaboration and cooperation was encouraged {{to find a way to}} hold the line on property taxes. The mayor worked in partnership with the city’s management and the unionized employees to use the zero-based budgeting process and to find millions of dollars in efficiencies in the city’s budget without layoffs. As a result, the city was able to hold the line on taxes while continuing to provide the level of service that citizens expected. In 1994, Sudbury topped the list of local municipal efforts to control property taxes in Ontario, according to the Canadian Federation of Independent <b>Business</b> (Members’ <b>Opinions</b> <b>Survey</b> #34, July 1994), a survey based on 8,058 face-to-face interviews with members from 18 communities.|$|R
40|$|We {{compare the}} {{performances}} of balances of opinion to those of indicators introduced by Mitchell, Smith and Weale for the one-quarter forecasting of the manufacturing production growth rate. These indicators {{take into account the}} heterogeneity of the response behaviours of the entrepreneurs taking part in the Business Tendency Survey. The responses which are the most tightly linked to the overall fluctuations of manufactured production contribute to the variability of these indicators to a larger extent than the responses of the other surveyed. The application of Mitchell, Smith and Weale to British and German data seems to suggest that these indicators perform better in short-term forecasting than the balances of opinion, but their application to Swedish and Portuguese data suggests not. In our study carried out using French data, their predictive performances turn out to be inferior or, at best, equivalent to those of the balances of <b>opinion.</b> <b>Business</b> Tendency <b>Surveys,</b> Quantification, Dis-Aggregate Indicators, Short-Term Forecasting...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of tendency surveys is very {{often based on}} changes in balances of opinion, which constitute {{the most commonly used}} summaries of responses of companies. This article suggests the construction of different indicators, which, on the one hand, take into account "stable" or "normal" response conditions, {{and on the other hand}} also take into account the dynamics of individual responses from one survey to the next. The responses of companies during two consecutive surveys are classified into nine categories: Increase-Increase, Increase-Unchanged, Increase-Decrease, Unchanged-Increase, etc. We focus on the percentages of companies that change their response from one survey to another. These percentages could give early signals of certain changes in the short-term economic situation and represent slightly advanced indicators. In particular, the article shows that, for certain questions, the percentages of Unchanged-Decrease and Unchanged-Increase responses do indeed display a number of tendencies earlier than the corresponding balances of <b>opinion.</b> <b>Business</b> Tendency <b>Surveys,</b> Synthetic Indicators, Short-Term Forecasting...|$|R

I frame these questions in a comparative perspective and in the transitional contexts of China. By examining the issues of item-nonresponse, norm-seeking response, and cross-national comparability, I show that the validity of survey response in Chinese <b>opinion</b> <b>surveys</b> is mainly influenced by the respondents' cognitive ability, political interest, media exposure, and cultural difference.

The aim is to demonstrate to central and eastern European governments and civil servants the utility of public <b>opinion</b> <b>surveys</b> before, during and after reforms in their countries and to encourage their systematic use. Up to now, public <b>opinion</b> <b>surveys</b> have received a great deal of scientific attention with regard to methodological problems of data gathering, data analysis and interpretation of data.
