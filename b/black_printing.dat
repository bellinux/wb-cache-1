25|$|In {{a letter}} of November 1937, to art {{historian}} Gunnar Jungmarker (1902–1983) at Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, Billman reveals {{that he is in}} an artistic crisis. The black and white woodcut restricts his expression - too brutal contrasts between black and white surfaces. It was not until 1940 he was able to present a woodcut with several grey tones, developed from the ordinary <b>black</b> <b>printing</b> ink. Gunnar Jungmarker called this type of woodcut: grisaille woodcut. A time-consuming printing process, exclusively for handprinting, with several grey-wood blocks (1-4) aside from the black and white key block. These first free grisaille woodcuts (made before the work with Dostoevsky's novel Crime and Punishment, in 1945) are based on self-perceived events for example from Billman's sailor years 1926-32, European travels 1936-39 and trips around Sweden during the war years. Some shining grisaille woodcuts are French Restaurant (1940), Artist Family (1941), Wilderness Kitchen (1942), Around a Guitar Player (1942), Stairway in the South (1942), Stormy Day, Dieppe sept. 1939 (1944) or Tropical Harbour (1945).|$|E

40|$|When {{compared}} to mainstream <b>print</b> media, the <b>black</b> <b>print</b> media has been improperly criticized, {{which leads to}} the question, how can and should the quality of the African American newspaper be measured? This subject has been under much debate {{since the beginning of the}} black press. This is a study of the California Eagle, an African American newspaper based in Los Angeles, coverage of WWII from 1941 to 1943. There are four main criticisms of the <b>black</b> <b>print</b> media that are the focus of this research project. Examples from the California Eagle were used to disprove these four theories: 1) second rate: black newspapers are read after mainstream newspapers are read, 2) sensationalism: black newspapers produce extreme emotional agitation in people, 3) ?race angling:? black newspapers exaggerate race relations, and 4) Elitism: black newspapers caters more to black elites. Several studies of the <b>black</b> <b>print</b> media have used the mainstream print media as the standard to compare and criticize the black newspaper. Although the <b>black</b> <b>print</b> media should be critiqued, to measure the quality of the black newspaper the <b>black</b> <b>print</b> media should not and can not be {{compared to}} mainstream print media...|$|R
