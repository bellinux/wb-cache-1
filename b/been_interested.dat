In her memoirs, Vogue editor Edna Woolman Chase recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that– although he had <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in acquiring the original– he had been unable to do so.

5|$|Again {{disappointed}} with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed {{for nearly three}} years. In addition to appearing in four films she toured Scotland and Ireland {{as part of a}} vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film Java Head (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, {{one of the most famous}} stars of the Beijing Opera.

40|$|In this essay, I offer a {{sympathetic}} {{reading of the}} rhetoric(s) of Augustine’s Confessions. First, as a historian of rhetoric I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in what Augustine’s narrative {{can tell us about}} the theory and practice of rhetoric in the late classical period and the early Christian era. From this perspective, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring what Augustine discloses about the rhetoric he learned in the provincial Roman schools, and taught at Carthage, Rome, and Milan. Second, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in Augustine’s own work on rhetoric, especially his De Doctrina Christiana, most of which he composed during the period right before he began the Confessions. In particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in how the rhetorical ethics that emerges from Augustine’s formal treatment of Biblical exegesis and preaching, and which distinguishes Augustine’s rhetoric from that of his classical predecessors, can illuminate our interpretation of the Confessions. Finally, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring how the Confessions itself works as a rhetorical text— that is, as a discourse addressed to an audience for the purpose of influence. In particular, I <b>am</b> <b>interested</b> in exploring the specific pastoral functions served by Augustine’s narrative...|$|R

5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> {{in the ditch}} since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit {{excavated}} sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, {{in an attempt to}} determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew that George Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may have <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in {{aviation}} {{since he was}} a boy, Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned down because {{he was the son of}} foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the Royal Air Force, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above-average ratings in all of his flying assessments.|$|E

5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete urine that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists have <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in proteinuria, the excess of protein in human urine, {{as an indicator of}} kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their urine. However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the urine in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E
5|$|In 1903–04 Vaughan Williams started {{collecting}} folk-songs. He {{had always}} <b>been</b> <b>interested</b> in them, and now followed {{the example of}} a recent generation of enthusiasts such as Cecil Sharp and Lucy Broadwood in going into the English countryside noting down and transcribing songs traditionally sung in various locations. Collections of the songs were published, preserving many that could otherwise have vanished as oral traditions died out. Vaughan Williams incorporated some into his own compositions, and more generally was influenced by their prevailing modal forms. This, together with his love of Tudor and Stuart music, helped shape his compositional style {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, VAT {{had started}} to seek a {{stronger}} partner when it negotiated with AB Scania-Vabis. The companies planned to use Scania engines in Vanaja vehicles but the plan proved too expensive for VAT. This may have led the major owners of VAT to start discussions about merging VAT and SAT. The chairman of VAT held regular meetings with the SAT manager Tor Nessling. In 1967, AB Scania-Vabis expressed its interest in VAT and German company Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG was interested in co-operation with, or acquisition of, VAT.
