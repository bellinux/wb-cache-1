When other bees were removed to create local-ized "competitive vacuums", the marked bees shifted their feeding {{activity}} toward the removal areas. <b>Bees</b> <b>foraging</b> in these competitive vacuums probed more flowers per in-florescence than control <b>bees.</b> One <b>bee's</b> <b>foraging</b> was stud-ied intensively {{before and after}} its local competitors were removed. Compared to four nestmates foraging elsewhere, the focal bee's trip times were shorter (p< 0. 005) and its food collection rate was marginally higher (P = 0. 064) dur-ing the removal, although all the <b>bees</b> <b>foraged</b> similarly before the removal.

50|$|C. edulis is an {{important}} <b>bee</b> <b>forage.</b> Furthermore, it serves as fodder for camels, goats, sheep and cattle in dry season but the shrubs cannot withstand long-term grazing pressure. It {{is essential for the}} livestock production, especially in central Somalia and eastern Ethiopia where C. edulis can cover 85% of the good-quality feed during the dry season. During the rainy season, the animals usually avoid the plant because of its high content of tannins in the leaves (see table below). The leaf content of K, Ca, Mg, S, Ni, Cr, V and Ti is adequate. The content of N and P is low, whereas the latter is probably a consequence of the low P stock in the soil. Al and Fe content is high, probably due to dust. Also, the Ca/Mg and Ca/P ratio is too high. Overall, there could be problems to cover the demand of P, Mg, Mn and partly Zn of grazing stock by feeding only Yeheb. C. edulis can cause intestinal disorders in goats when eaten as the sole diet.|$|E

The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E

In the present study we evaluated <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> flora composition and diversity within railway embankments located in the agricultural landscape, SE Poland. We also analysed the abundance of pollinators that use food resources along railway embankments and recognized insect visitors preference for selected plant species. Railway embankments represent valuable refuge areas for <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> flora (307 species, i. e. 76. 1 % of total flora) and pollinators (in total 4172 insect visits from 9 taxonomic groups). However, the richness and abundance of <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> flora significantly differed between types of the railway distinguished by traffic volume. The highest diversity of <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> flora is noted along the railway with intermediate traffic volume.

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} if railway embankments and road verges create refuge habitats for bee flora across agricultural landscape. The {{survey was conducted}} in 2009 – 2012, in the Lublin Province, SE Poland. Data on the <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> flora were obtained while making floristic charts along 60 transect plots × 300 m, with a total length of 18 [*] 000 m, {{for each type of}} linear structure. Forage bee flora was compared with respect to species richness, diversity, and evenness indices. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to characterize relationship between species composition and environmental variables. The <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> species richness and abundance were significantly greater on railway embankments than on road verges. The composition of species varied considerably; the number of <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> species common to both habitats was only approximately 38 % in entire data set. Most good-value <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> species were recorded along the embankments of railways with an intermediate traffic volume. <b>Bee</b> <b>forage</b> species diversity benefits from the location of habitat elements (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance is < 50 m. The lack of dense patches of valuable <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> species in the road verges was related to the high density of non-nectariferous graminoids.

40|$|The {{change of}} the {{location}} of the beehives on the diverse honeyfull pastures is the usual apiarists activity in the Republic of Croatia. The main reasons are the climatic and vegetation diversity, and richness of the floral composition, with numerous <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> plants. Our study aimed to detect consequences of honeybee broods (Queen-bee of different lineage) moving, from one habitat to another at various type of beehives. The Alberti-Žnideršič (AŽ), Langstroth-Root (LR) and Dadant-Blatt (DB) beehive types, constructed of (lime-tree), have been used. After the <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> on the Oilseed Rape in the beginning of April, the honeybee brood has been veterinary inspected (based on the Law of animal health protection in the Republic of Croatia) for varrosis, nosemosis and American foulbrood diseases.

The results of the study pointed out that different beehive types and the Queen-bee lineage (natural and selected) affect development of disease inside the honeybee brood, during the relocation and change from one dominant <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> plants to another. Certain allergy reactions occurring in people can be caused by the pollen of some honefull plants such as birch, grasses, ragweed, goldenrod and hazel.

This study investigated the performance of the honey bee subspecies Apis mellifera jemenitica Ruttner (Yemeni) and Apis mellifera carnica Pollmann (Carniolan) in weather that was hot and dry and in an environment of nectar-rich flora. The brood production, food storage, bee population and honey yield of Yemeni (native) and Carniolan (imported) colonies on Talh trees (Acacia gerrardii Benth.), a nectar-rich, subtropical, and summer <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> source in Central Arabia were evaluated. Owing to their structural and behavioral adaptations, the Yemeni bees constructed stronger (high population size) colonies than the Carniolan bees.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was carried out to {{determine}} an optimum honeybee colony’s carrying capacity of selected valleys dominated by Ziziphus spina-christi and Acacia tortilis in the Al-Baha region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted based on {{the assessment of the}} number of colonies kept, their productivities and the existing productive <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> resources in the target valleys with its economic implication. In the existing beekeeping practice, the average number of managed honeybee colonies introduced per square kilometer was 530 and 317 during the flowering period of Z. spina-christi and A. tortilis, respectively. Furthermore, the overall ratios of productive <b>bee</b> <b>forage</b> plants to the number of honeybee colonies introduced were 0. 55 and 11. 12 to Ziziphus trees and A. tortilis shrubs respectively. In the existing situation the average honey production potential of 5. 21 and 0. 34 kg was recorded per Ziziphus and A. tortilis plants per flowering season, respectively.

40|$|Given {{widespread}} {{declines in}} pollinator communities and increasing global reliance on pollinator-dependent crops, {{there is an}} acute {{need to develop a}} mechanistic understanding of native pollinator population and foraging biology. Using a population genetics approach, we determine the impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii. Our findings demonstrate that native <b>bee</b> <b>foraging</b> is far more plastic and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble <b>bees</b> <b>forage</b> further in pursuit of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives <b>bee</b> <b>foraging</b> distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities. Overall, this study reveals that natural and human-altered landscapes can be managed for increased native bee nesting and extended foraging, dually enhancing biodiversity and the spatial extent of pollination services...|$|R
