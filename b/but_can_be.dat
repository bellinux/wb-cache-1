5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery alkaline earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a form of}} carbon, diamond oxidizes in air if heated over 700°C. In {{absence of}} oxygen, e.g. in a flow of high-purity argon gas, diamond can be heated up to about 1700°C.
