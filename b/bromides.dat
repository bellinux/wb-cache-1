40|$|Abstract: Propargyl <b>bromide</b> {{is being}} {{investigated}} for its potential as a soil fumigant. Characterization of the fate of propargyl <b>bromide</b> in soil is important in determining both efficacy {{and the threat of}} environmental contamination. These experiments investigated some of the factors affecting the rate of propargyl <b>bromide</b> degradation in soil and quantified some of the products formed as a result of propargyl <b>bromide</b> degradation in four soils of differing composition and at three initial propargyl <b>bromide</b> concentrations. In all soils at all initial propargyl <b>bromide</b> concentrations, equimolar formation of Br was observed during propargyl <b>bromide</b> degradation, but little propargyl alcohol (product of hydrolysis) was formed. The apparent first-order degradation coefficient (k) increased with decreasing initial propargyl <b>bromide</b> concentration in all soils, but the mass degraded per unit time increased with increasing propargyl <b>bromide</b> concentration. The rate of propargyl <b>bromide</b> degradation increased with increasing soil organic matter content, and the k value was correlated to the organic carbon content of the soil (correlation coefficient> 0. 97 for all concentrations). Repeated application of propargyl <b>bromide</b> did not increase the rate of propargyl <b>bromide</b> degradation in soil. Addition of Br did not affect the rate of propargyl <b>bromide</b> transformation in soil, so accumulation of Br in the soil is not expected to impede propargyl <b>bromide</b> degradation...|$|R
5|$|Nearly all {{elements}} in the periodic table form binary <b>bromides.</b> The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the noble gases, {{with the exception of}} xenon in the very unstable XeBr2); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond bismuth); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's (oxygen, fluorine, and chlorine), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not <b>bromides</b> but rather oxides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine.|$|E
5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent <b>bromides</b> and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated {{hygroscopic}} compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and <b>bromides.</b> For example, when treated with potassium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid, Th4+ forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, K2ThF6.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium <b>bromides</b> are {{produced}} {{by the action of}} aluminium bromide, hydrogen bromide, carbon tetrabromide or a mixture of hydrogen bromide and thionyl bromide on protactinium oxide. An alternative reaction is between protactinium pentachloride and hydrogen bromide or thionyl bromide. Protactinium(V) bromide has two similar monoclinic forms, one is obtained by sublimation at 400–410°C and another by sublimation at slightly lower temperature of 390–400°C.|$|E

5|$|Bromide compounds, {{especially}} potassium bromide, {{were frequently}} used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. <b>Bromides</b> {{in the form}} of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, <b>bromides,</b> and iodides are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E

Therefore, a laboratory study was conducted to identify the effects of sediment content and initial <b>bromide</b> concentration on adsorption of <b>bromide</b> for selected soils. When <b>bromide</b> solutions were used within the appropriate instrument measurement range, neither soil texture, liming, nor sediment content were found to significantly affect adsorption of <b>bromide.</b> In contrast to systems using fluorescent dyes, correction factors for estimating adsorption of <b>bromide</b> are unnecessary.

40|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of <b>bromide</b> on the {{chlorination}} of NF 90 polyamide membranes have been investigated by a comparison between chlorination with and without <b>bromide</b> ions. The experimental results showed that chlorination {{in the presence of}} <b>bromide</b> ions (from 1 to 200 ppm Br-) makes the membrane simultaneously chlorinated and brominated. Increasing <b>bromide</b> concentration enhanced bromine uptake of the membrane, and shifted the halogenated form of the membrane from chlorinated to mixed and then to fully brominated. Chlorination under the condition of 100 ppm-hr Cl- 2 increased the ratio of bromine to chlorine content from 0. 13 at 1 ppm <b>bromide</b> concentration to 252 at 100 ppm <b>bromide</b> concentration. The bromine, oxidized from <b>bromide</b> ions by the addition of chlorine, outcompeted the chlorine during chlorination. Furthermore, chlorination of the membrane with 100 ppm <b>bromide</b> ions caused more bromination than chlorination with 100 ppm bromine did. Once the chlorine bound to the membrane, the chlorine could not oxidize <b>bromide</b> to bromine. The flux decline of membranes exposed to chlorine with <b>bromide</b> was greater than that of membranes chlorinated without <b>bromide,</b> especially at lower pH.

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} drugs were the sedative <b>bromides</b> (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs were available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E
5|$|Two {{neptunium}} chlorides, NpCl3 and NpCl4, {{have been}} characterized. Although several attempts to create NpCl5 have been made, {{they have not}} been successful. NpCl3 is created by reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and NpCl4 by reacting a neptunium oxide with CCl4 at around 500°C. Other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported, including NpOCl2, Cs2NpCl6, Cs3NpO2Cl4, and Cs2NaNpCl6. Neptunium <b>bromides</b> NpBr3 and NpBr4 have also been created; the latter by reacting aluminium bromide with NpO2 at 350°C and the former in an almost identical procedure but with zinc present. The neptunium iodide NpI3 has also been prepared by the same method as NpBr3.|$|E
5|$|Seawater is {{invariably}} salty and, {{although its}} degree of saltiness (salinity) can vary, about 90% {{of the water}} in the ocean has 34– (1.2 oz.) of dissolved solids per liter, producing a salinity between 3.4 and 3.5%. To easily describe small differences, however, oceanographers usually express salinity as a millage (‰) or part per thousand (ppt) instead of using percents. The surface salinity of waters in the Northern Hemisphere are generally closer to the 34‰ mark, while those in the South are closer to 35‰. The solutes in ocean water come both from inflowing river water and from the ocean floor. The relative composition of the solutes is stable throughout the world's oceans: sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) make up about 85%. Other solutes include metal ions such as magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and negative ions such as sulfate (SO₄), carbonate (CO₃), and <b>bromides.</b> In the absence of other pollution, seawater would not be harmful to drink except that it is much too saline; similarly, it cannot be used for irrigating most plants without being desalinated.

5|$|Two {{forms of}} {{berkelium}}(III) bromide are known, a monoclinic with berkelium coordination 6 and orthorhombic with coordination 8; {{the latter is}} less stable and transforms to the former phase upon heating to about 350 °C. An important phenomenon for radioactive solids has been studied for these two crystal forms: the structures of fresh and aged 249BkBr3 samples were studied using X-ray diffraction over a period longer than 3 years, so that various fractions of 249Bk had beta decayed to 249Cf. No change in structure was observed upon the 249BkBr3—249CfBr3 transformation, even though the orthorhombic bromide was previously unknown for californium. However, other differences were noted for 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3. For example, the latter could be reduced with hydrogen to249CfBr2, but the former could be not – this result was reproduced on individual 249BkBr3 and 249CfBr3 samples, as well on the samples containing both <b>bromides.</b> The intergrowth of californium in berkelium occurs {{at a rate of}} 0.22% per day and is an intrinsic obstacle in studying berkelium properties.

This confirms binding studies to transfected human muscarinic receptors which suggested that tiotropium <b>bromide</b> dissociates slowly from M 3 -receptors (on airway smooth muscle) but rapidly from M 2 autoreceptors (on cholinergic nerve terminals).
