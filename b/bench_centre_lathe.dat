40|$|The hazard of scrotal cancer from cutting oils {{was first}} {{recognized}} in the 1950 s, and led to various control measures including the introduction of solvent refined oils, use of splash guards, provision of protective clothing and washing facilities and education of workers to encourage early detection and treatment of tumours. To assess how effective these controls have been, we have analyzed occupational mortality from scrotal cancer in England and Wales during 1979 - 80 and 1982 - 90. Over this 11 -year period 85 deaths were attributed to the disease in men aged 20 - 74. This represents a reduction in mortality from the 1960 s. Significantly elevated proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were found in press and machine tool setters (PMR 1, 678, five deaths), <b>centre</b> <b>lathe</b> turners (PMR 1, 099, three deaths) and machine tool operators (PMR 303, eight deaths), {{but all of the}} metal machinists who died of scrotal cancer had been born before 1930, and could have worked with cutting oils before controls were introduced.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems of modern production techniques is the achievement of an appropriate quality at minimal costs and accompanied by the production efficiency increase. Therefore, while designing the production process, the technology used should have a considerable influence on the durability and reliability of machine parts to be produced. During finish treatment, the final dimensions as well as functional properties are imparted to a given element by application of proper treatment type. The engineer has a range of production techniques to choose for the proper surface layer formation. It is crucial to find a suitable solution which will meet the requirements {{as well as the}} work conditions of a given machine part. The article presents the preliminary research results referring to the analysis of the influence of finishing lathing on the cutting forces and surface roughness of steel.

5000|$|A toolroom lathe is a lathe {{optimized}} for toolroom work. It is essentially just a top-of-the-line center lathe, {{with all of}} the best optional features that may be omitted from less expensive models, such as a collet closer, taper attachment, and others. The bed of a toolroom lathe is generally wider than that of a standard <b>centre</b> <b>lathe.</b> There has also been an implication over the years of selective assembly and extra fitting, with every care taken in the building of a toolroom model to make it the smoothest-running, most-accurate version of the machine that can be built. However, within one brand, the quality difference between a regular model and its corresponding toolroom model depends on the builder and in some cases has been partly marketing psychology. For name-brand machine tool builders who made only high-quality tools, there wasn't necessarily any lack of quality in the base-model product for the [...] "luxury model" [...] to improve upon. In other cases, especially when comparing different brands, the quality differential between (1) an entry-level center lathe built to compete on price, and (2) a toolroom lathe meant to compete only on quality and not on price, can be objectively demonstrated by measuring TIR, vibration, etc. In any case, because of their fully ticked-off option list and (real or implied) higher quality, toolroom lathes are more expensive than entry-level center lathes.|$|R

40|$|Machining is a {{convoluted}} {{process in}} which many variables can deleterious the desired results. Among them, cutting tool vibration is the most decisive phenomenon which influences dimensional precision of the components machined, functional behavior of the machine tools and life of the cutting tool. In a machining operation, cutting speed, depth of cut and the tool feed rate principally influence cutting tool vibrations. In this paper, effects of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut on cutting tool vibration in both the directions, i. e. axial and tangential are investigated by the statistical methods of {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR), analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis. Experiments have been conducted using the L 9 orthogonal array in the <b>centre</b> <b>lathe</b> machine. Carbon steel was selected as cutting tool materials to conduct the experiments. From experimental results, the amplitude of vibration of the cutting tool was ascertaining for each machining performance criteria. The significance and percentage contribution of each parameter were determined by Analysis of variance (ANOVA). It has been observed that cutting speed has a maximum contribution on cutting tool vibration in both the directions. Variation of the vibration of cutting tool with machining parameters was mathematically modeled by using the regression analysis method. The predicted value from the developed model and experimental values are found to be very close to each other justifying the significance of the model. Confirmation runs demonstrates that the optimized result and the values obtained through regression analysis are within the prescribed limi...|$|R

The research attempts to increase the service life of shafts. The article presents the research results referring {{to the analysis of}} the influence of finish treatment (finishing turning, grinding, burnishing) on the friction properties of steel applied to marine pump shafts. The research was performed on a roller 39 mm in diameter made of 304 L stainless steel. The finish tooling of pump shaft pins was carry out on a universal <b>centre</b> <b>lathe.</b> The finish turning process was carried out by means of a WING WF 080408 Sandvik Coromant cutting tool with replaceable inserts. The grinding process was performed by grinding attachment for lathes. The 1 – 80 x 10 x 32 – 99 C 80 -N V grinding wheel was used for the process. The process of burnishing was done by SRMD single roll burnishing tool by Yamato. The burnishing process was carried out at the following technological parameters: burnishing force 1. 1 kN, burnishing speed 35 m/min, feed 0. 13 mm/rev.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an original {{piece of work}} and contribution to knowledge by creating a new process planning system; Haptic Aided Process Planning (HAPP). This system {{is based on the}} combination of haptics and virtual reality (VR). HAPP creates a simulative machining environment where Process plans are automatically generated from the real time logging of a user’s interaction. Further, through the application of a novel usability test methodology, a deeper study of how this approach compares to conventional process planning was undertaken. An abductive research approach was selected and an iterative and incremental development methodology chosen. Three development cycles were undertaken with evaluation studies carried {{out at the end of}} each. Each study, the pre-pilot, pilot and industrial, identified progressive refinements to both the usability of HAPP and the usability evaluation method itself. HAPP provided process planners with an environment similar to which they are already familiar. Visual images were used to represent tools and material whilst a haptic interface enabled their movement and positioning by an operator in a manner comparable to their native setting. In this way an intuitive interface was developed that allowed users to plan the machining of parts consisting of features that can be machined on a pillar drill, 21 / 2 D axis milling machine or <b>centre</b> <b>lathe.</b> The planning activities included single or multiple set ups, fixturing and sequencing of cutting operations.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The work of the author {{was to investigate the}} static, dynamic and machining behaviour of some new designs of slug damped boring bars with a 10 to 1 overhang ratio. The bars were mounted on a <b>centre</b> <b>lathe.</b> The static behaviour of a boring bar in relation to the geometric form errors that might be produced during boring was studied both analytically and experimentally. Specifically, two types of errors were considered, namely, a) errors that arise on entry of the boring tool into the workpiece) known as the "bell-mouth" errors; and b) reproducibility of eccentricity errors, known as the "copying" errors. The theory for "bell-mouth" errors did not seem to fit the results well; however, the theory did prove that such errors could exist. The theory for “copying” errors agreed remarkably well with the results provided that the initial eccentricity was small compared with the depth of cut. The dynamical behaviour of the slug damped boring bar was modelled by a mathematical analogue. Despite its inability to properly account for the compressibility effect of the gaseous damping fluid, the model revealed the possibility of design improvements. In consequence, the optimally-tuned slug-damped tungsten-bunged bar was conceived, Manufactured and tested along with a solid bar for comparison purposes, a slug-damped recessed bar and a slug-damped steel-bunged bar. The machining behaviour of a boring bar was studied in terms of the maximum depth of cut that it could cope before the occurrence of chatter. At first, a stability model was developed based on the mathematical analogue formulated {{in the study of the}} dynamical behaviour. But since this analogue did not fit the results accurately, a second and more precise model was set up using the frequency response obtained from dynamic experiments instead. The concept of negative damping coefficient was used; and a one-to-one correspondence between the asymptotic value of the negative damping coefficient and the limiting depth of cut was found to exist. By virtue of this, it is in principle possible to predict the limiting depth of cut of any machine tool system whose frequency response characteristics are known. Compared with other bars tested, the optimally-tuned tungsten-bunged bar was found to have the best dynamic and machining characteristics as reflected in the limiting depth of cut of 0. 10511 (2. 67 mm) to 0. 110 " (2. 79 mm) at the feed of 0. 0065 "/rev (0. 165 mm/rev) and the speed of 500 rprn on a 3. 5 " dia. bore (140 m/min) of EN 8 steel.
