5|$|The city is, and {{has been}} for centuries, the main hub of {{transportation}} for the Podlaskie Voivodeship and the entire northeastern section of Poland. It is a major city on the European Union roadways (Via Baltica) and railways (Rail Baltica) to the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republics</b> and Finland. It is also a main gateway of trade with Belarus due to its proximity to the border and its current and longstanding relationship with Hrodno, Belarus.|$|E
5|$|Bagramyan's {{experience}} in military planning as a {{chief of staff}} allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander {{in the early stages}} of the Soviet counter-offensives against Nazi Germany. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942, and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the commander of the 1st Baltic Front. As commander of the Baltic Front, he participated in the offensives which pushed German forces out of the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} conquered a huge area, {{including the}} <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics,</b> Belarus and West Ukraine. After the successful Battle of Smolensk, Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to halt its advance to Moscow and temporarily divert its Panzer groups {{to aid in}} the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev. This pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves. The Moscow offensive, which resumed in October 1941, ended disastrously in December. On 7 December 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Four days later, Germany declared war on the United States.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} {{operations}} in Kursk, the Soviets {{began a series of}} offensives on various fronts to push the Germans out of the occupied Soviet republics. In October 1943, Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army was transferred to the Second Baltic Front which was concentrated on the retaking of Belarus and namely, the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b> In November, Stalin offered Bagramyan the position of head commander of the First Baltic Front which had the similar objectives of the Second but was making little headway in its attempts to advance northwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} {{stagnation}} {{brought about the}} crisis of the Soviet system and reforms could not be long delayed. The new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985 and responded with glasnost and perestroika. They were attempts to reform the Soviet system from above to avoid revolution from below. The reforms failed to take into account that the USSR was held together by military force by repressing all forms of nationalism. The freedoms of Glasnost released long suppressed feelings of nationalism in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics,</b> in a development known as the Singing Revolution. The first major demonstrations against the system were in Riga in November 1986 and the following spring in Tallinn. Small successful protests encouraged key individuals {{and by the end of}} 1988 the reform wing had gained a decisive position in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b>|$|E

40|$|Upon the annex of Lithuania as a Soviet state, the Soviet Union imposed {{an order}} on Lithuanian {{athletic}} figures {{to represent the}} Soviet Union. Lithuanian athletes would now be obligated to represent the Soviet Union in all international sporting events in which they competed. The international success of Soviet Athletes, which did not exclude Lithuanians, was immense. This strength shown through athletes was meant to bolster the image of Soviet citizens as a unit, but by strengthening athletes in Lithuania, pride and nationalism grew in the small <b>Baltic</b> <b>republic</b> as Lithuanians became proud of their flag despite the Soviet Occupation...|$|R
5000|$|Eesti Gaas was {{established}} in 1990 as a state enterprise. [...] The company was partly privatized in 1993-1995. In 1993, 30% stake in Eesti Gaas was transferred to Lentransgaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom, to eliminate the gas debt dispute. In 1994, Ruhrgas (later: E.ON Ruhrgas) acquired about 15% of the company's shares while {{the management of the}} company together with other private investors, and the UK-based <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republic</b> Fund acquired 7.5% of shares both. [...] As a result, the Government of Estonia kept 39% stake. [...] In December 1996, Ruhrgas increased its stake to 21%; 12% was sold to public. In January 1999, the remaining state-owned shares were sold. Ruhrgas increased its stake up to 32%, Gazprom kept its 30% stake and Neste (later Fortum) got 10% stake. Later that year Itera (now part of Rosneft) Latvian branch acquired nearly 10% stake from the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republic</b> Fund. In following years, Gazprom increased its stake up to 37%, E.ON up to 33.66% and Fortum up to 17.7% by buying shares from private investors. [...] In 2014, E.ON sold its stake to Fortum, which became the largest shareholder with 51.4% stake. [...] In February 2016, it was announced that Fortum will sell its stake to Trilini Energy, a company controlled by the investment firm Infortar, the major shareholder of the shipping company Tallink. Later Trilini also acquired 50.9% of shares qoned previously by Gazprom.|$|R
25|$|The Soviet Union {{conducted}} {{a policy of}} Russification by encouraging Russians and other Russian-speaking ethnic groups of the Soviet Union to settle in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republics.</b> Today, ethnic Russian immigrants from the former Soviet Union and their descendants make up a sizable minority in the Baltic states, particularly in Latvia (about one-quarter {{of the total population}} and close to one-half in the capital Riga) and Estonia (one-quarter of the population).|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{military}} {{administrative control}} over the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> area where the Army Group North would be deployed was exercised by the Special Baltic Military District which after the invasion was renamed into the Northwestern Front (Colonel General Fyodor Kuznetsov). The front had the 8th and 11th Armies with the 27th Armies in its second echelon; the Northwestern Front had 28 rifle, 4 tank and 2 motorized divisions.|$|E
25|$|Catholics {{formed a}} {{substantial}} and active religious constituency in the Soviet Union. Their number increased dramatically with the annexation of territories of the Second Polish Republic in 1939 and the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> in 1940. Catholics in the Soviet Union were divided between those {{belonging to the}} Roman Catholic Church, which was recognized by the government, and those remaining loyal to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, banned since 1946.|$|E

50|$|The Baltic Republican Party (BRP) is {{a former}} {{political}} party in the Russian Federation. It was founded on 1 December 1993 in Kaliningrad Oblast and lost its official status as a political party on 26 March 2003 due to the new Russian Law on political parties which requires that each party should have regional branches at least in half of the Russian Federation constituencies and at least 10,000 members in strength. An appeal was lost in February 2005 before the Constitutional Court of Russia. The main political purpose of the party was {{the establishment of an}} autonomous <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republic</b> instead of the Kaliningrad region, possibly total independence. It also wanted the old name Königsberg restored. Its leaders were Sergei Pasko and Rustam Vasiliev.|$|R
25|$|In March and April 1989 {{elections}} to the Congress of People's Deputies took place throughout the Soviet Union. This returned many pro-independence republicans, as many CPSU candidates were rejected. The televised Congress debates allowed {{the dissemination of}} pro-independence propositions. Indeed, 1989 would see numerous nationalistic protests; for example, beginning with the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> in January, laws were passed in most non-Russian republics giving precedence for the local language over Russian.|$|E
25|$|The main {{issues are}} the territories which {{were part of}} Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in the interwar period, but which became {{incorporated}} into the Russian SFSR, Byelorussian SSR and Poland after World War II. In addition, some territories that were not controlled by the independent <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> were also annexed during the Soviet era. Most notable case is Vilnius taken from Poland by the USSR to become the capital of Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May 1990 {{the leaders}} of the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> signed a joint {{declaration}} known as the Baltic Entente. By mid-June the Soviets started negotiations with the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> on condition they agreed to freeze their declarations of independence. The Soviets had a bigger challenge elsewhere, {{in the form of the}} Russian Federal Republic proclaiming sovereignty in June. Simultaneously the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> also started to negotiate directly with the Russian Federal Republic. In Autumn 1990, they set up a customs border between the Baltic states, the Russian Federation and Belarus. After the failed negotiations the Soviets made a dramatic attempt to break the deadlock and sent troops to Lithuania and Latvia in January 1991. The attempts failed, dozens of civilians were killed, and the Soviet troops decided to retreat. In August 1991, the hard-line members of the Soviet government attempted to take control of the Soviet Union. One day after the coup on 21 August, the Estonians proclaimed independence. Shortly afterwards Soviet paratroops seized the Tallinn television tower. The Latvian parliament made similar a declaration at the same day. The coup failed but the Collapse of the Soviet Union became unavoidable. On 28 August, the European Community welcomed the restoration of the sovereignty and independence of the Baltic states. The Soviet Union recognised the Baltic independence on 6 September 1991. The Russian troops stayed for an additional three years, as Boris Yeltsin linked the issue of Russian minorities with troop withdrawals. Lithuania was the first to have the Russian troops withdrawn from its territory in August 1993. On 26 July 1994 Russian troops withdrew from Estonia and on 31 August 1994, Russian troops withdrew from Latvia. The Russian Federation ended its military presence in Estonia after it relinquished control of the nuclear facilities in Paldiski on 26 September 1995 and in Latvia after Skrunda-1 suspended operations on 31 August 1998 and subsequently dismantled. The last Russian soldier left Skrunda-1 in October 1999, thus marking a symbolic end to the Russian military presence on the soil of the Baltic countries.|$|E
5000|$|Buchanan {{states in}} the article Can Uncle Sam let go?: After the Russia-Georgia clash last August, Bush declared, [...] "It's {{important}} {{for the people of}} Lithuania to know that when the United States makes a commitment - we mean it." [...] But [...] "mean" [...] what? That a Russian move on Vilnius will be met by U.S. strikes on Mother Russia? Are we insane? Let us thank Divine Providence Russia has not tested the pledge. For can anyone believe that, to keep Moscow from re-establishing its hegemony over a tiny <b>Baltic</b> <b>republic,</b> we would sink Russian ships, blockade Russian ports, bomb Russian airfields, attack Russian troop concentrations? That would risk having some Russian general respond with atomic weapons on US air, sea and ground forces. Great powers do not go to war against other great powers unless vital interests are imperiled. Throughout the Cold War, that was true of both America and Russia.|$|R

40|$|Green {{growth is}} resource-efficient, cleaner {{economic}} growth and more resilient growth without slowing it. “Green growth’’ not only affects the quality of growth, but overall production. In this case, growth results from the investment in the upgrading of the entire production system to environmental and resource-saving processes and products. A prototype of this phenomenon is the climate-friendly ‘‘low-carbon economy. ’’ Green growth is expected in implementation of Europe 2020 stratgey and can provide to harminized development and cohesion {{of old and new}} EU member states. Europe 2020 is the EU’s growth stratgey based on the growth of smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. The comparative study of green growth indicators and use of EU Structural Funds in 2007 – 2013 period in <b>Baltics</b> and Czech <b>Republic</b> and Slovakia was performed with the aim to define the role of financing from EU Structural Funds for enhancement of green growth in <b>Baltic</b> States, Czech <b>Republic</b> and Slovakia. The performed comparative assessment revealed that Czech Republic allocated the highest share of means form EU Structural Funds to enhance green growth. In terms of development of green growth indicators Czech Republic is also among the best performing countries following Estonia. The analysis of the use of EU Structural Funds in 2007 – 2013 in five new EU member states indicated that the EU Structural Funds has positively influenced the development of RES in <b>Baltic</b> States, Czech <b>Republic</b> and Slovakia. The increase of renewable energy capacities in <b>Baltic</b> States, Czech <b>Republic</b> and Slovakia also contributed to the reduction of carbon intensity of economy, reduction of environmental pollution, climate change mitigation and energy import dependency...|$|R
25|$|By 1991, {{economic}} and political turmoil began to boil over, as the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On March 17, a referendum was held, in which {{the vast majority of}} participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation. In August 1991, a coup d'état attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led {{to the end of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On December 25, 1991, the USSR was dissolved into 15 post-Soviet states.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{democratisation}} of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had irreparably {{undermined the}} power of the CPSU and Gorbachev himself. The relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re-awakening long-suppressed nationalist and anti-Russian feelings in the Soviet republics. Calls for greater independence from Moscow's rule grew louder, especially in the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which had been annexed into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin in 1940. Nationalist feeling also took hold in Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|The first Supreme Soviet {{elections}} {{took place}} in March 1989. There was still only one legal communist party, but the availability of multi-candidate choice encouraged the popular fronts and other groups to spread their own electoral message. The Communist Party in all three <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> was divided along nationalist lines, and political leaders were increasingly responding to people rather than the party. The biggest demonstration was the Baltic Way in August 1989, where people protested on the fiftieth anniversary of the Molotov–Ribbentrop treaty by a human chain linking hands across the three republics. Still, by 1990, there were not yet calls for political independence but demands for economic independence from Moscow.|$|E
5000|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Joseph Stalin {{carried out a}} major {{resettlement}} campaign in the three <b>Baltic</b> Soviet <b>republics.</b> The Russians, along with {{a smaller number of}} other Soviet ethnic groups, who migrated to the Baltic were mostly factory workers who settled in major urban areas, as well as military personnel stationed in the region in significant numbers due to the border location of the Baltic States within the Soviet Union. Many military retirees chose to stay in the region, which featured higher living standards compared to most of Russia.|$|R

25|$|The total {{numbers of}} those {{deported}} between 1944 and 1955 {{has been estimated}} at 124,000 in Estonia, 136,000 in Latvia and 245,000 in Lithuania. The deportees were allowed to return after the secret speech of Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, however many did not survive in their years in Siberia. Large numbers of {{the inhabitants of the}} Baltic countries fled westwards before the Soviet forces arrived in 1944. After the war, the Soviets established new borders for the <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics.</b> Lithuania gained the regions of Vilnius and Klaipeda, but Estonia and Latvia ceded some eastern territories to the Russian SSR. Estonia lost 5 percent and Latvia 2 percent of its prewar territory.|$|E
25|$|During the Soviet {{occupation}} (1940–1991), {{the policy}} of Russification greatly affected the Latvian language. Throughout this period, many Latvians and Latvia’s other ethnicities faced deportation and persecution. A massive immigration from the Soviet republics of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and others followed, {{largely as a result}} of Stalin's plan to integrate Latvia and the other <b>Baltic</b> <b>republics</b> into the Soviet Union by means of Russian colonization. As a result, the proportion of the ethnic Latvian population within the total population was reduced from 80% in 1935 to 52% in 1989. In Soviet Latvia, most of the immigrants who settled in the country did not learn Latvian. Today, Latvian is the mother tongue of more than 60% of the country's population.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} 5,025 submachine {{guns and}} 1,900 rifles {{were brought in}} {{to ensure that the}} operatives were sufficiently armed. Telecommunications was a vital component to ensure smooth running of the operation, thus the MGB commandeered all civilian telephone exchanges for the duration an brought in an extra 2,210 MGB communications personnel. 4,437 freight railway cars were delivered. A total of 8,422 trucks were organised. 5,010 civilian trucks were commandeered and the remaining vehicles were military origin, including 1,202 imported from the Leningrad Military District, 210 from the Byelorussian Military District and 700 from Internal Troops. These additional vehicles were stationed just outside the border of the <b>Baltic</b> <b>Republics</b> in advance so as not to raise suspicion and sent in {{at the start of the}} operation.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the failure}} of this, further {{proposals}} came in 1762 and 1771, both times proposing the joint free port status of Marstrand, the previously mentioned Slite, and Visby (the capital of Gotland, and during the medieval period a <b>Baltic</b> merchant <b>republic).</b> In 1775 the plan finally bore fruit, {{in part due to}} the efforts of King Louis XV in previous years towards influencing the young Crown Prince Gustav in favour of the idea, as it was beneficial to France's economic interests. In 1772, with French backing, the newly crowned Gustav III launched the Revolution of 1772, a bloodless coup d'état that overthrew the Riksdag and established the rule of would-be enlightened absolutism.|$|R
