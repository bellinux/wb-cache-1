25|$|One {{of the big}} {{activities}} is trips to base camp (aka trekking), which can be higher {{than some of the}} highest mountains. The other big activity is serious attempts {{to make it to the}} top of Everest, and those in support of those attempts. The peak time for this is late May, because that is when the monsoons push the jet stream away, there is another time later in the year when the monsoon ends yielding another break in the weather, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> snow then. Some technology for climbing include crampons, fixed ropes, various cold-weather gear, bottled oxygen, and weather prediction. Predicting the weather is critical, one of the big disasters came in 1996 when a storm hit during a summit bid. In modern times, there is greater on-demand logistical support available such as internet access, but also some new challenges like not offending the locals and watching out for oxygen-bottle thefts. Helicopter support has grown and the availability of helicopter rescues increased, but there are limits on how high and in what weather they are able to fly. Modern dangers remain unexpected avalanches (this claimed many in 2014 and 2015), sudden onset of altitude sickness, and that classic climbing danger- falling. For a price, permits are available from China in the Tibet region and from Nepal and there is a multitude of mountaineering firms world over operating on the mountain.|$|E

500|$|... "The key to {{understanding}} Smith," [...] Johnson wrote, [...] "was that, like other white Rhodesians, he clung to an almost Victorian {{view of the world}} both in moral values and in the easy assumptions of British primacy that characterised the empire." [...] Bill Schwarz took a similar line, writing that Smith and his supporters reacted to the British Empire's demise by imagining white Rhodesians to be [...] "the final survivors of a lost civilisation", charged with [...] "tak on the mantle of historic Britain" [...] in the imperial power's absence. [...] "He spoke endlessly about how Rhodesians had been more British than the British," [...] Boynton reflected, [...] "and how this small community of decent, fair-minded whites had been betrayed by, well, just about everybody he could think of... It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right—both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians". Smith's [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered [...] "unfair and inaccurate": [...] "Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph... <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the two-factor model was challenged by studies that suggested a third factor (interactional justice) may be involved. [...] Bies and Moag (1986) argue that interactional justice is distinct from procedural justice because it represents the social exchange component of the interaction {{and the quality of}} treatment whereas procedural justice represents the processes that were used to arrive at the decision outcomes. [...] Generally researchers are in agreement regarding the distinction between procedural and distributive justice <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> controversy over the distinction between interactional and procedural justice (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001). [...] Colquitt (2001) demonstrated that a four-factor model (including procedural, distributive, interpersonal, and informational justice) fit the data significantly better than a two or three factor model. [...] Colquitt's construct validation study also showed that each of the four components have predictive validity for different key organizational outcomes (e.g., commitment and rule compliance).|$|E
2500|$|In the wild, {{diseases}} and parasites are normally at low levels, {{and kept in}} check by natural predation on weakened individuals. In crowded net pens they can become epidemics. Diseases and parasites also transfer from farmed to wild salmon populations. A recent study in British Columbia links the spread of parasitic sea lice from river salmon farms to wild pink salmon in the same river. The European Commission (2002) concluded [...] "The reduction of wild salmonid abundance is also linked to other factors <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> and more scientific evidence establishing a direct link {{between the number of}} lice-infested wild fish and the presence of cages in the same estuary." [...] It is reported that wild salmon on the west coast of Canada are being driven to extinction by sea lice from nearby salmon farms. These predictions have been disputed by other scientists and recent harvests have indicated that the predictions were in error. [...] In 2011, Scottish salmon farming introduced the use of farmed wrasse for the purpose of cleaning farmed salmon of ectoparasites.|$|E

2500|$|Charlie Soong {{was born}} as Han Jiaozhun (韓教準) {{in the western}} suburbs of Wenchang City in Hainan {{province}} as the third son of Han Hongyi (韓鴻翼 Hán Hóngyì) on October 17, 1861. [...] He was a Wenchang Hainanese, whose ancestors were Hakka people. As a teenager, he sailed to Boston, Massachusetts to work for an uncle at his shop in the city's Chinatown district. After working for his uncle for a short time, he acquired a job working for the U.S. Revenue Marine (the forerunner of the U.S. Coast Guard) on board the USS Albert Gallatin {{under the command of}} Captain Eric Gabrielson. After approximately a year of service, Gabrielson was transferred to Wilmington, North Carolina. Soong followed Gabrielson to North Carolina not long afterwards to work on the USS Schuyler Colfax. After arriving in Wilmington, Soong eventually converted to the Christian faith and was baptized Charles Jones Soon—Charlie Soon was probably an anglicized version of his given name Jiaozhun (Chiao-Chun), <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> confusion towards from where he got his middle name Jones. It was not until years after that he changed his name to Soong.|$|E
