50|$|On 21 February 1945, the 4th Marine Division {{was locked}} in battle against strong enemy forces {{protecting}} Motoyama Airfield #1. Multiple enemy defensive <b>belts</b> <b>guarded</b> this major complex on Iwo Jima's central plateau. The 24th Marines were assigned {{to drive to the}} O-1 line and clear the airfield.|$|R
50|$|In one of {{the issues}} by Super Action Komiks Darna was {{illustrated}} differently. This time she's wearing a chest and stomach-bearing red-trimmed blue one-piece with red shoulder pads, ruby encrusted gold winged medallion tiara, blue bracelets and <b>belt,</b> blue knee <b>guards</b> with yellow wings, and red boots.|$|R
50|$|Players are {{required}} to use a powerchair with 4 or more wheels. The maximum allowable speed during a match is 10 km/h (6.2 mph), and the referees will inspect the players' speed before the match begins. A lap <b>belt</b> and foot <b>guard</b> are also required equipment. The ball is an oversized soccer ball, 13 inches (33 cm) in diameter.|$|R
60|$|He {{would not}} wear such a corslet {{as had been}} crushed into his {{shoulder}} at Gaza, but put on a breastplate of thick quilted linen, girt with a broad leather <b>belt,</b> <b>guarded</b> with a crust of finely-worked metal, and holding a light, sharp sword. He had a polished steel helmet, a long spear in his right hand, and a shield on his left arm; and thus he went forth to meet Darius, who came {{in the midst of}} 200 chariots, armed with scythes, and fifteen trained elephants. He had so many troops that he intended to close the wings of his army in upon the Greeks, fold them up, and cut them off; but Alexander, foreseeing this, had warned his men to be ready to face about on any side, and then drew them up {{in the shape of a}} wedge, and thus broke into the very heart of the Immortal band, and was on the point of taking Darius prisoner, when he was called off to help Parmenio, whose division had been broken, so that the camp was threatened. Alexander’s presence soon set all right again, and made the victory complete; but Darius had had time to get away, and was galloping on a swift horse to the Armenian mountains. There was nobody left to defend Assyria, and Alexander marched in through the brazen gates of Babylon, when the streets were strewn with flowers, and presents of lions and leopards borne forth to greet the conqueror.|$|R
50|$|While the gunong {{dates back}} centuries before colonial times, {{it became more}} {{prevalent}} in 1915 when General John J. Pershing issued an order outlawing the wearing of swords. Now unable to carry traditional machetes or broadswords, people turned to the gunong {{to fill the gap}} without arousing the fears of the American colonial authorities. Around this time, the gunong became larger and was crafted with a pistol-grip handle rather than the old straight hilts. More extravagant fittings with chased bands on scabbards, <b>belt</b> clips, <b>guards,</b> and bulbous ferrules also became common. After World War II, thinner-bladed gunong were made from newer materials like nickel and aluminium.|$|R
25|$|Parade uniform (Paradeuniform) – The parade uniform for {{officers}} was the semi-dress/walking-out tunic {{with all}} authorized orders, awards and decorations attached, breeches and riding boots, steel helmet, white shirt, dark-gray necktie, and a ceremonial dagger worn {{on the left}} side and fastened to a silver-gray parade <b>belt.</b> Officers in <b>guards</b> of honor carried sabers. In winter, a greatcoat, scarf, and gloves were worn.|$|R
50|$|The parade uniform (Paradeuniform) for {{officers}} was the semi-dress jacket {{worn with}} all awards and decorations, breeches and riding boots, steel helmet or police shako (Tschako) from 1950 {{to the late}} 1960s, white shirt, green neck-tie, and a ceremonial dagger on the left side, fastened to a silver-grey parade <b>belt.</b> Officers in <b>guards</b> of honour carry sabres. In winter, overcoat, scarf, and gloves were worn.|$|R
50|$|Likewise {{the belief}} spread {{that some people}} could change their gender {{depending}} on the lunar phase. The term half-moon (hangetsu) was coined to describe such beings. It is assumed that traditional clothing, which {{made it more difficult}} to distinguish men from women like in other cultures, might have had an influence on this development. To restrict women from accessing prohibited areas and to avoid smuggling by hiding items in the <b>belt</b> bag, <b>guard</b> posts were assigned to perform body checks. In historical records, {{it can be seen that}} guards liked to joke about this matter quite frequently, resulting in various stories and even poems. Whether anatomical anomalies, like clitoromegaly or unusual physical development, led to these assumptions remains an open question.|$|R
50|$|The Corps of Drums. Inherited {{from the}} {{infantry}} battalion and {{still wearing the}} grenade beret badge, Foot <b>Guards</b> <b>belt,</b> beret badge backing and tactical recognition flash. As with an infantry battalion corps of drums, the drummers are 'soldiers first' and regularly deploy soldiers on operations as well as fulfilling their ceremonial role. The Corps of Drums form part of HQ Squadron and are a separate entity from the Band who are primarily musicians. They provide personnel for the Parachute Gun Troop whilst still maintaining their ceremonial drumming role.|$|R
50|$|The Danish Army, Home Guard, and Air Force all use stable belts. The Danish Defense's close {{cooperation}} with the British Army of the Rhine in the 1950s created the interest in a similar <b>belt,</b> for the <b>Guard</b> Hussar Regiment, which was introduced in 1968. In the late 70s, {{it was decided to}} allow Stable belts for all regiments in Denmark. The design of the belt would be based on the colours of the regiment, and a colour to signify their role. To show the transition between role and regiment colours, a thin line was introduced, there is however no system with these.|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: {{supported}} {{mine workings}} in bearing pressure zone. Purpose of the work: development of advanced technical {{concepts of the}} improvement of the development working support technology. Revealed are laws of distribution of the bearing reactions along the working beind supported depending on the ratio between the zone and face lengths. Created are a hydraulically-operated support section in the bearing pressure zone and the technology of formation of a <b>guard</b> <b>belt</b> in the settled pressure zone. The guard method and the supports are put into practice at some mines of Pechora coal basin. Field of application: roofs having thick strata of strong rocks, support of workings and their repeated useAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
60|$|When the {{substantial}} part of supper was disposed of, tea and pipes were introduced, and conversation began to flow. Then the three saddles were placed in a row; each hunter wrapped himself in his blanket, and, pillowing his head on his saddle, stretched his feet towards the fire and went to sleep, with his loaded rifle by his side and his hunting-knife handy in his <b>belt.</b> Crusoe mounted <b>guard</b> by stretching himself out couchant at Dick Varley's side. The faithful dog slept lightly and never moved all night, but had any one observed him closely he would have seen that every fitful flame that burst from the sinking fire, every unusual puff of wind, and every motion of the horses that fed or rested hard by, {{had the effect of}} revealing a speck of glittering white in Crusoe's watchful eye.|$|R
50|$|On {{ceremonial}} occasions the Life Guards wear {{a scarlet}} tunic, a metal cuirass and a matching helmet {{with a white}} plume worn bound on the top into an 'onion' shape; the exceptions to this are the regiment's trumpeters, who wear a red plume, and farriers, who wear blue tunics and have a black plume. In addition, the Life Guards wear their chin strap below their lower lip, {{as opposed to the}} Blues and Royals who wear it under their chin. On service dress the Life Guards Officers and Warrant Officer Class Ones wear a red lanyard on the right shoulder, as well as a Sam Browne <b>belt.</b> The Life <b>Guards,</b> as part of the Household Division, does not use the Order of the Bath Star for its officer rank 'pips', but rather the Order of the Garter Star.|$|R
5000|$|The Kingston Trio {{had emerged}} from the {{relatively}} crowded San Francisco folk music culture in 1957, using a mixture of calypso, pop, and folk styles, along with several forms of comedy, in their act. Relying on new pop-oriented arrangements of folk music classics {{as well as some}} original compositions, the Trio earned their first gold record with [...] "Tom Dooley" [...] and thereby launched a major revival in folk music that would lead to and influence the careers of Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul, & Mary, and John Denver, among others. The group had become one of the best-known and best-selling acts on the folk music scene and were enjoying a lucrative recording and touring contract with Capitol Records, having ten albums under their collective <b>belts,</b> when Dave <b>Guard</b> departed the group in 1961 to explore other musical directions. Stewart was selected by the remaining members Nick Reynolds and Bob Shane as Guard's successor, bringing with him his respected skills as a musician, composer, and performer.|$|R
60|$|He lowered {{a tender}} gaze on his banjo and I went on {{looking through the}} porthole. The round opening framed in its brass rim a {{fragment}} of the quays, with a row of casks ranged on the frozen ground and the tailend of a great cart. A red-nosed carter in a blouse and a woollen nightcap leaned against the wheel. An idle, strolling custom-house <b>guard,</b> <b>belted</b> over his blue capote, had the air of being depressed by exposure to {{the weather and the}} monotony of official existence. The background of grimy houses found a place in the picture framed by my porthole, across a wide stretch of paved quay brown with frozen mud. The colouring was sombre, and the most conspicuous feature was a little cafe with curtained windows and a shabby front of white woodwork, corresponding with the squalor of these poorer quarters bordering the river. We had been shifted down there from another berth in the neighbourhood of the Opera House, where that same porthole gave me a view of quite another sort of cafe--the best in the town, I believe, and the very one where the worthy Bovary and his wife, the romantic daughter of old Pere Renault, had some refreshment after the memorable performance of an opera which was the tragic story of Lucia di Lammermoor in a setting of light music.|$|R
