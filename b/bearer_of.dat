5|$|The <b>Bearer</b> <b>of</b> the Mace (Zhi jinwu 執金吾) {{was also}} known as the <b>Bearer</b> <b>of</b> the Gilded Mace. This official, whose title had been Commandant of the Capital (Zhongwei 中尉) before 104 BC, {{maintained}} law and order in the capital city—excluding the imperial palaces—in both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang. During Western Han, his salary-rank was Fully 2,000-dan, thus his prestige was {{similar to that of the}} Nine Ministers. However, during Eastern Han his salary-rank was reduced from Fully 2,000-dan to Equivalent to 2,000-dan.|$|E
5|$|While his {{subordinates}} were on constant patrol, the <b>Bearer</b> <b>of</b> the Mace personally inspected the city three times each month.

The <b>Bearer</b> <b>of</b> the Mace had a large staff of subordinates during Western Han, whose posts were abolished or transferred elsewhere during Eastern Han. This included the abolition of the Captains of the Standard Bearers, and the emperor's entourage became responsible for clearing the roadways when the emperor left the palace and hoisting colored standards to signal his return.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} obligations towards <b>bearers</b> <b>of</b> {{the right}} to asylum in circumstances of partial compliance. Who should bear the burdens when a state responsible for assisting <b>bearers</b> <b>of</b> {{the right to}} asylum fails {{to comply with the}} requirements of justice and unjustly defaults on its responsibilities? Are the complying states obligated to ‘take up the slack’ and assist the <b>bearers</b> <b>of</b> the right to asylum, or are they obligated to bear only their ‘fair share’ of burdens in the global protection of the right to asylum? The paper argues that the complying states with the capacity to assist can have an obligation of justice to assist <b>bearers</b> <b>of</b> the right to asylum when other states unjustly default on their responsibilities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the {{challenges faced by}} the new office <b>bearers</b> <b>of</b> university student organizations. A qualitative research approach was adopted, where {{the data was collected}} using semi-structured interviews with participants representing several student organizations. A formal structured knowledge transfer mechanism to equip the new office <b>bearers</b> <b>of</b> the student organizations was observed to be lacking. This paper presents a knowledge transfer framework that can be adopted by the relevant entities in preparing the newly elected office <b>bearers</b> <b>of</b> student organizations in executing their roles and responsibilities...|$|R

Rivkin announced her retirement from gymnastics in a press conference following the Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado {{is capable}} of {{delivering}} air-launched nuclear weapons. In 1979, Britain considered replacing its Polaris submarines with either the Trident submarines or alternatively the Tornado as the main <b>bearer</b> <b>of</b> its nuclear deterrent. Although the UK proceeded with Trident, several Tornado squadrons based in Germany were assigned to SACEUR to deter a major Soviet offensive with both conventional and nuclear weapons, namely the WE.177 nuclear bomb, which was retired in 1998. German and Italian Tornados are capable of delivering US B61 nuclear bombs, which are made available through NATO.|$|E

5|$|By the early-20th century, Dhaka {{projected}} {{itself as}} the standard <b>bearer</b> <b>of</b> Muslim minorities in British India; {{as opposed to the}} heavily Hindu-dominated city of Calcutta. During the abortive Partition of Bengal in 1905, Dhaka became the short lived capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1906, the All India Muslim League was formed at the Ahsan Manzil, during a conference on liberal education hosted by Nawab Sir Khawja Salimullah. Bengal was reunited in 1911. The University of Dacca was established in 1921. DEVCO, a subsidiary of the Occtavian Steel Company, began widescale power distribution in 1930.|$|E

5|$|Poland brought mercenaries from Moravia and Bohemia. The Czechs {{produced}} two full banners, {{under the command}} of Jan Sokol of Lamberk. Serving among the Czechs was possibly Jan Žižka, future commander of the Hussite forces. Alexander the Good, ruler of Moldavia, commanded an expeditionary corps. Vytautas gathered troops from Lithuanian, Ruthenian (modern Belarus and Ukraine) and Russian lands. The three Russian banners from Smolensk were {{under the command of}} Władysław II Jagiełło's brother Lengvenis, while the contingent of Tatars of the Golden Horde was under the command of the future Khan Jalal ad-Din. The overall commander of the joint Polish–Lithuanian force was King Władysław II Jagiełło; however, he did not directly participate in the battle. The Lithuanian units were commanded directly by Grand Duke Vytautas, who was second in command, and helped design the grand strategy of the campaign. Vytautas actively participated in the battle, managing both Lithuanian and Polish units. Jan Długosz stated that the low-ranking sword <b>bearer</b> <b>of</b> the Crown, Zyndram of Maszkowice, commanded the Polish army, but that is highly doubtful. More likely, marshal of the Crown Zbigniew of Brzezie commanded the Polish troops in the field.|$|E

Arthur destroys the weapon by throwing the pocket into it, simultaneously destroying the Skinless Boy. As Arthur escapes from the Piper with Sir Thursday, he distracts Thursday enough for the fourth part of the Will, a snake embodying the virtue of justice, to break free, whereupon it makes Arthur the <b>Bearer</b> <b>of</b> the Fourth Key – a sword or baton depending {{on whether or not}} the wielder is in combat – and Commander of the Glorious Army of the Architect. With help from Dame Primus and others from the lower demesnes, Arthur defeats the New Nithling army.|$|E
5|$|Uttar Pradesh has a humid {{subtropical}} climate and experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February {{is followed by}} summer between March and May and the monsoon season between June and September. Summers are extreme with temperatures fluctuating anywhere between 0°C and 50°C {{in parts of the}} state. The Gangetic plain varies from semiarid to sub-humid. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 650mm in the southwest corner of the state to 1000mm in the eastern and southeastern parts of the state. Primarily a summer phenomenon, the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian monsoon is the major <b>bearer</b> <b>of</b> rain in most parts of state. It is the south-west monsoon which brings most of the rain here, although rain due to the western disturbances and north-east monsoon also contribute small quantities towards the overall precipitation of the state.|$|E
