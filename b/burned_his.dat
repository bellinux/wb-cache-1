5|$|Some {{converts}} were sincerely devout {{in their}} Christian faith. Cisneros {{said that some}} converts chose to die as martyrs when demanded to recant by the Muslim rebels in Granada. A convert named Pedro de Mercado {{from the village of}} Ronda refused to join the rebellion in Granada; in response, the rebels <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> house and kidnapped members of his family, including his wife and a daughter. The crown later paid him compensation for his losses.|$|E
5|$|Abbas died {{in autumn}} 861, after another raid into Byzantine territory, and was buried at Caltagirone; the Byzantines later exhumed and <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> corpse. As his replacement, the Sicilian Muslims chose his uncle Ahmad ibn Ya'qub. His tenure was short, as in February 862 he was deposed {{in favour of}} Abdallah, son of Abbas. Abdallah's general Rabah was able to capture a few Byzantine fortresses, despite {{suffering}} a defeat in battle at first. Abdallah's elevation, however, was not acknowledged by the Aghlabids, and he was replaced, after only five months in office, by Khafaja ibn Sufyan.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{permission to}} do so, the Coast Guard boarded the KD II. The stench of decaying flesh quickly led them to a large quantity of shark fins. They were in bundles on the deck, the shipping container and filling most of the 40-ton (36-tonne) hold, where the ammonia odor {{was so strong that}} the Coast Guardsman who found them had to breathe through his mouth since it <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> nose. Since no corresponding carcasses could be found, the task force told the boarding party that this indicated a likely violation of the SFPA, and to consider the ship a crime scene as the fins were contraband.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, another group of Hatanaka's rebels led by Captain Takeo Sasaki went to Prime Minister Suzuki's office, intent on killing him. When they found it empty, they machine-gunned the office and set the {{building}} on fire, then left for his home. Hisatsune Sakomizu had warned Suzuki, and he escaped minutes before the would-be assassins arrived. After setting fire to Suzuki's home, {{they went to the}} estate of Kiichirō Hiranuma to assassinate him. Hiranuma escaped through a side gate and the rebels <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> house as well. Suzuki spent the rest of August under police protection, spending each night in a different bed.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West. The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E

5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other {{at either end of}} a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out of the shot in order to protect himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely apocryphal story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent {{about a third of the}} way down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E
5|$|In {{the account}} given by Livy, Laevinus, hearing that Apollonia was under siege, sent 2000 men {{under the command}} of Quintus Naevius Crista, to the mouth of the river. Avoiding Philip's army, Crista was able to enter the city by night unobserved. The {{following}} night, catching Philip's forces by surprise, he attacked and routed their camp. Philip, escaping to his ships in the river, made his way over the mountains and back to Macedonia, having <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> fleet and left behind many thousands of his men that had died or been taken prisoner, along with all of his armies' possessions. Laevinus and his fleet wintered at Oricum.|$|E

The request was granted by Jones, the main {{beneficiary}} of his will, and Betty Mackereth; the latter shredded the unread diaries page by page, then had them <b>burned.</b> <b>His</b> will {{was found to be}} contradictory regarding his other private papers and unpublished work; legal advice left the issue to the discretion of his literary executors, who decided the material should not be destroyed. When she died on 15 February 2001, Jones, in turn, left one million pounds to St Paul's Cathedral, Hexham Abbey, and Durham Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, in 1919, {{the city}} {{was caught up in}} the Red Summer riots when {{thousands}} of whites marched from South Omaha to the courthouse to lynch a black worker, Willy Brown, a suspect in an alleged rape of a white woman. The mob burned the Douglas County Courthouse to get the prisoner, causing more than $1,000,000 damage. They hanged and shot Will Brown, then <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> body. Troops were called in from Fort Omaha to quell the riot, prevent more crowds gathering in South Omaha, and to protect the black community in North Omaha.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the film incited Nataraja Mudaliar to make a series of {{historical}} films such as Draupadi Vastrapaharanam (1918), Lava Kusa (1919), Shiva Leela (1919), Rukmini Satyabhama (1922) and Mahi Ravana (1923). In 1923, {{the death of his}} son in a fire which also <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> entire studio led Nataraja Mudaliar to retire from filmmaking. Nataraja Mudaliar is widely recognised as the father of Tamil cinema and his films helped in laying the foundation for the South Indian cinema industry. Nataraja Mudaliar's work inspired Raghupathi Surya Prakasa, whose father Raghupathi Venkaiah Naidu was later acknowledged as the father of Telugu cinema, and J. C. Daniel, who was later recognised as the father of Malayalam cinema.|$|E

5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{was married}} to Anne-Marie (born 14 February 1955), but they {{divorced}} sometime later. They have two sons, Nicolas (born 18 October 1981) and Sacha Prost (born 30 May 1990). Prost also has a daughter, Victoria. , Nicolas races in Formula E for e.dams Renault, a team partially run by his father. Prost lived in his hometown, Saint-Chamond, until he and his Renault team fell out in the early 1980s. In April 1983 the Prost family moved to Sainte-Croix, Switzerland, and shortly after to Yens, Switzerland. They moved to Switzerland after Renault workers went to Prost's house in France and <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> Mercedes-Benz and another one of his road cars. They lived there until November 1999, when they moved to Nyon in the same country. In December 2015, Prost became a grandfather {{with the birth of}} Nicolas Prost's son Kimi.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's {{leadership}} of the Liberals was not, initially, an unqualified success; his local campaigning skills did not readily transfer to set speeches on national or international issues, and some sections of the party became restless. His engagement to Caroline Allpass, announced in April 1968, reassured those in the party who had reservations about his private life; others were shocked by Thorpe's emphasis on the political motivation for the marriage—worth five points in the polls, he opined to Mike Steele, the party's press officer. For much of 1968 Thorpe was untroubled by Scott, who had acquired new friends and, according to Bessell, had <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> Thorpe letters. His reappearance in November 1968, again penniless and without prospect of work, was particularly unwelcome to Thorpe, as he fought to establish his leadership credentials. Bessell provided immediate relief by resuming the weekly cash retainer, {{but this was a}} short-term respite.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
5|$|The {{police are}} upset about Abbott’s death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them {{that only the}} thing that killed Abbott and the others is to blame. Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E
5|$|Michigan lost to Purdue on January 3, {{by making}} only 4 second half field goals after taking an 8-point half time lead. The team {{defeated}} Penn State on January 6 with Albrecht {{in the starting}} lineup in place of Chatman. On January 10, the team wore throwback uniforms honoring the 1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team that won the 1989 NCAA Tournament. Michigan was down 49–40 with less than nine minutes remaining, before coming back to defeat Minnesota by a margin of 62–57. Michigan lost to (Receiving votes/#25) Ohio State on January 13. On January 17 Michigan defeated Northwestern, but lost LeVert for the season after he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May. In the game, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made his first start (in place of an ailing Albrecht) and made the game winning three-point shot. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). Nonetheless, the team defeated Rutgers in its first game without LeVert and with Dawkins making his first start. With LeVert absent, Walton scored 10 of the team's 15 points as it rallied from a 42–37 deficit to assume a 52–44 lead with just 32.5 seconds left. On January 24, Michigan fell to (AP #6/Coaches #5) Wisconsin in overtime after Walton, who had a team-high 17 points, scored Michigan's final seven points, including a game-tying three point shot with 1.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The game had been the featured College GameDay game of the week. On January 27 with Walton and Mark Donnal sidelined Michigan defeated Nebraska, as Irvin recorded his first career double-double, leading the team with 14 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Eventually, Walton missed final 12 of the season due to a toe injury. Due to the backcourt injuries, Dakich <b>burned</b> <b>his</b> redshirt season. Michigan finished the first half of its conference schedule with a 6–3 record.|$|E
