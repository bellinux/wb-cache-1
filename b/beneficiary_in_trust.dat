40|$|This paper {{argues that}} state trust land {{management}} experience is potentially {{a source of}} valuable insights and examples for the U. S. Forest Service. The paper sketches historic and current trends in public resource administration to define what constitutes useful new ideas which might aid the agency in its present crisis. In spite of being this nation's oldest approach to public resource management, the state trust lands are an appropriate source of new ideas in an era in which, the paper suggests: (1) the courts are receding as {{a major source of}} executive accountability, (2) the legitimacy of federal agencies, particularly those whose authority is rooted in science, is declining, and (3) the institutional framework for public resource management is rapidly fragmenting and diversifying. The Forest Service could fruitfully explore (1) the trust standard of prudence, particularly requirements for trustee accountability and record keeping; (2) the role of the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> accountability and constituency building; (3) the state trust manager's adaptation of the trust notion of a portfolio and risk management; and (4) state trust land agency's different approaches to tying program funding to income without eliminating the legislature's role in appropriations. The trust mandate as embodied in western trust land management organizations also provides (5) examples of institutional flexibility that could be instructive to the agency in this new era of partnerships, and (6) a raft of experience doing the same thing the Forest Service does (e. g., leasing grazing and minerals) which ought to inform Forest Service consideration of alternative management tools. ...|$|E
50|$|A spendthrift {{provision}} {{creates an}} irrevocable trust preventing creditors from attaching {{the interest of}} the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>in</b> the <b>trust</b> before that interest (cash or property) is actually distributed to him or her. Most well drafted irrevocable trusts contain spendthrift provisions even though the beneficiaries are not known to be spendthrifts. This is because such a provision protects the <b>trust</b> and the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>in</b> the event a beneficiary is sued and a judgment creditor attempts to attach the <b>beneficiary's</b> interest <b>in</b> the <b>trust.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A <b>beneficiary</b> (also, <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> law, cestui que use) in the {{broadest}} sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. For example, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is the person who receives the payment of the amount of insurance after the death of the insured.|$|R
50|$|The asset-protection {{trust is}} a trust that splits the {{beneficial}} enjoyment of trust assets from their legal ownership. The beneficiaries of a trust are the beneficial owners of equitable interests <b>in</b> the <b>trust</b> assets, {{but they do}} not hold legal title to the assets. Thus this kind of trust fulfills the goal of asset protection planning, i.e. to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or tax evasion. A creditor’s ability to satisfy a judgment against a <b>beneficiary’s</b> interest <b>in</b> a <b>trust</b> is limited to the <b>beneficiary’s</b> interest <b>in</b> such <b>trust.</b> Consequently, the common goal of asset protection trusts is to limit the interests of <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>in</b> such a way so as to preclude creditors from collecting against trust assets.|$|R
5000|$|... (1841) 4 Beav 115 is {{a leading}} English trusts law case. It laid down the rule of equity which {{provides}} that, {{if all of the}} <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>in</b> the <b>trust</b> are of adult age and under no disability, the beneficiaries may require the trustee to transfer the legal estate to them and thereby terminate the trust. The rule has been repeatedly affirmed in common law jurisdictions, and is commonly referred to as [...] "the rule in Saunders v Vautier" [...] for shorthand.|$|R
5000|$|Wasserstein had a sixth child, Sky Wendy Esme Wasserstein, with Erin McCarthy after {{separating}} from Becker; {{they did}} not marry. McCarthy, a Columbia MBA graduate, was formerly a Director of Development at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and is a 17-year veteran {{in the field of}} non-profit fundraising. Sky was born at a New York hospital in 2008. Wasserstein gave Sky her middle name, Wendy, in memory of his sister who had died in 2006. He also named Sky an equal <b>beneficiary</b> <b>in</b> <b>trusts</b> he had established for all his children that held his legacy assets, including several real estate properties and businesses, such as New York Magazine. Wasserstein and McCarthy shared joint custody of their daughter. [...] Upon Wasserstein's death, trustees for the various family trusts reportedly barred only Sky from benefiting from the jointly owned trust assets while allowing her five half-siblings and co-beneficiaries exclusive and unrestricted access to all <b>trust</b> properties, and <b>in</b> 2011, they filed an accounting in a New York Surrogate Court.|$|R
40|$|The highest {{priority}} over taxation on personal trusts {{is to establish}} a distinction between revocable trusts and irrevocable trusts. A beneficiary at the time of creating a trust, however, is not necessarily the <b>beneficiary</b> even <b>in</b> the future. In this regard, it is possible to make good use of personal <b>trusts</b> <b>in</b> Japan, and prevent tax evasion. It seems appropriate that the tax on a trust estate at the time of creating the trust should be borne by the trust or entity by itself, otherwise on the settler by himself. <b>In</b> addition, the <b>beneficiaries</b> should be taxed because they actually obtain the benefit. Most of the relationships between the settler and <b>beneficiary</b> <b>in</b> a personal <b>trust</b> agreement are family relationships. What is more, most taxation on trust beneficiaries and on trusts without beneficiaries is supposed to be regarded as personal trusts settled for personal property management. Thus we should not include taxation on trusts without beneficiaries among taxation on corporation trusts, and unify it among taxation of the beneficiaries of trusts. That is to say, there should be a division between taxation on trusts with beneficiaries and taxation on trusts without beneficiaries...|$|R
5000|$|Another theory {{asserts that}} it is {{feasible}} to typify letter of credit as a collateral contract for a third-party beneficiary because three different entities participate in the transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application {{of the theory of}} Jean Domat the cause of a LC is to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller. Therefore, a LC theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract under the framework for third party beneficiary where the buyer participates as the third party beneficiary with the bank acting as the stipulator and the seller as the promisor. The term [...] "beneficiary" [...] is not used properly in the scheme of an LC because a <b>beneficiary</b> (also, <b>in</b> <b>trust</b> law, cestui que use) in the broadest sense is a natural person or other legal entity who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. Note that under the scheme of letters of credit, banks are neither benefactors of sellers nor benefactors of buyers and the seller receives no money in gratuity mode. Thus is possible that a “letter of credit” was one of those contracts that needed to be masked to disguise the “consideration or privity requirement”. As a result, this kind of arrangement, would make letter of credit to be enforceable under the action assumpsit because of its promissory connotation.|$|R
40|$|Tax haven jurisdictions {{have over}} the years been used and abused by {{individuals}} and companies to further their own interests or beneficial owner?s interests (e. g. Shareholders and <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>in</b> a <b>trust)</b> through investments made in these jurisdictions. These jurisdictions are largely used as a channel for tax evasion and to conceal criminal activities such as money laundering. Due to the growth in international trade and globalisation, it has become important to ensure that individuals and corporations are prevented from participating in harmful tax practices {{in an attempt to}} evade tax. To minimise investments in tax haven jurisdiction which are solely done to evade tax, the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (?OECD?) set out some recommendations which are applicable on an international spectrum to combat this form of tax evasion. This dissertation addresses whether South Africa is complying with the recommendations of the OECD against investments in tax haven jurisdictions for purposes of evading tax. The importance {{of this study is to}} analyse South Africa?s compliance with the recommendations and to ensure that the standards currently in place to combat tax evasion are sufficient and to lay down recommendations that assist in ensuring transparency. By complying with international standards more particularly Bank transparency through Multinational agreements that enable signatory country to disclose information requested for tax matters. Should the recommendations by the OECD be fully implemented, it will enable South Africa to tax residents on their world-wide income, thereby ensuring that there are sufficient funds to cater for the poor and middle class people and enable economic growth within the country. In order to analyse South Africa?s compliance with the recommendations, the dissertation evaluate some of the anti-tax avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act which are consistent with the recommendations of the OECD as well as some treaties entered into by South Africa.

50|$|Conceptually many {{commentators}} {{have difficulty with}} the idea of a protector, as this undermines the role which in law has historically been fulfilled by the trustees.

Fiat stated plans for the Chrysler brand and Lancia to codevelop products, with some vehicles being shared. Olivier Francois, Lancia's CEO, took over as CEO of the Chrysler division in October 2009. Fiat has stated that, depending on the market, some Chrysler cars will be sold as Lancias and vice versa. Francois plans to reestablish the Chrysler brand as an upscale brand, a position somewhat muddied since the K-car era in the 80's, and especially after the Plymouth brand was discontinued. At the 2010 Detroit Auto Show, A Chrysler badged Lancia Delta was on display, likely the first Lancia to be sold as a Chrysler and possibly as a replacement for the Chrysler PT Cruiser.
