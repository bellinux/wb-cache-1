25|$|The {{width of}} the wreath was 5mm at the widest point and tapered to the apex where two oak leaves meet tip-to-tip. The height of the badge from base to tip was 26mm. The {{swastika}} was superimposed upon the separately-made wreath and was soldered onto the wreath assembly. The reverse side had four pins for attachment to allow securing to a strip of Iron Cross Second Class ribbon. This ribbon was then looped through the second <b>button</b> <b>hole</b> on the tunic of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|Through {{most of the}} Victorian era until {{towards the}} end, the lapels were cut {{separately}} and sewn on later, apparently because it made the lapel roll more elegantly. The revers {{from the inside of}} the coat wrapped over to the front, creating a small triangle of silk, while the outer half was cut from two strips of the body fabric. This was a feature of double-breasted frock coats used on all such coats, but morning and dress coats, which had previously followed this practice, began to be made with attached lapels (wholecut) around the end of the Edwardian era. Through the Victorian era, a row of decorative button holes was created down the lapel edge, but by Edwardian period these were reduced down to just the one lapel boutonnière <b>button</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
25|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} and Henry was {{rejected}} {{as a volunteer}} {{on account of his}} slightly cripped right hand, he turned his attention to making a <b>button</b> <b>hole</b> machine. He and his brother James entered into partnership with Mr. Seaman and in 1862 they perfected an automatic buttonhole sewing machine. It was then tested in a clothing shop in New York on army overcoats and capes, where its average was from 1,000 to 1,200 buttonholes per day. This caused hard feelings among the hand buttonhole workers, and one day during the noon hour they smashed the machine. However, the next morning another machine was working in its place. All together there were over one hundred thousand button holes made there. The patents were taken over by the Wheeler and Wilson Manufacturing Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut. While House was in Washington D.C. looking after the patent application, he met Abraham Lincoln, for whom he cast his first vote.|$|E

60|$|She drew {{a little}} nearer--they were all too much {{overcome}} by the shock of this thing to prevent her--and stood with glazed eyes looking down upon him. Everything, even the minutest article of his dress, seemed to appeal to her with a strange vividness. She found herself even studying the large check of his shooting-coat and the stockings which she had once laughingly admired, and which he had ever since worn. Her eyes rested upon the sprig of heliotrope which, with her own fingers, she had arranged in his <b>button</b> <b>hole,</b> as they had strolled down the garden together just before the start; and the faint perfume which reached her where she stood, helped her {{to realize that she}} was in the thrall of no nightmare, but that this thing had really happened. She had never loved him, she had never even pretended to love him, and it was less any sense of personal loss than the hideous sin of it which swept in upon her as she stood there looking down upon him. She recognized, as she could never have done had he been personally dear to her, the ethical horror of the thing. The faintness which had almost numbed her senses passed away. In that swift battle of many sensations it was anger which survived.|$|E

50|$|In knitting, binding off, or casting off, is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} for ending a column (a wale) of stitches. Binding off is typically used to define the final (usually upper, taking the cast on edge as the lower) edge of a knitted fabric, although {{it may also be}} used in other contexts, e.g., in making <b>button</b> <b>holes.</b> In principle, binding off is the opposite of casting on, but the techniques are generally not mirror images of one another. Sometimes, however, they can produce a mirror image appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} binding off {{method is}} to pass each knitted loop over the loop next to it.

This method also does not require that the knitting yarn be nearby, so it can be done at any time or position, e.g., to form <b>button</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
