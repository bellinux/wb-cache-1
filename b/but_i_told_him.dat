500|$|Despite his mixed {{feelings}} on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression {{of his time}} in Edinburgh is upbeat: [...] "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great. We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2–1 (John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> it was worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park (stopping them from winning the SPL that day)." [...] He received what he described as a [...] "wonderful reception" [...] from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club.|$|E
2500|$|Mitchel {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of Thomas Carlyle during his connection with The Nation. Carlyle described a dinner at Mitchel's house in 1846, saying that Mitchel was [...] "a fine elastic-spirited young fellow, whom I grieved to see rushing to destruction palpable by attack of windmills, but upon whom all my persuasions were thrown away". Carlyle later said, when Mitchel was on trial, [...] "Irish Mitchel, poor fellow… I {{told him he}} would most likely be hanged, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> too, that they could not hang the immortal part of him." ...|$|E
60|$|A mess-mate of {{the other}} watch now came to relieve me; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I chose to remain where I was till {{daylight}} came.|$|E
60|$|I gave 'im the tanner. It {{was no use}} {{standing}} there arguing over a tanner, with a purse of twelve quid waiting {{for me in the}} dock, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> wot people thought of 'im.|$|R
6000|$|... "He’s {{old enough}} to be married," [...] said Mrs. Wheeler. [...] "He’s told me all about you, he never has no secrets from ’is mother. He told me that he asked you to walk out with ’im last night and you said ’No’; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>’im</b> that that was only a gell’s way, and that you’d give ’im another answer soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say <b>I</b> have; <b>but</b> then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so {{many other}} things more to the point, that he cannot do less than believe this, when he hears it. Signor Viti promised to meet me here, after he has had a {{conversation}} with the vice-governatore; and we may now expect him every minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Abdullah {{would have}} {{assisted}} {{to carry the}} bed in, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that it might hurt his arm, and I and the woman could do it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are here," [...] he whispered. [...] "Mr. Shepley {{wanted to send}} the goods ashore, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that, if he did so, I would call you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} scourge such a form. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he must ask my pardon. As {{yet he has}} not. At my command, every two hours he stands before me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Old Miller, {{who really}} {{began to take}} some pride in me, was confounded when he {{understood}} that I {{did not intend to}} go to Bob Mosely's; <b>but</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> my misfortune, and that I had no dress: 'By the powers,' cried he, 'but you shall go, and you shall be the best dressed and the best mounted lad there!' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{drew out}} my purse; a meagre thing it was. [...] "Five shillings, sir." [...] He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over {{it as if}} its scantiness amused him. Soon he {{produced}} his pocket-book: [...] "Here," [...] said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me <b>but</b> fifteen. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> had no change.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's very true,' said Quilp, 'that your {{grandfather}} urged repeated forgiveness, ingratitude, riot, and extravagance, and all that; <b>but</b> as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> [...] "these are common faults." [...] "But he's a scoundrel," [...] said he. [...] "Granting that," [...] said I (for {{the sake of}} argument of course), [...] "a great many young noblemen and gentlemen are scoundrels too!" [...] But he wouldn't be convinced.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, some time," [...] said Eppie, [...] "I don't know when. Everybody's married some time, Aaron says. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that wasn't true: for, I said, look at father--he's {{never been}} married." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the morning-room," [...] she answered. [...] "He {{wanted to}} go into the library, and he wanted to see Smedley, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to wait where he was till I got down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He went {{in right}} after he heard that you had entered. He says {{he is going to}} beat you out of your boots. He wanted to bet with me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I didn't bet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, my dear; the Major {{asked me}} to come in, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> declined. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> frankly that <b>I</b> did not like Forster, and that the less I saw of him the better I should be pleased." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean your}} real {{mother died when}} you was a tiny little babe. You see, I was your father's second wife; in fact, you weren't a year old when we married. Ed made me promise never to let you know. We were to bring you up {{just the same as}} if you was a child to both of us. Nobody knows <b>but</b> Reddy. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> the day we started up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sire,' said Pharez, re-entering, 'a Tatar {{has arrived}} from the frontiers of the province, who will see none <b>but</b> thyself. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> your Highness was deeply busied, and as methinks he brings but the same news, I----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--well; I don't {{know whether}} I said exactly that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that the whole}} thing must come to an end. And it must. Luckily it seems that nothing has been said on either side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't often let {{business}} pass us; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{to go to}} perdition, if {{he could}} find his way swimming." [...] Gilby chuckled. [...] "I also told him several things that needn't be repeated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I {{came out}} alone. Lester {{wanted to come}} along, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{to stay at the}} ranch and do some work. He seems to think that all he's out here for is to play." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kostelka {{said that}} a federal {{constitutional}} ban on marriage between {{members of the same}} sex is required, but he also favored addressing the matter in the state constitution. The purpose of marriage is to continue the human species, he noted. Kostelka also noted that he [...] "had a son who died of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. I loved my son, and I cherish his memory, <b>but,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> could never accept his life-style." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sire! a Tatar {{has arrived}} from Hamadan, who will see none <b>but</b> thyself. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> your Highness was engaged, {{and sent him}} to the Lord Honain; but all denial is lost upon him. And as I thought perhaps the Lady Miriam----' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bruce was a lawyer, {{and a very}} respectable man, in whom Mr. Audley felt confidence. He rose at the clergyman's entrance, {{and asked}} {{to speak to him}} in another room, so he was taken into the little back dining-room, and began--'This is a very {{unpleasant}} business, Mr. Audley; this gentleman is very much annoyed, and persuaded that he has a right to carry off his nephew; <b>but</b> as <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> it all turns upon the father's expressions. Have you any written authority from him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well {{we had a}} right nice time together. I {{gave him}} part of my lunch, an' then {{he wanted me to}} come back with him; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I'd got to get to the {{telegraph}} office----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right. I just rang up to explain. The fact is, old man, I {{know you}} won't mind, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that you were}} the author of those books I've been reading to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was talking}} about you, Jamie. He said he thought you disliked him; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> I was certain you didn't. He's really such a good man, one can't help liking him. He said he'd like to teach you golf." ...|$|E
6000|$|I answered, Yes, {{they had}} run away, as they wanted {{more room to}} live; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all about that when I saw him before. He said he knew <b>I</b> had, <b>but</b> he wished to hear [...] "whether the same words {{came out of the}} same mouth, or {{different}} words," [...] so that he might know if I were a true man or not. Then, after pausing a while, he looked at me in his piercing fashion and asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was right}} {{sorry to see}} Mr. West go, for he was a right good teacher, and as harmless, inoffensive a creetur as ever lived. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> always <b>told</b> <b>him</b> every time <b>I</b> laid eyes on {{him that he was}} in consumption, if ever a man was. YOU look real healthy--though you can't aways tell by looks, either. I had a brother complected like you, but he was killed in a {{railroad}} accident out west when he was real young.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a servant}} who looks after them. Of course I {{shall have to}} see to Mr. Matterson's own things, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> cannot slave for them all. The three eldest have to be sent somewhere; that has been agreed upon. He has got an {{unmarried}} sister who can quite afford {{to do as much}} as that." [...] Then she explained her reasons for the marriage. [...] "Papa is getting quite unbearable, and Sophy spoils him in everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Teddy Bowser!" [...] Bill Dean exclaimed as {{he leaped}} to his feet. [...] "He {{wanted to come}} up here to-night, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> he mustn't, 'cause if the fellers hung 'round I'd lose my show for a tony lodgin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Lily, I have not. Indeed, I have not. I did {{not know}} how to speak, because I was surprised;--and he, of course, could say what he liked. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> as well as I could, that I would not marry him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fer the present. When I {{came away}} I left the claim in charge o' a miner named Allison--Tim Allison. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{not to do}} any diggin'--just keep his eyes on things. When there is any diggin' to be done I {{want to be on}} hand." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{went back}} to the wall, a white flag in my hand, and {{presently}} an envoy advanced from the Spanish camp to speak with me--not de Garcia, <b>but</b> another. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> in few words that those who remained alive {{of the people of the}} Otomie would die beneath the ruins of their city like the children of Tenoctitlan before them, but that while they had a spear to throw and an arm to throw it, they would never yield to the tender mercies of the Spaniard.|$|R
60|$|When I {{informed}} him that the strangers with us were the Dusantes, on whose island we had been staying, he at first listened vaguely. He had always looked upon the Dusante family {{as a sort of}} fable used by Mrs. Lecks to countenance her exactions of money from the unfortunate sojourners on the island. <b>But</b> when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what Mr. Dusante had done, and related how he had brought the board money with him, and had offered to pay it back to us, an eager interest was aroused in him.|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 1: Mr. Coleridge was {{a decided}} Wolfian in the Homeric question; {{but he had}} never read a word of the famous Prolegomena, and knew nothing of Wolf's reasoning, <b>but</b> what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of it in conversation. Mr. C. {{informed}} me, that he adopted the conclusion contained in the text upon the first perusal of Vico's Scienza Nuova; [...] "not," [...] he said, [...] "that Vico has reasoned it out with such learning and accuracy as you report of Wolf, but Vico struck out all the leading hints, and I soon filled up the rest out of my own head."-- ED.] ...|$|R
