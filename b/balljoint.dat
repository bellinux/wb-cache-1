50|$|Long spindle SLAs tend to {{have better}} kingpin geometry, but the {{proximity}} of the spindle to the tyre restricts fitting oversized tyres, or snowchains. The location of the upper <b>balljoint</b> may have styling implications {{in the design of the}} sheetmetal above it.|$|E
50|$|Rydquist capped off 2016 {{with another}} {{drive in the}} 25 Hours of Thunderhill, with the same team and car he had races in the NASA {{endurance}} season. Racing with former top 3 finishers Mike Holland, Beau Borders and Troy Lindstrom, Rydquist and the team's main competitors were Flying Lizards Porsche 997 GT3 RSR and Audi R8 GT3 LMS, {{as well as a}} Lamborghini Super Trofeo campaigned by CLP Motorsports. Halfway into the race Rydquist and his teammates were running 3rd in the ES (GT) class, however their chances to take a podium finish were eliminated when the front-splitter failed. Later in the race a rear <b>balljoint</b> failure dropped the team out of contention of even a top 10 finish.|$|E
50|$|The {{basis of}} the A310 was a hefty tubular steel {{backbone}} chassis, clothed in a fiberglass shell. As for the previous A110 the entire body was molded in a single piece. Like the ill-fated De Lorean DMC-12, which used the same PRV powertrain, the engine was mounted longitudinally in the rear, driving forward to the wheels through a manual five-speed gearbox. The driving position was low and sporty, although the front wheelwells encroached on the occupants' feet, pointing them towards {{the centre of the}} car. The A310 was labor-intensive, having been developed for small-scale artisanal production - a car took 130 hours to build from start to finish. The front axle also came in for some criticism, although in 1974 the <b>balljoint</b> mountings were replaced by rubber/steel bushings (silent-blocs) which somewhat improved the longevity. While many bits of the A310 came from the Renault parts shelf as expected, others are more surprising - the steering rack is from the Peugeot 504, while the turn signals are Simca 1301 units.|$|E
50|$|The E39 M5 {{suspension}} shared {{its basic}} aluminium-intensive MacPherson strut/multi-link {{design of the}} V8 engined E39 5 series. However, several changes were made by BMW M. Reduced spring height, 23 mm lower. A specific shock valving, thicker front and rear anti-roll bars, polyurethane auxiliary springs, and steel <b>balljoints.</b>|$|R
