50|$|The {{sawmilling}} area, {{which includes}} timber storage/loading and log working sections, is {{level with the}} driveway {{on the west side}} and has an elevated platform to the east. It is sheltered by a metal trussed skillion roof and houses a log carriage and <b>breakdown</b> <b>saw</b> sheltered by a low narrow barrel roof to the upper level. The log carriage and saw are operational and the carriage has rails and a trolley. A small timber shed houses the recently introduced four-sider machine.|$|E
50|$|The sawmill is {{a highly}} intact example of a small sawmill {{originally}} established to produce timber for packaging cases. The layout {{and all of the}} components typically found in a small mill of the 1950s remain including: the characteristic open-sided shed, early electrical insulators tracing the route of the original cabling, <b>breakdown</b> (Canadian) <b>saw,</b> number one and two saw benches, docking saw, original hand operated winch, rails and trolleys. The milling operation continues to follow the traditional packing case sequence of initial cut at the <b>breakdown</b> (Canadian) <b>saw,</b> sizing at the number one and two benches and cut to lengths at the docker.|$|R
50|$|The Red Hill {{line was}} closed in 1953. The Mornington line {{remained}} until 1981, but the line south of Moorooduc is now {{operated by the}} Mornington Railway as a tourist railway. Passenger services on the entire line were withdrawn on 10 June 1981, and the line from Long Island Junction to Stony Point closed from 22 June 1981, until 26 September 1984 when passenger services were reintroduced. For the reopening DRC railcars DRC40 and DRC 41 used, with two MTH carriages in between them making up a 4 car train.

40|$|Automated {{three-dimensional}} log scanning and {{positioning systems}} in a sawmill {{have a limited}} time available to reach an optimal positioning solution before primary <b>breakdown</b> <b>sawing</b> starts. In this study a search algorithm (tentacle algorithm) was developed for this task and was empirically evaluated {{in terms of its}} ability to find an optimal or close-to-optimal positioning solution in a limited number of iterations. This algorithm was compared to the population-based incremental learning algorithm, the simulated annealing algorithm, and the particle swarm optimisation algorithm. The tentacle algorithm performed the best of all the algorithms evaluated in terms of the mean volume recovery obtained. However, exhaustive searches around the centred and 'horns-up' and 'horns-down' positions using smaller ranges resulted in better mean volume recovery results than any of the algorithms, although the mean results using this strategy did not differ significantly from that of the tentacle algorithm. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

50|$|The {{substantially}} intact Elgin Vale sawmill is {{an exceptional}} {{example of a}} steam driven softwood sawmill, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. Located adjacent to a creek for water and {{in close proximity to}} well timbered areas, the mill is positioned below sloping ground to assist the movement of logs. Internally, the layout and the sequence designed to maximise the efficient movement and cutting of logs within the sawmill remain: the long open-sided tin and timber shed, log ramp, <b>breakdown</b> <b>saw,</b> number one and two saw, frame saw, docking benches, waste chute, rails and trolleys. Below the main floor are the boiler, engine and attached drive equipment that provide the power for the operations on the main floor.|$|E
50|$|When {{initially}} erected, the Kin Kin mill comprised {{only the}} number one saw bench and a docking saw. Both of these saws are still extant, but the docking saw has been relocated within the shed. The saws were powered by a tractor. Probably from the early 1950s after the mill was connected to electricity, a Canadian Saw, and number two bench were added and the docking saw was moved. The mill layout has remained largely unchanged since then. In its present form it resembles a typical sawmill layout of the 1950s. The original hand operated winch for moving logs through the <b>breakdown</b> <b>saw</b> remains extant and also the early electrical insulators tracing the original path of the cabling along {{the underside of the}} roof.|$|E
5000|$|Sawmill shed Standing {{close to}} the road at the {{southeast}} corner of the site, the heart of the mill operations is an open timber framed shed with corrugated iron clad roofs. The main part is sheltered by a gable roof the north side of which extends west over the docker area and northeast with a small skillion roof over the number two bench. The shed is framed with sawn and unsawn timber, the roof supported by round posts. The compact milling operation is organised around the sequence of saws and the accompanying benches, motors, trolleys and rails accommodated within the shed. The saws stand in a line from the <b>breakdown</b> <b>saw</b> (Canadian saw) to the south to the number two bench saw to the north. Timber logs are stacked by forklift at the southwest, rolled onto a trolley where they are secured with a dog and run through the <b>breakdown</b> <b>saw</b> for the half cut. The cut logs then roll across to the number one bench saw where the bark is stripped and the half logs are cut into 2" [...] (50mm) or 2.5" [...] (62.5mm) width planks. The cut planks are stacked north of the number one bench and taken across to the number two bench saw where they are cut into thinner 1" [...] (25mm) boards which are stacked to the west and taken across to the docker where they are cut into shorter lengths (mostly 6 metres). From here the boards pass to the groover where the sides are grooved before being placed in the pallet stack west of the log stack. A number of trolleys on rails take the offcuts and waste from the various bench areas out to {{the west side of the}} shed.|$|E

40|$|Eucalypt timber is {{extremely}} versatile {{and is used}} for diverse purposes. Increases in the world's population and in standards of living cause a continuous increase in the demand for forest products from intensively managed, fast growing eucalypt plantations. To {{take full advantage of}} the potential of the eucalypts, it is necessary to understand material properties such as growth stresses in standing trees, logs and cants (and the possible reduction of these stresses), brittle heart, kino rings and knots. Material properties should be carefully considered when planning all processing activities from felling and log-making, to primary log <b>breakdown</b> or <b>sawing.</b> Production lines that can be considered, consist of frame-saw lines, double-arbor-multiple-circular sawlines, single to quad-band lines or even rotary veneer peeling for the production of laminated veneer lumber.

Les Carlyon wrote [...] "What was wrong with (Hunter-Weston) has never become clear. The explanations run from sunstroke and exhaustion to enteric fever and dysentery to a collapse and a <b>breakdown.</b> Hamilton ... <b>saw</b> him 'staggering' off to a hospital ship.” Hamilton recorded “He is suffering very much from his head”. Next day he recorded “Hunter-Weston has to go home” {{and a few days}} later he referred to “Hunter-Weston’s breakdown”. Hamilton later wrote to Aspinall of the Dardanelles Commission (July 1916) that Lady Hunter-Weston had been told that her husband was being “sent home”, normally a euphemism for sacking. Travers argues that his illness was used as an excuse to relieve him of command. He was knighted after being invalided home.|$|R
50|$|An {{elevated}} {{hardwood timber}} floor supported on round timber stumps provides {{a platform for}} the milling plant with the drive shafts, belts and pulleys accommodated below connecting to the steam driven flywheel. A line of large round logs perpendicular to the mill floor is along the southwest side of the shed forming a log ramp feeding logs to the <b>breakdown</b> <b>saw</b> bench. The milling plant comprises benches, rollers, saws and other milling plant (all retain pulleys and belts), winches, a gantry crane and tramways (timber and steel rails) with trolleys. A winch stands in the yard to the southwest of the log ramp The traverser rails and trolley run along the southeast side on a narrow timber platform lower than the main floor. A set of timber stairs descends to the northwest from the timber floored walkway along the northwest side. Two boilers, a steam engine and a large flywheel stand at ground level to the north corner with a corrugated iron water tank on a tall timber standing further to the north. A tall metal stack projects from the boiler. Two timber framed and clad shutes between the workshop and boiler room discharge to the waste/sawdust and boiler/furnace areas to the northeast.|$|E

40|$|Photographs {{taken in}} the early 1900 's of 100 ft long Blue Gum piles {{produced}} by the Gray Brothers mills of " Quiet Corner" Adventure Bay, Bruny Island. The logs were destined for contracts to supply hewn Piles, 18 x 18 and 20 x 20, and up to lOO feet in length, for the Admiralty Harbour Works being carried out by Messrs. S. Pearson and Son. Ltd., at Dover, England, and for {{a contract with the}} firm of Sir John Jackson, Ltd., for similar Harbour Works at Simon's Town, South Africa. The Hobart Mercury of Monday 8 th June 1903 reported that the Gray Brothers, at their mill at Adventure Bay, which is on the open sea side of Bruni Island, have, of late, had their names prominently before the public in connection with several big contracts they executed, notably, their supply of piles and other timber for the great harbour works at Dover, England. The brothers (Messrs. Henty G. and Fred. Gray), with Mr. Fred. Gray as mill manager, have been operating here for about 15 years, having about 500 acres of freehold land, and leased over 1, 500 acres of immense beds of timber lands from the Crown, the trees being principally stringy bark and blue gum. Their tram lines branch into a dense forest, in different directions, for about two miles, some of the trees being 8 ft. in diameter, 250 ft. to 300 ft. high, from which a clear run of timber, without a limb, to the extent of over 100 ft., is often secured. As to the mill, it has powerful machinery. There are two immense vertical frames worked, one of which carries <b>breakdown</b> <b>saw,</b> and the other a set of "flitching" saws Then come the usual circular "bench" ripping saws, and a steam cross-cut, attachable to the log skids, which facilitates the cutting of large quantities of timber to any uniform length desired. A new Tangye engine, of 30 -horse power, has just been put down, for driving the machinery, whilst in the forest they have a powerful steam bush hauler at work, to pull the felled logs up to the tram line. About 30 hands are employed (for whom workmen's cottages are provided), and about 50, 000 ft. super. of sawn timber is the quantity put out in a week; but frequently great hewn piles for harbour works are also handled by the firm and shipped. The selection of these is a great point, and in this the lengthy experience and judgment of Messrs Gray Brothers (who {{have spent a lot of}} money in equipment and obtaining the necessary gear), stand them in good stead. For instance, the piles they sent to Dover (England), they were informed, gave great satisfaction, being well selected. They have recently been engaged in supplying great hewn logs and sawn timber for Simons- town (South Africa) Admiralty works, and have already despatched one cargo by the Lady Palmerston (1, 300 tons), and are now loading the ship Emily Reed (1, 500 tons), to be followed by a third cargo about September next, for England. Most of the hewn piles to supply this order are obtained from Flinder's Bay, on the peninsula. Timber of various kinds is also supplied for the Tasmanian and inter-state building trade. The deep water jetty has recently been lengthened to 500 ft, where vessels can come alongside, drawing over 16 ft of water, the jetty being capable of holding a stack of 400, 000 ft of timber. The bay is sheltered from most winds, and is a historical spot, having been the first landing place in Tasmania of the great circumnavigator, Captain Cook, and only the other day some relics of that memorable landing here were found. There are 16 workmen's cottages on the property, and stabling for 16 horses. Telephonic communication with Hobart (where the firm has its chief business office, in the charge of Mr. W. G. Andrewartha), and other centres, has recently been installed. The firm have just finished supplying large hewn timber for Stanley breakwater. It was from here that the Broken Hill Mining Company got a lot of their timber, and that piles for the Prince's Wharf extension and the Alexandra pier, Hobart, were obtained.

40|$|Electricity bills {{could be}} an {{effective}} strategy for improving communications about consumers’ electricity use and promoting electricity savings. However, quantitative communications about electricity use {{may be difficult to}} understand, especially for consumers with low energy literacy. Here, we build on the health communication and graph comprehension literature to inform electricity bill design, with the goal of improving understanding, preferences for the presented communication, and intentions to save electricity. In a survey-based experiment, each participant saw a hypothetical electricity bill for a family with relatively high electricity use, covering information about (a) historical use, (b) comparisons to neighbors and (c) historical use with appliance <b>breakdown.</b> Participants <b>saw</b> all information types in one of three formats including (a) tables, (b) bar graphs, and (c) icon graphs. We report on three main findings. First, consumers understood each type of electricity use information the most when it was presented in a table, perhaps because tables facilitate simple point reading. Second, preferences and intentions to save electricity were the strongest for the historical use information, independent of format. Third, individuals with lower energy literacy understood all information less. We discuss implications for designing utility bills that are understandable, perceived as useful, and motivate consumers to save energy...|$|R
60|$|Next morning, {{when the}} thick white fog, {{which made the}} smoking river {{resemble}} Father Rhine in autumn, had been licked up by fiery rays, we embarked, together with Chief Apó, of Asánta, the honest old owner of the 'Ingotro concession.' Our conveyance was the Effuenta, a steam-launch attached to the mine of that name, bought second-hand, and a fine specimen of what launches ought not to be. Built by Messieurs Dickenson, of Birkenhead, she is much too small (36 feet by 8) for a river which, even in {{the depth of the}} dries, averages two fathoms, and rarely runs less than ten feet. The engines are over far from the boiler, and the long raking stern swells out into a big belly worthy of a manatee or a Dutch hoy. Her boiler had been replaced with the usual inconsequence. She had been repaired by an 'intelligent artisan,' Mr. Emery; but, as he was allowed no tools and no time, he contented himself with reporting her in good working order. Consequently after every half-hour we had to unscrew the safety-valve, let off steam, and fill the boiler with a funnel and a tin pot. Pleasant three hours under a thin board-awning, in a broiling sun, off a poisonous mangrove-swamp! Presently she had to be started by the surf-boat lashed to one side, and a large canoe to the other. Finally, after a last <b>breakdown,</b> we <b>saw</b> steam-launch Effuenta lying high and dry upon the beach at Sánmá.|$|R
40|$|A log <b>breakdown</b> model, <b>SAW</b> 3 D, was {{developed}} to optimize lumber recovery from logs of any shape in 3 -dimensional space. The program uses a polygonal cross section representation of logs; three nested dynamic programming (DP) algorithms to optimize log breakdown, flitch and cant edging, and trimming operations; and a simple heuristic search method {{to find the best}} position combinations. After receiving the log scanning data, the program mathematically rotates the log and skews it horizontally. Then the log is sawn into slabs, flitches or cants using the first level DP algorithm. For each piece cut from the log, the program orients it and then edges it into untrimmed lumber using the second level DP algorithm. After that, the program trims all untrimmed lumber to finished dimensions using the third level DP algorithm. This process is repeated until all possible cutting Signature redacted for privacy. patterns are searched and all positions/orientations are compared. Upon completion, the program outputs the optimum value of the log; optimum value of each flitch/cant; corresponding sawing, edging and trimming patterns; optimum position of the log; and optimum position of each flitch/cant. Mathematically generated logs with ellipsoid, horn-down, and 3 -D, S-twisted shapes were sawn using SAW 3 D to analyze how factors such as log, cant, and flitch orientations; sawing intervals; scanning data density; and log size and shape affect both the value and volume of lumber recovered...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} 25 years, {{controlled}} cortical impact (CCI) {{has been a}} useful tool in traumatic brain injury (TBI) research, creating injury patterns that include primary contusion, neuronal loss, and traumatic axonal damage. However, when CCI was first developed, very little was known on the underlying biomechanics of mild TBI. This paper uses information generated from recent computational models of mild TBI in humans to alter CCI and better reflect the biomechanical conditions of mild TBI. Using a finite element model of CCI in the mouse, we adjusted three primary features of CCI: {{the speed of the}} impact to achieve strain rates within the range associated with mild TBI, the shape and material of the impounder to minimize strain concentrations in the brain, and the impact depth to control the peak deformation that occurred in the cortex and hippocampus. For these modified cortical impact conditions, we observed peak strains and strain rates throughout the brain were significantly reduced and consistent with estimated strains and strain rates observed in human mild TBI. We <b>saw</b> <b>breakdown</b> of the blood-brain barrier but no primary hemorrhage. Moreover, neuronal degeneration, axonal injury, and both astrocytic and microglia reactivity were observed up to 8 days after injury. Significant deficits in rotarod performance appeared early after injury, but we observed no impairment in spatial object recognition or contextual fear conditioning response 5 days and 8 days after injury, respectively. Together, these data show that simulating the biomechanical conditions of mild TBI with a modified cortical impact technique produces regions of cellular reactivity and neuronal loss that coincide with only a transient behavioral impairment...|$|R
