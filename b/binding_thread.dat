40|$|Abstract—While modern CPUs {{offer an}} {{increasing}} number of cores with shared caches, prevailing execution engines for business processes, workflows, or Web service compositions have not been optimized for properly exploiting the abundant processing resources of such CPUs. One factor limiting performance is the inefficient thread scheduling by the operating system, which can result in suboptimal use of shared caches. In this paper we study performance of the JOpera business process execution engine on a recent multicore machine. By analyzing the engine’s architecture and by <b>binding</b> <b>threads</b> that are likely to access shared data to cores with a common cache, we achieve speedups up to 13 % for a variety of workloads, without modifying the engine’s architecture and implementation, apart from <b>binding</b> <b>threads</b> to CPUs. As the engine is implemented in Java, we provide a new Java library to manage <b>thread</b> <b>bindings</b> and hardware performance counters. We also leverage hardware performance counters to explain the observed speedup in our performance analysis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the distribution and genetic structure of platypus populations in Australia, and in particular to investigate the interactions of distribution and genetic structure. The research considered the entire distributional range of the platypus, but with a special focus on the scientifically neglected platypus populations of northern Queensland. Platypuses in north Queensland are smaller than their southern counterparts and have a more reddish colouration. There appears also to be a break in the distribution of the platypus between about Mackay and Townsville, which corresponds to the catchment of the Burdekin River and which geographically separates northern platypuses from southern populations. The relationship of northern and southern platypus populations of mainland Australia, together with the biogeographic significance to the platypus of the Burdekin break, was a <b>binding</b> <b>thread</b> throughout the study. However, before that relationship could be inferred there were several smaller gaps in the knowledge regarding the distribution of platypus that had to be filled. These gaps were represented by several intriguing questions: Where do platypuses occur and why is their distribution limited to those areas? And, how are local populations of platypuses structured and how do they relate to each other? With these key pieces of information it was possible to expand the scope of the study to a distribution-wide level. Using distribution modelling software (MaxEnt), climate data and 4, 315 occurrence records, I produced a climate-based distribution model to describe the current distribution of the platypus. The two most important climate factors determining environmental suitability for the platypus were precipitation during the driest quarter (which was positively associated with platypus occurrence) and maximum temperature (negatively associated), to the near exclusion of all other variables (53. 8...|$|E

They permanently confronted Croatian nationalists who aspired to make Cavtat a Croatian city. People from Cavtat closely cooperated with national societies from Dubrovnik. National Women’s Cooperative from Dubrovnik opened in 1920 a branch in Cavtat with “Pčelica” institution. Serbian Sisters’ Circle (Kolo srpskih sestara) opened a vocational school in Cavtat at its own expense. The school was governed by Women’s Charitable Organisation from Cavtat, and financed by the Circle. King Aleksandar and Queen Marija received an enthusiastic welcome when they visited Cavtat in 1925. Catholic Serbs considered the Sokol Movement (Sokolsko društvo) a <b>binding</b> <b>thread</b> of Yugoslav society. The Sokol Movement in Cavtat was the most active and the largest society in Cavtat until the April War in 1941. Cavatat municipality was separated from Konavle in 1937. The Yugoslav Radical Union (JRZ) led by Niko Vragolov won the elections. According to the Cvetković-Maček Agreement from August 26 th, 1939 Cavtat was separated from Banovina of Zeta and allotted to Banovina of Croatia. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) in Banovina of Croatia used its leading position to expand persecutions and deprivations of Catholic Serbs, the Yugoslavs and the Sokols. Local newspapers, especially magazines Dubrovnik and Sokolski glasnik, reported about these persecutions. In Banovina of Croatia municipality of Cavtat was appended in 1940 to the municipality of Konavle with the seat in Gruda. Everything that happened in and around Dubrovnik in Banovina of Croatia was an introduction to what was happening later in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH).

The American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) has an institutional membership of 1, 200 community colleges. Of that number, 20 have an African-American woman as a chief executive officer (CEO). This qualitative, ethnographic study was conducted to identify the leadership qualities and the adult continuing education (leadership) programs that contributed to the success of these African-American women community-college CEOs, inclusive of presidents, vice presidents, and other high-level administrators at the dean's level and above. The data, which was obtained using a survey instrument and in-depth personal interviews, were analyzed using a four-phase qualitative research methodology. From the data several threads of commonality were identified. First, these women recognized (between 5 and 11 years old) their leadership potential at an early age. Second, all had strong mothers who guided them. Third, all, except two, experienced periods in their childhood without a father in the home. Their fourth commonality was "aloneness. " The typical African-American woman community-college CEO does not have a spouse. The <b>binding</b> <b>thread</b> is their connectedness which is fostered through sorority, camaraderie, and mentoring of each other. However, there were a few exceptions. Two received their associate's degree from the college where they are now the CEO. Two of the presidents came up through the ranks of the institution where they started as faculty members. Study findings are conceptualized into themes and are summarized to reflect a paradigm of synergistic forces representative of the African-American woman community-college CEO's antecedents to success. Study conclusions are that in preparation for the presidency the respondents: (1) were committed to life-long learning; (2) had a mentor; (3) developed strong interpersonal skills; (4) were politically astute; (5) were often alone but never lonely, and (6) were also quite mobile. One of the implications {{of this study is that}} community-college presidents determine who gets into the pipeline for consideration of a presidency. Another implication is that attending the leadership development continuing-education programs reported in this study is one of the primary ways to access the gatekeepers of the community-college presidency...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the missionary enterprise of the Methodist Overseas Missions (MOM) in north east and west Arnhem Land and the resultant emerging Aboriginal church. After earlier mission attempts elsewhere in Australia had been abandoned (1821 - 1855), the MOM concentrated its missionary efforts for the next 60 years in the Pacific and India (1855 - 1915). The Methodist work in Arnhem Land therefore represented the resumption by the MOM of the missionary endeavour among the Aboriginal people of Australia. By historical coincidence the MOM work in Arnhem Land was also carried out for 60 years (1916 - 1977). The history of Methodism in Arnhem Land is diachronically and missiologically connected to the global Christian and colonial expansion. In the Arnhem Land context, these various segments of history converged and {{in one way or another}} interacted and impacted on the Aboriginal people. The impact of these Western histories on Aboriginal people forms an important part of the investigation in this thesis. Besides its own ecclesiastical history, the Methodist Mission, as alluded to above, is connected to the global missionary movement and missiological developments. The investigation of the MOM work in Arnhem Land in this thesis, therefore, takes into account the global historical and missiological perspectives. This study employs selected missiological models of contextualisation to analyse the process of Christianisation of Aboriginal people in Arnhem Land. In the first 30 years of the MOM work (1916 - 1946), the evangelisation of the Aboriginal people moved from a noncontextualised to a contextualised approach. The pioneer stage (1916 - 1925) was characterised by a lack of concerted effort to contextualise Christianity to Aboriginal cosmological frames of reference. From the mid- 1920 s the MOM adopted a policy of 2 ̆ 7 non-interference 2 ̆ 7 and the 1939 mission policy affirmed Aboriginal culture and Aboriginal people 2 ̆ 7 s capability in appropriating tenets of Christianity. This marked a shift to contextualisation, although this did not represent authentic contextualisation as the Aboriginal people were not involved in this process. In the second 30 -year period of the MOM work (1947 - 1977), some missionaries and Aboriginal Christians attempted authentic contextualisation. This involved relating Christianity to Aboriginal cultural, social and political contexts. This was in parallel with the international missiological trend in the 1960 s and 1970 s. However, this study argues that during the missionary era, the contextualisation and noncontextualisation approaches existed in juxtaposition. During the missionary era, while there was no Aboriginal church structurally, theologically an Aboriginal ekklesia had begun to emerge within the structure of the Methodist Mission. This emerging indigenous church, however, was absorbed into the mainstream Uniting Church of Australia (UCA) in 1977, at the end of the missionary era. The MOM did not adopt a policy for the development of a separate indigenous church. The <b>binding</b> <b>thread</b> of the investigation in this thesis relates to the prolonged absence of a policy on training of Aboriginal church leadership, with concomitant tardiness in developing an ordained Aboriginal leadership. This study argues that in the first 30 years of the MOM work in Arnhem Land (1916 - 1946), there was a conspicuous lack of policy on training of Aboriginal church leadership. In the second 30 -year period (1947 - 1977), however, a policy on training on Aboriginal church leadership was developed. This failure to encourage indigenous leadership meant that by the end of the missionary era there was only a limited number of Aboriginal clergy, after 60 years of Methodism in Arnhem Land; and no Aboriginal church was established. The thesis nevertheless acknowledges that the mission developed a core group of outstanding lay Aboriginal workers in the 1950 s, 1960 s and 1970 s. Some of these leaders could have been ordained. However, missionaries 2 ̆ 7 lack of faith and high expectations prevented the Aboriginal people from becoming candidates for ordination. A number of issues are covered in the study. They include the investigation of: missionary pragmatism, paternalism, racial beliefs and missionary ambivalence; issues dealing with the establishment of mission stations and mission institutionalism, with related industrialism and commercialism; alien contacts with Aboriginal people; the encounter between Christianity and Aboriginal cosmology; and issues emerging out of political, social and economic changes impinging on Arnhem Land, particularly in the 1960 s and 1970 s, as a result of policies adopted by the government. The MOM developed its own policies, separate from government policies, in order to keep abreast of and respond to the changing situation in Arnhem Land. However, while the purpose of these policies was argued in convincing terms, this study contends that they created a diversity of priorities which competed with the missiological task of specifically training Aboriginal church leaders. This resulted in a small number of clergy at the close of the missionary enterprise in Arnhem Land, and no indigenous church was established structurally...|$|E

5000|$|Before the {{invention}} of the printing press, making even the simplest book was a painstaking process. The paper was made by hand, the leather was prepared in tanneries, the <b>binding</b> <b>threads</b> were hand spun, and the inks were ground with a mortar and pestle. Even with all the materials assembled, the book still had to be stitched and glued together, then painstakingly written by hand by a scribe. Even so, hundreds of thousands of books were produced between the transition from papyrus scrolls to codices and the advent of the printing press. The initial transition that sparked this production occurred over time between the first and fifth centuries A.D. The transition from scrolls to codices began from a common tool used by merchants, the wax tablet. These tablets were simple panels covered in wax, which could be written in with a pointed stylus and then wiped clean again for reuse. They were normally kept together by rings passed through holes in their sides (Anderson 17). Once the format of a rectangular codex protected by hard or stiff covers had become a commonly known alternative to the scroll form previously used, it rapidly gained popularity for its durability and versatile applications. Over time, they became the standard form of written information. Gradually the intricate designs of tooled covers and decorated pages evolved to appeal to wealthy clients, and the books became an art form in and of themselves. Of these carefully created books, only about five percent were deemed important enough to be decorated with illustrations and illumination (Anderson 7).|$|R

I begin my analysis by summarizing the cultural background of my target population. I focus on issues of Islamic culture and religion, gender segregation, diversity, and the Arabic language. I next discuss the method by which I arrived at my research problem and population. My population is comprised of Arabic individuals studying in the USA, and their accompanying persons. I narrowed this population into {{a core group of}} key consultants, whose perspectives became representative voices. I interviewed my consultants on aspects of academic and social experiences in this country and the adaptative strategies they used to counteract its challenges. I divide my core analysis into two phases of residence [...] initial and subsequent. The initial documents the incipient adaptative processes used by my consultants in both social and academic settings. It discusses implications of the co-presence of gender {{in and out of the}} classroom and the strategy of avoidance. It documents the dynamics of teacher-student interactions and the discourse of authority. Arabic discourse includes communicative strategies of repetition and indirectness. The subsequent phase discussion focuses on outcomes of adaptation. In this phase, I discuss the redefinition of identity and issues of stigma. I address the outcomes of redefinitions of self and social interaction. I focus on discourse and communicative styles, and address nonassimilative adaptive strategies achieved by boundary maintaining mechanisms. I address the role of the home countries in the adaptative strategies of the population. Finally, this dissertation concludes with a recapitulation of macro and micro interaction and the cultural experience.

40|$|In current architectures, page {{tables are}} the {{fundamental}} mechanism that allows contemporary OSs to isolate user processes, <b>binding</b> each <b>thread</b> {{to a specific}} page table. A thread cannot therefore directly call another process's function or access its data; instead, the OS kernel provides data communication primitives and mediates process synchronization through inter-process communication (IPC) channels, which impede system performance. Alternatively, the recently proposed CODOMs architecture provides memory protection across software modules. Threads can cross module protection boundaries inside the same process using simple procedure calls, while preserving memory isolation. We present dIPC (for "direct IPC"), an OS extension that repurposes and extends the CODOMs architecture to allow threads to cross process boundaries. It maps processes into a shared address space, and eliminates the OS kernel from the critical path of inter-process communication. dIPC is 64. 12 × faster than local remote procedure calls (RPCs), and 8. 87 × faster than IPC in the L 4 microkernel. We show that applying dIPC to a multi-tier OLTP web server improves performance by up to 5. 12 × (2. 13 × on average), and reaches over 94...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Herein, the cyclic voltammetric (CV) {{investigations}} of structurally similar bisnitrocompounds (N 3, N 4, N 5, N 6, having different −CH 2 − spacer length) is presented. CV study offered interesting interactional possibilities of bisnitrocom-pounds with chicken blood ds. DNA at physiological pH 4. 7 and human body temperature, 310 K. The results indicated strong interaction by these symmetric molecules with ds. DNA {{and strength of}} binding is found to depend on length of CH 2 spacer group in their molecular structure. Thermodynamics derived from electrochemical binding parameters also favored the irre-versible interactions. Moreover, threading intercalation mode of binding is suggested based on thermodynamic and kinetic binding parameters extracted from CV studies. Key words: Bisnitrocompounds, ds.

50|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{elaborate}} on the simple longstitch binding. Besides altering the stitching pattern to include crosses, altering the length of the longstitches to have their own patterns, and other patterns, artists have also used multiple colored thread. There are also a number of different ways to close a longstitch book. Though some longstitch bound book covers are just trimmed {{to the edge of the}} book block, there are a variety of ways to fold over one side of the cover and fasten it. Buttons can be stitched into the <b>binding</b> and a <b>thread</b> attached to the cover flap. A slit can also be cut into the front cover and a strip from the back cover can be slipped through the slit. Modern book artists have elaborated on closure styles.|$|R
