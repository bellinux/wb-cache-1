500|$|In 1963 Timmons' playing, with Lewis Powers on {{bass and}} Ron McCurdy on drums, was {{described}} by a Washington Post reviewer as [...] "flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable sheen of church music and spirituals." [...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{this is not the}} fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album Got to Get It! featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E
2500|$|However, Thompson's {{opinion of}} the {{legislation}} changed and he conceded it had not worked as planned, saying [...] "I'm not prepared to go there yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> we shouldn't just take off the limits and have full disclosure with harsh penalties for not reporting everything on the Internet immediately." [...] Thompson {{thought that it was}} right to do away with soft money, that it was right to raise the limits on hard money, but that the limitation on political speech within 30 or 60 days of an election was wrong and the spending limits by outside groups are not working and they both should be repealed.|$|E
2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E

5000|$|The web {{version of}} pop culture {{magazine}} Entertainment Weekly premiered the entire album as a stream on September 25th, 2015, and quoted singer/songwriter Eric Earley {{about the origins of}} the album: [...] "I just went back to the bands that influenced me in high school, like the Replacements and R.E.M., Uncle Tupelo." [...] Earley also highlighted the lingering impact of his father's death on the record, saying, [...] "He’s been gone for many years, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ever really knew him ... Who’s to say meditating on the thought, ‘What if I was to just cross over? Just to talk to my dad?’ isn’t real?" ...|$|R

The English reader forms his idea of French life from the French novel; it leads to mistaken notions. There are French Darbys, French Joans, many thousands of them.|$|R

To be sure, Mr. Grandcourt is a much younger man, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> Sir Hugo were to outlive him, {{notwithstanding}} the difference of years.

"My Merry {{seems to}} be {{contented}} with her brothers so far, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had my hands full by and by," [...] added Mrs. Grant, who already foresaw that her sweet little daughter would be sought after {{as soon as she}} should lengthen her skirts and turn up her bonny brown hair.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Glad {{you think}} so. The fact is it's {{going to take}} a heap of taming to make me go well in harness anywhere.

6000|$|Carol assured herself, [...] "Whatever faults I may have, I {{certainly}} couldn't ever be jealous.

6000|$|... "I will be careful," [...] she answered. [...] "I only {{spoke of}} it for this reason.

6000|$|The two men glanced {{quickly at}} the speaker, whose face flushed and then smiled embarrassedly as if {{ashamed of the}} enthusiasm into {{which he had been}} betrayed.

6000|$|I came to-day {{to spend}} a while with Aunt Margaret in [...] Charlottetown. It is so pretty here, where she lives--and [...] ever so much nicer than on the farm at home. I have no cows [...] to milk here or pigs to feed. Aunt Margaret has given me [...] such a lovely blue muslin dress, and I am to have it made to [...] wear at a garden party out at Brighton next week. I never [...] had a muslin dress before--nothing but ugly prints and dark [...] woolens. I wish we were rich, like Aunt Margaret. Aunt [...] Margaret laughed when I said this, and {{declared}} she would [...] give all her wealth for my youth and beauty and [...] light-heartedness. I am only eighteen and I know I am very [...] merry <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> I am really pretty. It seems to me [...] that I am when I look in Aunt Margaret's beautiful mirrors. [...] They make me look {{very different from the}} old cracked one in [...] my room at home which always twisted my face and turned me [...] green. But Aunt Margaret spoiled her compliment by telling [...] me I look exactly as she did at my age. If I thought I'd [...] ever look as Aunt Margaret does now, I don't know what I'd [...] do. She is so fat and red.|$|E

5000|$|Road to Nowhere is Monte Hellman's {{first feature}} film in 21 years. The film {{was written by}} Variety {{executive}} editor Steven Gaydos. [...] Shannyn Sossamon was the first actor to be cast after Gaydos saw her in a restaurant rehearsing a scene with another person. Reluctantly, Gaydos gave Sossamon his card saying, [...] "I don't do this often, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> you or your agent would contact Monte Hellman." [...] Hellman told the Los Angeles Times that he dedicated the film to Laurie Bird, with whom Hellman fell in love while directing her in Two-Lane Blacktop.|$|E

[...] "But, say--say, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> why--Somehow, <b>I</b> haven't enjoyed Oxford {{and the rest}} of the places like I ought to. See, I'd always thought I'd be simply nutty about the quatrangles and stuff, but I'm afraid they're too highbrow for me.

5000|$|I {{would really}} like to try to live {{in the world of the}} {{characters}} we've created for a little bit. We had a lot of great guest stars last year, but I also feel like there's a lot we could explore with the characters that we have. And I'd like to leave a little breathing room in the show, to let viewers keep up a little. I feel like sometimes it was a little too dense, the shows last year.

5000|$|He won {{his case}} against the {{university}} in Allahabad High Court on 1 April 2010, and got back his job as professor, along with his accommodation, until his retirement. The case was exacerbated by the involvement {{of students in the}} covert taping and ambush of Siras and his lover. The case was fought on the premise that Siras could not be penalised for being homosexual as Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized homosexuality, had been declared unconstitutional by the Delhi High Court in 2009. I spent two decades here. I love my University. I have always loved it {{and will continue to do}} so no matter what. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> they have stopped loving me because I am gay Siras, 2010 ...|$|E

2500|$|Sontag {{was quoted}} by Editor-in-Chief Brendan Lemon of Out {{magazine}} as saying [...] "I {{grew up in}} a time when the modus operandi was the 'open secret'.

Intellectually, I know why I haven't spoken more about my sexuality, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> do <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> haven't repressed something there to my detriment. Maybe I could have given comfort to some people if I had dealt with the subject of my private sexuality more, but it's never been my prime mission to give comfort, unless somebody's in drastic need. I'd rather give pleasure, or shake things up." ...|$|R
