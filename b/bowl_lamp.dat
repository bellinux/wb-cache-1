Here traces of Phoenician habitation dating to the early 7th century BC were discovered in excavations made during an archaeological expedition led by Pedro Sánchez in 1998. Bronze Age utensils including plates, carinated <b>bowls,</b> <b>lamps</b> and other ceramics of Phoenician and indigenous Iberian types have been found, as well as a few Greek examples. There are two ancient watchtowers, the Torre Río Real (Royal River Tower) and the Torre Ladrones (Tower of Thieves).

50|$|The Gulf of Mexico and Southeast {{extend the}} length of the state of Veracruz and into the Yucatán Peninsula and Chiapas. Basketry is made all over the state of Veracruz, with each ethnic and {{regional}} group producing its own style, based on their needs and other factors. Over time a number of traditional utilitarian and ceremonial items has been converted into decorative ones, and still support a number of Veracruz families. The Totonac principally use reeds, (A. donax) among others.) In the south of Veracruz, the Nahua communities of Pajapán and Hueyapan de Ocampo produce elaborate baskets with wicker and the roots of the Philodendrum radiatum and Monstera deliciosa. In the center of the state, mestizo groups create various products such as the palm petates in Tigrillos and shrimp traps in Jalcomulco located in the center of Veracruz on {{the eastern side of the}} Cofre de Perote. It is surrounded by semi deciduous rainforest with over 800 species of plants, as well a fruit orchards and fields with sugar cane and other crops. Its basketry is mostly linked to the harvesting of crayfish and fresh water shrimp form the Los Pescados River, using basket-like traps traditionally made from reeds. Since the 1990s, the economy has changed from agriculture and fishing towards eco-tourism. This had led to many trap makers to expand their skills into other objects such decorative baskets, vases, fruit <b>bowls,</b> <b>lamp</b> bases and more. The demand for these products has taken a toll on the plants used for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|Like the Art Nouveau {{period before}} it, Art Deco was an {{exceptional}} period for fine glass and other decorative objects, {{designed to fit}} their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was René Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of François Coty, {{but he did not}} begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, <b>bowls,</b> <b>lamps</b> and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners SS Ile de France in 1927 and the SS Normandie in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender glass column which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.|$|R

2500|$|Temascalcingo [...] makes {{high fire}} wares, a craft {{introduced}} during then governor Carlos Hank Gonzalez’s term to modernize production. It is distinguished by decoration in cobalt blue, based on traditional designs. In {{the community of}} Santa María Canchesda of this municipality, eight artisans, including two Mazahua, work to make high fire ceramics such as tea sets, shot glasses for tequila, bowls, flowerpots, napkin holders, fruit <b>bowls,</b> decorative figures, <b>lamp</b> bases and more.|$|R
5000|$|Articles {{produced}} included plates, <b>bowls,</b> vases, oil <b>lamps,</b> dresser sets, {{salt and}} pepper shakers and candle holders. The most common colors used were gold, red, and green, with gold usually being the predominant color. The exact etymology of the name is unknown, but likely {{stems from the fact}} that the painted decoration was not very durable and people felt that it was [...] "goofy" [...] or that someone had tried to [...] "goof us".|$|R
50|$|The unfired {{porcelain}} body is {{not very}} plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups and <b>bowls,</b> fishes, <b>lamps,</b> cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, brush holders, wine and teapots, Buddhist and Taoist figures, secular figures and puppets. There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g., Guanyin, Maitreya, Luohan and Ta-mo figures. Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy, was particularly revered in Fujian and there exist innumerable figures of her. Donnelly says, “There {{is no doubt that}} figures constitute the great glory of blanc de Chine.” Some have been produced with little modification from the late 16th or early 17th century. Crisply modeled figures with a smooth white glaze were popular as were joss-stick holders, brush pots, Dogs of Fo, libation cups and boxes.|$|R
50|$|In Byzantine times, a fortress, Pontikon or Pontikokastro, {{was built}} {{on the site of the}} ruined ancient acropolis. Archaeological {{excavations}} in the area were undertaken in 1957 by Nikos Gialouris, and the findings are exhibited in the Archaeological Museum of Olympia. They include ostraca from prehistoric up to Roman times, clay <b>lamps,</b> <b>bowls,</b> cylixes, amphorae, columns, an Archaic-era kouros from Naxos, and Cycladic statues, all testimonies to the site's role as a major port. An extensive Roman-era cemetery was also found on the islet of Ιchthys or Tiganonisi. However, most of the graves were found looted.|$|R
5|$|There are {{remnants}} {{of many of}} the items imported from and exported to the Roman empire, at Arikamedu. Imported items recovered from here include ceramics such as amphorae and sherds of Arretine ware, glass <b>bowls,</b> Roman <b>lamps,</b> a crystal gem and an object resembling a stylus. Artifacts that may have been meant for export include jewellery, worked ivory, textiles and perhaps leather or leather-related products. Similar looking ornaments have been recovered from Arikamedu and Palatine Hill in Rome, further confirming that this site was a leading trade center. The Pandyan port city Alagankulam has yielded a rouletted pottery ware that bears the figure of a ship on the shoulder portion. This figure is very similar to a finding reported from Ostia, an ancient port of the Romans. Wharf-like structures found at many port cities indicate that they might have been used as docks. Based on marine explorations of various port-sites, {{it has been suggested that}} stone anchors may have been used since as early as the 3rd century BCE.|$|R
50|$|Köhnəgala - the {{settlement}} of the Middle Ages, near the Shahbuzkand village in the Shahbuz rayon. It was registered in 1990. Its area is more than 10 hectares. It is surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs. During archaeological researches were found the fragments of pottery. The remains of a stone wall on the south-eastern part of Köhnəqala is observed {{from a distance of}} 150 m. Surface materials consists, from the iron things (most likely a knife blade), the products of unglazed (pot, kettle-type containers etc.) and glazed (<b>bowl,</b> plate-type containers, <b>lamp</b> etc.) ceramic, fragments of glass. The settlement belongs to the 14-18 centuries.|$|R
50|$|Klytie Pate’s pots take form in {{numerous}} shapes and sizes. Over {{the years she}} managed to produce a staggering amount of pottery, much of which is distributed in private collections across Australia, which {{makes it difficult to}} grasp the scope of her work. Even so, galleries often had to wait for an opportunity to exhibit her work as she became better known. She made lidded jars, large <b>bowls</b> and vases, <b>lamp</b> bases, jugs, animals and birds, large decorated plates, wall tiles, tea sets and mugs. Klytie went through different periods where she concentrated on a certain colour glaze, shape, or theme in the production of her pots. However, notably, apart from sets of cups and saucers, no two pieces are the same.|$|R

40|$|A multi-analytical {{approach}} {{was used to}} investigate Roman lead-glazed ceramic artefacts from archaeological excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum (Italy) aiming at defining the production technology of both glaze and ceramic body, by way of integrated investigations. The chemical, structural, and micro-morphological characterisations were performed {{using a combination of}} laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Fragments of artefacts (skyphoi, oil <b>lamps,</b> <b>bowls,</b> askoi, amphorae, krateres) of great historical and archaeological interest were sampled. LA-ICP-MS was used to determine the elemental composition by virtue of its effective lateral resolution, its ability to detect most elements and also to analyse comparably small samples. All the archaeological objects were coated with a lead-based glaze produced using a lead oxide-plus-quartz mixture, with sodium/potassium feldspars added as a flux and two different metals used: copper and iron. Two types of ceramic pastes have been identified, but chemometric techniques support the hypothesis of a Campanian provenance for the raw materials. Degradation phenomena such as the partial devitrification of the glaze, i. e. the slow structural reorganisation towards stable crystalline phases, and the leaching by mineral dissolution in the soil, were determined...|$|R
50|$|During {{a tour of}} Europe in 1906, {{funded by}} Helen, Guerrier and her partner, Edith Brown, had an epiphany - they would return to America and develop a pottery. The {{enterprise}} would be operated by Brown, Guerrier, and the Saturday Girls, providing the young women with employment and a skill set. Helen readily agreed to subsidize the venture and the Paul Revere Pottery was born. In 1908, she purchased a large townhouse at 18 Hull Street {{to serve as the}} club’s new headquarters; the pottery and kiln were erected in the basement. The operation was wholly run by the Saturday Girls. They produced and decorated the pottery, operated the kiln, ran the store in Boston where their wares were sold and, later on, they also conducted pottery classes. Helen, Guerrier, and Brown, agreed that an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere should surround the girls. Accordingly, their rooms were always filled with “fresh flowers and bright light,” and as they worked, the young women were treated to “dramatic readings and soothing music” performed by the children of well-to-do families who patronized the pottery. They produced a wide variety of objects, including pitchers, vases, inkwells, plates, <b>bowls,</b> and even <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tomkins {{relocated}} to Seattle, Washington, in 1939, becoming an Assistant Professor of Art at the University of Washington {{for a brief}} period. In 1940, she married Seattle artist James H. FitzGerald (1910-1973) who would also become a leading painter and sculptor in the Northwest. In 1941, she had her first solo exhibition at the Seattle Art Museum. The same year, Tomkins {{became involved in the}} Federal Art Project, teaching at the Spokane Art Center, one of the leading WPA facilities in the country, after her husband was appointed director of the center by Washington FAP head Bruce Inverarity. In 1942 Tomkins and Fitzgerald returned to Seattle, moving back into a house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood which they had purchased and begun renovating in 1939. During the Second World War, while FitzGerald worked at Boeing, Tomkins gave birth to the first of their three children. She supplemented their income with ceramic works, and began working with egg tempera while sketching out new directions for her painting. In addition to painting, Tomkins and FitzGerald were both fine craftsmen and sculptors, working in ceramics and even furniture design. Their Modernist ceramics were mostly utilitarian objects such as <b>bowls,</b> vessels and <b>lamps,</b> done in a unique and imaginative style.|$|R
40|$|Citation: Randle, Elizabeth. The {{decoration}} {{of the dining}} room. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1907. Introduction: The Dining Room in many homes {{is the most important}} room in the house. Here the entire family gather, perhaps three times a day and for that reason the room should be as pleasant as possible and represent something of comfort and happiness. There should be no airy triflings either in color or fabrics and no fussy fancywork. Two {{of the most important things}} in a Dining Room are, an abundance of light and proper ventilation. A western exposure is not preferable for a dining room. It makes the room a rather cheerless one on a winter's morning, and in the summer, by the time the family gather for the evening meal, the rays of the setting sun are likely to interfere with their comfort. A natural lighting consisting of a southerly or easterly aspect is much to be preferred. In artificial lighting use and appropriateness must be the first consideration. The primary object is to light the room in the right place without allowing the glare of light to strike the eye unpleasantly. Electric lights can be dropped from the ceiling, or if the light is on the table one should have the shade so it can be adjusted. Light should always be softened before it comes into the eyes. In the Dining Room the purpose is to light the table. This may be done in two ways; by hanging the light from the ceiling, or by having a lamp or candles on the table. A candle stick must have: first,- something to hold the candle; second,- something to catch the drip; third,- something to hold candle by. The lamp in this room should not be elaborate. A round lamp and a round globe give monotony. It is better to have different shapes that give variety. Highly decorated lamps should be avoided and in their place the dull hues might be used. The <b>bowl</b> of <b>lamp</b> must not be so large as to shade the table around it. In lighting by electricity the chandelier should hang directly over the table and the light be softened by ground glass shades...|$|R

On this a 4 ft. high wooden Irminsul, a spear, a sword, a replica of a sun disc chariot, a leather-bound copy of The Edda as well as ritual bowls and candles are placed. The participants are seated in a semi-circle in front of the table, the front row being occupied by Order members clothed in their ritual garb (black shirts for the men and long white dresses for the women; both have the AO emblem sewn on them)… after several invocations the 'spirit flame', symbolising Odin in the spirit world, is lit in a <b>bowl</b> filled with <b>lamp</b> oil. The purpose of this cultic celebration is the portrayal of Odin's concentration from spirit into matter. After a recital of the first part of Odin's rune poem (...) from The Edda, the [...] "blood sacrifice" [...] commences, in which a bowl with animal blood is raised to the beat of a gong and an invocation of sacrifice. Then Odin is called into the realm by the participants who assume the Odal rune stance, whisper 'W-O-D-A-N' nine times and finally sing an ode to Odin with the following words: 'Odin-Wodan come to us, od-uod, uod'. Wodan's sacrifice to himself is symbolised by extinguishing the flame.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Between 1988 and 1990 a shipwreck tentatively dated to the 5 th century B. C. was excavated off the coast of Israel at Ma'agan Michael by Dr. Elisha Linder of the Center for Maritime Studies. This study presents one category of material from the Ma'agan Michael shipwreck: the pottery. The goal of this analysis is to provide an indication of the ship's date, origin, and route, as well as insights into shipboard life and the utilization of shipboard space. The majority of wares are personal items for shipboard use such as <b>bowls,</b> jars, jugs, <b>lamps,</b> and a cooking pot. Transport amphoras of the basket handle and "Persian" storage jar types are represented only in small numbers. The pottery can be dated from approximately 425 to 400 B. C. The distribution of ceramics throughout the ship suggests two main storage areas: one in the ship's stern for the storage of food preparation and cooking vessels and one just forward of the mast step associated with the ship's water jar. A number of vessels are common types known from Persian period strata along the Levantine coast although many vessels, especially the jugs, have good Cypriot parallels. Attic and East Greek(?) wares are represented by only a few examples. The predominance of Cypriot pottery common to the southern coast from Amathus to Kition suggests a west-east route from Cyprus to any number of Phoenician settlements along the coast of Syria-Palestine...|$|R

The Chinese have built their [...] portion {{of the city to}} suit themselves; and as they keep neither [...] {{carriages}} nor wagons, their streets are not wide enough, as a [...] general thing, to admit of the passage of vehicles. At ten o'clock [...] at night the Chinaman may be seen in all his glory. In every little [...] cooped-up, dingy cavern of a hut, faint with the odor of burning [...] Josh-lights and with nothing to see the gloom by save the sickly, [...] guttering tallow candle, were two or three yellow, long-tailed [...] vagabonds, coiled up on a sort of short truckle-bed, smoking opium, [...] motionless and with their lustreless eyes turned inward from excess [...] of satisfaction--or rather the recent smoker looks thus, immediately [...] after having passed the pipe to his neighbor--for opium-smoking is a [...] comfortless operation, and requires constant attention. A lamp sits [...] on the bed, the length of the long pipe-stem from the smoker's [...] mouth; he puts a pellet of opium {{on the end of a}} wire, sets it on [...] fire, and plasters it into the pipe much as a Christian would fill a [...] hole with putty; then he applies the <b>bowl</b> to the <b>lamp</b> and proceeds [...] to smoke--and the stewing and frying of the drug and the gurgling of [...] the juices in the stem would well-nigh turn the stomach of a statue.

5000|$|Pottery is {{the most}} commons handcraft and remains an {{important}} economic activity for the state, although most wares are still produced in the traditional manner, with little modernization or industrialization in technique. Pottery centers include Metepec, Tecomatepec, Valle de Bravo, Texcoco, Cuauhtitlan and Almoloya de Juárez, and common products include dishes, cups, decorative items and miniatures, such as toy dishes. Valle de Bravo makes sets of dishes and other pieces of glazed brown clay, and Texcoco creates reproductions of pre Hispanic pieces as well as newer pieces based on the old designs. Tecomatepec is noted for producing jars for serving pulque.Metepec is the state’s main pottery center, with a production that stands out for its variety and artistry, which has evolved slowly since the colonial period. Although part of the Toluca metropolitan area, {{the center of this}} municipality maintains its small town atmosphere, with handcrafts filling stores and street stalls on the streets near the San Juan Bautista parish church. [...] The municipality is home to over 300 artisans and 270 families dedicated {{in one way or another}} to this industry, which is its main economic activity. Most of the pottery produced is common glazed wares for everyday use such as large pots, plates and casseroles, often with a blue, green or yellow glaze. However, the municipality is better known for its decorative pieces, generally unglazed and painted tempuras in bright and contrasting colors. These include items such as nativity scene pieces, figures of horses, sun plaques (hung on the outside of houses) and mermaids, but the most notable decorative piece is called the “tree of life.” These look like candelabras which lack places to put candles. Traditionally these were made as allegories for the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and these continue to be made. [...] More recently, trees with other themes have appeared including Day of the Dead, pottery making and more. These are low fire pieces, and most are small, no more than thirty cm in height, but monumental versions are made as well such as the one that is in the collection of the Vatican museums. Most are also painted in bright colors such as magenta, red, blue, yellow, green, orange and purple but some are left unpainted. In 2009, the Metepec style has been legally protected from imitations by denominación de origen.Temascalcingo makes high fire wares, a craft introduced during then governor Carlos Hank Gonzalez’s term to modernize production.
