40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding the {{behavior}} of birds in agricultural habitats can {{be the first step}} in evaluating the conservation implications of birds' use of landscapes shaped by modern agriculture. The existence and magnitude of risk from agricultural practices and the quality of resources agricultural lands provide will be determined largely by how birds use these habitats. <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> (Tryngites subruficollis) are a species of conservation concern. During spring migration large numbers of <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> stopover in row crop fields in the Rainwater Basin region of Nebraska. We used behavioral observations as a first step in evaluating how <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> use crop fields during migratory stopover. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured behavior during migratory stopover using scan and focal individual sampling to determine how birds were using crop fields. Foraging was the most frequent behavior observed, but the intensity of foraging changed {{over the course of the}} day with a distinct mid-day low point. Relative to other migrating shorebirds, <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> spent a significant proportion of their time in social interactions including courtship displays. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that the primary use of upland agricultural fields by migrating <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> is foraging while wetlands are used for maintenance and resting. The importance of foraging in row crop fields suggests that both the quality of food resources available in fields and the possible risks from dietary exposure to agricultural chemicals will be important to consider when developing conservation plans for <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> migrating through the Great Plains...|$|R

500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, <b>buff-breasted</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

During a ship-based expedition to arctic Canada, we caught waders at seven, mainly coastal sites, with-in 68 °- 76 °N and 139 °- 67 °W, from 28 July to 31 August 1999. More than two hundred waders of twelve species were trapped, mainly White-rumped Calidris fuscicollis, Semipalmated C. pusilla, Baird 2 ̆ 7 s C. bairdii and <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Tryngites subruficollis. The vast majority of the birds were juveniles. Body masses and visual fat stores were low, close to the lowest values found anywhere during the non-breeding season for the different species. The relatively fattest birds were <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> but they were still far from their maximum body mass on spring migration. We conclude that juvenile arctic waders depart from their natal areas with only small fuel stores, which is in concordance with a time-minimising migration strategy...|$|R

Zinc levels showed higher concentration (67. 97 µg/g) than the other metals, and cadmium levels showed the lowest concentration (0. 14 µg/g).

40|$|As {{is often}} the case, the spring season had {{something}} for everyone: potential range expansions, an incredible shorebird migration through the eastern Rainwater Basin, a scarcity of migrant warblers, and some genuinely rare birds. Timely spring rainfall transformed the Rainwater Basin, leaving large areas of sheetwater for migrant shorebirds and improving the attractiveness of wetlands, particularly renovated wetlands, to certain breeding species. Perhaps the most important bits of information we can record here are changes in breeding ranges or behavior. Of significance here is the second nesting record for Hooded Merganser, the increasing occurrence of Greater Prairie-Chickens at Rainwater Basin grasslands, the return of Mississippi Kites to Red Cloud, nesting Black-necked Stilts and American Avocets in the Rainwater Basin, discovery of Barn Owls in northeast Nebraska, expansion into the state of Scissor-tailed Flycatchers, possible breeding of Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcrackers on the Pine Ridge, the continued feeding of grackle and robin chicks by the Sioux Co Curve-billed Thrasher (now {{considered to be a}} Husker), increasing evidence of Spotted Towhee introgression at Schramm State Park, and extra-limital nestings of Pine Siskin. The shorebird migration through the Rainwater Basin was one for the ages, with record numbers of Hudsonian Godwits, Ruddy Turnstones, Dunlin, and <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> found. Numbers of other species were also high, and L Mcconaughy contributed with a record count of Whimbrels. On the other hand, migrant warblers were drastically lower in numbers, notably Nashville Warbler (8), Chestnut-sided Warbler (3), Magnolia Warbler (1), Black-throated Green Warbler (1), and Blackburnian Warbler (0). What this means will have to wait for a regional or national perspective. Rarities were in evidence also, with some real 2 ̆ 2 zooties 2 ̆ 2 : Black-bellied Whistling-Duck, Anhinga, Glossy Ibis, White-tailed Kite, Red Knot, Ruff, Little Gull, White-eyed Vireo (in Sioux Co, no less), and Connecticut Warbler...|$|R

40|$|Much less {{apparent}} {{and well}} known than the annual crane migration is Nebraska’s {{role in the}} spring and fall migrations of shorebirds such as sandpipers, plovers, curlews and godwits. These migrations are inconspicuous, {{in part because of the}} fact that most long-distance shorebird flights occur at night. Shorebirds also never migrate in the enormous flocks that are so typical of geese and cranes, and their flights are usually unaccompanied by loud calls. Yet, they are massive if nearly invisible migrations, involving over 30 species and an estimated 200, 000 – 300, 000 birds. Many of the species travel from South American wintering grounds, and about half of them are bound for arctic tundra breeding grounds of Canada and Alaska. While resting and feeding between flights, the birds scatter across Nebraska’s smaller and shallower wetlands, from the undulating loess plains of Rainwater Basin between the Platte and Republican rivers, across the wet meadows of the Platte Valley, to the thousands of remote Sand Hills wetlands nestled between the Platte and Niobrara rivers. Nebraska’s wetlands are a small but important part of an intercontinental series of important stepping- stones used by shorebirds on their migrations. Some locations are especially valuable for certain species but may be little used by others. For example, the otherwise undistinguished agricultural fields and wetlands centered in Seward and Fillmore counties are probably the <b>buff-breasted</b> <b>sandpiper’s</b> single most important spring stopover area between its Argentine wintering sites and its high-arctic nesting grounds. Not far to the south, the shallow marshes of Cheyenne Bottoms Wildlife Area in central Kansas supports nearly half of North America’s total shorebird population, including more than 90 percent of the white-rumped, Baird’s and stilt sandpipers, long-billed dowitchers and Wilson’s phalaropes surveyed during spring in central and eastern North America. To the north the glaciated potholes and sloughs of the Dakotas and southern Canada provide the major stopping points on the spring flights of many northern prairie or arctic-nesting species...|$|R
40|$|Black-shouldered Kite. On 6 May, 1995, I saw {{an adult}} in full plumage hunting over {{a field of}} tall, dead grass just inside the Polk County line from York County. I first noticed this large, white bird {{hovering}} while hunting, then it would move a short distance and hover again. Since I see these birds every winter in south Texas, I am very familiar with them, {{and this is the}} first one I 2 ̆ 7 ve seen in Nebraska. Its field marks were very plain, especially the black shoulder patches, long, pointed wings, and long tail. After watching it for some time, I left for about two hours. When I returned, it was still in the same area along with a pair of Northern Harriers. This was a good chance to see the differences in the two species from close range. While they are compared with each other in the bird literature, they really are not similar and are easily separated in the field. <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> This spring (1995) we had lots of these birds like we used to a few years ago when we planted later than we usually do now. Corn planting was so much later this year because of the cool, wet spring. When we plant earlier, I suppose the birds migrate through here after the planting is done and I 2 ̆ 7 m not in the field to see them. They have the odd habit of extending one wing straight up and holding it this way for a short time, so that the white underside reflects the light and can be seen for a long distance. I believe this behavior has something to do with courtship display, but I 2 ̆ 7 ve never seen other birds display in this manner.

It was observed for 15 - 20 minutes starting at 7 : 05 AM, and was flying between undergrowth and a sub-canopy of hackberry and ironwood trees. It ate what looked like two caterpillars. I was 20 to 25 feet from the bird, which was thrush size, about 6 to 8 inches in length. It had a slight reddish cast around the eye and bill, fading into a darker yellow on top, of the head and on the back of the neck. The upper and lower mand 1 bles were black, as were also the legs and feet. The back, rump, uppertail and undertail coverts, throat, belly, and flanks were all fairly bright yellow. The tail was all black with a small notch. The wings were solid black except for two very distinct and noticeable yellowish-white wing bars. It did not vocalize.

40|$|New in this Seasonal Report, {{direct from}} the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (along with Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Snipe, Rock Pigeon, etc.), is the {{modified}} checklist order, featuring geese, swans, and ducks at the beginning, followed by gallinaceous birds, then resuming the familiar order with loons. Perhaps {{the most important}} use for these reports, {{in addition to their}} incorporation into the Southern Great Plains Region summary in North American Birds, is the noting of significant avian events in Nebraska. Some are of obvious importance, but the meaning of others is obscure, perhaps only to be revealed as subsequent reports show a trend, or events noted in Nebraska are corroborated by the same events noted in the other Southern Great Plains states, in Kansas and Oklahoma, or even on a national level. Such events discussed in this report include a good showing of scoters, hints of a recovery of the Gray Partridge population, a sighting of 7 + migrating Mississippi Kites, a Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker in Sowbelly Canyon, indications of declines in numbers of Black-billed Magpie, American Crow, and Black-capped Chickadee, westerly Carolina Wrens, rather low numbers of thrushes and warblers, westerly Rose-breasted Grosbeaks possibly breeding, good numbers of Purple Finches, no reports of Red Crossbills after 27 Sep, and few Pine Siskins. A similar category of events, but perhaps better labeled 2 ̆ 2 quirky, 2 ̆ 2 were some strange bobwhite items from the Panhandle, the occurrence of Eurasian Collared-Doves in 74 counties so far, the possibility that the Curve-billed Thrasher at the Frimann Ranch in Sioux County was able to sneak its genes into the Brown Thrasher pool, a Blue Grosbeak carrying a minnow, and an Orange Bishop (a bird, not a Dutch prelate) in Kearney.

One shorebird of conservation concern, the <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (Tryngites subruficollis), is a New World migrant that breeds at Arctic latitudes in North America and Russia and winters in southeastern South America. We conducted a molecular survey of samples representing each of three migratory regions (breeding, migration, and wintering) using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci and 1. 5 kb of highly variable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the cytochrome b gene and mtDNA control region. We analyzed contemporary population structure, demographic trends, and phylogeographic patterns. Overall, microsatellite and mtDNA analyses revealed that Buff-breasted Sandpipers are panmictic both regionally and at a global scale, with no signal of a recent genetic bottleneck. The mtDNA analyses revealed a pattern of haplotype diversity consistent with an expansion from a single refugium (Tajima's D: - 2. 27, P < 0. 01; Fu's F[subscript s]: - 30. 6, P < 0. 0001), after {{the height of the}} Wisconsinan glaciation (8, 400 – 45, 000 years before present). Overall, our molecular analyses suggest that Buff-breasted Sandpipers should be treated as a single conservation unit, and management efforts for this species should focus on limiting future declines to ensure that genetic viability is maintained...|$|E

Shorebird Conservation Plan lists twenty-seven shorebird species as species of high concern and seven as highly imperiled, including the <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (Tryngites subruficollis). One hypothesis for ongoing population declines is exposure to toxic chemicals and pollutants. The purpose of this project was to characterize plasma cholinesterases (ChEs) of migratory shorebirds and address potential exposure to organophosphorus (OP) and carbamate (CB) pesticides. Consumption or contact with these pesticides can cause mortality {{and a variety of}} sub-lethal effects. Buff-breasted Sandpipers and other upland shorebirds are particularly likely to encounter agrochemicals due to their habitat use at the non-breeding grounds. I sampled migratory shorebirds over three seasons, during north- and southbound migration in 2006 and 2007 in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska and during the non-breeding season in 2007 in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. I collected blood samples and footwashings from reference sites, where OP and CB pesticides were not used, and agricultural sites, where these two insecticides were recommended for control of crop pests. I assessed several variables known to affect plasma ChE activity including body size, date of capture, time of capture, condition, sex, and region. Small-bodied species had higher levels of ChE activity in plasma than large-bodied species. Plasma ChE activities varied with date of capture in 3 of 5 species sampled in North America. Sex differences were significant in 1 of 4 species tested. Plasma acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was higher among White-rumped Sandpipers sampled in North America but {{there was no difference between}} regions among Buff-breasted Sandpipers. Time of capture and individual condition did not affect plasma ChE activity. Estimates of exposure to ChE inhibitors were addressed in five species. Plasma AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities of Buff-breasted Sandpipers were lower at agricultural sites in South America but BChE activity was higher at agricultural sites in North America. There were no differences between sites in four other species tested. A meta-analysis across all species indicated that in 4 of 6 comparisons habitat type had a negative effect on AChE activity consistent with exposure to ChE inhibitors but there was a regional positive effect of agricultural habitat on BChE activity in North America. Comparison of body mass between sites suggested that use of habitats with potential pesticide application did not affect mass gain. Project results suggest that 1 of 5 shorebird species tested was exposed to ChE-inhibiting pesticides at the non-breeding grounds and future monitoring is necessary to assess potential effects at the population level. This study highlights the importance of complete sampling and addressing variability in plasma ChEs before making estimates of exposure to OP and CB pesticides. It provides the first estimates of migratory shorebird exposure to OP and CB pesticides, a potential conservation issue. Future research should include continued monitoring of <b>Buff-breasted</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> ChE levels and habitat use. Other sources of anthropogenic declines such as habitat loss and illegal hunting should be investigated for species that did not show evidence of exposure...|$|E
