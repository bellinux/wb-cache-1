50|$|Very sharp {{knives and}} a cleaver are {{required}} for butchering. The carcass is cut into hams, shoulders, <b>bacon</b> <b>sides,</b> pork bellys, ham hocks, loins, pork chops, and other cuts of lesser importance.|$|E
50|$|The {{smoke house}} is {{essential}} for the preservation and long term storage of hams, shoulders, <b>bacon</b> <b>sides,</b> and pork bellies. The meat is hung on racks and hooks in the smokehouse; and later smoked. Fragrant hardwood, such as hickory, beech, or cherry is allowed to smolder slowly in a pit below the hanging meat. This gives added flavor and color to the meat as well as serving to dry cure the pork.|$|E
25|$|The term 'bacon' {{on its own}} {{typically}} {{refers to}} <b>side</b> <b>bacon.</b>|$|R

2500|$|<b>Side</b> <b>bacon,</b> or streaky bacon, {{comes from}} pork belly. It is very fatty with long layers of fat running {{parallel}} to the rind. This {{is the most common}} form of bacon in the United States. [...] "Slab bacon" [...] is <b>side</b> <b>bacon</b> that is not sliced. Slab bacon is similar to salt pork, which is prepared from the same cuts, but salt pork is not smoked.|$|R
5000|$|The Sorsogon-Bacon Bridge. Bacon was an {{important}} port during the Spanish period until {{the opening of the}} Sorsogon-Albay road in 1924. Government officials, businessmen and travelers from Manila used to come to Legazpi City by train, and from Legazpi City to Bacon, by the launch, San Antonio, and from Bacon to Sorsogon, by bus. Due to the importance of the port in business, and the road, in transporting goods from Bacon to Sorsogon, Governor Peñaranda of Albay issued a decree in 1814 ordering the construction of Gabao Bridge, to be finished in forty-five days by polistas. One-half of the bridge, on the <b>Bacon</b> <b>side,</b> was constructed by polistas from Bacon, and the other half from Sorsogon (Unfortunately, this bridge is no longer there, having given way to the widening of the concrete roadway going into Bacon, which is now a mere district of Sorsogon City) ...|$|R
5000|$|John Bacon {{allegedly}} served, at one point, in the Patriot militia and {{not long}} after he switched sides back to the British Loyalist <b>side.</b> <b>Bacon</b> insisted upon being called [...] "Captain".|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing much," [...] {{said the}} Kid calmly. [...] "I eat my first iguana steak to-day. They're them big lizards, you sabe? I reckon, though, that frijoles and <b>side</b> <b>bacon</b> would do me about as well. Do {{you care for}} iguanas, Thacker?" ...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} form sold is 'middle bacon', which {{includes}} the more of the streaky, fatty section of <b>side</b> <b>bacon</b> along with {{a portion of the}} loin of back bacon. In response to increasing consumer diet-consciousness, some supermarkets also offer the loin section only. This is sold as 'short cut bacon' and is usually priced slightly higher than middle bacon. Both varieties are usually available with the rind removed.|$|R
50|$|Back bacon is {{a cut of}} cured bacon sliced {{to include}} both the pork loin from the back {{and a bit of}} pork belly in the same cut. It is much leaner than American style <b>side</b> <b>bacon</b> made only from the pork belly. Back bacon is derived from the same cut used for pork chops. It is the most common cut in Britain and Ireland, where both smoked and unsmoked {{varieties}} are sold.|$|R
50|$|Palt and kams {{is usually}} filled with diced, unsmoked bacon. However, {{sometimes}} fried bacon is {{served on the}} side of unfilled palt or kams, which then is known as flatpalt or flatkams, as the lack of filling makes it flatter. The most well-known palt variant is the Pitepalt from Piteå. In Dalarna, where the dish is known as klabbe, it is still made without potatoes and is never filled. Klabbe is instead served with diced <b>bacon</b> on the <b>side.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The most {{distinct}} pizza in Canada is the [...] "Canadian" [...] pizza. A “Canadian” pizza {{is usually}} prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, {{but the two}} standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with [...] "Canadian bacon", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, <b>side</b> <b>bacon</b> is the standard pork topping on pizza.|$|R
60|$|But this {{is merely}} {{to explain why}} Bud Oakley and I gladly {{stretched}} ourselves {{on the bank of}} the nearby charco after the dipping, glad for the welcome inanition and pure contact with the earth after our muscle-racking labours. The flock was a small one, and we finished at three in the afternoon; so Bud brought from the morral on his saddle horn, coffee and a coffeepot and a big hunk of bread and some <b>side</b> <b>bacon.</b> Mr. Mills, the ranch owner and my old friend, rode away to the ranch with his force of Mexican trabajadores.|$|R
5000|$|When the 3rd Platoon {{lost its}} leader, Bacon took command of that platoon {{as well and}} led both platoons against the {{remaining}} enemy positions. During the evacuation of the wounded, <b>Bacon</b> climbed the <b>side</b> of a nearby tank to gain a vantage point and direct fire into enemy positions, despite his exposure to enemy fire. [...] "I got my boot heel shot off, I got holes in my canteens, I got my rifle grip shot up," [...] he recalled in [...] "Beyond Glory," [...] a 2003 book by Larry Smith of history interviews with Medal of Honor recipients. [...] "I got shrapnel holes in my camouflage covers, and bullets in my pot. A bullet creased the edge of it, tore the lining off." [...] He was personally credited with killing at least 4 enemy soldiers and destroying an antitank gun.|$|R
5000|$|After Gatch's {{death in}} 1968, Driggs {{returned}} to New York City. Over {{the next two}} decades, she experimented with mixed media constructions and figurative paintings in pastels and oils. The rise of feminist art history brought her renewed attention, {{and she was the}} subject of a one-woman show at the Martin Diamond Gallery in 1980 and a retrospective at the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton in 1990. Curated by Thomas Folk, the retrospective exhibition, titled [...] "Elsie Driggs, A Woman of Genius," [...] traveled to the Phillips Collection in Washington DC. And Driggs created two final oil paintings in her Precissionist style, [...] "The Javits Center" [...] in 1986 (private collection) and [...] "Hoboken" [...] of the same year (private collection). She was included in many historical surveys of Precisionism. She continued to follow the contemporary art scene, admiring in particular the work of Helen Frankenthaler and Francis <b>Bacon.</b> She also <b>sided</b> with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe during his controversy at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington DC. At the time of her death in 1992 at the age of ninety-four, Driggs was considered the most underrated as well as the most long-lived of the Precisionist painters. Thomas Folk, organized a memorial service and symposium which was held at the Whitney Museum of American Art on August 25, 2002. [...] "Pittsburgh" [...] was proudly displayed on the rear wall of the auditorium.|$|R
500|$|Another {{controversy}} surrounding {{the dress was}} the question of its originality. Brooks Barnes of The New York Times wrote that the dress was [...] "derived" [...] from Incarnation, {{a painting of a}} white-haired girl wearing a meat dress by artist Mark Ryden. Sharon Clott of MTV also noted the similarity between Gaga's dress and Ryden's painting. Ryden was reportedly upset that Gaga did not acknowledge that she took inspiration from his work. Some in the art and fashion press remarked on the dress' similarity to , a meat dress made by Canadian sculptor Jana Sterbak in 1987 exhibited to considerable controversy at the National Gallery of Canada in 1991. Karen Rosenberg from The New York Times compared the dress to a series of photographs of Francis <b>Bacon</b> posing with <b>sides</b> of beef attached to his torso like wings in 1952, while The Daily Telegraph compared the dress to the original cover of The Beatles' 1966 album Yesterday and Today, and noted its similarity to the cover of the November 1983 The Undertones album All Wrapped Up, which showed a female model wearing a dress and gloves made of cuts of meat (mostly bacon) held in place with plastic wrap and a sausage necklace. Architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro had also designed a meat dress in 2006. An earlier example of a garment made from meat stitched together {{in the same way as}} the Lady Gaga meat dress was worn at the Slade School of Art postgraduate degree exhibition opening in London, England in July 1979, when performance artist Robert Connolly wore a two-piece suit made of slices of salami.|$|R
