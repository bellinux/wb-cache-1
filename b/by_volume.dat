5|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, the {{concentration}} of helium <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> is only 5.2 parts per million. The concentration is low and fairly constant despite the continuous production of new helium because most helium in the Earth's atmosphere escapes into space by several processes.

5|$|Neon {{comprises}} 1 part in 55,000 in the Earth's atmosphere, or 18.2 ppm <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> (this {{is about}} the same as the molecule or mole fraction), or 1 part in 79,000 of air by mass.

5|$|On Earth it is {{relatively}} rare—5.2 ppm <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> in the atmosphere. Most terrestrial helium present today is created by the natural radioactive decay of heavy radioactive elements (thorium and uranium, although there are other examples), as the alpha particles emitted by such decays consist of helium-4 nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations as great as 7% <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation. Previously, terrestrial helium—a non-renewable resource, because once released into the atmosphere it readily escapes into space—was thought to be in increasingly short supply. However, recent studies suggest that helium produced deep in the earth by radioactive decay can collect in natural gas reserves in larger than expected quantities, in some cases having been released by volcanic activity.|$|E

5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2).

Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent smell. In addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E

5|$|After an oil {{drilling}} operation in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{distributed}} in bottles and cans {{and is also}} commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above.

5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol <b>by</b> <b>volume</b> (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall {{in the range of}} 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as table beer are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450°C, it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55g·cm−3 {{is the lowest}} in its group, with others decreasing towards it. Calcium can be cut with a knife with effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium <b>by</b> <b>volume,</b> it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is infeasible for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E
