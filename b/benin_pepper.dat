It is a close {{relative}} of cubeb pepper and a relative of black pepper and long pepper. Unlike cubeb pepper, which is large and spherical in shape, Ashanti peppers are prolate spheroids, smaller and smoother than Cubeb pepper in appearance and generally bear a reddish tinge. The stalks of Ashanti pepper berries are also distinctly curved whilst those of cubeb pepper are completely straight.|$|E

However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, <b>Benin</b> mainly exported <b>pepper,</b> ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.|$|R
