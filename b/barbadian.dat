5|$|A {{number of}} holidays, festivals and other {{celebrations}} play an integral role in <b>Barbadian</b> folk, and popular, music. Whitsuntide, Christmas, and Easter are important, each {{associated with their}} own musical traditions, as are distinctly <b>Barbadian</b> festivities like the crop over festival and the Landship movement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barbadian</b> {{culture and}} music are {{mixtures}} of European and African elements, with minimal influence from {{the indigenous peoples}} of the island, about whom little is known. Significant numbers of Asian, specifically Chinese and Japanese, people have moved to Barbados, but their music is unstudied and has had little impact on <b>Barbadian</b> music.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1930s, <b>Barbadian</b> calypso {{was called}} banja, and was {{performed}} by laborers in village-tenantry areas. Itinerant minstrels like Mighty Jerry, Shilling Agard and Slammer were well-known forerunners of modern <b>Barbadian</b> calypso. Their song tradition embraced sentimentality, humor, and opinionated lyrics that continued to the 1960s, often by then accompanied by guitar or banjo.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>Barbadians</b> {{now live}} {{overseas}} {{and outside of}} Barbados; the majority have migrated to Anglophone countries, including 34,340 <b>Barbadians</b> in Canada, some 19,000 in the United Kingdom, around 65,000 in the United States and some 500-1,000 <b>Barbadians</b> in Liberia. In addition to Anglophone countries other groups of <b>Barbadians</b> have moved to Latin countries including: Brazil, Cuba and Panama.|$|R
25|$|The {{government}} has also {{toyed with the}} idea of making retirement savings as tax exempt, to encourage <b>Barbadians</b> to spend less on goods and to encourage <b>Barbadians</b> to save more income as they once used to.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} the 1670s, <b>Barbadians</b> have contributed to American government. Many {{prominent}} <b>Barbadians</b> immigrated to Carolina during that decade, among them was Sir John Yeamans, who became governor of the colony that is known today as South Carolina.|$|R
5|$|String {{and wind}} {{instruments}} {{play an important}} role in <b>Barbadian</b> folk culture, especially the bow-fiddle, banjo and acoustic guitar; more modern groups also use an electric and bass guitar. The shukster is a distinctive instrument, made by stretching a guitar string between two sides of a house. Traditional <b>Barbadian</b> wind instruments are largely metal, but in their folk origins, were made out of locally found materials. <b>Barbadian</b> villagers burned fingerholes, for example, on bamboo tubes, made trumpets out of conch shells and pipes from pumpkin vines. Many modern groups use harmonica, accordion, alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet and trombone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barbadian</b> folk dances {{include a}} wide variety of styles, {{performed}} at Landship, holidays and other occasions. Dancers and other performers at the crop over festivals, for example, are popular and an iconic part of <b>Barbadian</b> culture, known for dancing in the costumes of sugarcane-cutters. The Landship movement features song and dance meant to imitate the passage of a British navy ship through rough seas; Landship and other occasions also feature African-derived improvised and complexly-rhythmic dances, and British hornpipes, jigs, maypole dances and Marches.|$|E
5|$|<b>Barbadian</b> {{traditional}} {{folk songs}} are {{heavily influenced by}} the music of England. Many traditional songs concern events current {{at the time of}} their composition, such as the emancipation of the slaves of Barbados, and the coronations of Victoria, George V, and Elizabeth II; this song tradition dates back to 1650. The most influential <b>Barbadian</b> folk songs are associated with the island's lower-class laborers, who have held on to their folk heritage.|$|E
50|$|Recent polls {{conducted}} by Caribbean Development Research Services Inc. (CADRES) have found <b>Barbadians</b> {{to be more}} tolerant than previous years. In a 2016 poll {{conducted by}} the Caribbean Development Research Services (CADRES), 67% of <b>Barbadians</b> described themselves as tolerant of the LGBT community. Another 82% also opposed discrimination against the LGBT community.|$|R
50|$|More {{recently}} the Guyanese Government has extended {{an offer to}} <b>Barbadians.</b> The Guyanese government has offered {{to put in place}} an economically favourable regime towards any <b>Barbadians</b> that wish to relocate to Guyana and contribute towards that nation's goals in agricultural investment. The announcement was made {{in the final days of}} the Owen Arthur administration by MP member Mia Motley.|$|R

5|$|By the 19th century, the <b>Barbadian</b> colonialists grew to fear slave revolts, and specifically, the use {{of music}} {{as a tool of}} {{communication}} and planning for revolution. As a result, the government passed laws to restrict musical activities among slaves. At the same time, American and other forms of imported music were brought to Barbados, while many important elements of modern <b>Barbadian</b> music, like tuk bands, also emerged. In the 20th century, many new styles were imported to Barbados, most influentially including jazz, ska, reggae, calypso and soca. Barbados became home to many performers of these new genres, especially soca and calypso, while the island also produced an indigenous style called spouge, which became an important symbol of <b>Barbadian</b> identity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, <b>Barbadian</b> calypso grew in {{popularity}} and stature, led by Viper, Mighty Gabby and The Merrymen. The first calypso competitions {{were held in}} 1960, and they quickly grew larger and more prominent. The Merrymen became the island's most prominent contribution to calypso by the 1970s and into the 80s. Their style, known as blue beat, incorporated <b>Barbadian</b> folk songs and ballads, as well as American blues, country music, and a distinctive sound created by harmonica, guitar and banjo.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{study of}} <b>Barbadian</b> music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably have brought with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in <b>Barbadian</b> culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>Barbadians</b> are Christian (whether {{practicing}} or otherwise). The Rastafari movement {{also has}} its community of adherents.|$|R

5|$|Bonnet's initial cruise {{took him}} to the coast of the Colony of Virginia, near the {{entrance}} of the Chesapeake Bay, where he captured and plundered four vessels, and burned the <b>Barbadian</b> ship Turbet to keep news of his crimes from his home island. He then sailed north to New York City, taking two more ships, and picking up naval supplies and releasing captives at Gardiners Island. By August 1717, Bonnet had returned to the Carolinas, where he attacked two more ships, a brigantine from Boston and a <b>Barbadian</b> sloop. He stripped the brigantine, but brought the cargo-filled <b>Barbadian</b> sloop to an inlet off North Carolina to use for careening and repairing the Revenge. After the <b>Barbadian</b> sloop's tackle was used to careen the Revenge, the ship was dismantled for timber, and the remains were then burned. In September 1717, Bonnet set course for Nassau, which was then an infamous pirate den on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas. En route, he encountered, fought, and escaped from a Spanish man of war. The Revenge was badly damaged, Bonnet was seriously wounded, and half the crew of the sloop was killed or wounded in the encounter. Putting in at Nassau, Bonnet replaced his casualties and refitted the Revenge, increasing the sloop's armament to twelve guns.|$|E
5|$|Spouge is a {{style of}} <b>Barbadian</b> popular music created by Jackie Opel in the 1960s. It is {{primarily}} a fusion of Jamaican ska with Trinidadian calypso, but is also influenced by {{a wide variety of}} musics from the British Isles and United States, include sea shanties, hymns and spirituals. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of cowbell, bass guitar, trap set and various other electronic and percussion instruments, later augmented by saxophone, trombone and trumpets. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are widely seen as the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of <b>Barbadian</b> music.|$|E
5|$|The mid-20th century {{brought new}} forms of music from Trinidad, Brazil, the United States, Cuba and the Dominican Republic to Barbados, and the <b>Barbadian</b> calypso style came {{to be viewed as}} lowbrow or inferior. Promoters like Lord Silvers and Mighty Dragon, however, kept the popular {{tradition}} alive through shows at the Globe Theatre, featuring pioneers Mighty Romeo, Sir Don Marshall, Lord Radio and the Bimshire Boys and Mike Wilkinson. These performers {{set the stage for the}} development of popular <b>Barbadian</b> calypso in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Though Western {{classical}} and other musics {{play an important}} role in Anglican church services on Barbados, religion and folk music are closely intertwined in the everyday lives of most <b>Barbadians.</b> The basis for religious folk music is the Anglican hymn, a kind of praise song mostly sung on Sundays, a day when Christian <b>Barbadians</b> come together with family members to sing and praise God to ask for strength for the next week's work.|$|R

5000|$|Historically {{migration}} from Barbados to the UK was fairly simple, since many <b>Barbadians</b> once held overseas British citizenship (see: Barbados and British nationality), {{but the number}} of <b>Barbadians</b> migrating to the UK increased after the 1952 McCarran Act put [...] "severe curbs" [...] on Caribbean immigration to the nearby United States. In 1955, the Barbados government established a Sponsored Workers Scheme and appointed an officer in London to help find work for <b>Barbadians</b> in the UK, due to the perception that population pressure was too great in Barbados. Between 1955 and 1966, more than 27,000 <b>Barbadians</b> migrated to the UK. This represented the largest mass {{migration from}} the Caribbean island since 45,000 people emigrated to Panama in the 1900s and 1910s, and was part of a wider migration of people from the Caribbean to the UK which saw 550,000 people migrate between 1948 and 1973, with the majority doing so before the passing of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962. They were recruited to fill labour shortages in the UK in sectors such as transport and healthcare. Migration from Barbados to the UK between 1951 and 1971 represented 12 per cent of the population of Barbados.|$|R
