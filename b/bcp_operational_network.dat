40|$|Do {{you know}} what the impact of your Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) {{deployment}} is to the <b>operational</b> <b>network?</b> During deployment, the network requirements for the application are discovered. Deploying functions directly to the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> forces the network technicians to quickly adapt the network to these requirements. Since this is not optimal, we need an improved process. A way of improving this process is to use a test network that simulates the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> although a better solution would be to extract network requirements and verify the requirements using the test network. The test <b>network</b> reduces <b>operational</b> impact by removing the development of the requirement from the <b>operational</b> <b>network.</b> To enhance this process farther would require that the network requirements be extracted during development. This process would use a common language between the developers and network technicians that capture the network requirement. The test network would then be used to verify the requirement of the new function before it is deployed to the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> and reduce the impact to operations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper {{seeks to}} explore the {{question}} of how to investigate the contribution of the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> (comprising sales service, logistics, planning, production, etc.) to operational performance. In doing so, the paper aims to link concepts from organisational and social psychology to production planning and control. Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces the concept "operational network", e. g. the network of people involved in customer and production order processing. Members of the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> need some autonomy, but this autonomy may also lead to dysfunctional behaviour, due to conflicts of interest, ambiguities and individual preferences. The contribution of the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> seems difficult to investigate. This is illustrated by an empirical study of the role of operational people in a semi-process industry. This study shows that concepts of organisational psychology are very applicable here. However, most results relate perceived behaviour to perceived performance; it appeared to be difficult to relate actual organisation characteristics to actual performance. This paper discusses the research approach that is necessary to be able to fill the gap between "perceived" and "actual". Findings - To fill the gap between "perceived" and "actual" behaviour, it is necessary to formalize the behaviour of the members of the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> by adopting an adequate planning and control framework. In most situations such a planning and control framework is not available. Therefore, a study of the role of the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> needs to be accompanied by a participative design of the planning and control framework. Originality/value - This paper conducts a convincing investigation into the contribution of the <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> to <b>operational</b> performance, a subject which hitherto has been only marginally addressed...|$|R

30|$|Water Distribution Networks (WDN) {{are complex}} and highly {{interconnected}} systems. To maintain operation under failure conditions, WDNs should have built-in resilience based on topological and energy redundancy. There are various methods for analysing the resilience of WDNs based on either hydraulic models or surrogate network measures; however, not a single universally accepted method exists. Hydraulic modeling of disruptive operational scenarios suffer from combinatorial restrictions and uncertainties. Methods that rely on surrogate network measures do {{not take into account}} the complex interactions between topological and energy redundancy. To bridge this gap, the presented work introduces a hydraulically informed surrogate measure of pipe criticality for the resilience analysis of WDNs, called Water Flow Edge Betweenness Centrality (WFEBC). The WFEBC combines the random walk betweenness centrality with hydraulic (energy) loss principles in pipes. The proposed network resilience estimation method is applied to a case study <b>network</b> and an <b>operational</b> <b>network.</b> Furthermore, a network decomposition approach is proposed to complement the network estimation method and facilitate its scalability to large <b>operational</b> <b>networks.</b> The described resilience analysis method is benchmarked against a hydraulic model-based analysis of WDN reserve capacity. WFEBC is also applied to assess the improvement in resilience allowed by the implementation of a dynamically adaptive topology in an <b>operational</b> <b>network.</b> The benefits and limitations of the proposed method are discussed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Fast reroute (FRR) {{techniques}} {{have been designed}} and standardised in recent years for supporting sub- 50 millisecond failure recovery in <b>operational</b> ISP <b>networks.</b> On the other hand, if the provisioning of FRR protection paths {{does not take into}} account traffic engineering (TE) requirements, customer traffic may still get disrupted due to post-failure traffic congestion. Such a situation could be more severe in <b>operational</b> <b>networks</b> with highly dynamic traffic patterns. In this paper we propose a distributed technique that enables adaptive control of FRR protection paths against dynamic traffic conditions, resulting in self-optimisation in addition to the self-healing capability. Our approach is based on the Loop-free Alternates (LFA) mechanism that allows non-deterministic provisioning of protection paths. The idea is for repairing routers to periodically re-compute LFA alternative next-hops using a lightweight algorithm for achieving and maintaining optimised post-failure traffic distribution in dynamic network environments. Our experiments based on a real <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> topology and traffic traces across 24 hours have shown that such an approach is able to significantly enhance relevant network performance compared to both TE-agnostic and static TE-aware FRR solutions.

The proposed analytical framework includes a network skeletonisation step, {{in the form of}} a forest-core decomposition of a network, in order to facilitate the application of the proposed resilience estimation to large scale <b>operational</b> <b>networks.</b> The surrogate measure is benchmarked against a traditional hydraulic analysis.

It is applied to compare the resilience of a sectorised <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> (single-feed DMAs) to the resilience of the same network following the implementation of a dynamically adaptive topology (multi-feed DMAs). Finally, a summary of the results is presented together with suggestions about the applicability and improvements of the proposed method.|$|R

This Knowledge Delivery Service mediates <b>operational</b> <b>network</b> knowledge in an open, ontological form, thereby promoting the graceful evolution of network management applications from contemporary to fully autonomic. To cope with the inevitable heterogeneity of knowledge across the population of network nodes, the service provides a level of semantic interoperability that will be transparent to the nodes providing and consuming knowledge. The Service will be based on content-based networking principles. This paper describes work towards supporting semantic interoperability in such a Knowledge Delivery Service. 1...|$|R
