25|$|A {{variation}} on tweening {{is used by}} a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power stroker. This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a <b>big</b> <b>hook,</b> but uses the timing of a stroker. It {{can also be used}} to describe a stroker with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a stroker).|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Passenger" [...] {{was hailed}} {{as one of the}} songs on Internationalist to come close to [...] "the big FM radio hits of Double Allergic", {{according}} to lead singer Bernard Fanning. [...] Not that it mattered to him - he still believed Internationalist was a better record, but was probably not as [...] "likable" [...] as its predecessor. [...] Juice's Simon Wooldridge agreed with Fanning, stating that [...] "Passenger" [...] "demonstrated their flair for the <b>big</b> <b>hook</b> was no longer being suppressed". On 2 August 2007, Australian television station Max published the Top 500 90s Songs, placing [...] "Passenger" [...] as the only Powderfinger song in the top 100, at #48, just ahead of Fatboy Slim's [...] "Praise You".|$|E

60|$|There was no bucket {{at the end}} of the {{windlass}} chain, {{but there}} was a <b>big</b> <b>hook</b> that at one time was used to hold a bucket. Shaggy let down this hook, dragged it around on the bottom and then pulled it up. An old hoopskirt came with it, and Betsy laughed and threw it away. The thing frightened Hank, who had never seen a hoopskirt before, and he kept a good distance away from it.|$|E
60|$|We got in {{position}} {{and headed for}} the school. I was using a <b>big</b> <b>hook</b> half embedded near the tail of the flying-fish and the leader ran through the bait. It worked beautifully. A little jerk of my rod sent the bait skittering over the water, {{for all the world like}} a live flying-fish. I knew now that I would get another strike. Just as we reached a point almost opposite the school of tuna they headed across our bow, so that it seemed inevitable we must either run them down or run too close. My spirit sank to zero. Something presaged bad luck. I sensed disaster. I fought the feeling, but it persisted. Captain Dan swore. My brother shouted warnings from over us where he sat on top. But we ran right into the leaders. The school sank. I was sick and furious.|$|E
50|$|Beneath {{continued}} {{on the path}} Amoral started with ”Show Your Colors”. The emphasis is still on solid songwriting, <b>big</b> <b>hooks,</b> new arrangements and guitar riffs, but the scale is wider than before: From 9-minute epics ”Beneath” to straightforward rock songs ”Silhouette” and ”Same Difference”, to nods to the band's death metal past ”(Won't Go) Home” and ”Staying Human” and talks between acoustic guitars and industrial landscapes in ”Wastelands”.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a lengthy}} essay {{regarding}} {{the concept and}} construction of All Across This Land, the official Blitzen Trapper site compared the album to earlier albums like Furr and American Goldwing: [...] "All Across This Land is a top-down, tightly defined piece of classic rock and roll, full of <b>big</b> riffs, <b>bigger</b> <b>hooks</b> and compelling, instantly relatable lyrics ...

6000|$|That {{meant the}} boys would bait with {{selected}} offal of the cod as the fish were cleaned--an improvement on paddling barehanded in the little bait-barrels below. The tubs were full of neatly coiled line carrying a <b>big</b> <b>hook</b> each few feet; and the testing and baiting of every single hook, with the stowage of the baited line so that it should run clear when shot from the dory, was a scientific business. Dan managed it in the dark without looking, while Harvey caught {{his fingers on the}} barbs and bewailed his fate. But the hooks flew through Dan's fingers like tatting on an old maid's lap. [...] "I helped bait up trawl ashore 'fore I could well walk," [...] he said. [...] "But it's a putterin' job all the same. Oh, dad!" [...] This shouted towards the hatch, where Disko and Tom Platt were salting. [...] "How many skates you reckon we'll need?" ...|$|E
60|$|First, we {{took off}} our shoes and stockings, and rolled up our trousers, so as to wade out in the shallow water. We each had a long line, one end of which we tied around our waists. Menendez had his tied to a button-hole of his coat, but {{he thought he had}} better make our lines very safe, as they belonged to him. There was a <b>big</b> <b>hook</b> and a heavy lead {{to the other end of}} the line, with a piece of fish for bait, and we swung the lead around our heads, and threw it out into the surf as far as we could. I thought I was pretty good on the throw, but I couldn't begin to send my line out as far as Menendez threw his. As for Rectus, he didn't pretend to do much in the {{throwing}} business. He whirled his line around in such a curious way that I was very much afraid he would hook himself in the ear. But Menendez put his line out for him. He didn't want me to do it.|$|E

"I have heard, sir, that in Africa {{the natives}} bait a <b>big</b> <b>hook</b> with {{a lump of}} pork, or {{something}} of that sort; then, when an alligator has swallowed it, they haul him up, holus bolus. I should say a good plan to kill them would be with 'tricity. The last ship I was in, we had {{an officer of the}} Marine Artillery who knew about such things, and he put a big cartridge into a lump of pork, with two wires, {{and as soon as the}} shark had swallowed it he would touch a spring or something, and there would be an explosion. There was not as much fun in it as having a hook, but it was quicker, and he did not do it for sport, but because he hated the sharks. I heard say that he had had a young brother killed by one of them. He would sit there on the taffrail for hours on the lookout for them, with three or four loaded lumps of pork. Why, I have known him kill as many as a dozen in a day. I expect the best part of his pay must have gone in dynamite.|$|E
50|$|Jewish {{people are}} {{sometimes}} stereotyped in media as cheap and greedy, with exaggerated Semitic physical {{features such as}} <b>big,</b> <b>hooked</b> noses, <b>big</b> lips, small eyes, black curly hair, and olive and/or brown-colored skin.

50|$|Delancey is bitter, {{but he does}} receive {{command of}} a fireship. He makes the most of this, by researching the history of fireships. Fire was a very serious danger aboard sailing ships. Their upper works could be bone dry, and very highly {{flammable}} materials, like pitch, were used in their construction. Fireships were ships intended to be sailed against enemy fleets at anchor, loaded with incendiaries. <b>Big</b> <b>hooks</b> are hung from her upper works, to entangle with the enemies ship's rigging.

For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called <b>big</b> <b>hooks),</b> {{the first and last}} third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent.

5000|$|Max Cavalera {{commented on}} the Roadrunner website about this song, [...] "I'm excited to open the record with a fast song.
