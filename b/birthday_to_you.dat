He was developing {{a series of}} cartoon commercials in 2008 for Pontiac Vibe starring George Liquor and Jimmy The Idiot Boy, but the series remained unreleased after General Motors discontinued the Pontiac Vibe auto line in 2009.

Also in 2012, he funded through Kickstarter a cartoon short entitled [...] "Cans Without Labels" [...] starring the character George Liquor, with the initial delivery date of February 2013. The cartoon was due to be screened at the 2016 Annecy International Animated Film Festival for the first time, however {{at the last minute}} it was announced that it wasn't ready. However, on August 6, 2017, the Kickstarter has been updated finally announcing the film's completion.

He posted the concepts for these projects on his blog. He partnered with animator Mike Judge to produce a series of shorts for UFC that aired on Adult Swim throughout 2016.|$|E

5000|$|Your {{friendly}} enquiry {{about the}} age of the celebrant elicits the reply that she is celebrating her (tp = [...] ) 50th <b>birthday.</b> According <b>to</b> Gott, <b>you</b> can predict with 95% confidence that the woman will survive between 50/39 = 1.28 years and 39&times;50 = 1,950 years into the future. Since the wide range encompasses reasonable expectations regarding the woman's survival, it might not seem so bad, till one realizes that rule predicts that with probability 1/2 the woman will survive beyond 100 years old and with probability 1/3 beyond 150. Few of us would want to bet on the woman's survival using Gott's rule. (See Caves' online paper below.) ...|$|R

2500|$|The American {{copyright}} {{status of}} [...] "Happy <b>Birthday</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] began to draw more attention {{with the passage}} of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act in 1998. When the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Act in Eldred v. Ashcroft in 2003, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer specifically mentioned [...] "Happy <b>Birthday</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] in his dissenting opinion. American law professor Robert Brauneis, who extensively researched the song, concluded in 2010 that [...] "It is almost certainly no longer under copyright." [...] In 2013, based in large part on Brauneis's research, Good Morning <b>to</b> <b>You</b> Productions, a company producing a documentary about [...] "Good Morning to All", sued Warner/Chappell for falsely claiming copyright to the song. In September 2015, a federal judge declared that the Warner/Chappell copyright claim was invalid, ruling that the copyright registration applied only to a specific piano arrangement of the song, and not to its lyrics and melody. In 2016, Warner/Chappell settled for US $14 million, and the court declared that [...] "Happy <b>Birthday</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] was in the public domain.|$|R

40|$|Transcription begins] At Sea 6 October 1944 Hello Sweetheart, If {{you were}} here, you’d tell me “Happy Birthday” and I would {{modestly}} reply “Thank you, darling may we {{spend the rest}} of them together. ” I think there is no more opportune time than on a <b>birthday</b> <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> that I have spent the happiest days of my life with you. Sweets, I never expected to find such marital happiness as I have experienced being married <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> The ocean continues to be calm even the swells (waves) have decreased in size since we left the Gulf stream. The temperature has become much cooler which makes a jacket or coat a necessity on deck. This morning we saw a school of sharks in the ocean. The other day we saw some porpoises playing in the ocean. They are strange little creatures spouting water into the air. Where the exact destination is we no [sic] not. Rumors fly around here fast and furious. I don’t know how long you’re {{going to have to wait}} for my letters but I shall get them <b>to</b> <b>you</b> as fast as the mails will carry them. Almost every night I take a hot salt water bath—not because I particularly desire salt water but it’s all they can spare. It’s quite a job getting a lather in the stuff. They have a salt water soap for sale but it isn’t worth a damn. The individual that discovers a good salt water soap should make a fortune. Wonder girl, do you see the folks now and then? Another thing, you’re allotment is supposed to be increased to $ 150. 00 beginning Oct. 1, 1944. Write me if there are any irregularities with the above. You tell me that you purchased a camera for me. Sweets, I presume that film will be difficult to purchase nevertheless, send me as much film as you can as I should like <b>to</b> send <b>you</b> as many snaps as I can. The food continues to be good and the service excellent. Last night we had roast chicken which really doesn’t compare <b>to</b> the way <b>you</b> make chicken but was delicious nevertheless. Every meal (2) has fish as one of its courses. In the morning we have smoked herring or kippers, and in the evening cod, sole, halibut, etc. It’s a good thing I’m a fish eater or I’d be “hurtin’. ” Darling, I’m one who has always looked to see that my adorable wife is enjoying herself and am not of a different opinion now. Tell me of the new people you have met and the new events that have occurred. I love you and idolize you. Me— Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
