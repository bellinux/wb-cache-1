That hardy and undaunted veteran refused to shirk his {{share in the}} scene merely because the minority was recalcitrant and {{the majority}} perhaps subject to stage fright. When Mr Samuel had informed me that the Committee had no further questions to ask me with an urbanity which gave the public no clue as to the temper of the majority; when I had jumped up with the proper air of relief and gratitude; when the secretary had handed me his little packet of books with an affability which effectually concealed his dramatic function as executioner; when the audience was simply disappointed at being baulked of the entertainment of hearing Mr Robert Harcourt cross-examine me; in short, when the situation was all but saved by the tact of the Chairman and secretary, Colonel Lockwood rose, with all his carnations blazing, and gave away the whole case by handing me, with impressive simplicity and <b>courtesy,</b> his TWO <b>copies</b> of the precious statement.

40|$|Combined petrographic, {{structural}} and geochronological {{study of the}} Malashan dome, one of the North Himalayan gneiss domes, reveals that it is cored by a Miocene granite, the Malashan granite, that intruded into the Jurassic sedimentary rocks of Tethys Himalaya. Two other granites {{in the area are}} referred to as the Paiku and Cuobu granites. New zircon SHRIMP U-Pb and muscovite and biotite 40 Ar- 39 Ar dating show that the Paiku granite was emplaced during 22. 2 – 16. 2 Ma (average 19. 3 ± 3. 9 Ma) and cooled rapidly to 350 – 400 °C at around 15. 9 Ma. Whole-rock granite chemistry suggests the original granitic magma may have formed by muscovite dehydration melting of a protolith chemically similar to the High Himalayan Crystalline Sequence. Abundant calcareous metasedimentary rocks and minor garnet-staurolite-biotite-muscovite ± andalusite schists record contact metamorphism by three granites that intruded intermittently into the Jurassic sediments between 18. 5 and 15. 3 Ma. Two stages of widespread penetrative ductile deformation, D 1 and D 2, can be defined. Microstructural studies of metapelites combined with geothermobarometry and pseudosection analyses yield P–T conditions of 4. 8 ± 0. 8 kbar at 550 ± 50 °C during a non-deformational stage between D 1 and D 2, and 3. 1 – 4. 1 kbar at 530 – 575 °C during syn- to post-D 2. The pressure estimates for the syn- to post-D 2 growth of andalusite suggest relatively shallow (depth of ∼ 15. 2 km) extensional ductile deformation that took place within a shear zone of the South Tibetan Detachment System. Close temporal association between intrusion of the Malashan granite and onset of D 2 suggests extension may have been triggered by the intrusion of the Malashan granite.
