5|$|During {{the great}} housing <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1930s, Giffnock {{began to grow}} rapidly. Between 1930 and 1940, as many as 3,000 {{dwellings}} were constructed, and the population rose dramatically, from 1,425 to 3,471 in 1939 and 9,144 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Clinton's November 2000 {{visit to}} Vietnam {{was the first}} by a U.S. {{president}} {{since the end of}} the Vietnam War. On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to People's Republic of China. The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform. Clinton also oversaw a <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. economy. Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969.|$|E
5|$|Since the Second World War, {{unemployment}} in Crawley has been low: the rate was 1.47% of the working-age population in 2003. During the <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s the town boasted {{the lowest level}} of {{unemployment in}} the UK. Continuous growth and investment have made Crawley {{one of the most important}} business and employment centres in the South East England region.|$|E

50|$|Historically, {{the dot-com}} boom {{can be seen}} as similar to a number <b>of</b> other technology-inspired <b>booms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past {{including}} railroads in the 1840s, automobiles in the early 20th century, radio in the 1920s, television in the 1940s, transistor electronics in the 1950s, computer time-sharing in the 1960s, and home computers and biotechnology in the 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Some unusual {{features}} of the Chinese vampire include its long, curved fingernails, perhaps derived from the appearance of growing fingernails on corpses due to flesh recession, and its greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The copper mines prospered {{for about}} seventy years, {{but by the}} early 17th century the {{industry}} was in decline. Demand for copper fell {{and the cost of}} extracting it was high. Graphite mining continued, and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance. Other small-scale industries grew up, such as tannery and weaving. Although the <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-16th century had finished, the town's economy did not slide into ruin, and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1,000.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.|$|E

50|$|CMC {{is widely}} {{discussed}} in language learning because CMC provides opportunities for language learners {{to practice their}} language. For example, Warschauer conducted several case studies on using email or discussion boards in different language classes. Warschauer claimed that information and communications technology “bridge the historic divide between speech...and writing”. Thus, considerable concern has arisen over the reading and writing research in L2 due to <b>the</b> <b>booming</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet.|$|R
5|$|The pre-Code horror cycle was {{motivated}} by financial necessity. Universal in particular buoyed itself with the production of horror hits such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein, then followed those successes up with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Mummy (1932), and The Old Dark House (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions. Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horror cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off {{at the box office}} {{by the end of the}} pre-Code era.|$|E
5|$|Tinker {{ended his}} {{involvement}} in professional baseball, focusing instead on his real estate ventures during the Florida land <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. He developed a successful real estate firm, buying and selling land in Orange County and Seminole County. He purchased the Longwood Hotel, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1926. Tinker convinced Reds owner Garry Herrmann to use his stadium in Orlando for their spring training site in 1923.|$|E

With <b>the</b> abolition <b>of</b> prostitution in Singapore in 1920, these trades replaced the brothel [...] "business" [...] and sustained the community that by then had its own newspaper, Nanyo Shimpo (1908), a cemetery (1911), a school (1912) and a clubhouse (1917).|$|R
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} growth that began in Indiana during the gas <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E
5|$|During the oil <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and {{the huge}} oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Fort Lauderdale's {{first major}} {{development}} {{began in the}} 1920s, during the Florida land <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 white men proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) {{indicated}} {{it wanted to}} consolidate its offices spread out across Philadelphia into one office building. In May 1988, Conrail solicited proposals from developers for a building to house its corporate headquarters. On March 30, 1990, after being sought after by numerous developers in Philadelphia and its suburbs, Conrail {{announced that it would}} be leasing 27 floors of Two Commerce Square. With a lead tenant secured, construction of the identical tower commenced in July 1990. Two Commerce Square was completed in July 1992 and Conrail began moving in approximately 3,000 employees in September of that year. Two Commerce Square marked the end of the skyscraper <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, being the last office skyscraper to be built in Philadelphia until the Cira Centre in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s the {{downtown}} area experienced a resurgence, {{with a level of}} construction activity not seen again until the urban real estate <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2000s. By the end of the decade, Phoenix adopted the Phoenix Concept 2000 plan which split the city into urban villages, each with its own village core where greater height and density was permitted, further shaping the free-market development culture. Originally, there were nine villages, but this has been expanded to 15 over the years (see Cityscape below). This officially turned Phoenix into a city of many nodes, which would later be connected by freeways. The Phoenix Symphony Hall opened in 1972; other major structures which saw construction downtown during this decade were the First National Bank Plaza, the Valley Center (the tallest building in the state of Arizona) and the Arizona Bank building.|$|E

Bahrain joined the United Nations and the Arab League later in the year. The oil <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1970s benefited Bahrain greatly, although the subsequent downturn hurt the economy. The country had already begun diversification of its economy and benefited further from the Lebanese Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bahrain replaced Beirut as the Middle East's financial hub after Lebanon's large banking sector was driven {{out of the country}} by the war.|$|E
5|$|The buyout of RJR Nabisco was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.|$|E
5|$|The sudden <b>boom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silk {{industry}} in the Italian state of Lucca, starting in the 11th and 12th centuries was due to much Sicilian, Jewish, and Greek settlement, alongside many other immigrants from neighbouring cities in southern Italy. With the loss of many Italian trading posts in the Orient, the import of Chinese styles drastically declined. Gaining momentum, {{in order to satisfy}} the rich and powerful bourgeoisie's demands for luxury fabrics, the cities of Lucca, Genoa, Venice and Florence were soon exporting silk to all of Europe. In 1472 there were 84 workshops and at least 7000 craftsmen in Florence alone.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the {{construction}} and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> huge number <b>of</b> ships required to build and defend the British Empire left few trees in Britain suitable for use as large spars. Eastern white pines from colonial New England were superior timber for the single-stick masts and <b>booms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day. To maintain Britain's naval and trading advantage, laws were passed in North America to protect selected white pines for British shipbuilding. British success in <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748) and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) were {{due in large part}} to <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seas by the Royal Navy.|$|R
