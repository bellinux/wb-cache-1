Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, indifferent to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it was an instant success. He had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was {{in fifth}} grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the Palestinian Authority {{had called for}} a general strike and day of {{mourning}} following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother said he had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> rioting on television {{and asked if he}} could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.|$|E

Medb, queen of Connacht, has mounted the {{invasion}} to steal the stud bull Donn Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman when he should have <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labor pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.|$|E
5|$|That season, McNichol {{scored a}} hat-trick against {{eventual}} runners-up Reading, which {{caught the eye}} of manager Ted Drake. Shortly before the next season started, he became Drake's first signing for his new club, Chelsea, at a fee of £12,000 plus the player Jimmy Leadbetter, a club record fee received for Albion. He had scored 39 goals in all competitions from 165 appearances. Although scouts from bigger clubs had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> player since soon after his arrival at the club he had apparently already turned down moves to Manchester City, Everton and Huddersfield Town Brighton's supporters were disappointed, seeing his sale as a backward step.|$|E
5|$|During March and April, U.S. {{military}} intelligence began to detect {{elements of the}} PAVN 2nd Division moving towards Khâm Đức, but their opponent's true intentions were largely unknown. In response to {{what could be a}} major attack, General William Westmoreland decided to build up the defenses of the Khâm Đức Special Forces, by sending in U.S. Army engineers to upgrade the local airstrip for sustained use by large transport aircraft, as well as airlifting weapons and ammunition for the U.S.-led Detachment A-105. Australian-led 11th Mobile Strike Force (MSF) Company was ordered to take up positions in Ngok Tavak (Ngok Ta Vak), an outpost serving Khâm Đức, to boost allied intelligence-gathering capabilities in the area. However, unbeknownst to the United States and other allied forces, the Viet Cong (VC) 1st Regiment had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> build-up around Khâm Đức for some time, and were preparing to initiate the assault by taking out Ngok Tavak.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

25|$|Pelléas arrives {{alone at}} the well. He is worried that he has become deeply {{involved}} with Mélisande and fears the consequences. He knows he must leave but first, {{he wants to see}} Mélisande one last time and tell her things he has kept to himself. Mélisande arrives. She was able to slip out without Golaud's noticing. At first she is distant but when Pelléas tells her he is going away she becomes more affectionate. After admitting his love for her, Mélisande confesses that she has loved him since she first saw him. Pelléas hears the servants shutting the castle gates for the night. Now they are locked out, but Mélisande says that it is for the better. Pelléas is resigned to fate too. After the two kiss, Mélisande hears something moving in the shadows. It is Golaud, who has <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> couple from behind a tree. Golaud strikes down a defenseless Pelléas with his sword and kills him.

500|$|The episode makes {{repeated}} {{references to}} the 1987 film Harry and the Hendersons, in which actor John Lithgow starred.

[...] to which Lithgow replies [...] "I guess someone's <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>The</b> World According to Garp", a movie that also starred Lithgow. Kenneth says that he saw a birthday party celebrated by prisoners on the television drama Oz. After seeing Becca eating baby food, Liz tells her that the baby cannot taste anything, as it gets its nutrients from its mother, to which Becca says [...] "I am going to post a reply to juno32 and tell her she's a giant ass wipe", {{a reference to the}} 2007 comedy-drama Juno in which the title character is faced with an unplanned teenage pregnancy.|$|E
500|$|Over 1,600 {{people were}} killed {{instantly}} and 9,000 were injured, more than 300 of whom later died. Every building within a [...] radius, over 12,000 in total, was destroyed or badly damaged. Hundreds {{of people who had}} <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> fire from their homes were blinded when the blast wave shattered the windows in front of them. Stoves and lamps overturned by the force of the blast sparked fires throughout Halifax, particularly in the North End, where entire city blocks were caught up in the inferno, trapping residents inside their houses. Firefighter Billy Wells, who was thrown away from the explosion and had his clothes torn from his body, described the devastation survivors faced: [...] "The sight was awful, with people hanging out of windows dead. Some with their heads missing, and some thrown onto the overhead telegraph wires." [...] He was {{the only member of the}} eight-man crew of the fire engine [...] "Patricia" [...] to survive.|$|E
500|$|When {{reflecting}} on the casting of James Pickens, Jr., Spotnitz called him [...] "another great find", adding that [...] "so {{many times over the}} course of the series we just got so lucky with the actors that we cast in these guest parts and just kept bringing them back because they were so wonderful. That's what happened with William B. Davis as the Cigarette-Smoking Man and with Nick Lea as Krycek, and with Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner, and that's what happened here with James Pickens. Just a fantastic actor, not at all like this person, really transformed himself to play this part". Spotnitz thought that, for a viewer who had weekly <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>The</b> X-Files sixth season, there was a great sense of gratification when—in the final moments of [...] "One Son"—Spender essentially withdraws and tells Kersh that Mulder has been right, all along, precisely because the last thing that Kersh wanted was for Spender to behave in this way.|$|E

500|$|The {{military}} films generated {{only enough}} revenue to cover costs, and the feature film Bambiwhich {{had been in}} production since 1937underperformed on its release in April 1942, and lost $200,000 at the box office. On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss {{the future of the}} company, the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Disneys' pictures quite closely because I knew we were lending them money far above the financial risk.... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year after.... You have to relax and give them time to market their product." [...] Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.|$|E
500|$|In New York, Michael and Dwight locate Ryan after {{discovering}} which club Ryan frequents; Ryan is {{thrilled to see}} them but appears {{to be under the}} influence of drugs though Michael and Dwight do not notice. Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan and Ryan's colleague, Troy Underbridge (Noel Petok) (who Dwight is certain is a Hobbit due to his short stature) wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they do not have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women's basketball team, who are also waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic and aggressive, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack Ryan. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks his [...] "friend Troy" [...] has a drug problem, and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a wiretap and snitching on a drug dealer. [...] He then tells the camera that he has <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>The</b> Wire but does not understand {{what is going on in}} the show.|$|E
500|$|From 1989 to 1991, Glicken {{continued}} his volcanological studies in Japan as a postdoctoral {{fellow at the}} Earthquake Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Later, while a research professor and translator at Tokyo Metropolitan University, Glicken became involved with research at Mount Unzen. The volcano had recently resumed eruptive activity in November 1990, after being dormant for 198 years. In the months after its first activity, it erupted sporadically, and the government evacuated its vicinity {{near the end of}} May 1991. On June 2, 1991, Glicken visited the mountain with Katia and Maurice Krafft. The three entered a danger zone near the base of the volcano the following day, assuming that any potentially hazardous pyroclastic flows would follow a turn in the landscape and safely bypass them. Later that day, a lava dome collapsed, sending a large flow down the valley at [...] The current reached the turn before separating into two parts, and the upper, hotter part swiftly overcame the volcanologists' post, killing them upon impact. In total, 41 or 42 people died in the incident, including press members who had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> volcanologists. The volcano burned down 390 houses, and the remains of the flow extended [...] in length. Glicken's remains were found four days later, and were cremated according to his parents' wishes. To date, Glicken and Johnston are the only American volcanologists known to have been killed by a volcanic eruption.|$|E

500|$|Several minor {{characters}} {{have been removed}} from the film version, most prominent among them the spectral History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, and Peeves the poltergeist. The book's first chapter is from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day before they are given Harry to look after, highlighting how non-magical people react to magic. The film removes this, beginning with Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys (although McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she had <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> Dursleys all day). Harry's less than pleasant times at Mrs. Figg's are cut from the film while the boa constrictor from Brazil in the zoo becomes a Burmese Python in the film. Some conflicts, such as Harry and Draco's encounter with each other in Madam Malkin's robe shop and midnight duel, are not in the film. Some of Nicolas Flamel's role is changed or cut altogether. Norbert is mentioned to have been taken away by Dumbledore in the film; whilst the book sees Harry and Hermione have to take him by hand to Charlie Weasley's friends. Rowling described the scene as [...] "the one part of the book that she felt [...] be changed". As such, the reason for the detention in the Forbidden Forest was changed: In the novel, Harry and Hermione are put in detention for being caught by Filch when leaving the Astronomy Tower after hours, Neville and Malfoy are given detention when caught in the corridor by Professor McGonagall. In the film, Harry, Hermione and Ron receive detention after Malfoy catches them in Hagrid's hut after hours (Malfoy however, is given detention for being out of bed after hours). Firenze the centaur, who is described in the book as being palomino with light blonde hair, is shown to be dark in the film. The Quidditch pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers.|$|E
