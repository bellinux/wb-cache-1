5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered. Their {{cartilaginous}} skeletons do not preserve {{well as they}} lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, one from the Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler <b>Bridge</b> <b>Formation</b> of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E
25|$|Presence of {{long-lasting}} {{bonds between}} parents and young seen in the family of this species is another attribute of obligate monogamy. Both sexes of the rock-haunting ringtail possum showed substantial long-term care of offspring. An unusual interaction observed {{between parents and}} young were the embrace by adult males and the <b>bridge</b> <b>formation.</b> Both sexes embrace young, whereas only females engage in <b>bridge</b> <b>formation.</b> The mother allows her young to move from branch to branch by using her body as a bridge. This has never been seen in another possum. Embracing {{is a way for}} the adults to know the stage of maturation of the offspring. A third feature of obligate monogamy shown by the Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum is the rearing of younger siblings by juveniles.|$|E

30|$|The {{moderate}} {{decline in}} total pectin contents {{recorded in the}} middle of the ripening (3 rd and 4 th sampling), is directly related to high values of the activity of PE in fruits and low activity in PG.

40|$|Background: Hydrogen peroxide, {{as other}} {{reactive}} oxygen species (ROS) produced during redox processes, induces lipid membrane peroxidation and protein degeneration causing cell apoptosis. ROS are recently considered as messengers in cell signalling processes, which, through reversible protein disulphide <b>bridges</b> <b>formation,</b> activate regulatory factors of cell proliferation and apoptosis. Disulphide <b>bridges</b> <b>formation</b> is catalysed by sulphydryl oxidase enzymes. Aim: The neuroprotective effect of ALR protein (Alrp), a sulphydryl oxidase enzyme, on H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis in SH-SY 5 Y cells has been evaluated. Methods: Cell viability, flow cytometric evaluation of apoptotic cells, fluorescent changes of nuclear morphology, immunocytochemistry Alrp detection, Western blot evaluation of mitochondrial cyt c release and mitochondrial swelling were determined. Results: Alrp prevents the H 2 O 2 -induced cell viability loss, apoptotic cell death and mitochondrial swelling in SH-SY 5 Y cells in culture. Conclusions: The data demonstrate that Alrp improves SH-SY 5 Y cells survival in H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis. It is speculated that this effect {{could be related to}} the Alrp enzymatic activity...|$|R

5000|$|The {{rocks are}} {{located within the}} {{confines}} between the Church Stretton Fault and the Pontesford-Lindley Lineament. The Wentnor Group is a predominantly sedimentary group {{with a range of}} facies attributable to that of a closing ocean. The Wentnor Group overlies the Stretton Group of rocks and although the units are separate, together they show a good geological progression. At the base of the Stretton Group the rocks are of basinal oceanic facies and as time goes a coarsening occurs with increased terrigenous input from the continent. Turbidites are observed and deltas form latterly with alluvial plains with occasional marine washovers. This creeps up into the Wentnor Group where alluvial plains occur latterly with fluvial and alluvial deposits noted in the uppermost (youngest) <b>Bridges</b> <b>Formation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Computer {{modeling}} and simulations are performed to investigate capillary bridges spontaneously formed between closely packed colloidal particles in phase separating liquids. The simulations reveal a self-stabilization mechanism that operates through diffusive equilibrium of two-phase liquid morphologies. Such mechanism renders desired microstructural stability and uniformity to the capillary bridges that are spontaneously formed during liquid solution phase separation. This self-stabilization behavior {{is in contrast}} to conventional coarsening processes during phase separation. The volume fraction limit of the separated liquid phases as well as the adhesion strength and thermodynamic stability of the capillary bridges are discussed. Capillary <b>bridge</b> <b>formations</b> in various compact colloid assemblies are considered.

The PFC's tungsten armor damage under pulsed plasma exposure was driven by (i) the melt layer motion, which leads to <b>bridges</b> <b>formation</b> between neighboring tiles and (ii) the W brittle failure giving rise to a stable crack pattern on the exposed surface. The crack width reaches a saturation value that does not exceed some tens of micrometers after several hundreds of ELM-like pulses. HHF thermal fatigue tests have shown (i) a peeling-off of the re-solidified material due to its brittle failure and (ii) a significant widening (up to 10 times) of the cracks {{and the formation of}} additional cracks...|$|R
