The Hour Hand is {{more powerful than the}} Minute Hand, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Minute</b> Hand is quicker and can be used more often. When combined, they make the First Key and {{take the form of a}} sword which bears some resemblance to the clock hands, having a silver and golden blade. It gives dominion over the Lower House and Monday.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, Kaif {{appeared}} in two films. In Abhishek Kapoor's Fitoor, {{an adaptation of}} Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, Kaif played a role based on Estella Havisham along with Aditya Roy Kapur and Tabu. Later that year she featured in Nitya Mehra's love story Baar Baar Dekho with Sidharth Malhotra. Both films were critical and commercial failures. In a review for the former, Namrata Joshi wrote: [...] "Katrina is good so long as she has to just be herself. So she dances, smiles and flirts well, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> a dramatic scene comes up, her utter inadequacy as a performer shows." ...|$|E

Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E

500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} {{in terms of}} who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [...] He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> we got on the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available.

2500|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} process, Hall and the design team took a research trip to Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute, where they met a team of DARPA-funded researchers who were pioneering the new field of 'soft robotics' using inflatable vinyl, which ultimately inspired Baymax's inflatable, vinyl, truly huggable design. Hall stated that [...] "I met a researcher who was working on soft robots. … It was an inflatable vinyl arm and the practical app {{would be in the}} healthcare industry as a nurse or doctor's assistant. He had me at vinyl. This particular researcher went into this long pitch <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> he showed me that inflatable arm, I knew we had our huggable robot." [...] Hall stated that the technology [...] "will have potential probably in the medical industry in the future, making robots that are very pliable and gentle and not going to hurt people when they pick them up." ...|$|E

2500|$|From “The Maples", her Rutland home, Dorr became {{involved}} in her community, leading the work of broadening women’s interests. For 33 years, she was president of “The Fortnightly,” the literary society of her church. To “The Maples" [...] in its more than half-century of life came many authors; among them Emerson, searching the vicinity for the lost grave of his grandfather {{who died in the}} American Revolutionary War. At the Atlantic breakfast given in honor of Dr. Holmes’ 70th birthday, Dorr was warned that Emerson, shadowed as he then was by loss of memory, might not know her. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> he saw her he exclaimed, “Oh, Mrs. Dorr, I shall never forget the view of Killington from your piazza!" [...] Here, too, came authors’ second-selves, their books, inscribed by their own hands; and authors’ letters, both congratulatory and purely friendly, Longfellow’s, Whittier’s, Emerson’s—covering many years —Dr. Holmes’, the one she knew best of the Cambridge group, Stedman’s, R. H. Stoddard’s, his wife’s, Howells'—But to name them all would be to recite a long list of the makers of American literature. Nor of American literature alone. One of the pleasantest consequences of her last public appearance at the Howells’ birthday dinner was the personal touch it gave her with the English poet, William Watson.|$|E
2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>minute</b> the wheels left the runway, the light went off {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight digital video camera with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." [...] The author then asked, [...] "Where's the tape?" [...] "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape." ...|$|E
