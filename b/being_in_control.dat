Tornado was the early aggressor, until Razer picked it up with the hook and dragged it towards the pit. The size of Tornado's framework made it difficult for Razer to drop it in, and the strain of lifting Tornado burnt out Razer's drive motors. Razer was immobile {{at the end of the}} match, but the result went to a judges' decision.

Research Findings/Insights: Results drawn from a longitudinal sample of directors sitting on the board of 200 public French firms suggest that the stronger a director's reputation for <b>being</b> active <b>in</b> increasing <b>control</b> over management, the larger the number of his/her subsequent appointments to (1) boards with a nominating committee, (2) to boards with a nominating committee which excludes the CEO and (3) to boards with a nominating committee dominated by non-executive directors.

Theoretical/Academic Implications: This study shows that the outcome of the power struggle between the CEO and incumbent directors during the candidate selection process determines the profile of directors who will ultimately obtain the board appointment. On the one hand, independent nominating committees are likely to reduce the influence of CEOs over the process of a director's appointment, and therefore are likely to increase the recruitment of directors with reputations for <b>being</b> active <b>in</b> exercising <b>control</b> over managers.
