40|$|Shape memory {{polymers}} (SMP) {{are smart}} materials {{was characterized by}} the recoverability of shape memory effect, but its mechanical property such as the strength is low. In this study, for industrial applications, a carbon fiber fabric reinforced shape memory polymer was developed. Four kinds of specimens with different laminations of carbon fiber fabric and shape memory polymer sheet were prepared. The bending recoverability was investigated and compared between the SMP sheet substance and the developed SMP based laminates. Both of the materials were loaded and then unloaded repeatedly above the Tg. The bending recoverability characterized by the bending angle, {{and the influence of}} weight of specimen was examined. Results show that the SMP based laminates developed have good shape recoverability, and their <b>bending</b> <b>recovery</b> ratio was larger than that of the SMP sheet at any recovery time. Furthermore, the <b>bending</b> <b>recovery</b> ratio was predicted with an analysis model and its result was compared with experiment values. The good agreement between the experiment and analysis suggests that the proposed analysis model is effective for the prediction of the <b>bending</b> <b>recovery</b> of SMP based laminates...|$|R
30|$|We {{also tested}} J-V curves of a CNT/Si {{thin-film}} solar cell under several <b>bending</b> and <b>recovery</b> cycles. An original CNT/Si solar cell (with an initial efficiency of η[*]= 1.52 %) is first bended to 30 ° and then recovered to original state. Figure  3 d shows the light J-V curves under three bending-recovery cycles. For the first bending, {{the efficiency of}} the cell decreases from 2.5 % to 1.4 %. After the first bending, the light J-V curves almost overlap with each other in the three bending-recovery cycles, showing a good reliability of the flexible CNT/Si solar cells in <b>bending</b> and <b>recovery</b> cycles.|$|R
40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} and analytical {{study on the}} free <b>bending</b> <b>recovery</b> of shape memory alloy strips are presented. Nitinol strips {{have been trained to}} memorize a bending shape and the best recovery performances have been obtained by heat-treating at 450 °C for 25 minutes. Free recovery has been observed during heating in an Ethylene Glycol based water solution and curvature data have been acquired by means of digital image analysis. To simulate free recovery, the Euler-Bernoulli beam model has been considered together with a one-dimensional phenomeno- logical constitutive equation for shape memory alloys. The calculated relations between the applied moment, the curvature and the temperature show good agreement with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} and experimental {{investigation of the}} <b>bending</b> <b>recovery</b> performances for a commercial NiTi shape memory alloy strip. We evaluate the mechanical properties and the shape setting parameters and estimate {{the evolution of the}} curvature during heating in an Ethylene Glycol-based water solution. To model the strip bending response, we use a one-dimensional phenomenological constitutive equation for the shape memory material, based on the introduction of (twinned and detwinned) martensite and austenite volume fractions as internal variables. Under the assumption of uniform bending, we calculate a quasi-closed-form solution for the stress and martensite fraction distributions in a shape memory beam during bending and subsequent shape recovery. Using our characterisation data as input parameters of the model, we find that the theoretical curvature evolution is in good agreement with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of realising adaptive structures {{is of great}} interest in the control/automation fields, owing to the benefits related to enhanced performance. To accomplish this, a challenging approach is the employment of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) as active elements, which can recover seemingly permanent strains by temperature-induced phase transformations whereby the so-called Shape Memory Effect (SME) takes place. This paper deals with an experimental investigation of the <b>bending</b> <b>recovery</b> performance of a functional structure. The active material was a near-equiatomic NiTi alloy {{in the form of}} strips, which were embedded into a custom-made polymeric matrix. To study the influence of heating/cooling rates on the characteristic transformation temperatures of the NiTi material, several analyses were carried out by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Prior to the insertion, the strips were thermo-mechanically treated to memorise a bent shape through experimentally evaluated shape setting parameters. The martensitic and reverse martensitic transformations were thermally activated by means of a hot/cold air stream flow. Experimental tests enabled the characterisation of the SME recovery behaviour evolution as well as the shape changes of the structure. Subsequently thermal activations were considered to assess the stability of the functional structure deformations (polymeric matrix with SMA strips) whose actual deflections were evaluated by means of digital image analysis...|$|R
40|$|Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik) cultivars {{similar to}} Laird, {{in the large}} green seed market class, are {{currently}} produced in Western Canada and are susceptible to lodging. The first goal {{of this study was}} to identify characteristics of lentil canopy architecture that will lead to reduced lodging and improved yield. The second goal was to determine if plant traits associated with lodging exist to allow indirect selection of lodging resistant material early in a breeding program. Four stiff-stem unadapted to Saskatchewan ICARDA genotypes varying in leaf size and canopy openness were compared to large green and other locally adapted cultivars at three population densities in the field in 2001 and 2002. Canopy measurements included biomass and light interception at weekly intervals, <b>recovery</b> from stem <b>bending,</b> <b>recovery</b> from canopy crushing, lodging score, end of season harvest index, yield, maximum plant height, final branch number, stem fiber and lignin content. Cultivars adapted to Saskatchewan had greater biomass (525 to 700 g m- 2), higher seed yield (96 to 130 g m- 2), higher maximum light interception (61 to 80 %), higher final branch number (17 to 19), and greatest overall plant height (0. 30 to 0. 44 m), but large green cultivars with canopy development similar to Laird had weak stems and were more prone to lodging. CDC Milestone and Crimson had improved canopy architecture compared to large green cultivars with higher harvest index (0. 40 and 0. 34, respectively, compared t...|$|R
40|$|A novel type of covalently {{cross-linked}} semi- {{crystalline polymer}} with shape-memory and biocompati- bility properties was prepared from alkoxysilane-termi- nated poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) by sol–gel process {{that allowed the}} generation of silica-like cross-linking points. A fine tuning of the cross-linking density and thermal prop- erties (melting temperature) of the materials was obtained by controlling the molecular weight of the PCL precursor (and thus the molecular structure of the resulting network) and the curing conditions. The shape-memory behaviour was investigated with <b>bending</b> tests. <b>Recovery</b> times of less than one second were observed in water depending on the temperature, and a linear correlation of the recovery time with cross-linking density and molecular weight of PCL network precursor was observed...|$|R
40|$|We propose {{parametric}} geons as {{a coarse}} description of object components for qualitative object recognition. Parametric geons are seven qualitative shape types defined by parameterized equations which control {{the size and}} degree of tapering and <b>bending.</b> Model <b>recovery</b> is performed by a procedure of model fitting and selection by minimizing an objective function measuring the similarities in both size and shape between models and objects. Multiple view data, parametric model constraints and global optimization are employed to obtain unique models and to compensate for noise and minor changes in object shape.

The regenerative amplifier uses a longer undulator and relies on higher extraction efficiency to achieve high average power, whereas the oscillator is a more compact overall design requiring the transport of the high energy electron beam around <b>bends</b> for energy <b>recovery.</b> Using parameters extrapolated from the 1 kW LANL regenerative amplifier, simulations study the feasibility of achieving 1 MW average power...|$|R
40|$|We {{report for}} the first time on the pulsed laser {{deposition}} of NiTi shape-memory effect thin films. Using a NiTi bulk target with a 1 : 1 nominal stoichiometry, we deposited thin films (thickness approximate to 0. 6 mu m) on both Si(100) and Al 2 O 3 (100) substrates. We also produced free-standing NiTi films by deposition on KBr substrates and subsequent substrate removal by immersion in water. The presence of the solid-solid phase transformation responsible for the shape memory effect has been demonstrated through temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction and four-probe resistance versus temperature measurements. On cooling the deposited him, the austenite-martensite transformation was measured at around 195 K; on heating the film the reverse transformation was around 250 K. Evidence of the shape-memory effect for freestanding films was obtained in a <b>bending</b> deformation-shape <b>recovery</b> experiment...|$|R
40|$|Ni-free Ti-Sc-Mo {{shape memory}} alloys are {{designed}} {{as a substitute for}} Ti-Ni alloys in the biomedical field. From results of <b>bending</b> and <b>recovery</b> test with heating, Ti-Sc-Mo alloys were found to have superior shape memory effect. The optimum composition for the shape memory effect was Ti- 4. 0 to 6. 0 Sc- 6. 0 Mo alloys. The maximum shape recovery strain in the Ti- 5. 0 Sc- 6. 0 Mo alloy was 5. 3 % measured through cyclic tensile deformation. Vickers hardness and 0. 2 % proof stress were remarkably decreased and elongation was increased with Sc content. The marked grain refining was also achieved. The relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties was briefly discussed. Microstructure observations and XRD measurements before and after tensile deformation showed that the shape memory effect was associated with the stress induced to 00 transformation...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} two {{complementary}} time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, dipolar electron–electron resonance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer to determine conformational {{changes in a}} single structural element of the myosin motor domain, the relay helix, {{before and after the}} recovery stroke. Two double-Cys mutants were labeled with optical probes or spin labels, and interprobe distances were determined. Both methods resolved two distinct structural states of myosin, corresponding to straight and bent conformations of the relay helix. The bent state was occupied only upon nucleotide addition, indicating that relay helix, like the entire myosin head, <b>bends</b> in the <b>recovery</b> stroke. However, saturation of myosin with nucleotide, producing a single biochemical state, did not produce a single structural state. Both straight and bent structural states of the relay helix were occupied when either ATP (ADP. BeFx) or ADP. Pi (ADP. AlF 4) analogs were bound at the active site. A greater population was found in the bent structural state when the posthydrolysis analog ADP. AlF 4 was bound. We conclude that the bending of the relay helix in the recovery stroke does not require ATP hydrolysis but is favored by it. A narrower interprobe distance distribution shows ordering of the relay helix, despite its <b>bending,</b> during the <b>recovery</b> stroke, providing further insight into the dynamics of this energy-transducing structural transition...|$|R

He is also noted for having an atypical front crawl technique in which his arms do not <b>bend</b> during the <b>recovery</b> phase. Normally, a swimmer will bend the arm at the elbow while above water to improve their line in the water.|$|R

A B 2 cubic structure of 5 - to 60 -nm grain size was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The fatigue strain capability at 107 cycles is 30 % greater in the nanocrystalline versus microcrystalline annealed wire. Grain size and residual strain are positively correlated in cyclic uniaxial tension testing within the super-elastic temperature and strain regime.

40|$|To produce {{interlining}} fabric, {{various kinds}} of chemicals such as cross-linking, soft-ening, stiffening and water repellent agents have been employed. In this work, amixture of dimethylol dihydroxy ethylene urea (DMDHEU), polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and some other resins were examined in special finishing of cotton for producing inter-lining cotton fabrics properties. Majority of cross-linking agents used today is DMDHEU based with low formaldehyde level. In order to elucidate the role of DMDHEU and PVAc in this specific finishing, some physical properties of fabric such as <b>bending</b> length, crease <b>recovery</b> angle, wettability time and thickness were studied with varying their con-centrations. Both bending length, thickness and wettability time of cotton fabrics increased on increasing PVAc and DMDHEU concentrations.

40|$|Two {{different}} types of cotton fabrics, i. e. cotton twill and cotton poplin, were treated with purified Trichoderma reesei cellulases. Methods {{used to evaluate the}} enzyme effects included weight loss, tear strength, <b>bending</b> hysteresis, wrinkle <b>recovery</b> and pilling tendencies. When the different fabric properties at the same weight loss level were compared, it was apparent that cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I) and endoglucanases had different effects on cotton fabrics. Endoglucanases caused more strength loss than CBH I but had also positive effects on the bending behaviour and pilling properties. The two endoglucanases tested differed in their action. At low hydrolysis levels practically no strength loss was obtained with these endoglucanases whereas at higher dosages EG II caused significantly higher strength losses as compared to EG I. A positive result in the pilling was, however, also obtained with these low enzyme levels, indicating practically no strength loss...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the {{development}} of a beam theory for a small strain continuum model of thermoviscoelastic shape memory polymers (SMP). Rather than a history integral model that is common for viscoelastic materials, a thermodynamically based state evolution model developed by Ghosh and Srinivasa (2011 a) is used {{as the basis for the}} beam model based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. An example of a three-point bend test is simulated using the beam theory model. The numerical solution is implemented by using an operator split technique that utilizes an elastic predictor and dissipative corrector. The key idea is that the elastic predictor is based on the solution to a beam theory boundary value problem while the dissipative corrector is entirely local (and hence can be parallelized) and is applied by considering the beam as a two or three dimensional body. This enables a very rapid solution of the problem yet maintaining fidelity of the distribution of inelastic strains across the cross-section. A displacement based convergence criterion is used in each time step. This algorithm is validated by using a three-point bending experiment for three different material cases: elastic, plastic and thermoplastic response. Time step convergence and mesh density convergence studies are carried out for the thermoviscoelastic FEM model. Finally, we implement and study this model for a SMP beam undergoing three-point <b>bending</b> strain <b>recovery</b> and stress recovery thermomechanical loading...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thermomechanical {{treatment}} {{was applied to}} a binary NiTi alloy {{in order to improve}} its functional properties by forming nanocrystalline structure of the alloy. The alloy deformation was obtained by cold rolling combined with transverse movement of the rolls. This technique allowed us to obtain high strain (εc ≈ 6) for the relatively large specimens. Subsequently, the samples were annealed in the temperature range 300 - 500 o C in order to form a nano-, submicro –and/or microcrystalline structure. The evolution of the structure and associated changes of the transformation sequences and functional properties were studied with the use of TEM, X-ray phase analysis, DSC and <b>bend</b> and free <b>recovery</b> ASTM tests. A mixed amorphous/crystalline structure was obtained after severe deformation, the martensitic transformation was completely suppressed in the sample. Annealing at lower temperatures caused formation of nanocrystalline structure that grew to the microcrystalline and finally well-defined polygonized structure in annealed at 500 o C specimens...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{generation}} of recovery stresses using prestrained body temperature nickel titanium (NiTi) shape memory alloy (SMA) wires embedded inside hybrid CFRP/SMA patches is investigated. The embedded prestrained SMA wires are activated using a heating source and the heat produced by halogen lamps {{is used as a}} heat source. The generated recovery stresses within the CFRP/SMA patch are produced by the embedded prestrained SMA wires when they attempt to return to their original shape after being subjected to the heat source. This behavior of shape memory alloy is called the one-way shape memory effect (SME). The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the recovery stresses produced by the CFRP/SMA patches can be estimated using the recovery stress values of the SMA wires and simple <b>bending</b> equations. The <b>recovery</b> stress of the SMA wires is measured by conducting a recovery stress test on SMA wires using a 50 kN tensile machine. These results can be used in the evaluation of the level of prestressing inside the CFRP/SMA patch. Prestressed CFRP/SMA patches can be used for improving the fatigue life of steel structures subjected to continuous external loadings, such as bridges and offshore platforms...|$|R
30|$|To {{clarify the}} bending {{properties}} and cooling set for bamboo under large deformation, {{the relationship between}} applied deflection and residual deflection was investigated, and comparison was made {{with the results of}} thermal recovery and anatomical changes due to deformation. No clear effect of initial deflection on set measured after a long time was found for wood and bamboo loaded on the epidermis side (Bepi). On the other hand, set for bamboo loaded on the endodermis side (Bendo) increased with deformation level. Recovery from the deformation with time for Bendo was almost complete at around 1000 min after unloading in the three-point <b>bending</b> method. This <b>recovery</b> behavior was not seen for Bepi or wood. It was considered that no failure was caused in the bent specimen, because most of the deformation was completely recovered by reheating to the temperature at which the specimens were deformed before cooling. The recovery from deformation for Bendo loaded by the four-point bending method continued even after 1000 min. From microscopic observations, shearing deformations were seen for Bendo loaded by the three-point bending method. From these results, it can be considered that shearing deformations between the two loaded points effectively contribute to decreased recovery force from deformations for Bendo.|$|R
40|$|A {{shape memory}} {{composite}} (SMC) was fabricated with a {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) and a shape memory polymer (SMP), and its two-way <b>bending</b> deformation and <b>recovery</b> force were investigated. The results obtained can be summarized as follows: (1) two kinds of SMA tapes which show the shape memory effect (SME) and superelasticity (SE) were heat-treated to memorize the round shape. The shape-memorized round SMA tapes were arranged facing in the opposite directions and were sandwiched between the SMP sheets. The SMC belt can be fabricated by using the appropriate factors: the number of SMP sheets, the pressing force, the heating temperature and the hold time. (2) The twoway bending deformation with an angle of 56 degrees in the fabricated SMC belt is observed based on the SME and SE of the SMA tapes during heating and cooling. (3) If the SMC belt is heated and cooled by keeping the bent form, the recovery force increases during heating and degreases during cooling based on the two-way properties of the SMC. (4) The development and application of high-functional SMCs are expected by {{the combination of the}} SMA and the SMP with various kinds of phase transformation temperatures, volume fractions, configurations and heating-cooling rates...|$|R
40|$|For many proteins, {{especially}} for molecular motors and other enzymes, the functional mechanisms remain unsolved {{due to a}} gap between static structural data and kinetics. We have filled this gap by detecting structure and kinetics simultaneously. This structural kinetics experiment is {{made possible by a}} new technique, (TR) 2 FRET (transient time-resolved FRET), which resolves protein structural states on the submillisecond timescale during the transient phase of a biochemical reaction. (TR) 2 FRET is accomplished with a fluorescence instrument that uses a pulsed laser and direct waveform recording to acquire an accurate subnanosecond time-resolved fluorescence decay every 0. 1  ms after stopped flow. To apply this method to myosin, we labeled the force-generating region site specifically with two probes, mixed rapidly with ATP to initiate the recovery stroke, and measured the interprobe distance by (TR) 2 FRET with high resolution in both space and time. We found that the relay helix <b>bends</b> during the <b>recovery</b> stroke, most of which occurs before ATP is hydrolyzed, and two structural states (relay helix straight and bent) are resolved in each nucleotide-bound biochemical state. Thus the structural transition of the force-generating region of myosin is only loosely coupled to the ATPase reaction, with conformational selection driving the motor mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{mutation}} uni- 1 {{gives rise}} to uniflagellate Chlamydomonas cells which rotate around a fixed point in the microscope field, so that the flagellar bending pattern can be photographed easily. This has allowed us to make {{a detailed analysis of}} the wild-type flagellar bending pattern and the bending patterns of flagella on several mutant strains. Cells containing uni- 1, and recombinants of uni- 1 with the suppressor mutations, sup(_pf) - 1 and sup(_pf) - 3, show the typical asymmetric bending pattern associated with forward swimming in Chlamydomonas, although sup(_pf) - 1 flagella have about one-half the normal beat frequency, apparently as the result of defective function of the outer dynein arms. The pf- 17 mutation has been shown to produce nonmotile flagella in which radial spoke heads and five characteristic axonemal polypeptides are missing. Recombinants containing pf- 17 and either sup(_pf) - 1 or sup(_pf) - 3 have motile flagella, but still lack radial-spoke heads and the associated polypeptides. The flagellar bending pattern of these recombinants lacking radial-spoke heads is a nearly symmetric, large amplitude pattern which is quite unlike the wild-type pattern. However, the presence of an intact radial-spoke system is not required to convert active sliding into bending and is not required for bend initiation and bend propagation, since all of these processes are active in the sup(_pf) pf- 17 recombinants. The function of the radial-spoke system appears to be to convert the symmetric bending pattern displayed by these recombinants into the asymmetric bending pattern required for efficient swimming, by inhibiting the development of reverse <b>bends</b> during the <b>recovery</b> phase of the bending cycle...|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{primary side}} aerosol retention, an Eulerian/Lagrangian approach {{was used to}} investigate aerosol transport in a compressible, turbulent, adiabatic, internal, wall-bounded flow. The ARTIST experimental project (Phase I) served as the physical model replicated for numerical simulation. Realizable k-? and standard k-? turbulence models were selected from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, FLUENT, to provide the Eulerian description of the gaseous phase. Flow field simulation results exhibited: a) onset of weak secondary flow accelerated at bend entrance towards the inner wall; b) flow separation zone development on the convex wall that persisted {{from the point of}} onset; c) centrifugal force concentrated high velocity flow {{in the direction of the}} concave wall; d) formation of vortices throughout the flow domain resulted from rotational (Dean-type) flow; e) weakened secondary flow assisted the formation of twin vortices in the outflow cross section; and f) perturbations induced by the <b>bend</b> influenced flow <b>recovery</b> several pipe diameters upstream of the bend. These observations were consistent with those of previous investigators. The Lagrangian discrete random walk model, with and without turbulent dispersion, simulated the dispersed phase behavior, incorrectly. Accurate deposition predictions in wall-bounded flow require modification of the Eddy Impaction Model (EIM). Thus, to circumvent shortcomings of the EIM, the Lagrangian time scale was changed to a wall function and the root-mean-square (RMS) fluctuating velocities were modified to account for the strong anisotropic nature of flow in the immediate vicinity of the wall (boundary layer). Subsequent computed trajectories suggest a precision that ranges from 0. 1 % to 0. 7 %, statistical sampling error. The aerodynamic mass median diameter (AMMD) at the inlet (5. 5 ?m) was consistent with the ARTIST experimental findings. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) varied depending on the scenario evaluated but ranged from 1. 61 to 3. 2. At the outlet, the computed AMMD (1. 9 ?m) had GSD between 1. 12 and 2. 76. Decontamination factors (DF), computed based on deposition from trajectory calculations, were just over 3. 5 for the bend and 4. 4 at the outlet. Computed DFs were consistent with expert elicitation cited in NUREG- 1150 for aerosol retention in steam generators...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop and {{validate}} a continuum model for the simulation of the thermomechanical response of a shape memory polymer (SMP). Rather than integral type viscoelastic model, the approach here {{is based on the}} idea of two inter-penetrating networks, one which is permanent and the other which is transient together with rate equations for the time evolution of the transient network. We find that the activation stress for network breakage and formation of the material controls the gross features of the response of the model, and exhibits a "thermal Bauschinger effect". The model developed here is similar to a thermoviscoelastic model, and is developed with an eye towards ease of numerical solutions to boundary value problems. The primary hypothesis of this model is that the hysteresis of temperature dependent activation-stress plays a lead role in controlling its main response features. Validation of this hypothesis is carried out for the uniaxial response from the experimental data available in the literature for two different SMP samples: shape memory polyurethane and Veriflex, to show the control of the evolution of the temperature sensitive activation stress on the response. We extend the validated 1 D model to a three dimensional small strain continuum SMP model and carry out a systematic parameter optimization method for the identification of the activation stress coefficients, with different weights given to different features of the response to match the parameters with experimental data. A comprehensive parametric study is carried out, that varies each of the model material and loading parameters, and observes their effect on design-relevant response characteristics of the model undergoing a thermomechanical cycle. We develop "response charts" for the response characteristics: shape fixity, shape recovery and maximum stress rise during cooling, to give the designer an idea of how the simultaneous variation of two of the most influential material parameters changes a specific response parameter. To exemplify the efficacy of the model in practical applications, a thermoviscoelastic extension of a beam theory model will be developed. This SMP beam theory will account for activation stress governed inelastic response of a SMP beam. An example of a three point bend test is simulated using the beam theory model. The numerical solution is implemented by using an operator split technique that utilizes an elastic predictor and dissipative corrector. This algorithm is validated by using a three-point bending experiment for three different material cases: elastic, plastic and thermoplastic response. Time step convergence and mesh density convergence studies are carried out for the thermoviscoelastic FEM model. We implement and study this model for a SMP beam undergoing three-point <b>bending</b> strain <b>recovery,</b> stress recovery and cyclic thermomechanical loading. Finally we develop a thermodynamically consistent finite continuum model to simulate the thermomechanical response of SMPs. The SMP is modeled as an isotropic viscoplastic material where thermal changes govern the evolution of the activation stress of the material. The response of the SMP in a thermomechanical cycle is modeled as a combination of a rubbery and a glassy element in series. Using these assumptions, we propose a specific form for the Helmholtz potential and the rate of dissipation. We use the technique of upper triangular decomposition for developing the constitutive equations of the finite strain SMP model. The resulting model is implemented in an ODE solver in MATLAB, and solved for a simple shear problem. We study the response of the SMP model for shear deformation as well as cyclic shear deformation at different initial temperatures. Finally, we implement the thermomechanical cycle under shear deformations and study the behavior of the model...|$|R
