5|$|The most {{significant}} {{threat to the}} bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{is likely to be}} ongoing land clearing in semi-arid bioregions of Queensland and NSW. The eastern Australian Bioregions that comprise the core range of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat, particularly the Brigalow Belt (north and south), have been subjected to broad scale clearing and habitat modification since European settlement. Clearing of vegetation for agriculture and removal of hollow <b>bearing</b> <b>trees</b> for firewood collection and forestry are likely to reduce the availability of roosting sites for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat. Clearing of native vegetation and removal of dead wood and dead trees have been recognised as key threatening processes for the bristle-faced free-tailed bat in NSW.|$|E

25|$|The {{people of}} Nodena were {{intensely}} involved in maize agriculture, {{as well as}} other food crops originating in the Americas, such as beans, squash, sunflowers and gourds. They also gathered wild foodstuffs such as pecans and persimmons. The de Soto choroniclers described the area as being under heavy cultivation, and the most populous they had seen in La Florida. The Spaniards described groves of wild fruit and nut <b>bearing</b> <b>trees,</b> implying that the Nodena must have left them standing when clearing other trees for the cultivation of maize. The hunting of whitetail deer, squirrel, rabbit, turkey, and mallard was practiced as well as fishing for alligator gar, catfish, drum, and mussels.|$|E
2500|$|On each bearing tree, two blazes were {{typically}} required, one about chest height and easily visible, {{and one at}} ground level (in case the tree were illegally cut, the stump remaining). [...] On the exposed wood of the blaze, surveyors were required to inscribe, with wood chisels, township, range and section information, on typically either two or four <b>bearing</b> <b>trees,</b> if they were within some reasonable distance of the corner (unspecified early on but later set at a maximum of 3 chains (178 feet, 60 meters) away). <b>Bearing</b> <b>trees</b> are of vital importance not just for these land boundary purposes, but also for their use by ecologists in the estimation of historic forest vegetation conditions before settlement, and large scale human disturbance, of the land. [...] No other data set comes close to providing this estimate of original forest composition and structure, and the data have accordingly been used very heavily.|$|E

2500|$|At corners, corner monuments are {{established}} to mark their exact {{location on the}} ground. As with most PLSS specifications, those for corner monumentation also changed over time. [...] In the 19th century, monuments were commonly a rock pile, a wooden post, {{or a combination of}} the two. Trees could be used if the corner happened to fall at the exact spot where one grew. In the 20th century, steel pipes with caps, supported by mounds of rock, became required (e.g. Fig. 4). Witnesses can be trees, rocks, or trenches dug in the ground; their exact locations relative to the corner, and the markings made on them, are also recorded in the surveyor's official fieldnotes. [...] Witness trees at corners are more commonly referred to as <b>bearing</b> <b>trees</b> because the exact distance and bearing from the corner, to them, was required to be recorded (as well as the taxon and diameter).|$|E
2500|$|The {{people of}} Parkin were {{intensely}} involved in maize agriculture, {{as well as}} other food crops originating in the Americas, such as beans, gourds, squash, and sunflowers. After the harvest maize was stored in large above ground cribs for consumption during the remainder of the year. They also gathered wild foodstuffs such as pecans and persimmons. The de Soto chroniclers described the area as being under heavy cultivation, and the most populous they had seen in La Florida. The Spaniards described groves of wild fruit and nut <b>bearing</b> <b>trees,</b> implying that the Parkin phase peoples must have left them standing when clearing other trees for the cultivation of maize and their other crops. The hunting of whitetail deer, squirrel, rabbit, turkey, and mallard was practiced as well as fishing for alligator gar, catfish, drum, turtles and mussels.

60|$|That was one {{employment}} we had, {{and it made}} me {{feel less}} lonesome; but there was no profit in the thing, for though the priest came and sat and yarned, none of his folks could be enticed into my store; and if it hadn't been for the other occupation I struck out there wouldn't have been a pound of copra in the house. This was the idea: Fa'avao (Uma's mother) had a score of <b>bearing</b> <b>trees.</b> Of course we could get no labour, being all as good as tabooed, and the two women and I turned to and made copra with our own hands. It was copra to make your mouth water when it was done--I never understood how much the natives cheated me till I had made that four hundred pounds of my own hand--and it weighed so light I felt inclined to take and water it myself.|$|E
60|$|The soil in {{the parish}} of Hursley, as may be {{supposed}} in so extensive a tract of land, is of several different sorts; in some parts it is light and shallow, and of a chalky nature; in others, particularly on {{the east and west}} sides of the parish, it is what is called STRONG land, having clay for its basis; and in others, especially that of the commons and fields adjoining, it consists principally of sand or gravel. Towards the west, it is entirely covered with wood, not in general <b>bearing</b> <b>trees</b> of large size, but some beautiful beech-trees; and breaking into peaty, boggy ground on the southern side. The northern side is of good rich loam, favourable to the growth of fine trees, and likewise forms excellent arable land. This continues along the valley of Otterbourne, along a little brook which falls into the Itchen. It is for the most part of thick clay, fit for brick-making, with occasional veins of sand, and where Otterbourne hill rises, beds of gravel begin and extend to the borders of the Itchen, through a wooded slope known as Otterbourne Park.|$|E

60|$|She groped her {{way through}} the darkness, giving the tower and its {{enclosure}} as wide a berth as possible. Sometimes she stumbled, for in the long shadows cast by the rising Cluros objects were grotesquely distorted though the light from the moon was still not sufficient to be of much assistance to her. Nor, as a matter of fact, did she want light. She could find the stream in the dark, by the simple expedient of going down hill until she walked into it and she had seen that <b>bearing</b> <b>trees</b> and many crops grew throughout the valley, so that she would pass food in plenty ere she reached the stream. If the moon showed her the way more clearly and thus saved her from an occasional fall, he would, too, show her more clearly to the strange denizens of the towers, and that, of course, must not be. Could she have waited until the following night conditions would have been better, since Cluros would not appear in the heavens at all and so, during Thuria's absence, utter darkness would reign; but the pangs of thirst and the gnawing of hunger could be endured no longer with food and drink both in sight, and so she had decided to risk discovery rather than suffer longer.|$|E
60|$|The {{process by}} which nature uses her {{materials}} to found islands {{in the midst of}} oceans like the Pacific, is a curious study. The insect that forms the coral rock, must be an industrious little creature, as there is reason to think that some of the reefs that have become known to navigators within the last sixty or seventy years, have since been converted into islands <b>bearing</b> <b>trees,</b> by their labours. Should the work go on, a part of this vast sea will yet be converted into a continent; and, who knows but a railroad may yet run across that portion of our globe, connecting America with the old world? I see that Captain Beechy, in his voyage, speaks of a wreck that occurred in 1792, on a reef, where, in 1826, he found an island near three leagues long, bearing tall trees. It would be a curious calculation to ascertain, if one family of insects can make an island three leagues long, in thirty-four years, how many families it would take to make the grading of the railroad I have mentioned. Ten years since, I would not have ventured a hint of this nature, for it might have set speculation in motion, and been the instrument of robbing more widows and orphans of their straitened means; but, Heaven be praised! we have at length reached a period {{in the history of the}} country, when a man may venture on a speculation in the theory of geography without incurring the risk of giving birth to some wild--if not unprincipled--speculation in dollars and cents.|$|E
