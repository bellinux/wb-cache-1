We conclude that the partnership is changing as a result of external, economic forces. In essence, we are seeing a threat-rigidity response. The economic crisis may be responsible for causing PTGs to narrow their range of activities away from broader strategic issues that can be addressed through their confrontation activities and advocacy mission towards a narrower focus on classroom activities that protect core school operations, namely instruction...|$|R

40|$|Bridge {{safety is}} of {{paramount}} importance in transportation engineering and maintenance management. Corrosion causes strength deterioration and weakening of aged steel structures. Therefore, it is a vital task to estimate the remaining strength of corroded steel structures in order to assure the public safety. Due to the economic constraints and increase of number of steel highway and railway bridge structures, it will be an exigent task to conduct tests for each and every aged bridge structure within their <b>bridge</b> <b>budgets.</b> Therefore, this paper proposes a method of evaluating the residual strength capacities by numerical approach and compares the non-linear FEM analyses results with their respective tensile coupon tests. Further, since {{it is not easy to}} measure several thousands of points, to accurately reproduce the corroded surface by numerical methods and to predict their yield and ultimate behaviors, a simple and reliable analytical model is proposed by measuring the maximum corroded depth (tc,max), in order to estimate the remaining strength capacities of actual corroded members more precisely...|$|R

The parkway would be of little value, he concluded, to intra-District travel, but could serve as a bypass for heavy trucks traveling south. The House Committee on Public Works agreed, and added 0.5 mi of parkway inside the District of Columbia (between the District line and South Dakota Avenue NE) to federalize the bridge and interchange as Young had requested. President Harry S. Truman signed the bill into law on August 3, 1950.|$|R

Along these lines, social-ecological systems including Payment for Watershed Services (PWS) are increasing in frequency and can help land management entities to <b>bridge</b> <b>budget</b> shortfalls for funding needed watershed restoration forestry treatments. The Flagstaff Watershed Protection Project (FWPP) is a bond-financed wildfire risk mitigation partnership and PWS program in Northern Arizona, the only forest management project that utilizes a municipal bond as the financial mechanism in conjunction with a partnership governance structure to invest in federal land management. The purpose of this research was to describe this new governance structure to understand the potential benefits to communities and federal land management agencies for protecting watershed services. Data were derived from document review and key informant interviews (n = 9). FWPP institutional design and governance structures were tailored to maximize community strengths and encompassed several advantages over traditional federal land management models; these advantages include increased collaboration and institutional support, financial security, and public approval. The FWPP represents an innovative PWS system that can help showcase unique community and federal forest management partnerships that benefit watershed health in western US communities...|$|R

This was largely due to the raising the spans, removing the bad rock and sand beneath the abutments, and other structural changes which added more than $4.5 million in additional costs. By not carving statues for the Boundary Channel Bridge or the Arlington Memorial Bridge piers and by eliminating all balustrades, statuary, and buildings on Columbia Island, the budget overruns were minimized.|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of fatigue cracks in steel bridge girders {{has become a}} major problem for bridge engineers in the USA. Currently, most bridge inspection is carried out using visual methods.

This requirement adds to the expense and complexity of the inspection process and often requires that one or more traffic lanes be closed to accommodate the required equipment.
