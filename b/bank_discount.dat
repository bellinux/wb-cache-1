25|$|Discounting to face value: Before {{national}} currencies {{and efficient}} clearing houses, banknotes were only redeemable {{at face value}} at the issuing bank. Even a branch <b>bank</b> could <b>discount</b> notes of other branches of the same <b>bank.</b> The <b>discounts</b> usually increased with distance from the issuing <b>bank.</b> The <b>discount</b> also depended on the perceived safety of the bank.

40|$|The {{study on}} which {{this article is based}} was {{concerned}} with establishing whether the lending behaviour of Lesotho's commercial banks in relation to the private sector has changed following the reforms that have been implemented since 1980. The influence of macroeconomic variables on agricultural credit and on private sector lending provided through the existing commercial banks during the period 1980 to 1993 was examined. The results showed a high and significant association between total credit extension and the general performance of the economy. Macroeconomic variables such as returns on financial securities in Lesotho and bonds in the Republic of South Africa, <b>bank</b> <b>discount</b> rates and the interest rates on saving deposits applicable in Lesotho had a key effect on the extension of credit by commercial banks to the private sector.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} central bank interventions had {{a statistically significant}} impact on easing stress in unsecured interbank markets during {{the first phase of}} the subprime crisis which began in July 2007. Extraordinary liquidity provisions, such as the Term Auction Facility by the Federal Reserve, are analyzed. First a decomposition of the Libor-OIS spread indicates that credit premia increased in importance as the crisis deepened. Second, using Markov switching models, central bank operations are then graphically associated with reductions in term funding stress. Finally, bivariate VAR and GARCH models are adopted to econometrically quantified these impacts. While helpful in compressing Libor spreads, the economic magnitudes of central interventions have overall not been very large.

The chapter also outlines the basic institutional and economic framework of the Swedish stock and money markets.

40|$|This paper applies {{and extends}} a {{theoretical}} model built by Agénor and Montiel (2007) by exploring {{the effectiveness of}} government bonds and monetary policy in a small, open, credit-based economy with a fixed exchange rate. The model is applied to Benin, {{a member of a}} currency union, using a general equilibrium model with stochastic simulation. Model calibration replicates the historical pattern for 1996 – 2009. Policy experiments simulated an increase in government securities in Benin’s regional market and a cut in the reserve requirement. Simulations produced mixed results. It appears that, among other factors, excess bank liquidity lowers the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments through the credit channel and that government bonds can help mop up excess bank liquidity.
