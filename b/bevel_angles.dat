5000|$|Double bevel or {{compound}} bevel — A back bevel, {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge bevel (the bevel which is the foremost cutting surface). This back bevel keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single bevel, sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single bevel blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the bevel is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades.

40|$|Background and Aim: Achieving {{appropriate}} seal in canal obturation is {{the main}} goal of endodontic therapy. However, in some cases, {{it can not be}} obtained by non-surgical procedures alone. Retrograde surgery {{is one of the most}} common procedures in endodontics. Apical seal improvement can be obtained by root end filling and decreasing the root end resection <b>angle</b> (<b>bevel</b> <b>angle).</b> The aim of this study was to investigate the role of <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> on apical microleakage following the use of amalgam and MTA as root end filling materials. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 128 extracted human teeth were instrumented and obturated by lateral condensation technique. The teeth were divided into two groups and the apical root resection was performed by high speed fissure bur (one group perpendicular to the long axis of the teeth and the other 45 &# 61616; to the long axis. The 3 mm root end cavity was prepared by ultrasonic device. Each group was divided into two subgroups: One filled with amalgam and the other with MTA. Teeth were incubated for 72 h, covered by two layers of nail polish (except for apical 3 mm) and submerged in methylene blue for 48 h. Teeth were washed under tap water and mesiodistally dissected by low speed disc. Dye penetration was evaluated by stereomicroscope. Data were analysed by two way ANOVA and Tukey tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: The results showed that retrofill material type had a significant effect on microleakage and MTA was superior to amalgam in this respect. <b>Bevel</b> <b>angle</b> failed to show any significant effect on apical microleakage. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, it seems that the use of MTA instead of amalgam in clinical practice can improve the success rate of endodontic surgery whereas the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> can be determined based on the status of each individual case; However, increasing the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> seems to increase microleakage due to exposure of more dentinal tubules...|$|R

This paper presents measurements of the turbulent flow near {{the trailing edge of}} a two-dimensional lifting surface at chord-based Reynolds numbers, ReC, typical of heavy-lift aircraft wings and full-scale ship propellers. The experiments were conducted in the William B.

Flow-field measurements concentrated on the foil’s near wake and include results from trailing edges having terminating <b>bevel</b> <b>angles</b> of 44 ◦ and 56 ◦. Although generic turbulent boundary layer and wake characteristics were found at any fixed ReC in the trailing-edge region, the variable strength of near-wake vortex shedding caused the flow-field fluctuations to be Reynolds-number and trailing-edge-geometry dependent. In the current experiments, vortex-shedding strength peaked at ReC = 4 × 106 with the 56 ◦ bevel-angle trailing edge.

40|$|Flush {{repairs to}} {{military}} aircraft {{are expected to}} become more prevalent as more thick skin composites are used, particularly {{on the surface of}} the fuselage, wings and other external surfaces. The use of these repairs, whilst difficult to manufacture provide an aerodynamic, “stealthy” finish that is also more structurally efficient than overlap repairs. This research was undertaken to improve the design methodology of scarf repairs with reduced material removal and to investigate the damage tolerance of scarf repair to low velocity impact damage. Scarf repairs involve shallow <b>bevel</b> <b>angles</b> to ensure the shear stress in the adhesive does not exceed allowable strength. This is important when repairing structures that need to withstand hot and humid conditions, when the adhesive properties degrade. Therefore, considerable amounts of parent material must be machined away prior to repair. The tips of the repair patch and the parent laminate are very sharp, thus a scarf repair is susceptible to accidental damage. The original contributions include: •	Developed analytic means of predicting the stresses within optimised scarf joints with dissimilar materials. New equations were developed and solved using numerical algorithms. •	Verified using finite element modelling that a scarfed insert with dissimilar modulus subjected to uniaxial loading attracted the same amount of load as an insert without a scarf. As such, the simple analytic formula used to predict load attraction/diversion through a plate with an insert may be used to predict the load attraction/diversion into a scarf repair that contains a dissimilar adherend patch. •	Developed a more efficient flush joint with a doubler insert placed near the mid line of the parent structure material. This joint configuration has a lower load eccentricity than external doubler joint. •	Investigated the damage tolerance of scarf joints, with and without the external doubler. The results showed that scarf joints without external doublers exhibited a considerable strength reduction following low velocity impact. Based on the observations, the major damage mechanics in the scarf joint region following impact have been identified. These results demonstrated that it is important to incorporate damage tolerance in the design of scarf repairs...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of microwave and millimetre-wave systems, the performance requirements for passive band-pass filters and diplexers, as essential parts in these systems, are steadily increasing. Both rectangular waveguide and substrate-integrated waveguide technologies help to satisfy various high-performance requirements. Rectangular waveguides offer {{the advantages of}} low loss and high power handling capabilities, while substrate-integrated waveguides have the advantages of low cost and easy integration into planar circuit technology. Besides, the miniaturisation of electronic devices is of great importance, especially for microwave or millimetre-wave systems whose volume is limited by system considerations. Hence, the two main aims of this thesis are firstly to develop efficient methods which can improve the design reliability and reduce the design cycle of such passive devices, and secondly to present novel structures of band-pass filters and diplexers whose dimensions are reduced. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, a method based on the mode-matching technique is developed to rigorously and efficiently analyse the negative influence introduced by micromachining errors on the performance of band-pass H-plane iris filter. This analysis includes the effect on the centre frequency and 3 dB bandwidth caused by the round angles between waveguide walls and H-plane irises, or by the <b>bevel</b> <b>angles</b> on the H-plane irises. To remove these undesired influences, three approaches are proposed and verified with simulations performed with the finite-element method. In the next part, efficient approximation approaches are investigated in the framework of the mode-matching method to analyse the characteristics of cylindrical posts placed in the cross-section of a rectangular waveguide or substrate-integrated waveguide. Compared with the H-plane irises in rectangular waveguides, cylindrical posts are more promising for realising band-pass rectangular waveguide filters, because the geometries are easier to manufacture and less prone to machining errors. Thus, a general design procedure for band-pass post filters in rectangular waveguides and substrate-integrated waveguides is developed and verified with finite-element simulations and measurements on prototypes. The tolerance analysis for the band-pass filters is also explored quickly and accurately with the developed method, while the influence of realistic material losses on the insertion loss of various structures, is also quantitatively analysed with a full-wave simulation solver. Next, the characteristics of a shielded microstrip line for single-mode operation is investigated rigorously based on the mode-matching method. The research focuses on the influence of the metal enclosure dimensions on the fundamental mode, and the relationships between the cutoff frequency of the 2 nd-order mode and the geometrical variables of the cross-section of the shielded transmission line. A similar method is then applied to an E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide. The analysis demonstrates that the propagation characteristics for the first twenty modes in the E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide and its corresponding equivalent rectangular waveguide are almost identical if the width of the middle metal vane in the E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide is chosen reasonably. Exploiting this similarity property, a novel concept of band-pass post filter in E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology is developed to reduce the band-pass filter dimension further, together with an efficient specific design procedure. The validity of the approach is verified via finite-element simulations and measurements on a fabricated prototype. Finally, to reduce the sizes of common diplexers, four types of novel three-port junctions are proposed, including two improved Y-junctions in substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a double-layer junction in substrate-integrated waveguide technology, a Y-junction in T-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology, and a junction with stairs in T-type and E-type folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology. Exploiting the flexibility of the in-house developed mode-matching code or a commercial finite-element simulation solver, the characteristics for all presented junctions are shown to satisfy the constraints for optimum performance of diplexers when adjusting the relevant variables in the corresponding structures. Three types of these junctions are then utilised in realising diplexers whose performance is verified over the required operation bands with either numerical simulations or measurements on fabricated prototypes. In summary, this thesis has introduced novel concepts and realisations of compact band-pass filters and diplexers in unfolded or folded substrate-integrated waveguide technology, as well as related structures. One of the crucial aspects emphasised throughout the research is the need for efficient and accurate modelling methods specifically tailored to support such developments. This has been demonstrated throughout the thesis with the combined use of powerful numerical methods and equivalent models based on symmetries or unfolded geometries. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The developed fuzzy model had an accuracy of 91 %, 97 % and 100 %, respectively in bad, middle and good levels to predict the stem shearing strength...|$|R
40|$|Accurate needle {{placement}} {{is important}} during percutaneous needle insertion procedures such as biopsy and brachytherapy. However, needle-tissue interactions may cause the needle {{to deviate from}} its intended path. In this paper, we have investigated the effects of insertion velocity, tip <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> and insertion proﬁle on needle deﬂection in three-dimensional space (in-plane and out-of-plane). Experiments are done using soft-tissue simulant and chicken liver. The needle tip is tracked during insertion using stereoscopic cameras and an electromagnetic tracker. Experimental {{results show that the}} in-plane and out-of-plane deﬂection decreases, as insertion velocity increases. Varying the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> from 30 ° to 60 ° is shown to decrease the in-plane deﬂection, and increase the out-of-plane deﬂection. The addition of rotational motion during continuous linear insertion decreases both the in-plane and out-of-plane deﬂection. Tapping during insertion does not produce signiﬁcant reduction in the in-plane or out-of-plane deﬂection. An increase in the insertion velocity from 10 mm/s to 300 mm/s during insertion into chicken liver results in the decrease and increase in the in-plane and out-of plane deﬂection, respectively. A monotonic increase in the out-of-plane deﬂection as insertion velocity increases is probably caused by the needle slipping while penetrating the outer capsule of the liver. The results of this study can be used to develop an accurate model of needle-tissue interactions...|$|R
40|$|Design and {{experimental}} data for obtuse-angled wedges used in coupled configurations of diode lasers and multimode fibers are presented. An analytic {{definition of the}} connection between the wedge angle and the fiber acceptance half-angle is developed, along with a formula for the minimum half-angle. An inequality is defined for determining the <b>bevel</b> <b>angle</b> of the output end of the fiber to eliminate end reflections. The fiber parameters are accounted for in the bevel. The formulations were tested in comparison with the performance of a coupled CDH laser system and good agreement was found in the output spectrum...|$|R
50|$|Japanese chisel (nomi 鑿). These come in {{a larger}} variety of types and {{gradations}} than the Western chisel. There are bench chisels, paring chisels, striking chisels, heavy timber chisels and slicks, and myriad others for specialized applications. Like the planes, the blades are of laminated hard steel/soft steel construction. <b>Bevel</b> <b>angle</b> varies from 20˚ to 35˚ typically, with mortising and heavy chisels featuring steep angles, and paring chisels having shallower angles. It is common in Japan to work with softwoods, so many chisels are made with that in mind, and require the bevels be steepened if employed for harder woods.|$|R
