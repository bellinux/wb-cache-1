25|$|In Paul Tillich's work The Courage to Be {{he defines}} courage as the self-affirmation of one’s being {{in spite of}} a threat of nonbeing. He relates courage to anxiety, anxiety being the threat of non-being and the courage to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> use to combat that threat. For Tillich, he {{outlines}} three types of anxiety and thus three ways to display the courage to be.|$|E

The anxiety is produced when we realize our being is unsatisfactory. “It [...] threatens man’s moral self-affirmation, relatively in terms of guilt, absolutely in terms of condemnation” (41).|$|E

2500|$|The {{method of}} Lagrange {{multipliers}} {{can be extended}} to solve problems with multiple constraints using a similar argument. Consider a paraboloid subject to two line constraints that intersect at a single point. As the only feasible solution, this point is obviously a constrained extremum. However, the level set of [...] is clearly not parallel to either constraint at the intersection point (see Figure 3); instead, it is a linear {{combination of the two}} constraints' gradients. In the case of multiple constraints, that will <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> seek in general: the method of Lagrange seeks points not at which the gradient of [...] is multiple of any single constraint's gradient necessarily, but in which it is a linear combination of all the constraints' gradients.|$|E
2500|$|Bourguiba {{had also}} {{reacted to the}} {{statement}} of Maurice Viollette, governor-general of Algeria, who proclaimed [...] "North Africa {{is an integral part}} of France and that it was impossible for France to abandon a bit of it". 1930 was the peak of French colonization in North Africa, which led France to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria, by organizing a eucharistic congress in Tunisia. On this occasion, millions of Europeans invaded the capital city and went to the Saint-Lucien de Carthage cathedral, disguised in crusaders, which humiliated and revolted the people who protested against what they considered, as a violation of an Islam land by Christendom. The protestors, strongly repressed, were brought to Justice and some of had Bourguiba for lawyer, as he did not participate in the event. He also remained neutral when Tahar Haddad was dismissed of his duties of notary. He estimated at that moment, that the main goals were political, while other problems of society are secondary, insisting on the Tunisian personality and identity that had to affirm, declaring: [...] "Let us <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> are before becoming what we will".|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the GIDC diagnosis into the DSM-III in 1980 was preceded by numerous US studies and treatments on feminine boys beginning {{as early as the}} 1950s and 1960s, most prominently by John Money and Richard Green at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The prevention of transsexuality and / or homosexuality was explicitly stated as the goal of many of these studies: [...] "My focus will <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> might consider the prevention of transsexualism." [...] Bryant notes that feminine boys were not a new phenomenon at this time; however, the public emergence of adult transsexual women (male to female) in the 1950s was new and created a number of problems for psychologists, motivating some to undertake efforts at preventing their further emergence. Meyerowitz chronicles the deep disagreements which erupted between psychologists and physicians after Christine Jorgensen's public gender transition, namely over whether transsexuals should be permitted to align their bodies with their inner identities or whether their inner identities must be brought in line with their bodies. At the time, transsexual women were beginning to publish first-person narratives which highlighted their awareness of their femininity at a young age and Bryant notes that some clinicians and researchers thus turned their attention to feminine boys, constructing sissies as a new [...] "medicalized patient and research population." ...|$|E
