I had to prove them wrong, which meant not only proving myself to my fans <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> record company as well. That is something that happens when you're a girl. It wouldn't happen to Prince or Michael Jackson. I had to do everything on my own and it was hard trying to convince people that I was worth a record deal. After that, I had the same problem trying to convince the record company that I had more to offer than a one-shot singer. I had to win this fight." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{introduces}} the character Michonne, a protagonist in the comic {{series of the}} same name who is portrayed by Danai Gurira. Gurira was cast as part of the series a week before the broadcasting of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] although rumors of introducing Michonne circulated months prior to the season finale. Kirkman admitted that he was a fan of her work in the HBO drama series Treme. Rutina Wesley, who played Tara Thornton in True Blood, was rumored to be considered for the role of Michonne, although Kirkman stated that she was never involved in the auditioning process. [...] "It was a lot of actresses. The True Blood actress, I don't know that she was even available; I think she's still on True Blood. I don't know where that rumor came from, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> knowledge, she was never involved." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams had {{his first}} {{audience}} with King George III on June 1, and recorded the event {{as he saw it}} in great detail in a letter to Foreign Minister John Jay on June 2. Adams approached the King, telling him that he felt greatly honored by his appointment, and promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality [...] "between People who, tho Seperated by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood." [...] After hearing this, King George, promised to [...] "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." [...] He added that [...] "while he had been the last to consent" [...] to American independence, he wished Adams to know that he had always done what he thought right and proper. Towards the end of the interview, the King said, which to Adams appeared very sudden, [...] "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." [...] Adams replied, [...] "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own Country." [...] To this King George responded, [...] "An honest Man will never have any other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Acadian {{historian}} Maurice Basque {{writes that}} the term [...] "'genocide'... does not apply {{at all to the}} Grand Derangement. Acadie was not Armenia, and to compare Grand-Pré with Auschwitz and the killing fields of Cambodia is a complete and utter trivialization of the many genocidal horrors of contemporary history." [...] Concerning the use of 20th century terms such as [...] "ethnic cleansing" [...] and [...] "genocide" [...] to understand the past, historian John G. Reid states, [...] "I'm not sure that it's the best way to understand 18th century realities... What happened in the 18th century is a process of imperial expansion that was ruthless at times, that cost lives…. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mind, you can't just transfer concepts between centuries.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Snowden {{has said}} that he had told {{multiple}} employees and two supervisors about his concerns, but the NSA disputes his claim. Snowden elaborated in January 2014, saying [...] " [...] made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go through what [...] Drake did." [...] In March 2014, during testimony to the European Parliament, Snowden wrote that before revealing classified information he had reported [...] "clearly problematic programs" [...] to ten officials, who he said did nothing in response. In a May 2014 interview, Snowden told NBC News that after bringing his concerns about the legality of the NSA spying programs to officials, he was told to stay silent on the matter. He asserted that the NSA had copies of emails he sent to their Office of General Counsel, oversight and compliance personnel broaching [...] "concerns about the NSA's interpretations of its legal authorities. I had raised these complaints not just officially in writing through email, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> supervisors, to my colleagues, in more than one office." ...|$|E

60|$|Just before tea, I strolled down to tell Poirot {{of the new}} disappointment, <b>but</b> found, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> annoyance, that he {{was once}} more out.|$|R

60|$|That evening I {{informed}} Walkirk of the ill {{success of}} my grandmother's mission, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> surprise {{he did not}} appear to be discouraged.|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> surprise, and indignation too, {{she only}} looked humbled. Some tears sparkled in her eyes, {{but they were}} wholly of grief, not anger.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> now, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> chagrin, I saw {{the sails}} on the {{schooner}} being lowered. Then I heard the captain give the command {{to lower the}} boat.|$|R

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>to</b> this <b>my</b> fine {{gentleman in}} t'other boat made no reply except {{to burst out}} once more into a great fit of laughter.|$|R
