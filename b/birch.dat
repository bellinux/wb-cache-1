5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy <b>birch</b> (B. pubescens, the other common European <b>birch)</b> in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy <b>birch),</b> more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy <b>birch),</b> and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy <b>birch).</b> It is also distinguished cytologically, silver <b>birch</b> being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy <b>birch</b> is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver <b>birch</b> found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy <b>birch</b> more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver <b>birch</b> also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy <b>birch,</b> which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|Silver <b>birch</b> {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy <b>birch</b> (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy <b>birch</b> are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver <b>birch</b> are hairless. The leaf base of silver <b>birch</b> is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy <b>birch</b> it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this, <b>Birch</b> has overdosed three times, and wrecked ten cars. <b>Birch</b> entered rehab in 2006, and missed six months of work. After his return, <b>Birch</b> became {{addicted}} to painkillers, due to the facial injury he suffered at the Armageddon pay-per-view in December 2006. After a direct intervention by WWE owner Vince McMahon, <b>Birch</b> was released, and credits this with him beating his addictions.|$|E

5|$|Betula pendula, {{commonly}} known as silver <b>birch,</b> warty <b>birch</b> or East Asian white <b>birch,</b> is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia {{in the mountains of}} northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white <b>birch,</b> and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and in parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The {{closely related}} Betula platyphylla in {{northern}} Asia and Betula szechuanica of central Asia are also treated as varieties of silver <b>birch</b> by some botanists, as B. pendula var. platyphylla and B. pendula var. szechuanica respectively (see <b>birch</b> classification).|$|E
5|$|The larvae of a {{large number}} of species of butterflies, moths and other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of the silver <b>birch.</b> In Germany, almost 500 species of insect have been found on silver and downy <b>birch</b> {{including}} 106 beetles and 105 lepidopterans, with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on <b>birch.</b> <b>Birch</b> dieback disease can affect planted trees, while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible. This disease also affects Betula pubescens and in 2000 was reported at many of the sites planted with <b>birch</b> in Scotland during the 1990s. In the United States, the wood is attacked by the bronze <b>birch</b> borer (Agrilus anxius), an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance.|$|E

5|$|In 1646, the Parliamentary Colonels John <b>Birch</b> and Robert Kyrle marched {{south from}} their {{successful}} Siege of Hereford and besieged the castle, {{with the aim}} of eliminating {{one of the few remaining}} Royalist strongholds. There was some personal animosity between Lingen and <b>Birch,</b> and both were outspoken, impulsive men. Birch's first move was to prevent further attacks from Lingen, and on 9March he burned the weakly defended stables in a surprise night attack, driving away the Royalist horses and temporarily denying the Royalist forces' mobility. <b>Birch</b> was unable to press home his advantage however, and over the next few months Lingen succeeded in replacing some of his horses and resumed his attacks on Parliamentary forces.|$|E

5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of <b>birch,</b> specifically dwarf <b>birch</b> and silver <b>birch.</b> Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are eight to ten species of willow within the national park.|$|E

50|$|<b>Birching</b> {{was a form}} of {{corporal}} punishment used on the Isle of Man during the 1960s and 1970s. It was principally the form of punishment for boys under 15 convicted of stealing, however was altered in 1960 so that <b>birching</b> could be used on males up to 21 years of age. In 1972 the case of Tyrer v The United Kingdom went to Human Rights Court. By a majority of six votes to one, the Court held Tyrer's <b>birching</b> to constitute degrading treatment contrary to the Article 3 of the ECHR. This was labelled a landmark decision by Manfred Nowak, UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It wasn’t until 1993 that <b>birching</b> was formally repealed in the Isle of Man.|$|R
