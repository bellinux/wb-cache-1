40|$|When {{transcription}} by RNA polymerase II {{from the}} major-late (ML) promoter was studied with purified basal transcription factors, {{it was observed}} that transcription from negatively-supercoiled ML templates did not require transcription factor IIH (TFIIH). Addition of the <b>basal</b> <b>factor</b> TFIIE was highly stimulatory, but not absolutely required for this reaction. In contrast, transcription from relaxed or linear ML templates required both TFIIE and TFIIH. Adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), an ATP analog with a non-hydrolyzable beta-gamma phosphoanhydride bond, could support RNA synthesis from supercoiled templates, but not from linear templates. Since AMP-PNP cannot act as a cofactor for the DNA helicase activity of TFIIH, this finding independently supported the conclusion that TFIIH is not required for transcription of negatively-supercoiled templates. Taken together, these data indicate that the ATP-dependent step in transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II is caused by a requirement for the ATP-dependent helicase activity of the <b>basal</b> <b>factor</b> TFIIH. The experiments also show that transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II does not require hydrolysis of the beta-gamma phosphoanhydride bond of ATP per se...|$|E

40|$|A genetic {{polymorphism}} (Arg/Gln 353) of coagulation factor VII was recently identified and {{shown to be}} associated with differences in <b>basal</b> <b>factor</b> VII coagulant activity. Postprandial lipaemia seems to exert an acute but evanescent effect on the activity of factor VII, and the influence of the Arg/Gln 353 polymorphism on factor VII activation during postprandial lipaemia was therefore studied in male post-infarction patients [age 48. 8 +/- 3. 3 years (mean +/- SD) ] with Arg/Arg (n = 23) and Arg/Gln (n = 8) genotypes. Factor VII antigen (VIIag) and activity along with plasma lipoproteins were determined before and after intake of a mixed meal-type of oral fat load. Patients with the Arg/Gln genotype had basal VIIag and activated factor VII (VIIa) levels 75 % and 48 %, respectively, of those of patients homozygous for the Arg allele. In absolute terms, VIIa increased more in homozygotes for the Arg allele (delta 0 - 6 h VIIa 1. 76 +/- 1. 48 ng/ml) than in heterozygotes (0. 60 +/- 0. 27 ng/ml) in response to fat intake, but the percentage increase in VIIa molecules did not differ significantly between subjects with Arg/Arg and Arg/Gln genotypes (37 +/- 32 % versus 27 +/- 15 %). This suggests that the influence of the Arg/Gln polymorphism on factor VII activity is mainly accounted for by differences in the <b>basal</b> <b>factor</b> VII protein level between genotypes. Since most of our lives are spent in the postprandial state, possession of the factor VII-Gln 353 allele is likely to confer protection against coronary heart disease by reducing the amount of VIIa produced in response to fat intake...|$|E

In addition, the small subunit of TFIIE (E 34) directly contacts DNA and TFIIA and thus providing a second mechanism for TFIIE to help binding of a TBP/IIA complex to the promoter, the first critical step in the PIC assembly.

The results obtained by the research are as follows: 1) The estimate values by the Bitterlich method were calculated smaller than the plot sampling on the four areas. This reason is considered that the Standing trees were not counted accurately, that is, many standing trees were missed to count because of the local topography(especially of the inclination) and standing of the forest tree. Moreover, it is seemed to be necessary to take note in a case using a hand-made simple rod. 2) The simple rods, of which <b>basal</b> area <b>factors</b> are l, 4 and l 0, {{were used in the}} research. It is generally practiced that the simple rod with the smaller <b>basal</b> area <b>factor</b> is for young stands and the one with the larger <b>basal</b> area <b>factor</b> is for old stands.

The yeast Ctk 1 kinase associates with elongation complexes and phosphorylates serine 2 in the YSPTSPS repeats of the Rpb 1 C-terminal domain, a modification that couples transcription to mRNA 3 ′-end processing.

The signaling pathways that relay stress and nutrient conditions converge on the conserved protein Maf 1, but how Maf 1 integrates environmental conditions and couples them to transcriptional repression is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Maf 1 is phosphorylated in favorable conditions, whereas diverse unfavorable conditions lead to rapid Maf 1 dephosphorylation, nuclear localization, physical association of dephosphorylated Maf 1 with Pol III, and Maf 1 targeting to Pol III-transcribed genes genome wide. Furthermore, Maf 1 mutants defective in full dephosphorylation display maf 1 D phenotypes and are compromised for both nuclear localization and Pol III association. Repression conditions also promote TFIIIB-TFIIIC interactions in crosslinked chromatin.

However, we found no evidence that UBF could stimulate recruitment or stabilization of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) in reconstituted transcription assays. In this, UBF is fundamentally different from archetypal activators of transcription.

We provide evidence to suggest that UBF activates transcription in the transition between initiation and elongation, at promoter escape by Pol I. This novel role for UBF in promoter escape would allow control of rRNA synthesis at active rDNA repeats, independent of and complementary to the promoter-specific targeting of SL 1 and Pol I during PIC assembly.

40|$|Administered in {{critical}} doses, drugs and chemicals can damage organs and tissues by turning numerous genes on or off. Changes in the expression patterns of target genes indicate toxic action and are manifested as multiple toxicological endpoints detectable by transcriptome analysis. Microarray technology allows measuring transcriptional modulation {{of thousands of}} genes after exposure to xenobiotics. Induction or repression of genes is mediated by an altered protein-DNA binding pattern of nuclear transcription factors (TFs). TFs are regulatory proteins that bind to the promoters or enhancers of their respective target genes and thereby affect gene expression and potentially lead to dysfunction of target organs. Approximately 2000 TFs [1, 2] are responsible for controlling the entire gene expression from development and differentiation to metabolic functions. A major challenge in genomic research today involves identifying more of their respective target genes. Regulation of gene transcription is a multifactorial process. TFs bind to a specific DNA sequence in the control region of a gene and interact with so-called general <b>basal</b> <b>factors</b> to recruit RNA polymerase II to the transcription start site of a gene. These proteins together form a multiprotein complex that permits regulated mRNA synthesis [3]. Initiation of transcription is frequently the result of binding of many different TFs to cognate DNA binding sites, which enables combinatorial control of gene expression. An additional level of complexity is provided by protein-protein interactions between TFs and cofactors and between synergistically acting TFs [4]. The activation of a gene requires accessibility of TFs, cofactors, and <b>basal</b> <b>factors</b> to the regulatory region. Chromatin remodelling complexes change chromatin structure by altering DNA–histone contacts within a nucleosome and make regions of the genome accessible to target transcription factor binding [5]. Several transcriptional coactivators contribute to chromatin remodelling [6]. [ [...] . ...|$|R

We show that binding of xl-mtTFA to a site separating the two clusters of bidirectional promoters selectively stimulates specific transcription in vitro by the basal transcription machinery, comprising mitochondrial RNA polymerase and xl-mtTFB...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe HIV- 1 Tat {{protein is}} {{required}} for viral replication and is a potent stimulator of viral transcription. Although Tat has been extensively studied in various reductive paradigms, to date there is little information as to how this activator mediates transcription from natural nucleosomally packaged long terminal repeats. Here we show that CREB-binding protein (CBP) /p 300 interacts with the HIV- 1 Tat protein {{and serves as a}} coactivator of Tat-dependent HIV- 1 gene expression on an integrated HIV- 1 provirus. The site of acetylation of Tat was mapped to the double-lysine motif in a highly conserved region, 49 RKKRRQ 54, of the basic RNA-binding motif of Tat. Using HLM 1 cells (HIV- 1 +/Tat−), which contain a single copy of full-length HIV- 1 provirus with a triple termination codon at the first AUG of the Tat gene, we find that only wild type, and not K 50 A, K 51 A, or K 50 A/K 51 A alone or in combination of ectopic CBP/p 300, is able to produce full-length infectious virions, as measured by p 24 gag ELISAs. Tat binds CBP/p 300 in the minimal histone acetyltransferase domain (1253 – 1710) and the binding is stable up to 0. 85 M salt wash conditions. Interestingly, wild-type peptide 41 – 54, and not other Tat peptides, changes the conformation of the CBP/p 300 such that it can acquire and bind better to <b>basal</b> <b>factors</b> such as TBP and TFIIB, indicating that Tat may influence the transcription machinery by helping CBP/p 300 to recruit new partners into the transcription machinery. Finally, using biotinylated wild-type or acetylated peptides, we find that acetylation decreases Tat's ability to bind the TAR RNA element, as well as to bind <b>basal</b> <b>factors</b> such as TBP, CBP, Core-Pol II, or cyclin T. However, the acetylated Tat peptide is able to bind to core histones on a nucleosome assembled HIV- 1 proviral DNA...|$|R
40|$|Repression of {{transcription}} by {{the classical}} nuclear receptors (e. g. TR, RAR), the orphan nuclear receptors (e. g. Rev-erbA alpha/beta), Mxi- 1 and Mad bHLH-zip proteins and the oncoproteins PLZF and LAZ 3 /BCL 6 is {{mediated by the}} corepressors N-CoR and SMRT. The interaction of the corepressors with the components involved in chromatin remodelling, such as the recruiting proteins Sin 3 A/B and the histone deacteylases HDAc- 1 and RPD 3, has been analysed in detail. The N-CoR/ Sin 3 /HDAc complexes have {{a key role in}} the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, the interaction of these corepressors with the basal transcriptional machinery has remained obscure. In this study we demonstrated that the N-terminal repression domains and the receptor interaction domains (RID) of N-CoR and its splice variants, RIP 13 a and RIP 13 Delta 1, directly interact with TAF(II) 32 in vivo and in vitro. We show that interaction domain II within the N-CoR and RIP 13 a RID is required for the interaction with TAF(II) 32. We also observed that N-CoR directly interacts with each of the <b>basal</b> <b>factors,</b> TFIIB and TAF(II) 70, and can simultaneously interact with all three <b>basal</b> <b>factors</b> in a non-competitive manner. Furthermore, we provide evidence that suggests the RVR/Rev-erb beta-corepressor complex also interacts with the general transcriptional machinery, and that the physical association of TFIIB with N-CoR also occurs in the presence of Sin 3 B and HDAc- 1. Interestingly, we observed that N-CoR expression ablated the functional interaction between TFIIB and TAF(II) 32 that is critical to the initiation of transcription. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the N-terminal repressor region and the C-terminal RIDs are part of the corepressor contact interface that mediates the interaction with the general transcription factors, and demonstrates that TAFs can also directly interact with corepressors to mediate signals from repressors to the basal machinery. We also suggest that N-CoR interacts with the central components of the transcriptional initiation process (TFIIB, TAFs) and locks them into a non-functional complex or conformation that is not conducive to transcription...|$|R
