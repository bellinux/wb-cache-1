25|$|The FDA {{has been}} criticised for {{allowing}} {{the use of}} recombinant <b>bovine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (rBGH) in dairy cows. rBGH-treated cows secrete higher levels of {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) in their milk than do untreated cows. IGF-1 signalling is thought {{to play a role in}} sustaining the growth of some tumors, although there is little or no evidence that exogenously absorbed IGF could promote tumor growth. The FDA approved rBGH for use in dairy cows in 1993, after concluding that humans drinking such milk were unlikely to absorb biologically significant quantities of bovine IGF-1. A 1999 report of the European Commission Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health noted that scientific questions persist regarding the theoretical health risks of milk from rBGH-treated cows, particularly for feeding to infants. Since 1993, all EU countries have maintained a ban on rBGH use in dairy cattle.|$|E

2500|$|In some countries, {{recombinant}} (GM) {{bovine somatotropin}} (also called rBST, or <b>bovine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> or BGH) is approved for administration to increase milk production. rBST {{may be present}} in milk from rBST treated cows, but it is destroyed in the digestive system and even if directly injected into the human bloodstream, has no observable effect on humans. The FDA, World Health Organization, American Medical Association, American Dietetic Association and the National Institutes of Health have independently stated that dairy products and meat from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption. However, on 30 September 2010, the United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, analyzing submitted evidence, found a [...] "compositional difference" [...] between milk from rBGH-treated cows and milk from untreated cows. The court stated that milk from rBGH-treated cows has: increased levels of the hormone Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1); higher fat content and lower protein content when produced at certain points in the cow's lactation cycle; and more somatic cell counts, which may [...] "make the milk turn sour more quickly." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{biological}} {{activities of}} human (hGH) and <b>bovine</b> (bGH) <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> derivatives obtained by chemical {{modification of the}} lysine residues were studied by radioreceptor assays using rabbit liver homogenates for somatotropic activity (SA). Control treatment with BH 4 − had a very slight effect on the SA, whereas the methylation and ethylation drastically reduced the acitivty of both hormones. Guanidination of these hormones and even acetimidination at a lower rate are accompanied by a considerable loss of biological activity. These results show the involvement of lysine residues in the interaction of hGH and bGH with somatotropic receptors.

5000|$|Bovine {{somatotropin}} or bovine somatotrophin (abbreviated bST and BST), or <b>bovine</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (BGH), is a {{peptide hormone}} produced by cows' pituitary glands.

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{and to use}} {{the effects}} of single genes on quantitative traits, genotypes need to be known. However, in large animal populations, the majority of animals are not genotyped. These missing genotypes have to be estimated. However, currently used methods are impractical for large pedigrees. An alternative method to estimate missing gene content, defined as the number of copies of a particular allele, was recently developed. In this study, the proposed method was tested by assessing its accuracy in estimation and use of gene content in large animal populations. This was done for the <b>bovine</b> transmembrane <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor and its effects on first-lactation milk, fat, and protein test-day yields and somatic cell score in Holstein cows. Estimated gene substitution effects of replacing a copy of the phenylalanine-coding allele with a copy of the tyrosine-coding allele were 295 g/d for milk, - 8. 14 g/d for fat, - 1. 83 g/d for protein, and - 0. 022 /d for somatic cell score. However, only the gene substitution effect for milk was found to be significant. The accuracy of the estimated effects was evaluated by simulations and permutations. To validate the use of predicted gene content in a mixed inheritance model, a cross-validation study was done. The model with an additional regression of milk, fat, and protein yields and SCS on predicted gene content showed a better capacity to predict breeding values for milk, fat, and protein. Given these results, the estimation and use of allelic effects using this method proved functional and accurate. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Transferrin is an iron-binding {{protein that}} is {{expressed}} as a major product in liver and secreted into the plasma. To study the tissue-specific regulatory regions of this gene, the genomic mouse transferrin (mTf) gene was cloned and characterized by partial sequence analysis and S 1 nuclease mapping of the transcriptional start site. Fusion genes containing the transferrin gene promoter and 5 '-flanking sequences were ligated to the human <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (hGH) gene and used to produce transgenic mice. A deletion construct containing the - 581 to + 50 region of the transferrin gene was sufficient to direct {{a high level of}} liver-specific expression resembling endogenous transferrin gene expression. Deletion to - 139 base pairs of 5 '-flanking sequence gave a construct which retained liver specificity, but the magnitude of expression decreased severalfold. These results demonstrate the presence of a liver-specific transcriptional element between - 139 and + 50 and suggest the presence of a distal element between - 581 and - 139 that can further increase expression. Surprisingly, fusion constructs containing - 3 kilobase pairs (kb) of 5 '-flanking sequence gave higher levels of mRNA in nonhepatic tissues than did either the - 581 or - 139 construct. Further studies indicated that the high levels of circulating hGH in these transgenic mice specifically induced the endogenous transferrin and albumin genes in liver and also stimulated the normally low levels of expression of the endogenous transferrin gene in brain, heart, kidney, and muscle. A mutated hGH gene that does not produce active <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> was fused to the - 3 - to + 50 -kb transferrin sequences to produce the - 3 -kb mTf-hGX construct. A liver-specific pattern of expression was observed in transgenic mice harboring the - 3 -kb mTf-hGX construct, and this mutated transgene was shown to be induced four- to sevenfold by either <b>bovine</b> or human <b>growth</b> <b>hormone.</b> These results demonstrate the presence of a growth hormone-responsive element between - 3 and + 50 kb in the 5 '-flanking region of the mTf gene promoter...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{characteristics and}} glycoprotein {{nature of the}} human <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (hGH) receptor in cultured lymphocytes (IM- 9 cell line) were studied {{with the use of}} a bifunctional reagent (disuccinimidyl suberate) to couple 125 I-hGH covalently to intact cells. After cross-linking, the hormone-receptor complexes were analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. A single band of Mr 140, 000 was identified under reducing conditions. The labelling of this band was blocked by unlabelled hGH but not by insulin, ovine prolactin, <b>bovine</b> or ovine <b>growth</b> <b>hormones.</b> The Mr 140, 000 band was immunoprecipitated by either anti-hGH antibody or by a monoclonal antibody against rat liver <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor. In the absence of reductant two major bands of Mr 270, 000 and 140, 000 were found. On two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, with the first dimension in the absence of reductant and the second in its presence, the Mr 270, 000 complex generated the Mr 140, 000 band. The nature of the oligosaccharide chains of the receptor was studied by treatment with different glycosidases. The electrophoretic mobility of the Mr 140, 000 receptor complex was markedly increased after digestion with endoglycosidase F but showed no or little change after digestion with endoglycosidase H. The Mr 140, 000 band was also sensitive to neuraminidase treatment. In addition the 125 I-hGH-receptor complex was adsorbed by immobilized wheat germ agglutinin and to a smaller extent by immobilized concanavalin A, lentil lectin, ricin I and ricin II. In conclusion, taking into account that hGH is a Mr 22, 000 polypeptide, the binding subunit of the GH receptor in human IM- 9 lymphocytes has an Mr of approx. 120, 000. The native receptor may exist as a homodimer of the binding subunit formed by disulphide bonds. Furthermore, the GH receptor subunit contains asparagine N-linked type of oligosaccharide chains.
