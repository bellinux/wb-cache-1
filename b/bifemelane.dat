5000|$|<b>Bifemelane</b> (INN) (Alnert, Celeport), or <b>bifemelane</b> {{hydrochloride}} (JAN), {{also known}} as 4-(O-benzylphenoxy)-N-methylbutylamine, is an antidepressant and cerebral activator that is widely used {{in the treatment of}} cerebral infarction patients with depressive symptoms in Japan, and in the treatment of senile dementia as well. It also appears to be useful in the treatment of glaucoma. <b>Bifemelane</b> acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) of both isoenzymes, with competitive (reversible) inhibition of MAO-A (Ki = 4.20 μM) (making it a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA)) and non-competitive (irreversible) inhibition of MAO-B (Ki = 46.0 μM), [...] and also acts (weakly) as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. The drug has nootropic, neuroprotective, and antidepressant-like effects in animal models, and appears to enhance the cholinergic system in the brain.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>bifemelane</b> [4 -(o-benzylphenoxy) -N-methylbutylamine hydrochloride] on the {{deposition}} of calcium and magnesium in {{central nervous system}} (CNS) tissues, heart, liver, kidney, muscle, abdominal aorta and bones were studied in rats maintained on standard and low-calcium diets. Rats were maintained for 90 days on the followingdiets: standard calcium (12. 5 g/kg diet); standard with 100 mg/kg bi-femelane; low-calcium (30 mglkg diet); and low-calcium with <b>bifemelane.</b> The presence ofbifemelane did not affect blood chemistry, but the magnesium concentration in the cerebellum was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in rats receiving standard diet after <b>bifemelane</b> treatment. Magnesium concentrations in the pons, cerebellum, spinal cord, heart, liver and femur of bifemelane-treated rats fed low-calcium diets were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher compared with the corresponding controls, whereas the calcium concentration in the liver was significantly (P < 0. 05) lower. In general, <b>bifemelane</b> tended to decrease calcium deposition in the CNS and soft tissues of rats fed standard or low-calcium diets. <b>Bifemelane</b> may activate cerebral Receivedfor publication 15 August 1991; accepte...|$|E
40|$|Effects of antioxidants, such as {{superoxide}} dismutase, vitamin C, vitamin E, 4 -(0 -benzylphenoxy) -N-methylbutylamine hydrochloride (<b>bifemelane),</b> and selenite on {{survival of}} adult rat hepatocytes were examined under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions in serum-free primary culture. The tested antioxidants, except for vitamin C, significantly increased the survival rate of hepatocytes under the normoxic condition (under air). Thus, even the normoxic culture condition is hyperoxic for hepatocytes. Elevation of oxygen tension (40 % O 2) caused severe morphologic degeneration of hepatocytes and remarkable {{decrease in the}} survival rate of the cells. Addition of the antioxidants effectively protected hepatocytes from the morphologic degeneration, and significantly improved {{the survival of the}} cells under the hyperoxic condition. These findings indicate that the antioxidants can maintain the long-term survival of hepatocytes in serum-free primary culture. </p...|$|E
