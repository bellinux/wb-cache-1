5|$|Devastated, Darin {{becomes a}} recluse {{living in a}} trailer on the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> coast in California. He finds himself {{out of step with}} {{changing}} music trends, and when he tries to adapt by incorporating folk music and protest songs into his repertoire, he finds himself rejected by the audience that once embraced him. Undaunted, he stages a show, complete with a gospel choir, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, and against all odds it is a huge success.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, Bosworth and her boyfriend, Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgard, parted ways {{after two}} years of dating. In mid-2011, Bosworth began dating American {{director}} Michael Polish, whom she had met earlier that year when he directed her in the film <b>Big</b> <b>Sur.</b> Bosworth and Polish announced their engagement in August 2012, and married on August 31, 2013 in Philipsburg, Montana.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} {{population of}} California sea otters {{was estimated at}} 16,000 before the fur trade began. California's sea otters are the descendants of a single colony of about 50 southern sea otters discovered near Bixby Bridge in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> in 1938. Their principal range has gradually expanded and extends from Pigeon Point in San Mateo County to Santa Barbara County.|$|E
5|$|As the Recovery Program {{achieved}} milestones, a fifth active {{release site}} in Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park, Baja California, Mexico, {{was added to}} the three release sites in California (<b>Big</b> <b>Sur,</b> Pinnacles National Park and Bitter Creek National Wildlife Refuge) and the Vermilion Cliffs release site in Arizona. In early 2007, a California condor laid an egg in Mexico {{for the first time since}} at least the 1930s. The population of the condors has risen due to these wild and also captive nestings.|$|E
5|$|Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia {{has led to}} a {{dramatic}} improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E
5|$|The California condor {{conservation}} project {{may be one}} of {{the most}} expensive species conservation projects in United States history, costing over $35million, including $20million in federal and state funding, since World War II. As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year. However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors. In 2003, the first nestling fledged in the wild since 1981. In March 2006, a pair of California condors, released by Ventana Wildlife Society, attempted to nest in a hollow tree near <b>Big</b> <b>Sur,</b> California. This was the first time in more than 100 years that a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Spacey {{declined}} {{to be paid for}} his work as actor, director, co-writer and producer on Beyond the Sea. A portion of the $25 million budget came from his own Trigger Street Productions. Producer Arthur Friedman, who had shepherded the biopic since 1987, commented that he and Spacey experienced creative differences during pre-production. Friedman remarked that he was not involved with Beyond the Sea once production began in Germany. Filming was originally set to begin in June 2003 before it was pushed to November 7, 2003, lasting until late-January 2004. 80% of Beyond the Sea was shot using sound stages at Babelsberg Studios in Germany and Pinewood Studios in England. Lulworth Cove, Dorset, South West England doubled for Darin's setting of reclusiveness in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur,</b> California. In an attempt to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during {{the early stages of the}} singer's life depicted in the film, Spacey hired prosthetic makeup designer Peter King from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.|$|E
5|$|This decade also {{witnessed}} {{the emergence of}} a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the San Francisco Zen Center, Transcendental Meditation, Soka Gakkai, the Inner Peace Movement, the Church of All Worlds, and the Church of Satan. Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century, many of these new developments were variants of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the Asian Exclusion Act in 1965. In 1962 the Esalen Institute was established in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur,</b> California. It was from Esalen and other similar personal growth centers which had developed links to humanistic psychology that the human potential movement emerged, which would also come to exert a strong influence on the New Age.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{southern}} sea otter's range has continuously expanded from the remnant {{population of about}} 50 individuals in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> since protection in 1911, however from 2007 to 2010, the otter population and its range contracted and since 2010 has made little progress. As of spring 2010, the northern boundary had moved from about Tunitas Creek to a point 2km southeast of Pigeon Point, and {{the southern}} boundary has moved from approximately Coal Oil Point to Gaviota State Park. Recently, a toxin called microcystin, produced by a type of cyanobacteria (Microcystis), seems to be concentrated in the shellfish the otters eat, poisoning them. Cyanobacteria are found in stagnant freshwater enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus from septic tank and agricultural fertilizer runoff, and may be flushed into the ocean when streamflows are high in the rainy season. A record number of sea otter carcasses were found on California's coastline in 2010, with increased shark attacks an increasing component of the mortality. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) do not consume relatively fat-poor sea otters but shark-bitten carcasses have increased from 8% in the 1980s to 15% in the 1990s and to 30% in 2010 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters are {{a classic}} example of a {{keystone}} species; their presence affects the ecosystem more profoundly than their size and numbers would suggest. They keep the population of certain benthic (sea floor) herbivores, particularly sea urchins, in check. Sea urchins graze on the lower stems of kelp, causing the kelp to drift away and die. Loss of the habitat and nutrients provided by kelp forests leads to profound cascade effects on the marine ecosystem. North Pacific areas that do not have sea otters often turn into urchin barrens, with abundant sea urchins and no kelp forest. Reintroduction of sea otters to British Columbia has led to a dramatic improvement in the health of coastal ecosystems, and similar changes have been observed as sea otter populations recovered in the Aleutian and Commander Islands and the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> coast of California However, some kelp forest ecosystems in California have also thrived without sea otters, with sea urchin populations apparently controlled by other factors. The role of sea otters in maintaining kelp forests has been observed to be more important in areas of open coast than in more protected bays and estuaries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> is sparsely {{populated}} with about 1,000 year-round residents, {{according to the}} 2000 U.S. Census, {{about the same number}} of residents found there in 1900. <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> residents include descendants of the original ranching families, artists and writers, service staff, along with wealthy home-owners. These wealthy homeowners, however, are usually only part-time residents of <b>Big</b> <b>Sur.</b> The mountainous terrain, environmental restrictions imposed by the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> Coastal Use Plan, and lack of property and the expense required to develop available land, have kept <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> relatively unspoiled. The economy is almost completely based on service industries associated with tourism.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{well-known}} films located in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> were The Sandpiper starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Eva Marie Saint and Charles Bronson. The 1974 film Zandy's Bride, starring Gene Hackman and Liv Ullmann, {{was based in}} <b>Big</b> <b>Sur.</b> In 2013, Jack Kerouac’s novel <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> was adapted for the film of the same name, starring Kate Bosworth and directed by the actress’ husband, Michael Polish. , 19 movies had been filmed in the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> region, beginning with Suspicion in 1941.|$|E
25|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> {{also is the}} {{location}} of a Catholic monastery, the New Camaldoli Hermitage. The Hermitage in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> was founded in 1957.|$|E

25|$|Many {{residents}} of <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> {{object to the}} rentals. They claim short term rentals violate the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> Local Use Plan which prohibits establishing facilities that attract destination traffic. Short term rentals also remove scarce residences from the rental market {{and are likely to}} drive up demand and the cost of housing. About half of the {{residents of}} <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> rent their residences.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} rest of California, <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> became part of Mexico when it gained {{independence}} from Spain in 1821. Parts of the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> region were included in land grants given by Mexican governors José Figueroa and Juan Bautista Alvarado.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> Marathon is {{an annual}} {{marathon}} that begins south of Pfeiffer <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> State Park and {{ends at the}} Crossroads Shopping Center in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. The marathon was established in 1986 and attracts about 4,500 participants annually.|$|E

25|$|<b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> is {{a region}} of the Central Coast of California where the Santa Lucia Mountains rise {{abruptly}} from the Pacific Ocean. <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> {{is home to a}} wide variety of animals. Mammals include bobcat, weasel, coyote, gray fox and puma. Sea lions, harbor seals, elephant seals, gray whales, sea otters, and several species of sharks can be spotted off the rocky coastline.|$|E
25|$|At {{the county}} level, <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> is {{represented}} on the Monterey County Board of Supervisors by Supervisor Dave Potter.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} European settler in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> was George Davis, who in 1853 claimed a {{tract of land}} along the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> River. He built a cabin near the present day site of the {{beginning}} of the Mount Manuel Trail, just above the location of a cabin later built by John Bautista Rogers Cooper. Born John Rogers Cooper, he was a Yankee born in the British Channel Islands who arrived in Monterey in 1823. To marry and obtain land, he became a Mexican citizen, converted to Catholicism, and was given a Spanish name at his baptism. He married Native American Encarnacion Vallejo and acquired considerable land, including Rancho El Sur, on which he built a cabin in April or May 1861. The Cooper Cabin is the oldest surviving structure in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur.</b> In 1868, Native Americans Manual and Florence Innocenti bought Davis' cabin and land for $50. The second European settlers were the Pfeiffer family from France. Michael Pfeiffer and his wife and four children arrived in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> in 1869 with the intention of settling on the south coast. After reaching Sycamore Canyon, they found it to their liking and decided to stay.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> River {{watershed}} provides {{habitat for}} mountain lion, deer, fox, coyotes and non-native wild boars. The boars, of Russian stock, {{were introduced in}} the 1920s by George Gordon Moore, the owner of Rancho San Carlos. The upstream river canyon is characteristic of the Ventana Wilderness region: steep-sided, sharp-crested ridges separating valleys. Because most of {{the upper reaches of}} the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> River watershed are within the Los Padres National Forest and the Ventana Wilderness, much of the river is in pristine condition.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, seven {{families}} {{formed the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> Land Trust. They envisioned preserving the iconic <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> landscape {{for the benefit}} of future generations. The founding members were Zad Leavy, an experienced attorney and his wife Laela; Sherna and Kipp Stewart; Roger and Beverly Newell; Nancy Hopkins; Lloyd and Pat Addleman; Martin and Suzanne Forster; and Peter Harding. Hopkins, daughter-in-law of Hewlett Packard founder David Packard, became the trust's first president. Attorney Zad Leavy became its first executive director and served for 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Several {{proposals}} for federal administration of <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> {{have emerged in}} the past. All of these have been strongly opposed by county officials, local residents, and property owners.|$|E
25|$|Although some <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> {{residents}} {{catered to}} adventurous travelers {{in the early}} twentieth century, the modern tourist economy began when Highway 1 opened the region to automobiles in 1937, but only took off after World War II-era gasoline rationing ended in the mid-1940s. In 1978, about 1.5 million visitors are estimated to have visited the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> Coast. In 1980, that number had grown to about 3 million visitors a year. Most of the 3 to 4 million tourists who currently visit <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> each year never leave Highway 1, because the adjacent Santa Lucia Range {{is one of the largest}} roadless areas near a coast in the contiguous United States. The highway winds along the western flank of the mountains mostly within sight of the Pacific Ocean, varying from near sea level up to a thousand-foot sheer drop to the water. The highway includes a large number of vista points allowing motorists to stop and admire the landscape.|$|E
25|$|Soto {{has gained}} {{prominence}} via Shunryu Suzuki, who established the San Francisco Zen Center. In 1967 the Center established Tassajara, the first Zen Monastery in America, {{in the mountains}} near <b>Big</b> <b>Sur.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> Land Trust is well-regarded, {{and ranked}} {{alongside}} notable trusts like Washington's San Juan Preservation Trust, Wyoming's Jackson Hole Land Trust, New York's Adirondacks Land Trust, and Maine Coast Heritage Trust.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 2007, McKenna's {{library of}} rare books and {{personal}} notes {{was destroyed in}} a fire at the Esalen Institute in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur,</b> California. An index of McKenna's library was made by his brother Dennis.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{dominant}} overstory plant of the coast live oak woodland habitat, often joined by California bay laurel and California buckeye north of <b>Big</b> <b>Sur.</b> Associated understory plants include toyon, various manzanitas and western poison-oak.|$|E
25|$|Later, on the Spanish {{island of}} Ibiza, he met an Englishwoman, Claire Lydon; {{they married in}} 1958 and moved to California. She died the next year at <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> in an {{automobile}} accident on May 8, 1959.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} was limited as the Santa Lucia Mountains made the area relatively inaccessible and long-term habitation a challenge. Their natives {{who lived in}} the <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> area are estimated from a few hundred to a thousand or more.|$|E
25|$|A US {{fisheries}} service report {{estimates that the}} number of trout in the entire south-central coast area—including the Pajaro River, Salinas River, Carmel River, <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> River, and Little Sur River—have dwindled from about 4,750 fish in 1965 to about 800 in 2005.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} famous people have called <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> home, {{including}} diplomats Nicholas Roosevelt, famed architects Nathaniel Owings and Phillip Johnson, Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, show business celebrities Kim Novak and Allen Funt, and business executives Ted Turner and David Packard.|$|E
25|$|Highway 1 {{was named}} the most popular drive in California in 2014 by American Automobile Association. The section of Highway 1 running through <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> is widely {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most scenic driving routes in the United States, if not the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, {{shortly before}} moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period {{of his life in}} Brooklyn falling in love with June and {{struggling}} to become a writer. Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan. In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His <b>Big</b> <b>Sur</b> and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of stories about his life and friends in <b>Big</b> <b>Sur.</b>|$|E
