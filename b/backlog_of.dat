5|$|On July 27, 2016, in its {{quarterly}} {{report to the}} Securities and Exchange Commission, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft. With a firm order <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year, program accounting {{has been reduced to}} 1,555 aircraft, and the 747 line could be closed {{in the third quarter of}} 2019. In October 2016, UPS Airlines ordered 14 -8Fs to add capacity, along with 14 options, which doubles its official <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{that affect}} water {{supply in the}} United States include {{droughts}} in the West, water scarcity, pollution, a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> investment, concerns about the affordability of water for the poorest, and a rapidly retiring workforce. Increased variability and intensity of rainfall {{as a result of}} climate change is expected to produce both more severe droughts and flooding, with potentially serious consequences for water supply and for pollution from combined sewer overflows.|$|E
50|$|Journalists in Kosovo face {{recurrent}} {{threats and}} attacks. The <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> judicial {{courts and the}} flaws in the judiciary (with inefficient prosecutions) lead to delayed investigations.|$|R
5000|$|Export coal traffic {{required}} a storage capacity of around 200 loaded high-side wagons per day. When colliers were loading, <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> up to 400 wagons could occur.|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} {{assumption is}} that the population <b>of</b> <b>backlogged</b> users is constant and equal to N. According to [11], this assumption is realistic since the separation of time-scales makes the population <b>of</b> <b>backlogged</b> users nearly static; i.e., the population <b>of</b> <b>backlogged</b> users changes much slower than the time-window over which the throughput guarantees are calculated.|$|R
5|$|The strike action {{led to a}} <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> tens of {{millions}} of items of undelivered mail, with an estimated 30 million letters and parcels affected after the first wave of walkouts, and rising to in excess of 50 million following the second. Businesses in London were forced to lay off staff, or defer paying them, generally because they were unable to dispatch goods or couldn't receive payment for them. However, the strikes had less of an impact outside the capital.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversial}} plan, {{known as}} the Major Moves plan, was passed in 2006. The Indiana Toll Road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years {{in exchange for a}} one time payment of $3.85 billion. The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> public transportation projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue for the maintenance of the highway system.|$|E
5|$|Between July and December 1941, the {{garrison}} received 8,500 reinforcements. After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment {{intended for the}} Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels. In addition, the Navy intercept station in the islands, known as Station CAST, had an ultra secret Purple cipher machine, which decrypted Japanese diplomatic messages, and partial codebooks for the latest JN-25 naval code. Station CAST sent MacArthur its entire output, via Sutherland, the only officer on his staff authorized to see it.|$|E
50|$|Many county record offices {{have issued}} printed guides to their collections, {{although}} {{the addition of}} new materials can make these go rapidly out of date. Furthermore, many offices also have considerable <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> uncatalogued materials.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the use of}} private action in federal institutions for relief from disparate racial impacts. The courts have eliminated consideration of § 602 disparate impact regulations {{as the basis for}} a private right of action challenging environmental harms. Legislative action seems unlikely in this era of gridlock and partisan polarization. Agency action seems to offer the most avenues for consideration of environmental justice concerns. However, agencies are bureaucratic and subject to election results, Congressional oversight and budgetary limitations, and <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> determination of environmental justice complaints. Deeply rooted systemic institutional racism further constrains possible reforms to the federal branches of government...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), federal agencies must generally provide access to their information, enabling the public to learn about government operations and decisions. To help ensure proper implementation, the act requires that agencies report annually to the Attorney General on their processing of FOIA requests. For fiscal year 2006, agencies were also to report on their progress in implementing plans to improve FOIA operations, as directed by a December 2005 Executive Order. A major goal of the order was reducing <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> overdue FOIA requests (the statute requires an agency to respond to requests within 20 or, in some cases, 30 working days with a determination on whether it will provide records). For this study, GAO was asked, among other things, to determine trends in FOIA processing and agencies' progress in addressing <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> overdue FOIA requests since implementing their improvement plans. To do so, GAO analyzed 21 agencies' annual reports and additional statistics. ...|$|R
5|$|Biman's {{handling}} of Hajj flights {{has also been}} beset with troubles. In 2005, the State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism resigned after complaints that he set fares too high. In 2006, Biman took the unprecedented step of removing the business–class seats from its dedicated Hajj flights to accommodate more economy-class passengers. Procedural irregularities by the Hajj agencies delayed the confirmation of pilgrims' visas, and Biman had to cancel 19 flights owing to lack of sufficient passengers. Once the situation was resolved, Biman was then unable to offer the required number of flights {{to cope with the}} <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> passengers.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, a {{deputation}} led by Lord Shaftesbury {{was made}} to the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway, proposing that for trains due to arrive in central London prior to 8am, third class tickets should be sold at a fare of 3d providing the return journey was not made before 4pm. By May 1885 both railways had adopted this policy. However, the delays and uncertainty caused by the fares dispute had discouraged prospective tenants, leaving large numbers of properties vacant and causing further building work to slow considerably. In 1887, construction work was temporarily suspended altogether, {{in response to the}} large <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> un-let properties.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{second to}} the 747 as Boeing's most {{profitable}} jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative model in the 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400million of Boeing's pretax earnings in 2000, US$50million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner comprised the bulk of wide-body revenues for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes division. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012. The program <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> 356 orders was valued at US$95billion at list prices in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The ministerial {{reshuffle}} in July 2014 saw Harper {{restored to}} {{office in the}} role of Minister for Disabled People at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). He took over responsibility for the relatively new Personal Independence Payment (PIP), {{as well as for the}} dysfunctional Work Capability Assessment (WCA) used to assess entitlement to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) - a legacy of New Labour. Both operations were plagued by large <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> unassessed claims.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{attempts}} to eliminate <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> DNA samples collected from crime victims and criminal offenders, {{to expand the}} number and type of samples included in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), and to provide legal assistance to survivors of dating violence. The Act amends the DNA Analysis <b>Backlog</b> Elimination Act <b>of</b> 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135) to reauthorize and broaden the number of eligible grantees under the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program. The Act expands eligible grantees to include local units of government and authorizes the appropriation of $151,000,000 each year for fiscal years 2005 through 2009 to states and local units of government to conduct DNA analyses <b>of</b> <b>backlogged</b> DNA samples collected from victims and criminal offenders. Under the Act, the Attorney General may award grants to eligible grantees to alleviate backlogs requiring a forensic science other than DNA analysis pending the state or local unit of government can certify that no significant backlog awaits DNA analysis {{and that there is}} no immediate need for laboratory equipment, supplies, or additional personnel to ensure the timely processing of future DNA evidence. The Act also amends the DNA Analysis <b>Backlog</b> Elimination Act <b>of</b> 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14135) to provide for the use of vouchers or contracts for laboratory services to assist in the reduction <b>of</b> <b>backlogged</b> DNA evidence.|$|R
40|$|To {{illustrate}} {{the extent of}} time lags from manuscript submission to journal publication certain “core” journals in neurology and general medicine have been surveyed. The clinical journals experience less time lag, but {{more of a problem}} with <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> manuscripts, than basic research journals. Most editors of the journals surveyed cited the following as the major causes for publication delay: failure of authors to follow journal requirements, slowness of editorial and referee reviews, and author revisions...|$|R
5|$|Mindful of {{the long}} time {{required}} to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. As of February 2015, the <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft, representing just under three years of current production at 8.3 aircraft per month, causing Boeing to ponder the 2018-2020 time frame. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.|$|E
5|$|On a {{personal}} level, Grace was still unqualified {{as a doctor}} and had a growing family to support, his daughter Bessie being born in May. When not playing cricket, he had to study a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> medical theory. He did not qualify as a doctor {{until the end of}} the following year. He then needed a practice and this was effectively purchased for him by MCC in 1878 after they launched a National Testimonial on his behalf, though the underlying and hopeful purpose of the appeal was to terminate Grace's embarrassing mercenary activity.|$|E
5|$|Ten more {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} by the SECR from Ashford works in June 1920, and to speed delivery the construction of frames, cylinders and side tanks was subcontracted to the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. However, further severe delays at Ashford caused by the <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> repair work meant that the boilers had to be supplied by the North British Locomotive Company. Construction of these locomotives had not begun by 1 January 1923, when the Railways Act 1921 merged the SECR with other railways in southern England to form the Southern Railway.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of {{inflation}} and time discounting on an inventory model with general ramp type demand rate, time dependent (Weibull) deterioration rate and partial <b>backlogging</b> <b>of</b> unsatisfied demand. The model is studied under the replenishment policy, starting with shortages under two different types <b>of</b> <b>backlogging</b> rates, and their comparative study is also provided. We then use the computer software, MATLto find the optimal replenishment policies. Duration of positive inventory level is taken as the decision variable to minimize the total cost of the proposed system. Numerical examples are then taken to illustrate the solution procedure. Finally, sensitivity of the optimal solution to changes of the values of different system parameters is also studied...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a product {{recovery}} system for one product is investigated. The system contains one inventory for returned and recoverable items {{and one for}} serviceable items. Demands are satisfied from serviceable inventory where <b>backlogging</b> <b>of</b> demands is allowed. In addition, {{there is the possibility}} of disposal for the returned products. We assume deterministic but dynamic return and demand rates and a linear cost structure. The Pontryagin maximum principle is used to determine the optimal production, remanufacturing and disposal policy...|$|R

5|$|The {{appointment}} of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One {{of his first}} changes was to clear the classification committee's <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, {{as well as an}} assessment centre to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.|$|E
5|$|After new {{investment}} at board level Revie {{was able to}} spend £25,000 on Everton's Scotland international Bobby Collins, who he installed as captain. Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason. He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus, and though he proved not to {{be as effective as}} during his first spell at Leeds, Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> games {{at the end of the}} season proved too much for Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.|$|E
5|$|Grace {{was living}} in Gloucestershire in 1878. He and his wife Agnes had moved to London in February 1875 when he was {{assigned}} to St Bartholomew's Hospital to further his medical education. They lived in an Earl's Court apartment until autumn 1877 when they returned to Gloucestershire and lived with Grace's elder brother Henry, who was a general practitioner (GP) at Kingswood, near Bristol. The Graces already had two sons and their third child Bessie was born in May 1878. When not playing cricket, Grace had to study a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> medical theory and, after the season ended, {{he was assigned to}} Westminster Hospital for his final year of medical practice; the family moved back to London and lived at Acton until he finally qualified in November 1879.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to naturalisation, the British government can grant settlement to foreign nationals.

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the pricing and lot-sizing problem for a product subject to general rate of deterioration and partial backordering. We use impatience functions to model <b>backlogging</b> <b>of</b> demand. We show that even when lost sale and backorder costs are present, the problem is well posed in the reduced space. We provide an iterative procedure for solving the overall problem. We describe structural properties of the solution for the new model and comment on the recent work incorporating backorder cost. We illustrate the solution procedure for the new model with examples. ...|$|R
40|$|The cost of {{enforcing}} contracts {{is a key}} determinant of market performance. We document this point {{with reference to the}} credit market in a model of opportunistic debtors and inefficient courts. According to the model, improvements in judicial efficiency should reduce credit constraints and increase lending, with an ambiguous effect on interest rates that depends on banking competition and on the type of judicial reform. These predictions are supported by panel data on Italian provinces. In provinces with longer trials or large <b>backlogs</b> <b>of</b> pending trials, credit is less widely available...|$|R

Darwin visited his home in Shrewsbury and saw relatives, then hurried to Cambridge to see Henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue the collections and agreed {{to take on the}} botanical specimens. Darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist, and an excited Darwin went round the London institutions being fêted and seeking experts to describe the collections.

5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty, but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: ordinary and specialised. Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations. Between 2004 and 2012, a system of Gacaca courts was in operation. Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects. The court succeeded in clearing the <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.|$|E
