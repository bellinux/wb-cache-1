5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that have been seen briefly on the island include whooper swans, various species of geese, and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{writing system}} {{is one of}} the {{outstanding}} achievements of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas. It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system {{of more than a dozen}} systems that developed in Mesoamerica. The earliest inscriptions in an identifiably Maya script date back to 300–200 BC, in the Petén Basin. However, this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems, such as the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec scripts. Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century. Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem. By about AD 250, the Maya script had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> formalized and consistent writing system.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Japan {{began its}} southward {{expansion}} by expanding its {{military presence in}} Indochina ("securing 'points d'appui'") and decisively {{increased the number of}} stationed personnel and planes. This provoked the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments to freeze Japanese assets, while the US (which supplied 80 percent of Japan's oil) responded by placing a complete oil embargo on the Japanese Empire. As a result, Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in South-East Asia and its prosecution of the war against China, or seizing the natural resources it needed by force. The Japanese military did not consider the former an option as attacking Soviet Russia instead of expanding into South Asia had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> and more unpopular choice since Japan's humiliating defeat at the Battle of Khalkin Gol in 1939 and the final rejection of any near-term action in Siberia shortly after Germany began its invasion of the USSR. Moreover, many officers considered America's oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war. With the harsh oil sanctions imposed by the United States, the Japanese leadership was now even more determined to remain in China. Germany had refused to sell Japan the blueprints to make synthetic oil, so Japan's only hope for oil was to invade the Dutch East Indies, which would result in war with the United States and Britain. To succeed the Japanese had to neutralize the powerful United States Pacific Fleet, so they could prevent it from interfering with future Japanese movements in South-East Asia and negotiate peace terms from a strong hand.|$|E

25|$|The {{mandolin}} has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> common instrument amongst Irish traditional musicians.

HSwMS Visby and HSwMS Sundsvall were used as target ships before being sold to Spain for scrapping.|$|E

25|$|Kassengift went {{straight}} to No.1 in the German albums chart and this coincided with music television stations MTV and VIVA starting to regularly play Rosenstolz's music. This took AnNaR. and Plate by surprise, who remarked that they had spent six years trying to crack the music stations. The accompanying concert tour was a sell-out, and {{in a review of}} one of the Berlin concerts, Felix Kosel of German music magazine bloom commented that the band's gay audience had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> diverse audience.|$|E
25|$|In a {{continuing}} bid to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> diverse network focusing on youth and culture {{as well as}} music, MTV added animated shows to its lineup in the early 1990s.

In addition to airing original shows created specifically for MTV, the channel also occasionally aired episodes of original cartoon series produced by sister channel Nickelodeon (Nicktoons) in the early 1990s.|$|E

These faculty were to be paid by the grant for three years, but after that time any faculty hired with the Associate or Full Professor designation would become tenured. The Governor and the Chancellor forced Rutgers to lose this grant by rejecting these faculty as tenured.|$|E
