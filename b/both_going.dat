5|$|Throughout the game, nobles regard commoners and peasants as animals, {{and many}} commoners {{try to take}} revenge on the nobles, who {{abandoned}} them after the war. Most joined the so-called Death Corps {{to fight against the}} nobles' soldiers, and many die in vain. Ramza, part of the noble Beoulve family of knights, and Delita, his childhood friend who was an ordinary commoner, are witnesses to this phenomenon. Events such as meeting an arrogant noble named Algus, as well as the negligent killing of Delita's sister Teta during an uprising, cause Delita and Ramza to abandon their ties to the nobility, <b>both</b> <b>going</b> separate ways.|$|E
5|$|Over Romney Marsh Nos. 41, 92 and 222 Squadrons engaged JG 26, {{losing one}} of their number to the Bf 109s. The second wave of RAF fighters arrived on the scene, {{comprising}} 607 and 213 Squadrons with 23 Hurricanes. They initiated a head-on attack against the Do 17s of KG 3. A Hurricane and a Dornier collided, <b>both</b> <b>going</b> down. The Bf 109s {{did their best to}} break up attacks and the bombers held a tight formation, putting up withering cross-fire. The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters. Time and again, they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream, allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process. Soon after, No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes. One fighter was hit by return fire, but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out. The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber. The German bomber crews {{had no way of knowing}} that the crashes were not premeditated. It seemed as if the British were desperate. Nevertheless, they thought the 'tactic' was devastatingly effective. Chastened by losses, the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target.|$|E

5|$|The first {{match of}} the women's finals day, the Western Storm won the toss {{and decided to}} bowl first against the Loughborough Lightning. The Lightning scored 21 runs from the first four overs, before Stafanie Taylor struck twice in the fifth over, dismissing both openers; van Niekerk for 14, and Georgia Elwiss for 6. A 58-run {{partnership}} between Ellyse Perry and Sophie Devine ensued, though neither scored that quickly. The scoring-rate slowed further after Devine's dismissal for 21 runs, but a late surge from Perry and Thea Brookes helped Loughborough reach 124 for seven. Taylor finished the innings with three wickets, while Shrubsole and Dibble were both relatively economical, <b>both</b> <b>going</b> for five-runs per over or less. Beginning their chase, the Storm lost Priest early, bowled by van Niekerk for four runs. Taylor and Knight then shared a 57-run partnership before van Niekerk took the wicket of Taylor for 34. Knight remained in place, reaching a half-century before being dismissed in the final over, with the scores level. Georgia Hennessy came in, and struck four runs from her only ball to secure the victory, and {{a place in the}} final, for the Western Storm.|$|E

25|$|In the law-books (smṛtis and dharma-sūtras, {{like the}} Manu-smṛti), naraka {{is a place}} of {{punishment}} for sins. It is a lower spiritual plane (called naraka-loka) where the spirit is judged and the partial fruits of karma affect the next life. In Mahabharata there is a mention of the Pandavas and the Kauravas <b>both</b> <b>going</b> to Heaven. At first Yudhisthir goes to heaven where he sees Duryodhana enjoying heaven; Indra tells him that Duryodhana is in heaven as he did his Kshatriya duties. Then he shows Yudhisthir hell where it appears his brothers are. Later it is revealed that this was a test for Yudhisthir and that his brothers and the Kauravas are all in heaven and live happily in the divine abode of gods. Hells are also described in various Puranas and other scriptures. The Garuda Purana gives a detailed account of Hell and its features; it lists the amount of punishment for most crimes, much like a modern-day penal code.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{recurring}} storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest {{one of these}} lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates {{about what will happen}} if he wanders off – and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, monkeys, a seal, a snake, a kangaroo and joey, and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and <b>both</b> <b>going</b> to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.|$|E

500|$|Established acts {{benefited from}} the new {{commercial}} climate, with Whitesnake's self-titled album (1987) selling over 17 million copies, outperforming anything in Coverdale's or Deep Purple's catalogue before or since. It featured the rock anthem [...] "Here I Go Again '87" [...] as one of 4 UK top 20 singles. The follow-up Slip of the Tongue (1989) went platinum, but according to critics Steve Erlwine and Greg Prato, [...] "it was a considerable disappointment after the across-the-board success of Whitesnake". Aerosmith's comeback album Permanent Vacation (1987) would begin a decade long revival of their popularity. Crazy Nights (1987) by Kiss was the band's highest charting release in the US since 1979 and the highest of their career in the UK. Mötley Crüe with Girls, Girls, Girls (1987) continued their commercial success and Def Leppard with Hysteria (1987) hit their commercial peak, the latter producing seven hit singles (a record for a hard rock act). Guns N' Roses released the best-selling début of all time, Appetite for Destruction (1987). With a [...] "grittier" [...] and [...] "rawer" [...] sound than most glam metal, it produced three top 10 hits, including the number one [...] "Sweet Child O' Mine". Some of the glam rock bands that formed in the mid-1980s, such as White Lion and Cinderella experienced their biggest success during this period with their respective albums Pride (1987) and Long Cold Winter (1988) <b>both</b> <b>going</b> multi-platinum and launching a series of hit singles.

(1988) by Poison, Pump (1989) by Aerosmith, and Mötley Crüe's most commercially successful album Dr. Feelgood (1989). New Jersey spawned five Top 10 singles, a record for a hard rock act. In 1988 from 25 June to 5 November, the number one spot on the Billboard 200 album chart was held by a hard rock album for 18 out of 20 consecutive weeks; the albums were OU812, Hysteria, Appetite for Destruction, and New Jersey. A final wave of glam rock bands arrived in the late 1980s, and experienced success with multi-platinum albums and hit singles from 1989 until the early 1990s, among them Extreme, Warrant Slaughter and FireHouse. Skid Row also released their eponymous début (1989), reaching number six on the Billboard 200, but they were {{to be one of the}} last major bands that emerged in the glam rock era.|$|E

[...] The first of the Parasols (RAF serial K1228) was initially fitted with a fully slotted wing of the well-used RAF28 section. At one stage the upper surface of its wing was covered in wool tufts and a camera was fitted to a high pylon {{just in front of}} the tail to record their behaviour. The second (K1229) flew with wings having full-span split trailing edges and out-rigged ailerons. 1930 Farnborough records log the two as in the Aerodynamic Flight, with K1228 doing [...] "flight path recorder" [...] work and K1229 [...] "test of wing section".

[...] Additionally, Kingston explained the plot of the video to Rap-Up, commenting, [...] "The video is basically about this girl trying to play both of us and at the end... we end up both at the same place at one time, and she's left with a stupid look on her face." [...] Appearances are made by Bieber's friend, Christian Beadles, as well as rapper Lil Romeo and singer/actress Jasmine Villegas, whose appearance further fuelled media speculation Villegas and Bieber were romantically involved after a previous appearance in his music video for 'Baby'. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News reviewed the video, [...] "Here's the play-by-play: While Kingston and the lady in question are flirting out on the deck, Bieber is chilling inside.
