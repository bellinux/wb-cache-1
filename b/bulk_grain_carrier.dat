40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{presence}} of insects in stored grains {{is a significant}} problem for <b>grain</b> farmers, <b>bulk</b> <b>grain</b> handlers and distributors worldwide. Inspections of <b>bulk</b> <b>grain</b> commodities is essential to detect pests and therefore {{to reduce the risk}} of their presence in exported goods. It has been well documented that insect pests cluster in response to factors such as microclimatic conditions within <b>bulk</b> <b>grain.</b> Statistical sampling methodologies for grains, however, have typically considered pests and pathogens to be homogeneously distributed throughout grain commodities. In this paper we demonstrate a sampling methodology that accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of insects in <b>bulk</b> <b>grains.</b> RESULTS: We show that failure to account for the heterogeneous distribution of pests may lead to overestimates of the capacity for a sampling program to detect insects in <b>bulk</b> <b>grains.</b> Our results indicate the importance of the proportion of grain that is infested in addition to the density of pests within the infested grain. We also demonstrate that the probability of detecting pests in <b>bulk</b> <b>grains</b> increases as the number of sub-samples increases, even when the total volume or mass of grain sampled remains constant. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the importance of considering an appropriate biological model when developing sampling methodologies for insect pests. Accounting for a heterogeneous distribution of pests leads to a considerable improvement in the detection of pests over traditional sampling models. ...|$|R
