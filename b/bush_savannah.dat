50|$|Welfare of {{wild animals}} in captivity {{is a key}} value in {{the vision of the}} park. This is why all the {{different}} species of the park live in surroundings tailored to meet their special needs and instinctive behaviour. The American black bears, for example, have access to both tall trees and lakes in order to facilitate their natural climbing and swimming behaviour. Similarly, the cheetahs live in a hilly <b>bush</b> <b>savannah</b> where these fast predators can spot e.g. antelopes in a different area of the park. This architectural feature of the park evokes instinctive hunting behaviour in the cheetahs even though the animals {{do not have access to}} their prey. In their natural African habitat, cheetahs often observe the savannah from hills and rocks enabling them to find their prey from a long distance.|$|E
50|$|With {{more than}} 22,000 {{different}} higher plants, or about 9% {{of all the}} known species of plants on Earth, South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity. The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the grassland, particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different grasses, low shrubs, and acacia trees, mainly camel-thorn and whitethorn. Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low rainfall. There are several species of water-storing succulents like aloes and euphorbias in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn savannah turns slowly into a <b>bush</b> <b>savannah</b> towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth.

50|$|A {{protected}} area {{was created in}} January 2000 in this ecosystem in the centre of Cameroon, and named the Mbam Djerem National Park. It covers 4200 square kilometres, of which about half is lowland tropical forest, and half is Sudano-Guinean tree and woodland savannah, with a wide ecotone belt between the two. This straddling of two major vegetation zones gives Mbam Djerem probably the highest habitat diversity of all the {{protected area}}s in Cameroon.

Standing on any hilltop in the Park affords a view of ridge after ridge vanishing into the distance, some of them forested, some savannah, and all valleys clothed in a strip of gallery forest along the water’s edge.The Park is watered by the upper Sanaga basin: the main river of the Park is the Djerem, which becomes the Sanaga itself further south.

40|$|Soil {{fertility}} {{restoration and}} crop performance {{in many developing}} countries with low input agriculture strongly relies on fallow duration and management. More precise information about the availability of fallow land may provide a way to improve the simulation of yam (Dioscorea spp.) yields at the regional scale which has hardly been considered in prevailing approaches to model regional crop production. The probable reason behind this is scarce availability of data on fallow duration and variation across the farms in a region. Therefore, this study attempts to estimate effective fallow availability for yam production at the regional scale and to simulate the effect of fallow on regional yam yield. Yam growth and yield were simulated with the EPIC model which was incorporated into a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) covering a typical catchment with variable land use intensity within the sub-humid savannah zone of West Africa. Yam-fallow rotations were simulated within 1120 quasi-homogenous spatial units (LUSAC = Land Use-Soil Association-Climate units) and aggregated to the 121 sub-basins and ten districts within the catchment under three different scenarios of fallow availability: (S 1) Total savannah area was available as fallow land, (S 2) 50 % of the <b>bush</b> <b>savannah</b> was available as fallow land and (S 3) 25 % of the <b>bush</b> <b>savannah</b> was available as fallow land. The aggregation procedure adopted in this study was based on changes in the frequency of fallow-cropland classes within the sub-basins to render the SDSS sensitive to changes in fallow availability. Comparison of the average simulated tuber yield with the observed mean yield over the entire catchment showed that the simulations slightly overestimated the yields by 0. 4 % for scenario S 1, whereas, underestimated by 14. 2 % and 36. 8 % in scenario S 2 and S 3 respectively.

40|$|Abstract. The {{willingness}} {{of a species}} to leave a forest fragment {{is a prerequisite for}} subsequent dispersal across the intervening non-forested landscape. Species with stringent fidelity to the forest patch will be isolated from populations in other fragments and predisposed to factors that promote extinction of local populations. Here, we document which fruit-feeding, forest-dwelling butterflies occur in the farm <b>bush</b> <b>savannah</b> outside an afrotropical forest reserve in order to gain a first approximation of those potentially dispersing across it. Standard fruit-baited traps hung at 80 m inside the forest, the forest edge and 12 and 50 m into the savannah matrix were used to characterize communities in the different habitats. A total of 1616 specimens were collected from the 19 traps, representing 90 species. Rarefied species richness was generally comparable across habitats. Multivariate ordination analyses, which integrate species composition and relative abundance in addition to richness, uncovered two broad community types, i. e. forest (edge plus 80 m inside) and matrix. Relative fidelity to forest habitat was investigated for the 45 species that were represented by at least five individuals. More than half of the forest-associated species showed relaxed fidelity to forest habitat and were commonly trapped in the matrix. Although forest generalists and dry forest species were expected to be more commonly trapped outside the forest relative to wet or moist forest species, there was no relationship between the relative occurrence of species in matrix versus forest habitat and their habitat association category...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{population}} growth and industrial development create problems with water management {{that can lead to}} contamination and scarcity of water resources. The primary aim of the modeling in this study was to assess annual renewal rates of water resources and erosion rates in the Okpara catchment at the Kaboua outlet. The SWAT 2003 model was selected as the most appropriate {{for the purpose of this}} study; it was calibrated and validated for the study basin. Digital elevation model, daily climatic data for 1968 - 2007, soil and land use maps, physical characteristics of soil, physical parameters of crops were all incorporated in the model that divided the whole catchment in to sub-basins and Hydrological Responses Units (HRU). Calibration and validation of data demonstrated that precipitation in the watershed was 1, 075. 8 mm/a. Surface runoff was 106. 6 mm/a (10 % of precipitation), and the total recharge of aquifers was 225. 4 mm/a (21 % of precipitation). The actual rate of evapotranspiration was 759. 8 mm/year (71 % of precipitation). The total volume annually produced in the catchment was about 4 billions m 3; this amounted to more than 500 times the needs of the population, but paradoxically it still suffered from severe water scarcity. Regarding erosion, an average value of 7 t/ha/year was obtained for the watershed with a maximum value for cropland (16. 85 t/ha/a) and the minimum value for <b>bushed</b> <b>savannah</b> (0. 64 t/ha/a).

40|$|In {{northern}} Cameroon like in all Sudano-Sahelian regions, {{women have}} very few rights to trees, although they are key users of tree products. Surveys and feedback sessions were conducted in five villages, each being representative of an agroecological subregion, to understand the disparity between the importance of trees for women and their lack of involvement in tree management. Although women {{are aware of the}} pressure on available tree resources, they feel powerless to do anything about it. Tree management actions women have undertaken or intend to undertake are limited to the vicinity of the homestead. In other places, parkland fields and <b>savannah</b> <b>bush,</b> women are skeptical about and sometimes unaware of actions that could be undertaken. This is mainly due to the existing gender relations. Men have the power over rights of access to trees and make all decisions concerning management of trees in the parklands and savannahs. The gender division of labor is such that women are not involved in tree management. A change in gender relations and a complete reversal of opinion and behavior would be needed for a more balanced involvement of women and men in the management of trees. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Africa's lands - croplands, <b>savannah,</b> <b>bush</b> {{and forests}} - are in danger. Poor land {{management}} is resulting in rapid land degradation: massive soil losses, falling yield potentials, deforestation, {{the disruption of}} water resources, {{and the destruction of}} natural pasture. The same is true {{in many parts of the}} Caribbean and Pacific. Land mismanagement usually results from removing too much, returning too little and cultivating, grazing or cutting too frequently. Land degradation is proceeding so fast that few countries can hope to achieve a sustainable agriculture in the foreseeable future; yet land degradation can be prevented and even reversed. Traditional systems of land use rarely led to rapid deterioration except where large populations were concentrated. Even there, farmers often developed sophisticated and effective conservation measures to overcome the risk of degradation, and to maintain or even raise crop and livestock yields. One such example is southern Ethiopia where the Konso people live in a steep erodible area subject to unreliable rain-fall. Over the years, the Konso have terraced most of their land and developed a complex system of agroforestry and water harvesting. Compost and manure are spread in the fields to maintain fertility, while cattle are stall-fed. The cabbage tree (Moringa stenopetala), from which young green leaves are collected as a vegetable, is planted together with fruit trees in the cropped fields. Planting density is increased on the wetter sites. On steeper slopes, terrace walls are made from double layers of rock, and the space between them is filled with soil and planted with leguminous crops. A variety of annual and perennial crops is sown in staggered or relay-cropping sequences; usually sorghum, finger millet or maize is the main crop, mixed with beans, peas, lentils, fruit trees, medicinal plants, spices, oil-seeds, firewood and timber trees, root crops and cash crops such as cotton and coffee. Another country where effective conservation measures are practiced is Rwanda, one of the most densely populated countries in Africa. Although most d the population remains dependent on agriculture, some families now have only 0. 2 - 0. 5 ha of land to farm. Being a mountainous country with tropical rainfall, there is serious risk of erosion. Under these conditions Rwandan farmers have devised ways of maintaining and even increasing yields while protecting the soil from erosion. Land management is based on stall feeding a cow or several sheep to produce manure for composting. Fodder is grown on the banks of the terraces and is fed, together with vegetable waste, to the animals. The compost is spread on the terraces to in crease the organic content of the soil, thereby increasing its permeability, improving its water storage capacity, raising its fertility and hence increasing crop yields and reducing erosion. Rainwater running off roofs is trapped and stored underground for human and livestock use. Land degradation has many causes and there is no universal solution. But the problems of land degradation can be overcome if each country develops its own conservation strategies, policies and programmes tailored to its own peculiar circumstances. Africa's lands - croplands, <b>savannah,</b> <b>bush</b> and forests - are in danger. Poor land management is resulting in rapid land degradation: massive soil losses, falling yield potentials, deforestation, the disruption of water resources, and the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Farming {{activities}} can be assumed {{to be one of}} several driving forces which lead to continuous deterioration processes of tree and <b>bush</b> <b>savannahs</b> in the Kavango Region of northeastern Namibia. However, these farming {{activities can}} be assumed to be closely connected with securing subsistence needs of peasant farmers. In this context, the present study aims to a) empirically identify objectives of peasant farmers, b) quantify their most prevailing and other possible on-farm and off-farm activities, c) identify optimal farming strategies under important system constraints and their impacts on environmental and socioeconomic aspects and d) identify policyinduced changes to the previously identified optimal farming strategies. Results of this study are intended to a) serve as a solution point for similar problems in related ecological or economic systems and b) be relevant for policy makers to investigate policy impacts on peasant farming strategies. Chapter 2 addresses some major challenges of the Namibian economy. In particular, the agricultural sector and the peasant farming system of the Kavango Region are described. In this environment, agricultural activities are predominantly subsistenceoriented and embedded in a semi-commercial system of imperfect markets. The prevailing farmingsystem comprises of three major elements: a) crop production, b) livestock production and c) natural resource production. By a varying degree, all elements contribute to food security, cash income or domestic usage patterns. Hence, an important internal driving force which causes (over) usage or depletion of natural resources is the obligation to secure substantial living needs. This aspect is further discussed by giving an outline of a) environmental and socioeconomic threats as well as b) possible coping strategies. Chapter 3 illustrates the theoretical background of the present study by discussing two different methodological approaches. Peasant farmers in the research area can be as-sumed to be both producers and consumers. This aspect determines the first considered methodological approach. Several concepts of farm household (FHH) models reflect non-separability under specific assumptions and imply certain benefits and limitations. This study uses a FHH model which is primary based on Barnum and Squire. However, it is supplemented by features from Chayanov and Low. Economic farm activities are influenced by the natural resource base and vice versa. This aspect determines the second considered methodological approach. In order to reflect economic and environmental dynam-ics, bio-economic models (BEM) are wellknown tools. Hence, important facets of BEMs and their applications to various research tasks and areas are briefly outlined. This study develops a multiannual programming optimisation model (MAPOM) which is based on theories of FHHs and BEMs. MAPOM represents a typical village with two non-separable and non-interacting gender-specific FHH categories and includes some bio-physical features. Both FHH categories are equally equipped with several farm assets but follow different objectives. Utility is maximised for both FHH categories by consuming several goods and services which are generated by participating in different farm and off-farm activities. One major constraint which needs to be respected is food security. Biophysical dynamics are addressed by a) including rainfall in all on-farm production functions, b) updating the resource base each year and c) calculating a ‘native biomass loss’ index for each farming element. Chapter 4 consists of two parts which describe the data base of MAPOM. Primary data is predominantly obtained by a case study on farming systems (CSFS). Outcomes of the CSFS build the basis of all relevant parameter calculation processes (e. g. static input-output relationships). Moreover, a review of region-specific publications is supplemented to validate calculation outcomes and to fill data gaps. In a second part, this chapter de-picts the methodological approach of a traditional conjoint analysis (TCA). This method is used to identify objectives of peasant farmers. A brief outline of the research design is specified after a description of the theoretical foundation of TCAs and their applications in developing countries. Results of this analysis generated weighting factors for the arguments of the objective function used in MAPOM. Since these results showed some gender specifications, MAPOM distinguishes in this point between female and male-headed FHH. Chapter 5 presents the model framework and the mathematical model formulations. Generally, it embeds the previously determined static input-output combinations in dy-namic ecological and economic relationships, in terms of equations. These equations are specified for each farming element and off-farm activity in MAPOM. Moreover, the most important consumption patterns are outlined along with production functions. As an example, equations are specified for cattle dynamics, annual growth of native biomass and population dynamics. Linkages of the different farming system elements become apparent in exchange relationships specifically between livestock and crop production. In addition, attention is paid to the description of system-related constraints. They are imple-mented in MAPOM to mirror the prevailing conditions in the research area. A final section presents the development of the objective function. Chapter 6 illustrates the results of four different scenarios simulated by MAPOM. In general, all different farming elements and off-farm activities are represented to a varying degree in the optimal solution of the baseline scenario. Cattle production plays a minor role in optimal farming strategies. Results indicate that land and labour are limiting fac-tors. A trade-off between food security and native biomass conservation is apparent. To some degree, native biomass could be potentially conserved without tremendously threat-ening food security. Scenario 2 involves a modification of the cattlekeeping element in the objective function. Then, cattle production is slightly intensified at the costs of crop production activities. Simultaneously, overcompensations of nutrition requirements and potentials of native biomass conservation are reduced. Scenario 3 addresses the enforcement of a fee system for natural resources usage and considers an increased land endowment. Impacts of these changes on optimal farming strategies are rather small. However, in some cases farmers use even more land for cultivation, instead of conserving native natural resources. In a final scenario, weighting factors in the objective function are modified. Generally, average weighting factors (over both genders) are suitable to reflect optimal farming strategies of both genders to some degree. Contrarily, equal weighting factors underestimate or overestimate optimal production levels. Hence, they do not reflect actual native biomass destruction potentials. Results of all scenarios indicated that FHHs are highly attracted to labour-saving technologies or activities which demand little labour. Hence, family labour {{is one of the most}} prominent limiting factors. This factor might, however, be threatened in the future by several socioeconomic developments. Therefore, it seems to be of high relevance to promote labour-saving devices for the different farming activities of peasant farmers in the research area...|$|R
