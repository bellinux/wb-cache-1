40|$|Objectives. <b>Foods</b> {{containing}} <b>bioengineered</b> (also {{referred to}} as “genetically-engineered”) ingredients are prevalent in U. S. grocery stores. The belief that adverse human health effects can result from consuming <b>bioengineered</b> <b>foods</b> has prompted consumer groups to urge mandatory labeling of <b>foods</b> containing <b>bioengineered</b> ingredients. This report reviews the potential adverse health effects of <b>bioengineered</b> <b>foods,</b> and implications for labeling are addressed. Data Sources. Literature searches were conducted in the PubMed database for English-language articles published between 2000 and 2012 using the search terms “genetically modified food,” “genetically engineered food, ” and “bioengineered food, ” combined with the terms “health,” “safety, ” and “labeling. ” To capture other reports, news articles and press releases, Google searches were conducted using the same search terms. Additional articles were identified by manual review of the captured literature citations. Results. <b>Bioengineered</b> <b>foods</b> have been consumed for close to 20 years, and during that time, no overt consequences on human health have been reported and/or substantiated in the peer-reviewed literature. However, a small potential for adverse events exists, due mainly to horizontal gene transfer, allergenicity, and toxicity. Pre-market safety assessments are designed to identify an...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{modified}} (GM) crops bioengineered to express agronomic traits including herbicide resistance and insect tolerance have been commercialized. Safety studies conducted for the whole grains and food and feed fractions obtained from GM crops (i. e., <b>bioengineered</b> <b>foods)</b> bear similarities to and distinctive differences from those applied to substances intentionally added to foods (e. g., food ingredients). Similarities are apparent in common animal models, route of exposure, duration, and response variables typically assessed in toxicology studies. However, because of differ-ences in the nutritional and physical properties of <b>food</b> ingredients and <b>bioengineered</b> <b>foods</b> and in the fundamental goals of the over-all safety assessment strategies for these different classes of sub-stances, there are recognizable differences in the individual compo-nents of the safety assessment process.

5000|$|Public Law 114-214 is {{the federal}} law of the United States that regulates GMO food labeling. It was enacted on July 29, 2016 when President Obama signed then Senate Bill 764 (S.764). While the law is officially termed A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Sea Grant College Program Act, and for other purposes, it evolved over time into [...] "the {{legislative}} vehicle for a measure concerning <b>bioengineered</b> <b>food</b> disclosure". The bill was crafted by Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). The [...] "GMO labeling bill" [...] was introduced by its sponsor, Sen. Roger F. Wicker (R-MS), cosponsored by Sen.

5000|$|While the FDA is {{responsible}} for protecting and promoting public health through the control and supervision of food safety, the agency holds the position that [...] "the use of genetic engineering {{in the production of}} food does not present any safety concerns for such foods as a class", and , as there is [...] "an absence of reliable data indicating safety concerns" [...] with GMO foods as a class, voiced no opposition for USDA having the responsibility of regulating GMO food labeling. [...] The agency commented that the bill has language that may allow GMO material to escape labeling: the bill requires labeling if the food contains “genetic material”, but that may exempt secondary products like oil, starches, sweeteners, or proteins derived from GMO substrates. The agency questioned the specificity of the definition of <b>bioengineered</b> <b>food</b> when it would not apply to GMOs that could also be achieved by ‘conventional breeding”. The FDA has also voiced some concerns about food information being presented in electronic codes.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{determinants}} of the adoption of genetically modified (GM) corn and soybean varieties by Iowa producers using data collected from a survey of producers. The representative respondent increased or held constant his GM soybean acreage but decreased his GM corn acreage. Agreement {{with the statement that}} consumers will not accept some <b>bioengineered</b> <b>foods</b> was associated with a significant decline in the intended share of acreage devoted to GM corn but had no explanatory power for GM soybean planting intentions. Risk attitudes did not prove to be a significant explanatory factor, perhaps due to the existence of production risk and price risk, which may have offset each other in the acreage allocation decision. Other significant factors included gross farm income, the previous year’s acreage allocation, agreement with the statement that farmers will benefit from biotechnology, years of schooling (soybeans only), total corn acreage (corn only), and concern regarding European corn borer yield damage (corn only). An increase in gross farm income was associated with an increase in the share of GM acreage for both crops. The previous year’s GM acreage share for that crop was highly significant...|$|R

The willingness to consumer three difference GM foods is modeled in terms of consumersÂ’' economic, demographic, and value attributes. Empirical results indicate that respondentsÂ’' attitudes and perceptions of biotechnology and their views about various private and public institutions associated with this technology are important determinants of their acceptance of food biotechnology. We find that attitudinal variables have greater influence on the acceptance of food biotechnology than do consumers'Â’ economic and demographic attributes. We find significant difference in consumer attitudes between plant- and animal-based <b>bioengineered</b> <b>food</b> products. Compared to plant-based products, there is far less consensus on the acceptance of genetic modification in animals. Consumer/Household Economics, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E
40|$|IV ABSTRACT Public {{acceptance}} of {{new food products}} will be the major determinant of their commercial success. I present selected findings from two national social science research projects aimed at gauging consumer knowledge of and understand-ing consumer attitudes about biotechnology, as well as about the specific use of genetic engineering in milk production. People {{are more willing to}} accept products if they understand them and are assured by credible sources that such products are safe and effec-tive. Perceived health concerns and ethical issues will be important to many people and are an important challenge to acceptance. Women tend to be more skeptical about these new products than are men. I make recommendations for more-effective educational efforts, based on social science research, that could increase ac-ceptance by key consumer groups and, ultimately, the commercial success of <b>bioengineered</b> <b>food</b> products.

40|$|Biotechnology {{refers to}} the broad set of {{techniques}} that allow genetic manipulation of organisms. The techniques of biotechnology have broad implications for many industries, however it promises the greatest innovations {{in the production of}} products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Like many other powerful new technologies, biotechnology may carry risks as well as benefits. Several of its applications have engendered fervent emotional reactions and raised serious ethical concerns, especially internationally. ^ First, in my paper I discuss the historical and technical background of biotechnology. Second, I examine the development of biotechnology in Europe, the citizens 2 ̆ 7 response to genetically modified (“GM”) foods and the governments 2 ̆ 7 response. Third, I examine the regulation of <b>bioengineered</b> products and <b>foods</b> in the United States. ^ In conclusion, there are various problems with the current status of regulation of GM foods in the United States. These are four basic flaws: (1) the Coordinated Framework allows for too much jurisdictional overlap of biotechnological foods, (2) GM foods are considered GRAS and consequently, are placed on the market without pre-market approval, (3) federal mandatory labeling of GM foods cannot occur until {{the question of whether or}} not nondisclosure of a genetic engineering production processes is misleading or material information and (4) an independent state-labeling scheme of GM foods will most likely impede interstate commerce. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate as}} to whether to require {{mandatory}} labeling of genetically modified organism (GMO) foods was partially settled on 29 July 2016, when President Obama signed the National <b>Bioengineered</b> <b>Food</b> Disclosure Standard into public law. In contrast to precipitating legislation passed by the State of Vermont that required disclosure of GMO ingredients on food shelves or food packages, the superseding National Standard allows firms to disclose bioengineered ingredients to consumers via symbols, electronic or digital links, or phone numbers, and further requires a study assessing the ability of consumers to access disclosure information by these means. This communication analyzes survey responses from 525 adults to investigate whether U. S. consumers are able to obtain information as per the disclosure methods allowed in the Federal legislation. The survey probes deeper to investigate consumer perceptions of genetically modified organisms and whether consumers would use the tools available to access disclosure about bioengineered ingredients. Findings from the survey show that 93. 8 % of respondents {{have the ability to}} access information via the disclosure methods permitted. Those in the lowest income group, and from the oldest age group are least likely to have such access. This provides the United State Department of Agriculture with information relevant to how they can implement the law and highlights particular demographic segments that may require additional attention to ensure the disclosed information is universally accessible...|$|E
