5|$|Capcom began {{development}} knowing {{they wanted to}} make a survival horror game with a lead female character. Believing that the female lead would not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> with retailers and players alike, they added in a dog partner that could attack enemies. After this change, they further designed the gameplay around this partner mechanic. The cinematics were directed by actor and director, Naoto Takenaka. He directly supervised the motion capture performances used for all the characters, placing emphasis on dramatic performance. Takenaka played the motion capture role for Riccardo, and Japanese actors Yasue Sato and Jiro Sato played Fiona and Debilitas respectively. Rather than streaming audio files, the music for Haunting Ground was generated by using the PS2's built-in sounds. This way, the composers could easily change the tempo of the music during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|The club's League title win in 1986 {{saw them}} {{qualify for the}} European Cup in 198687, where Celtic {{eliminated}} Shamrock Rovers 30 on aggregate in the first round. The next round saw Celtic take on Soviet champions Dynamo Kyiv, a side comprising {{a large number of}} players in their national side. A hard-fought 11 draw in the first leg at Parkhead did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for the return match in Kiev. Oleh Blokhin's free-kick in the second leg gave the Soviet's an early lead, but Mark McGhee levelled the tie shortly after half-time. Dynamo regained the lead later on in the second half, but Celtic continued to press. A late third goal from Dynamo, however, saw them clinch the tie.|$|E
5|$|Command, control, and {{coordination}} {{of the operation}} {{was going to be}} problematic, especially in the highly politicized South Vietnamese command structure, where the support of key political figures was of paramount importance in promotion to and retention of command positions. Lieutenant General Lê Nguyên Khang, the Vietnamese Marine Corps commander and protege of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky, whose troops were scheduled to participate in the operation, actually outranked General Lãm, who had the support of President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The same situation applied to Lieutenant General Dư Quốc Đống, commander of ARVN Airborne forces also scheduled to participate in the operation. After the incursion began, both men remained in Saigon and delegated their command authority to junior officers rather than take orders from Lãm. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for the success of the operation.|$|E

5|$|Most in {{the crowd}} {{believed}} they knew what would follow; Constantine and Maxentius, the only adult sons of a reigning emperor, men who had long been preparing to succeed their fathers, would be granted the title of caesar. Constantine had traveled through Palestine at the right hand of Diocletian, and {{was present at the}} palace in Nicomedia in 303 and 305. It is likely that Maxentius received the same treatment. In Lactantius' account, when Diocletian announced that he was to resign, the entire crowd turned to face Constantine. It was not to be: Severus and Maximin were declared caesars. Maximin appeared and took Diocletian's robes. On the same day, Severus received his robes from Maximian in Milan. Constantius succeeded Maximian as augustus of the West, but Constantine and Maxentius were entirely ignored in the transition of power. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for the future security of the tetrarchic system.|$|E
5|$|Prospects for a {{successful}} release did not look good. Aykroyd and Belushi had left SNL {{at the end of}} the previous season, reducing their bankability. Belushi's fame had taken a further hit after the commercial and critical failure of 1941 {{at the end of the}} year. One day after the editing was done, Wasserman invited Landis up to his office to speak with Ted Mann, head of the Mann Theatres chain, which dominated film exhibition in the Western United States. He told Landis that he would not book the film at any theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods, such as Westwood. Not only did Mann not want black patrons going there to see the film, he surmised that white viewers were unlikely to see a film featuring older black musical stars. Ultimately The Blues Brothers got less than half the bookings nationwide for its initial release than a typical big-budget studio film of the era, which did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for its success at the box office.|$|E
25|$|Pippen {{is remembered}} {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} defenders ever to play the game, and one of the most versatile and agile players overall. Much like fellow Chicago Bull Michael Jordan, he provided tenacious on-the-ball perimeter defense, or tough interior defense, and was particularly effective as a help defender. He was gifted with extraordinary athleticism, even compared with other professional athletes, and skills in areas that <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for basketball.|$|E

His friendship with Galileo began to take second place to his feelings of persecution and fear for his own life.

Only on 12 May did operations of the combined Austro-Dutch forces resume near Le Cateau-Cambrésis. A chance to cut off Pichegru was missed, however, because of hesitation by the Emperor. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> {{for the remainder of the}} campaign.

25|$|Contact with Europeans {{brought a}} series of devastating {{epidemics}} of diseases from Europe the people had no immunity to. The result was a dramatic population collapse, culminating in the 1862 Smallpox outbreak in Victoria that spread throughout the coast. European settlement did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for the remaining native population of British Columbia. Colonial officials deemed colonists could make better use of the land than the First Nations people, and thus the land territory be owned by the colonists. To ensure colonists {{would be able to}} settle properly and make use of the land, natives were relocated onto reserves, which were often too small to support their way of life. By the 1930s, British Columbia had over 1500 reserves.|$|E

After the war, he moved his family to Bloomington, Illinois for a brief time and was {{appointed}} editor of the Bloomington Republican, but the family returned to Canton in 1867. Remington was the only child of the marriage, and received constant attention and approval. He was an active child, large and strong for his age, who loved to hunt, swim, ride, and go camping. He was a poor student though, particularly in math, which did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for his father's ambitions for his son to attend West Point.

25|$|The Vikings {{boosted by}} return of Captain Ian Cahill {{for the final}} felt {{it was time for}} them to win their first {{silverware}} since 2010. However, the Trinity team who had scouted the previous game and had fresh legs started quick and were 2 scores up within the first quarter. The Vikings rattled responded positively with some outstanding Defensive play from the entire squad Ian Cahill, Donogh Flannery, Pat Noonan, Brian Kelly, Rob Crimin, Lorcan Crean, Ray Burke, Craig Switzer, Kevin Flaherty, Bono and Alvaro. However, despite several turnovers the Vikings offence struggled and the 2 games started to take their tole on an impressive offensive line. The Vikings played out the game and ultimately the scores remained 14–0. The Vikings battled valiantly with their most impressive rookie class in memory which surely <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for the coming season. Impressive displays by the entire team and toughness shown by the offence through their struggles showed positive signs for the Vikings going forward. The Vikings then regrouped and disbanded before pre-season training began again in mid-January. With some hard work on offence and continued effort on Defence the Vikings team looks like it's ready for big things n 2014.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as was the story of their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{marketing}} campaigns {{in the early}} 1980s was successful in increasing patronage of the Board's buses, culminating in an improvement of 10.3% being reported in the 1984 Annual Report. This was also a time of increasing economic troubles for the country, typified by a dramatic rise in inflation. Following {{the end of a}} price and wage freeze, inflation again began to rise sharply, prompting the Tramways Union to campaign for an increase in allowances to cover cost-of-living increases for its members. This resulted in a series of 24- and 48-hour strikes from 8 November 1985 when the Board was not agreeable to their demands, to which the Board responded with a lock-out on 3 December. Fifteen days of industrial action followed, at the conclusion of which the striking staff returned to work having failed to secure any concessions from the Board. Some conditions were curtailed, and the liberal approach to various employment matters that workers had enjoyed was replaced by a hard-liner stance. To make up for revenue forgone during the strikes, fares were raised by 33%. This did not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> with passengers, and when combined with the loss of goodwill from the recent industrial action, they deserted the buses {{to the extent that the}} Board lost around half of the improvement in its patronage of recent years. With the general economic malaise that followed, patronage of the Board's services never recovered to previous levels.|$|E

25|$|Having survived section 98, and {{benefiting from}} the public sympathy wrought by persecution, Communist Party members set out to {{organize}} workers in the relief camps {{set up by the}} Unemployment and Farm Relief Act. Camp workers laboured on a variety of infrastructure projects, including such things as municipal airports, roads, and park facilities, along with a number of other make-work schemes. Conditions in the camps were poor, {{not only because of the}} low pay, but also the lack of recreational facilities, isolation from family and friends, poor quality food, and the use of military discipline. Communists thus had ample grounds on which to organize camp workers, although the workers were there of their own volition. The Relief Camp Workers' Union was formed and affiliated with the Workers' Unity League, the trade union umbrella of the Communist Party. Camp workers in BC struck on 4 April 1935, and, after two months of protesting in Vancouver, began the On-to-Ottawa Trek to bring their grievances to Bennett's doorstep. The Prime Minister and his Minister of Justice, Hugh Guthrie, treated the trek as an attempted insurrection, and ordered it to be stopped. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) read the Riot Act to a crowd of 3,000 strikers and their supporters in Regina on 1 July 1935, resulting in two deaths and dozens of injured. All told, Bennett's anti-Communist policy would not <b>bode</b> <b>well</b> for his political career.|$|E
