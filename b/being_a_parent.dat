She contacts Ben {{for the first time}} since their one-night stand to tell him. Although insensitive at first, Ben says he will be there to support Alison. While he is still unsure about <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent,</b> his father (Harold Ramis) is excited. Alison's mother (Joanna Kerns) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give their relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Stanford University {{professor}} Shelley Correll {{and colleagues}} (2007) sent {{out more than}} 1,200 fictitious résumés to employers in a large Northeastern city, and found that female applicants with children were {{significantly less likely to}} get hired and if hired would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children. This {{despite the fact that the}} qualification, workplace performances and other relevant characteristics of the fictitious job applicants were held constant and only their parental status varied. Mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent.</b> In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers. The researchers review results from other studies and argue that the motherhood role exists in tension with the cultural understandings of the [...] "ideal worker" [...] role and this leads evaluators to expect mothers to be less competent and less committed to their job. Fathers do not experience these types of workplace disadvantages as understandings of what it means to be a good father are not seen as incompatible with understandings of what it means to be a good worker.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{explores the}} views and {{experiences}} of teenage parents as service users of universal child and family health care services. The focus {{of this study was}} to reveal lived experience from the emic perspective. For this purpose interpretive hermeneutical phenomenology underpinned by Martin Heidegger 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical perspective was utilized. Thus, this study 2 ̆ 7 s phenomenological focus emphasised the explication of 2 ̆ 7 Being 2 ̆ 7, in this instance 2 ̆ 7 <b>being</b> <b>a</b> teenage <b>parent</b> service user 2 ̆ 7 and the exploration of that existence. The thematic analysis of the data revealed phenomenological findings represented in themes and subthemes of the phenomenon of both <b>being</b> <b>a</b> teenage <b>parent</b> service user of universal child and family health care services and of being in the world of the teenage parent. These themes included; being in the world of the teenage parent, being supported and helped and encounters with service entities as a service user. In the context of presenting these findings 2 ̆ 7 world 2 ̆ 7 in this instance was viewed from the ontological perspective of 2 ̆ 7 <b>being</b> <b>a</b> teenage <b>parent</b> service user 2 ̆ 7. Following the initial explication of the phenomenological findings it was evident that participants 2 ̆ 7 existence was impacted by other people, processes and structures within their world. From these viewpoint critical realist principles using Derek Layder 2 ̆ 7 s (1997) Theory of Social Domains was used to explicate the causative mechanisms within social life that shaped the lived experience of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> teenage <b>parent</b> service user. The culmination of utilizing both a phenomenological and critical realist approach facilitated the explication of lived experience within the social context. The conceptualization of 2 ̆ 7 <b>being</b> <b>a</b> teenage <b>parent</b> service user 2 ̆ 7 revealed existence shaped by ideological social norms of the teenage parent. These understandings served to shape the personal and social sense of self contributing to the sense of difference, stigma and othering experienced. The negotiation of social milieu at the personal, interactional and contextual level revealed a struggle for participants in challenging the effects of social norms. This negotiation revealed the experience of 2 ̆ 7 <b>being</b> <b>a</b> teenage <b>parent</b> service user 2 ̆ 7 as dependent on how others in their world viewed them. It reveals the inherent power of others to shape the teenage parents existence. It reveals the struggle teenage parents have to strive toward future goals and ambitions drawing on both material and cultural resources that facilitate these goal...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the course}} of the forenoon I {{encountered}} Mr. Howes in the street. He looked most exceedingly depressed, and, pressing my hand with peculiar emphasis, said that he was in great affliction, having just heard of his son George's death in Cuba. He seemed encompassed and overwhelmed by this misfortune, and walks the street as in a heavy cloud of his own grief, forth from which he extended his hand to meet my grasp. I expressed my sympathy, which I told him I was now the more capable of feeling in a father's suffering, as being myself the father of a little girl,--and, indeed, the <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> does give one the freedom of a wider range of sorrow as well as of happiness.

"I {{perceive}} by {{the letters}} {{you have given}} me, my son, that your mother's family had imbibed the opinion, that I was John Assheton, of Lancaster, a man of singular humours, who had made an unfortunate marriage in Spain, and whose wife, I believe, is still living in Paris, though lost to herself and her friends. My kinsman lived retired, and never recovered the blow. As {{he was one of}} the only persons of the name, who could have married your mother, her relatives appear to have taken up the idea that he had been guilty of bigamy, and of course that Paul was illegitimate. Mr. Warrender, by his letters, appears even to have had an interview with this person, and, on mentioning his wife, was rudely repulsed from the house. It was a proud family, and Mildred being dead, the concealment of the birth of her child was resorted to, as a means of averting a fancied disgrace. As for myself, I call the all-seeing eye of God to witness, that the thought of my <b>being</b> <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> never crossed my mind, until I learned that a John Assheton was the father of Paul, and that the miniature of Mildred Warrender, that I received at the period of our engagement, was the likeness of his mother.

40|$|Facing {{the death}} of a loved one is often a {{traumatic}} experience; when the deceased is one 2 ̆ 7 s own child, the loss may be the most stressful event of one 2 ̆ 7 s life. There has been very little research into the phenomenon of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bereaved <b>parent.</b> This study is a phenomenological investigation into the lived experience of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bereaved <b>parent</b> and whether resilience or recovery plays a role in how parents move through and eventually past such a loss to continue with their own lives. Previous research has indicated that adjustment to traumatic experiences can take multiple pathways or trajectories, depending on a variety of factors within the individual coping with the stressful event. This study involved an investigation into these pathways through the lived experiences of those who suffered the loss of a child, in an effort to determine whether resilience or recovery influenced <b>a</b> <b>parent</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ability to survive the death. Ten bereaved parents were interviewed to learn whether resilience or recovery affected their ability to cope and function in a healthy way despite the loss. These interviews were analyzed to determine whether there were common themes among unrelated bereaved parents, and whether they resonated with the concept of resilience or that of recovery. The results of this study indicated resilience to be a healthier method of adjustment for bereaved <b>parents,</b> with recovery <b>being</b> <b>an</b> almost offensive concept for those who participated. These results allow for a greater understanding of the lived experience of <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bereaved <b>parent,</b> as well as instruct those in helping professions in how best to serve bereaved parents who need to adapt to new lives that now proceed without the beloved child...|$|R
