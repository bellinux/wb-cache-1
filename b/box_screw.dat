6000|$|We {{have had}} weather here, since five o'clock this morning, after your own heart. Suppose {{yourself}} the Admiral in [...] "Black-eyed Susan" [...] after the acquittal of William, {{and when it}} was possible to be on friendly terms with him. I am T. P.[4] My trousers are very full at the ankles, my black neckerchief is tied in the regular style, the name of my ship is painted round my glazed hat, I have a red waistcoat on, and the seams of my blue jacket are [...] "paid"--permit me to dig you in the ribs when I make use of this nautical expression--with white. In my hand I hold the very box connected with the story of Sandomingerbilly. I lift up my eyebrows as far as I can (on the T. P. model), take a quid from the <b>box,</b> <b>screw</b> the lid on again (chewing at the same time, and looking pleasantly at the pit), brush it with my right elbow, take up my right leg, scrape my right foot on the ground, hitch up my trousers, and in reply to a question of yours, namely, [...] "Indeed, what weather, William?" [...] I deliver myself as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{manufacture}} of the drum also has changed. In the past {{it was not possible}} to commission a blacksmith for a <b>box</b> and <b>screws.</b> The people used their ingenuity with laths, to constitute the base of the drum. In those cases the skins were tightened using some holes punched in the rings and winding a cord to constrict them. The strings were made with intestines of animals. In the present day, the drums are made with a metallic <b>box,</b> <b>screws</b> to tighten and the strings are guitar cords.|$|R
5000|$|Old work {{boxes are}} {{designed}} to attach to already-installed wall material (usually drywall). The boxes will almost always have two or more parsellas (from Latin: [...] "small wing or part). The parsellas flip out when the <b>box</b> <b>screws</b> are <b>screwed,</b> securing the <b>box</b> to the wall {{with the help of}} the four or more tabs on the front of the box.|$|R
5000|$|Steering {{is carried}} out through a worm and {{complete}} wheel in a <b>box</b> <b>screwed</b> to the frame. New gear positions are available at a low price. The brake pedal operates internally expanding brakes on all four wheels, the handbrake operates at the back using separate shoes. The brake drums are enclosed. Standard fittings include a spare (steel artillery) wheel and tyre. Shock absorbers are provided. There are semi-elliptic springs all round, flat set at the front. The rear springs are underhung. Cross-braced by three direct members the chassis channel-section side members are narrowed at the front and rise over the back axle ...|$|R
50|$|Payne was interned in an {{asylum in}} Davidson County, Tennessee in 1879. He died poor and blind in 1889, {{at the age}} of eighty-four. He was buried in a lumber square <b>box</b> without <b>screws</b> at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.|$|R
60|$|Far off, {{a distant}} rumble rolled through the earth, shaking the floor under him. On the bench, tools and {{equipment}} danced up and down. A pair of pliers fell crashing to the floor. A <b>box</b> of <b>screws</b> tipped over, spilling its minute contents out.|$|R
50|$|The {{built-up}} gun {{is constructed}} of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two locking rings, tube and liner locking ring, yoke ring and <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons {{built in the}} 1940s, the bore was chromium-plated for longer barrel life. It uses a Welin breech block that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{explanation}} of the [...] "black box" [...] term popularization came from a meeting about Warren's [...] "Red Egg", when afterwards a journalist told Warren: [...] "This is a wonderful black box." [...] The unit itself {{was based on an}} EMI Minifon wire recorder (originally a 1950s espionage gadget from the West-German manufacturer Protona Monske) fitted into a perspex <b>box</b> firmly <b>screwed</b> together.|$|R

50|$|Rick Kiefner, a 1969 {{graduate}} of ODU {{who worked on}} Saturday's radio broadcast of the game, tells a story that he thinks best reflects {{the beginnings of the}} intensity - and animosity - between the programs. During the 1970 season, Kiefner was {{part of a group of}} about 50 ODU fans who chartered a bus to Richmond for a game at VCU's old Franklin Street gym. After mailing a check for the tickets, the ODU group received a package in return from VCU. But no tickets were inside. Instead, somebody had sent a <b>box</b> of <b>screws.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{was feeling}} annoyed with men generally. I do not blame her, I feel annoyed with them myself sometimes. There is {{one man in}} {{particular}} I am always feeling intensely irritated against. He says one thing, and acts another. He will talk like a saint and behave like a fool, knows {{what is right and}} does what is wrong. But we will not speak further of him. He will be all he should be one day, and then we will pack him into a nice, comfortably-lined <b>box,</b> and <b>screw</b> the lid down tight upon him, and put him away in a quiet little spot near a church I know of, lest he should get up and misbehave himself again.|$|R
50|$|Because {{an attic}} fan {{is made of}} metal, and is also subject to {{lightning}} strikes if mounted on a roof, grounding is extremely important. On some attic fans, grounding is achieved through a screw mounted on the thermostat box of the attic fan. The grounding wire {{is attached to the}} <b>box</b> via the <b>screw</b> and thereby grounds the external metal components. Most modern attic fans have this as well as a grounding wire connected directly to the motor, thereby ensuring all parts are grounded.|$|R
50|$|Each of the {{original}} Mark 1 built-up guns consisted of a tube without liner, jacket, eight hoops and a <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner. To compensate for the problem of gun drooping, four hoop-locking rings {{were added to the}} guns. The Mark 3 added three hoop locking rings and contained a longer slide, while the Mark 5 had five hoops total. Owing to the interchangeability of the guns, the battleships fitted with the 14-inch/45 caliber guns often had guns of various Marks installed on each turret.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Plot== Roberto is {{a veteran}} who is characterised by orderliness and a firm belief {{in the value of}} control. He runs his own {{hardware}} store accordingly. If a supplier sells him <b>boxes</b> with 100 <b>screws</b> each, he counts all the screws and files a complaint if just a single one is missing. He feels that the world around his isle of neatness has gone mad. In order to prove his point, he collects newspaper articles about grotesque mishaps originally triggered by a lack of diligence.|$|R
2500|$|The Mark 3 was {{the last}} 10-inch gun built for the U.S. Navy, with a tube, jacket, locking ring and <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner {{manufactured}} from nickel steel. Due to the [...] "smokeless" [...] powders which came into use near {{the turn of the}} 20th century, these guns boasted a higher velocity than those used during the Spanishâ€“American War. They also had a flatter trajectory, which led to more accurate firing and aided in centralized fire control. In 1908, the armor-piercing shells were fitted with a ballistic cap lengthened to 7crh. This improved their penetration ability at longer ranges.|$|R
50|$|Each Mark 4 {{built-up}} gun {{consisted of}} a tube, liner, and a <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner with a separate screwed-on flange. Three hoops and two locking rings were also included. The Mark 6 was slightly different in that it contained a single step taper liner and uniform twist rifling. Downward-opening Welin breech blocks and Smith-Asbury mechanisms were used on both Mark 4 and Mark 6 types. The Navy encountered dispersion problems at extreme ranges with these guns in the 1920s. Several methods were used to correct these problems, including correction of range tables for errors, addition delay coils, reduction of chamber volume, and improvement of shot seating.|$|R
50|$|The 16-inch Mark 2 was 50 calibers long, with a liner, an A tube, {{jacket and}} seven hoops with four hoop locking rings and a <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner. The Mod 0 used an {{increasing}} {{twist in the}} rifling while the Mod 1 used a uniform twist and a different groove pattern. The Mark 3 {{was the same as}} the Mark 2 but used a one-step conical liner. The Mark 3 Mod 0 had an increasing rifling twist (like the Mark 2 Mod 0) while the Mark 3 Mod 1 utilized had a uniform twist. At the time the program was cancelled, in 1922, 71 guns had been built, including the prototype, while another 44 were in progress.|$|R
50|$|The jack is {{rigid and}} robust. The upright column is {{fabricated}} and welded to the cast steel Gear <b>Box.</b> The elevating <b>screw</b> {{is provided with}} buttress thread supported with single-acting thrust ball-bearing having a spherical seating {{at the top and}} self-aligning ball-bearing at the bottom. This imparts self-aligning properties to the screw under loaded condition. The elevating screw is under tension when loaded and hence there is no chance of distortion due to buckling.While lifting the load, the Jack rests firmly on its base. For movement from one place to another, the lifting carriage is to be lowered by pressing the yoke which lifts the base and the Jack rests on the three wheels with a ground clearance of 20 mm.|$|R
40|$|New {{introduction}} of the third modularity measure to the environmental conscious product design system collaborating with the conventional first-and second-modularity measure, enables the system to be reflected from the disassembly time of the products. The disassembly operation will be commonly carried out by hand with rotation of used appliances in disassembly process, andthe loss time by the rotation makes the process efficiency worse. Then the {{introduction of}} the third modularity measure will be very important to evaluate the design in circulatory society promoting reuse of parts and recycle of materials by the way of disassembling. For the illustration of the efficiency of the third modularity measure, the demonstrative experimental results of the disassembly time have been shown by making use of the trial on wooden <b>boxes</b> assembled by <b>screws...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 7-inch Mark 1 {{was built}} in a length of 44 calibers, had a nickel-steel liner, with a tube, jacket and three hoops with a locking ring, all made of gun steel, a <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner, and Welin breech block. The Mark 1 was hooped from the breech to [...] from the muzzle. Only one Mark 1 was built, the prototype. The Mark 2 was the {{production}} version, it was of the same construction as the Mark 1 {{except that it was}} hooped {{all the way to the}} muzzle and had one caliber, or seven inches, added to its length. The Mark 2 Mod 1 was constructed with a conical nickel-steel liner. Two experimental Mark 2 guns, given serial numbers 2 and 3, were built with wider diameter breech ends, with gun No. 2 modified with a conical nickel-steel liner and modified breech, becoming Mark 2 Mod 2.|$|R
50|$|The Mark 3 was {{specifically}} designed for the Tennessee-class armored cruisers, numbered in order after the Mark 1 and Mark 2s, Nos. 27-47, with No. 27 being delivered in February 1906. Nos. 27-31, 36, and 45 were all Mod 0s, with Nos. 37-44, 46, and 47 being Mod 1s. The initial Mod 2s were Nos. 32-35, with other later converted to Mod 2. These were all constructed of gun steel. The 10-inch Mark 3 Mod 0 was built in a length of 40 calibers, had a tube, jacket and four hoops with a locking ring, and a <b>screw</b> <b>box</b> liner, {{all of which were}} manufactured out of nickel-steel. The Mark 3 Mod 1s only differed from the Mod 0 {{in the shape of the}} front of their chambers and the Mod 2 had a conical nickel-steel liner that was the same length as the tube, with the chamber volume being slightly reduced.|$|R
6000|$|... "The ill {{husband of}} Cousin Teresa who went {{with us to}} Meran and lost her {{umbrella}} and Dr. Edmund was so sorry about it, has been very much worse, so she is not here but in Baden. I wrote to her but have no news, so I {{do not know whether}} he is still living or not, at any rate he can't get well again so soon (and I don't think he ever shall). I think as the weather is very warm you and Uncle Nic are sitting much out of doors. I am sending presents to you all in a wooden <b>box</b> and <b>screwed</b> very firm, so you shall have to use again the big screw-driver of Fritz. For Aunt Constance, photographs; for Uncle Nic, a green bird on a stand with a hole {{in the back of the}} bird to put his ashes in; it is a good green and not expensif please tell him, because he does not like expensif presents (Miss Naylor says the bird has an inquiring eye--it is a parrat); for you, a little brooch of turquoise because I like them best; for Dr. Edmund a machine to weigh medicines in because he said he could not get a good one in Botzen; this is a very good one, the shopman told me so, and is the most expensif of all the presents--so that is all my money, except two gulden. If Papa shall give me some more, I shall buy for Miss Naylor a parasol, because it is useful and the handle of hers is 'wobbley' (that is one of Dr. Edmund's words and I like it).|$|R
