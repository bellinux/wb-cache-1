5|$|Brazil ordered six Jurua-class {{ships from}} Britain in 1938. These ships were {{purchased}} <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> on {{the outbreak of}} war in 1939 and are described above. The Brazilians decided to produce indigenous destroyers, the , at the Ilha das Cobras shipyard, Rio de Janeiro. The design {{was based on the}} H-class plans supplied <b>by</b> <b>Britain,</b> but with guns and machinery supplied by the United States. Although laid down in 1940, the ships were not completed until 1949–51.|$|E
5|$|A {{changing}} legal imperative (transatlantic {{slave trade}} outlawed <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> in 1807) and economic imperative (a desire {{for political and}} social stability) led most European powers to support widespread cultivation of agricultural products, such as the palm, for use in European industry.|$|E
5|$|Peace would {{continue}} {{between the two}} states until 1645, when a long war over Crete would break out. Cyprus itself remained under Ottoman rule until 1878, when it was ceded to Britain as a protectorate.

5|$|The {{attempted}} expedition had {{a significant}} consequence. Wassmuss left Constantinople to organise the tribes in south Persia to act against British interests. While evading British capture in Persia, Wassmuss inadvertently abandoned his codebook. Its recovery <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> allowed the Allies to decipher German communications, including the Zimmermann Telegram in 1917. Niedermayer led the group following Wassmuss's departure.|$|E
5|$|After the Wind of Change of {{the early}} 1960s, the British {{government}} under Harold Wilson and the predominantly white minority government of the self-governing colony of Rhodesia, led by the Prime Minister Ian Smith, were unable to agree terms for the latter's full independence. Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965. This was deemed illegal <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> and the United Nations (UN), each of which imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war on Nazi Germany <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> and France {{in the aftermath of}} the German invasion of Poland, nine months of stalemate took place along the Western Front. After the Polish Campaign, in October 1939, the planners of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (Luftwaffe High Command) and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) turned their attentions to Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Another {{arm of the}} {{conspiracy}} was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East, while efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war {{on the side of}} the Central Powers, which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed <b>by</b> <b>Britain,</b> who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten {{played a crucial role in}} ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the last}} decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN {{condemned}} the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> and Singapore. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing {{the size of the}} organization somewhat. His successor, Kofi Annan (1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.|$|E

5|$|From {{its base}} in India, the Company {{had also been}} engaged in an {{increasingly}} profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.|$|E
5|$|HMS Express was an E-class minelaying {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> and France {{on both sides of the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|Majority of {{the people}} in South India speak one of the four major Dravidian languages: Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. During its history, a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across {{southern}} and southeastern Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas, Pallavas, Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas and Vijayanagara. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was colonised <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> and other nations.|$|E

50|$|Just {{before the}} 20th century, the British {{historian}} (and science fiction author and forgotten mainstream novelist) H. G. Wells published a book, Little Wars, {{on how to}} play at battles in miniature.

5|$|Prosperity {{returned}} {{when the}} Americans {{were invited to}} the island <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> to set up military bases in 1941 to 1945. The American Bases Act became law in Newfoundland on June 11, 1941. As Earle (1998) finds, Newfoundland girls married American personnel by the thousands. In 1948 there was a short-lived but growing movement {{for some sort of}} economic union with the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{public was}} shocked by the revelation by a turncoat Russian officer, who claimed that a direct {{engagement}} was secretly planned by Russia in case the Confederacy was recognised <b>by</b> <b>Britain.</b> The Russian navy had just paid Australia a visit in preparation for launching attacks. Fear of a possible military confrontation led to a massive buildup of coastal defences and to the acquisition of an ironclad warship.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean U-boat Campaign lasted {{approximately}} from 21 September 1941 to May 1944. The Kriegsmarine {{tried to}} isolate Gibraltar, Malta, and Suez and disrupt Britain's trade routes. More than sixty U-boats {{were sent to}} interdict Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea. Many of these U-boats were themselves attacked negotiating the Strait of Gibraltar controlled <b>by</b> <b>Britain.</b> Nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged.|$|E

5|$|The {{peace with}} Britain {{proved to be}} uneasy and controversial. Britain did not {{evacuate}} Malta as promised and protested against Bonaparte's annexation of Piedmont and his Act of Mediation, which established a new Swiss Confederation. Neither of these territories were covered by Amiens, but they inflamed tensions significantly. The dispute culminated in {{a declaration of war}} <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> in May 1803; Napoleon responded by reassembling the invasion camp at Boulogne.|$|E
5|$|Three of the {{surviving}} ships, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were seized <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> as war prizes {{after the end of}} the war and sold for scrapping. The other two ships, Hamburg and Berlin, were used as training cruisers through the 1920s. They were converted into barracks ships in the mid-1930s, a role they filled for a decade; in 1944, Hamburg was sunk by British bombers and later broken up for scrap, while Berlin was scuttled in deep water after the end of World War II to dispose of a load of chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rebel}} capture of Brussels on 18 December, work soon began {{on a new}} constitution. In January, the rebels re-called the States-General, a {{traditional}} assembly composed of the provincial elites which had not met since the Middle Ages, to discuss the form the new state would take. Its 53 members, representing the states and social classes, met in Brussels in January 1790 to begin negotiations. The constitution eventually devised by the States-General was inspired by both the Dutch Verlatinge of 1581 and American Declaration of Independence of 1776. The liberals were disgusted that members of society from beyond the guilds, clergy and nobility should not be consulted. They also saw the closed sessions of the States-General as ridiculing the idea of popular sovereignty. The declaration of the independence was not supported <b>by</b> <b>Britain</b> and the Dutch who believed that the new independent state {{would not be able}} to act as an effective buffer against possible French territorial expansion in the region.|$|E
