5000|$|In episode 4 of the 1st series, [...] "Once a Copper", {{the opening}} scene was filmed at Shirburn Castle. <b>Barstock</b> University is Bracknell College. Cambridge meets with an officer from a former {{investigation}} in Bracknell - the 3M Building can be seen out of the window. The 'Thin Blue Line' Conference takes place at Oakley Court, adjoining Bray Studios. Henry confronts a supposedly dead criminal at Windsor Racecourse and is later shown hurrying to the Japanese Reception across Marlow Bridge.|$|E
50|$|Notching is a {{metal-cutting}} process used on sheetmetal or thin <b>barstock,</b> {{sometimes on}} angle sections or tube. A shearing or punching process {{is used in}} a press, so as to cut vertically down and perpendicular to the surface, working {{from the edge of}} a workpiece. Sometimes the goal is merely the notch itself, but usually this is a precursor to some other process: such as bending a corner in sheet or joining two tubes at a tee joint, notching one to fit closely to the other.|$|E
40|$|This project {{addresses}} the continuous casting of <b>barstock</b> in certain copper alloys. A superheated reservoir of molten alloy is maintained in a continuously heated holding furnace (tundish) during casting. These tundishes are currently heated exclusively by fuel gas or oil, and are only 20 % energy efficient. The proposed {{system will be}} 98 % energy efficient and eliminate corrosive, polluting waste gases which cause porosity problems due to the entrapment of waste combustion gases in the casting. With reduced porosity, better quality parts can be more elegantly designed and downsized, reducing overall material and energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne factory using {{semi-continuous}} casting process produce the ф 200 × 6000 mm 6061 aluminium alloy <b>barstock,</b> and then rotary forged for car wheels. 6061 distorting aluminium alloy is an forged aluminum alloy, and mainly containing Mg, Si, Cu and other alloying elements. The main strengthening phase is Mg 2 Si, {{and also has}} few phase of (FeMn) 3 Si 2 Al 15. In order to eliminate the segregation and separation which present in the crystal boundary, and make the distortion to be uniform, and does not present ear and fracture defects after the forging. So the 6061 distorting aluminium alloy adopt the diffusion annealing heat treatment before the forging process. According to the current conditions, we use the diffusion annealing which have the different heating temperature and different holding time. The best process we can obtain from the test which can improve the production efficiency and reduce the material waste, improve the mechanical properties, and eliminate the overheated film on the surface. Then,we using OM,SEM and EDS to analyse the microstructure and the chemical composition of compound between the surface and centre. The result shows {{that the amount of}} segregation were different in the surface and in the center, and the different diffusion annealing can cause the phase change in the surface and the center...|$|E
