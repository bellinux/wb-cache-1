40|$|This study {{investigates the}} use of fair value {{measurement}} by 228 listed companies in the UK and Australia {{around the time of}} adoption of IFRS from 1 January 2005. We test whether within and between country comparability in policy choices (as measured by T indices) has changed in relation to (a) mandatory and (<b>b)</b> <b>optional</b> use of fair value measurement. Mandatory requirements related to financial instruments (IAS 39) and share-based payments (IFRS 2) have increased comparability, with a weaker effect for biological assets (IAS 41). In relation to the optional use of fair value, comparability increased in relation to property (IAS 16) because some companies discontinued fair value measurement. Under IAS 39, the fair value option for other financial assets and other financial liabilities decreased comparability. Options to use fair value in other areas (intangible assets, plant and equipment and investment properties) are not generally taken up, either for on-going measurement or on IFRS adoption (under the 'deemed cost' option). The results suggest a conservative approach and/or lack of incentives to use fair value measurement for most companies. Exceptions include some banks and insurance companies (for other financial assets and liabilities) and companies holding investment properties...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we investigate}} whether the term 'near-native speaker' {{should be used}} to refer to speakers who, in spite of having been in contact with the Spanish language since childhood, differ from the Spanish standard norm sanctioned by grammarians and linguists with respect to both their grammatical competence and their ability to process this language. In order to carry out this investigation we have used two constructions that evidence unstable areas of the Spanish language: (a) Resumptive Pronouns in ambiguous Restrictive Relative Clauses (Pintaron los techos de unas casitas i que cuando nos fuimos a vivir al camp las i vimos en malas condiciones.); and (<b>b)</b> <b>Optional</b> Dative Clitic Doubling (Sally Potter (les) dedico el premio a los tangueros.) versus Obligatory Dative Clitic Doubling (El nino travieso le rompio el jarron a la abuela.). Three groups of speakers with Spanish as their mother tongue participated in our study: an SC (Spanish Control) group consisting of speakers who have always lived in a Spanish speaking country; an LC (Late Contact with English) experimental group formed by L 1 Spanish / L 2 English speakers, and an EC (Early Contact with English) group which consisted of so-called heritage speakers. Our aim was to revise the term near-native so that {{it is not only the}} experimental groups' global grammatical competence that determines their being near-native versus native speakers, but also these experimental groups' local grammatical competence in relation to their acceptance and processing of Resumptive Pronouns and Dative Clitic Doubling constructions. We carried out three off-line and two on-line experimental tasks (Acceptability Judgments, Magnitude Estimation and Sentence Matching) intended to evaluate the grammatical and processing abilities of the three groups of speakers, who represented two varieties of Spanish: the Peninsular variety and the Rioplatense variety. The results show that the experimental groups' (LC, EC) global grammatical competence differs significantly from that of the Control group (SC). However, in relation to the acceptability and processing of the Resumptive Pronouns and Dative Clitic Doubling constructions, the experimental groups differ from the Control group only with respect to certain aspects of these constructions while they evidence native competence in relation to other aspects. This leads us to propose that the term 'near-native' cannot be applied across the board...|$|E

40|$|Background: Supernumerary {{chromosomes}} (<b>B)</b> comprise <b>optional</b> {{complement to}} basic (A) chromosome set. The presence of B-chromosomes may significantly reduce plant vigor and fertility. Potentially active genes constitute only {{small fraction of}} DNA of these chromosomes indicating that these effects are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. One example is down-regulation of rDNA genes and condensation of their respective chromatin regions (demonstrated in squashed preparations using 2 D microscopy). It may be postulated {{that the presence of}} B chromosomes leads to more extensive changes of local chromatin structure. Verification of hypothesis requires studying 3 D spatial architecture of intact nuclei in tissue. Results: An image processing algorithm was developed and applied for isolation (from the confocal datasets) of regions corresponding to single nuclei. The nuclei were segmented using iterative global thresholding followed by growing and merging of regions belonging to different nuclei. The result of segmentation was verified by a human observer. Chromatin architecture was characterized quantitatively using global fluorescence intensity distribution measures (mean, variance) and local intensity distribution parameters (haraclick features, wavelet energy, run- length features). The sets of parameters corresponding to populations of nuclei with different number of B-chromo- somes were subjected to discriminate analysis. The distinct parameters were then correlated with depth in tissue at which a given nucleus was positioned. Conclusions: Combination of light microscopy with dedicated image processing and analysis framework made it possible to study chromatin architecture in nuclei containing various number of B chromosomes. These data indicate that alterations of 3 D chromatin distribution occur globally in the interphase nuclei in the presence of Bs. The changes occur at the spatial scale comparable with the resolution limit of light microscopy and at larger distances...|$|R

40|$|Supernumerary <b>B</b> {{chromosomes}} are <b>optional</b> {{additions to}} the basic set of A chromosomes, and occur in all eukaryotic groups. They differ from the basic complement in morphology, pairing behavior, and inheritance and are not required for normal growth and development. The current view is that B chromosomes are parasitic elements comparable to selfish DNA, like transposons. In contrast to transposons, they are autonomously inherited independent of the host genome and have their own mechanisms of mitotic or meiotic drive. Although B chromosomes were first described a century ago, {{little is known about}} their origin and molecular makeup. The widely accepted view is that they are derived from fragments of A chromosomes and/or generated in response to interspecific hybridization. Through next-generation sequencing of sorted A and B chromosomes, we show that B chromosomes of rye are rich in gene-derived sequences, allowing us to trace their origin to fragments of A chromosomes, with the largest parts corresponding to rye chromosomes 3 R and 7 R. Compared with A chromosomes, B chromosomes were also found to accumulate large amounts of specific repeats and insertions of organellar DNA. The origin of rye B chromosomes occurred an estimated ∼ 1. 1 – 1. 3 Mya, overlapping in time with the onset of the genus Secale (1. 7 Mya). We propose a comprehensive model of B chromosome evolution, including its origin by recombination of several A chromosomes followed by capturing of additional A-derived and organellar sequences and amplification of B-specific repeats...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim of the}} Water Framework Directive (WFD 00 / 60 /EC) is {{the achievement}} of good water status for all waters by 2015. The WFD requires water bodies to be differentiated according to types determined using either System A or System B. Both systems are based on morphometric descriptors and the predominant composition of the geological substratum. Then, for each type, reference sites regarding their ecological status must be identified through the analysis of different elements, primarily by evaluating pressures and impacts on water bodies. This paper discusses the characterization of 190 Italian lake-types (selected {{on the basis of}} size, i. e. surface area > 0, 5 km 2) using both systems, and a method for determining their potential reference sites by analysing the pressure factors involved. The results show that System A is not suitable for Italian lakes; too high a number of types (36) emerges, and the distribution of the lakes into the various types is not homogeneous, making it difficult to identify reference sites. In contrast, the application of System <b>B,</b> including <b>optional</b> (i. e. conductivity and origin) as well as obligatory factors, makes it possible to group together the types and reduce their number. Thirteen different types, containing between 1 and 44 lakes, were identified using System B. The method developed to identify reference sites is based on the analysis of anthropogenic pressure. It was estimated from the equivalent population density (inhab. km- 2) in topographic catchments and calculated using census data from ISTAT (Italian National Statistics Institute) (population, industry, animal husbandry). The equivalent population density, related to total phosphorus concentrations, enabled us to identify 5 potential reference sites, representative of 3 of the 13 types characterized (23 %). The method can be regarded as a preliminary approach to identifying reference sites, but must be refined through the addition of other pressure factors and other quality elements. Another approach to identifying reference sites is based on the relation between altitude (indirect index of anthropogenic pressures) and phosphorus concentration: high-altitude lakes (above 1000 m a. s. l.) have high or good quality status and can be regarded as potential reference sites. However, the development of a suitable method for identifying reference sites must consider the receptive capacity of a water body and its specificity; the identification of reference conditions must be specific for each type, and the analysis must be based on both spatial and temporal factors...|$|R
