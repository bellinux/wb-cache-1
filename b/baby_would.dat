5|$|Blyton and Darrell Waters {{married at}} the City of Westminster Register Office on 20 October 1943. She changed the surname of her daughters to Darrell Waters and {{publicly}} embraced her new role as a happily married and devoted doctor's wife. After discovering she was pregnant {{in the spring of}} 1945, Blyton miscarried five months later, following a fall from a ladder. The <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> have been Darrell Waters's first child and it would also have been the son for which both of them longed.|$|E
5|$|Perdiccas {{initially}} did {{not claim}} power, instead suggesting that Roxane's <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be king, if male; with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, {{under the command}} of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{exclusively}} {{reported a}} new storyline for Hollyoaks as Mercedes and Joe Roscoe's (Ayden Callaghan) unborn <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> die before birth in scenes to air in early November 2015. It was revealed the show {{had been working}} with stillbirth charities, Count the Kicks and Sands to produce various ways mothers can monitor their unborn baby's progress. Rival soap opera, EastEnders, had produced a similar storyline when Shabnam Masood and Kush Kazemi (Rakhee Thakrar and Davood Ghadami) lost their son Zaair before he was born, but fans were reassured the storyline had been planned {{months prior to the}} announcement of EastEnders storyline. It was revealed Mercedes would first admit her fears to John Paul and they visited the hospital where a doctor would inform them that their son had died. Kilkelly teased that the storyline would see how Mercedes coped with the situation, how it affects Mercedes and Joe's relationship, as well as seeing the permanent return of Myra.|$|E

25|$|According to the Life of St. Macarius, when he {{was still}} a baby, he would start crying every time he heard the ringing of the bells of the nearby church. There was no way to console the child. The parents would not want to bring the baby boy to the church, afraid that he would disturb the service with his crying; but {{eventually}} they decided to try. And, to their surprise, as soon as they brought the child to the church, he became quiet, smiling joyfully. From this time on, the parents had to attend every service at the parish church, and to take the child with them, because if they stayed at home during the service, the <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> again start crying.|$|E
25|$|Babe strikes up a {{friendship}} with Bianca Montgomery during December 2003. They grow close and become best friends. At a cabin, while a storm goes on outside, Babe helps Bianca give birth to her baby daughter, Miranda Montgomery. Bianca falls unconscious and Babe leaves to go get help. She breaks into Dr. David Hayward's cabin and calls Paul at Llanview Hospital for help. The day before (on One Life to Live), Paul helped his sister, Kelly, {{give birth to a}} baby boy, but the baby died right after birth. Kelly, believing a <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be {{the only thing that could}} save her marriage, begged her brother to get her a child. Paul helps Babe get back to the cabin, where he delivers her son by the fireplace.|$|E
25|$|The Sims 2 {{characters}} pass through seven life stages — babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with University), adults, and elders — with eventual death of old age, while babies in The Sims only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to The Sims 2. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits {{as opposed to}} Sims, in which the <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> take on random appearance and personality. Genetics {{play a major role}} in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.|$|E
50|$|The most {{significant}} mass retirement of all came late in 1999, when Ty announced {{that at the}} end of the year, all Beanie <b>Babies</b> <b>would</b> retire. This kept the public wondering whether or not more beanie <b>babies</b> <b>would</b> be introduced. At the end of the year, the public was given the opportunity to vote to determine if beanies should continue to be produced. There was a 50¢ fee to vote in order to prevent multiple votes by one person. Proceeds were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation. About 90% of voters voted for Beanie Babies to continue, and more beanies were introduced early in 2000.|$|R

50|$|The {{album was}} a radical {{departure}} from the previous two albums, alienating fans of the blue-eyed soul material that dominated the albums. War Babies is a more rock-oriented LP with heavy keyboard work and sarcastic lyrical content. War <b>Babies</b> <b>would</b> be their first charting album, reaching #86 on the Billboard 200.|$|R
25|$|The actual {{duties of}} the midwife in antiquity {{consisted}} mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the midwife would call for {{the assistance of a}} physician when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the midwife brought along two or three assistants. In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her. The midwife sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards {{on the top of the}} mother's abdomen.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ritual {{practices}} and beliefs {{are associated with}} birth among the Tanala. In the past, after delivery of a baby the mother would wash {{her hands in the}} blood of a freshly sacrificed chicken, bathe herself in hot water, and then rest upright beside a fire to make her sweat out impurities. The period that she needed to stay beside the fire varied; noblewomen might stay beside the fire for as long as several months, but more commonly the duration was eight days. Immediately after this period beside the fire was concluded, a party was held, which the mother had to attend regardless of her condition; the event was marked by the slaughter of zebu. Immediately after birth, the <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be bathed in cold water, and a sorcerer would declare certain days to be lifelong fady (taboo days); if a baby was born on a day that was fady for both the mother and father, the child would be abandoned to die. In addition, there are eight fady days per month for all Tanala, and historically if a child was born on one of these days, it would be drowned by holding its head in a water-filled winnowing pan.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Holland and Smith {{had already decided}} that Sue and her husband would be parents to a young baby named Hassan. However, as further {{characters}} were invented they realised {{that there would be}} a total of four babies in the show: Annie Smith, Martin Fowler, Vicki Fowler and Hassan. It was decided that it would be impossible for the studios to cope with four babies, and so they invented a storyline to eliminate one of the young babies from the cast. During this time in the 1980s, the issue of cot death was extremely prominent in the British press, partly due to an increase in casualties, but also because a doctor had gone public with the accusation that parents were to blame for the tragic occurrence. Holland and Smith decided that covering this subject in the soap would be a good way of 'setting the record straight', and so it was decided that Sue and Ali's <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> die from cot death in the early months of the show. This was the first of many controversial storylines in EastEnders history. After the storyline aired in June 1985, the show was praised by audience and press alike for the sensitive and unsensational way this harrowing subject was treated. The sudden tragedy came as a surprise to the audience, especially since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways had made them appear rather comic in the early episodes of the show. The British Cot Death Foundation initially feared that a soap opera would trivialise the subject and frighten new parents. They tried to stop the episodes from airing, but in the end they were pleased with the way the subject was handled, and provided back-up support after transmission to many viewers who wanted more information on the subject.|$|E

5000|$|In his 1976 Massachusetts Institute of Technology {{research}} {{funded by}} National Institutes of Health, National Aeronautic and Space Administration, and the Spencer Foundation, Held {{worked with the}} idea that <b>babies</b> <b>would</b> rather focus on a pattern they can see than a [...] "fuzzy pattern." [...] In 1978, Held found that impediments to vision in babies, such as drooping eyelids, should be treated immediately to prevent vision impairment.|$|R
500|$|Capper went on {{to modify}} the airship as Nulli Secundus II, parodied by Punch as [...] "second to none the second", and a smaller {{experimental}} airship called Baby.

500|$|In early 1922, Zelda again became pregnant. Although {{some writers}} {{have said that}} Scott's diaries include an entry {{referring}} to [...] "Zelda and her abortionist", there is, in fact, no such entry. Zelda's thoughts on the second pregnancy are unknown, but in {{the first draft of}} The Beautiful and Damned, the novel Scott was completing, he wrote a scene in which the main female character Gloria believes she is pregnant and Anthony suggests she [...] "talk to some woman and find out what's best to be done. Most of them fix it some way." [...] Anthony's suggestion was removed from the final version, a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria's concern that a <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> ruin her figure.|$|E
500|$|In June 1953, Hayward took {{command of}} the escort carrier [...] He confessed to the crew {{that he did not}} know what he was doing, and urged any crewman who felt he was doing {{something}} wrong to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was deployed at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruzs chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: [...] "You are not to return to this vessel until you have procured that baby." ...|$|E

25|$|It was {{generally}} believed that <b>babies</b> <b>would</b> not remember any pain that {{they happened to}} feel, and that lack of conscious memory meant lack of long-term harm.

Furthermore, the whole effort of relieving pain was considered futile since it was thought to be impossible to measure the child's pain.|$|R
500|$|... "Home" [...] {{was first}} {{submitted}} to the censors featuring audio of the baby screaming while being buried alive. Ten Thirteen Productions was asked by Fox executives to alter the audio so that the <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> sound sick; they noted that the audio change was needed to show the child was diseased and that the Peacocks were not simply killing an innocent child. Manners called the shot, shown from the child's perspective, of the baby's burial as [...] "the most awful shot of my career". He said that he approached filming as seriously as he could because he felt the script was a classic. [...] When production was finished, {{he said that he}} loved the episode and called it one of his favorites. Duchovny agreed with Manners, saying, [...] "I really like that one. Although it didn't scare me." [...] He explained that it [...] "touched" [...] him with its themes concerning the desire to [...] "live and to propagate." ...|$|E
500|$|Samuel Johnson {{was born}} on 18 September 1709, to Michael Johnson, a bookseller, and his wife, Sarah Ford. He {{was born in the}} family home above his father's {{bookshop}} in Lichfield, Staffordshire. His mother Sarah was 40 when she gave birth to Samuel. This was considered an unusually late pregnancy, so precautions were taken, and a [...] "man-midwife" [...] and surgeon of [...] "great reputation" [...] named George Hector was brought in to assist. The infant Samuel did not cry, and there were concerns for the baby's health. His aunt exclaimed that, [...] "she would not have picked such a poor creature up in the street." [...] The family feared that the <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> not survive, and in this extremity, the vicar of St Mary's was summoned to perform a baptism. Two godfathers were chosen, Samuel Swynfen, a physician and graduate of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Richard Wakefield, a lawyer, coroner, and Lichfield town clerk.|$|E
500|$|Feldman's {{article in}} the Western Journal of Medicine {{was picked up by}} The New York Times in a story by Denise Grady, who {{described}} three cases of Internet forum members who were [...] "incorrigible fakers". These include a woman with a professed eating disorder who posted to a support group saying she was reporting from an intensive care unit via her laptop computer, and claimed to have had a stroke while online, to be followed by her mother's posts declaring that she too had to be hospitalized; the original poster's father purportedly continued to update the online group. In another example, a teenager frequenting a forum for mothers with premature infants – some of whom had endured lengthy, expensive, and painful medical procedures, or had died – claimed to have given birth to a premature baby and expressed her fears for her own child, after which she received support and sympathy from the 400-member group. The teenager confided to the group that her baby had also died, and soon after returned to the forum to announce she was again pregnant and feared her <b>baby</b> <b>would</b> be premature, which it turned out to be, more frail this time than the first. Forum members eventually became unsympathetic with her vivid descriptions of surgeries and confronted her. Grady also addresses a similar confrontation that occurred when a man who claimed to be a monk with end-stage cancer posted long descriptions of his trials and struggles with facing death alone, eventually arousing the suspicions of other forum members who were not convinced someone so sick could correspond with so much vitality.|$|E
