5000|$|During this period, Nicklaus {{also let}} his {{physical}} condition decline somewhat, putting on some excess weight, which affected his stamina. Following the Ryder Cup, he significantly improved his condition {{in the fall}} of 1969 by losing 25 lb in one month, and his game started to return to top form. In February 1970, Nicklaus' father, Charlie Nicklaus, died. Five months after this, Nicklaus won the 1970 Open Championship under difficult scoring conditions in Scotland where the wind howled up to 56 MPH, defeating fellow American Doug Sanders in an 18-hole playoff round in emotional fashion. On the 18th hole of the playoff, Nicklaus drove about 380 yards, through the par-4 green with a three-wood, and was forced to pitch back to the hole. His eagle pitch finished approximately eight feet short of the hole.

Everybody. Trust me, the transition from one anchor to another is not that <b>big</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> Cronkite begat Rather, Chancellor begat Brokaw, Reynolds begat Jennings. And each of them did a pretty fair job in his own right. You've always been very nice to me, so give this new anchor team for Nightline a fair break.
