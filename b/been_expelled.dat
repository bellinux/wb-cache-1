5|$|Andrew was {{the second}} son of King Béla III and Béla's first wife, Agnes of Antioch. The year of Andrew's birth is not known, but modern historians agree that he was born around 1177. Andrew was first {{mentioned}} in connection to his father's invasion of the Principality of Halych in 1188. That year, Béla III invaded Halych upon the request of its former prince, Vladimir II Yaroslavich, who had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> by his subjects. Béla forced the new prince, Roman Mstislavich, to flee. After conquering Halych, he granted it to Andrew. Béla also captured Vladimir Yaroslavich and imprisoned him in Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Echmarcach first {{appears on}} record in about 1031, {{when he was}} one of three kings in {{northern}} Britain who submitted to Knútr Sveinnsson, ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire. Echmarcach is recorded to have ruled over Dublin in 10361038 and 10461052. After losing Dublin for the final time, he appears to have been seated in the Isles on Mann. In 1061, about a decade after his final defeat in Dublin, Echmarcach appears to have <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from the Isles, and may have then fallen back into Galloway.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Chris Poland {{and drummer}} Gar Samuelson had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the band}} {{following}} {{the conclusion of the}} Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior, including Poland's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs. Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician, Chuck Behler. However, a new guitarist would take longer to emerge. At first, the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice, but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording, and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher, Jeff Young. Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds's firing.|$|E
50|$|When the Jesuits <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from Naples in 1767, {{the church}} {{passed to the}} Franciscan order. The Jesuits {{returned}} in 1821, only to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> again in 1848.|$|R

5|$|In October 1942, Popovac {{issued an}} appeal to Muslim Partisans, urging them to join the Chetniks and turn against the Ustaše. In a report to Mihailović dated 3 November, Popovac wrote:I have to {{emphasize}} to you the intimate cooperation between the Muslims and Orthodox in the Stolac district from where, through the joint struggle of the Muslims and Orthodox, the Croat inhabitants, who were largely Ustaša-inclined, have <b>been</b> <b>expelled.</b> In that way, from Gabela to Mostar the entire left bank of the Neretva has been cleansed, {{and the number of}} refugees has been estimated at 12,000 people.|$|E
5|$|In high school, Mitchell played {{four years}} of varsity football, {{on both sides of}} the ball. He {{received}} a full scholarship to Northwestern State University of the Southland Conference, but was expelled for fighting during his freshman season. After attending Blinn College in Bryan, Texas for two semesters, Mitchell joined the Beaumont Drillers of the National Indoor Football League in 2003. After a season with them, he attended a National Football League combine, but was told to go home after officials found out he had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from college for fighting.|$|E
5|$|Irene Cara, {{a former}} student of the Performing Arts, was cast as Coco Hernandez. Parker was not {{impressed}} with Cara's musical audition, until after her recording sessions with the film's music composer Michael Gore. Gene Anthony Ray, who plays Leroy Johnson, was also a Performing Arts student but had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from the school for disruptive behavior. Simkin had discovered Ray breakdancing on a street corner in Harlem before asking him to audition for a role in the film.|$|E
50|$|In October 1927, {{the last}} Left Opposition members <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from the Central Committee {{elected by the}} 14th Congress, and in November 1927 Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from the Party itself.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{the rest}} of the British {{communist}} movement the NCP from the beginning had to deal with what they saw as ultra-leftism and right-wing deviation. All were defeated at congresses over the years and many <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> for factionalism. In the early 1980s an extreme pro-Soviet faction called [...] "Proletarian" [...] <b>was</b> <b>expelled.</b> In the early 1990s another small group <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> which later formed the Communist Action Group.|$|R
50|$|On December 1, 2010, Turner <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the}} Boston City Council by an 11-1 vote {{making him the}} first council member to ever <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> {{in the history of}} the modern Boston City Council.|$|R
5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior to whites, and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{slaughter}} {{continued for}} the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed. The Eastern Christian population of the city had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day}} of the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through the door by Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping from the doorway. He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E

50|$|In October 1940, 115,000 Poles <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from their}} homes in central Warsaw {{to make room for}} the Jewish Ghetto, {{constructed}} there by German authorities. (Jews <b>were</b> then <b>expelled</b> {{from their homes}} elsewhere and forced to move into the Ghetto.) When the Warsaw Uprising failed, 500,000 people <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from the city alone as punishment by German authorities.|$|R
5|$|At a {{masquerade}} ball, various romantic liaisons are made. André and Christine declare {{their love}} for each other and plan to run away together. Robert and André come to an argument over Christine. In the secluded greenhouse, Octave declares that he too loves Christinewho is having doubts about Andréand they decide to run away together. Schumacher and Marceau, who have both <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from the estate after a fight over Lisette, watch Octave and Christine in the greenhouse. They mistake Christine for Lisette because Christine is wearing Lisette's cape and hood. Octave returns to the house for his coat and hat, and is begged by Lisette not to leave with Christine.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, Aberhart's {{government}} had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected {{on the promise of}} dividends and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through. Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises. One such MLA, Samuel Barnes, had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from the Social Credit caucus and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.|$|E
5|$|Edgar {{had been}} a strong ruler who had forced monastic reforms on a {{probably}} unwilling church and nobility, aided by the leading clerics of the day, Dunstan, Archbishop of Canterbury; Oswald of Worcester, Archbishop of York; and Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. By endowing the reformed Benedictine monasteries with the lands required for their support, he had dispossessed many lesser nobles, and had rewritten leases and loans of land {{to the benefit of}} the monasteries. Secular clergy, many of whom would have been members of the nobility, had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from the new monasteries. While Edgar lived, he strongly supported the reformers, but following his death, the discontents which these changes had provoked came into the open.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 Representative Michael Myers of Pennsylvania <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> for bribes in {{connection}} with the Abscam scandal.

50|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences {{announced}} on February 3, 2004 that it <b>was</b> <b>expelling</b> Caridi for violating his agreement to safeguard their screeners, {{making him the}} first Academy member to <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> under its anti-piracy policy.|$|R
50|$|His {{most notable}} {{appointment}} was as ambassador to Moscow from 1977 to 1980, until he <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> as a tit-for-tat when the Soviet ambassador Vsevolod Sofinsky <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> for passing {{funds to the}} pro-Soviet Socialist Unity Party of New Zealand.|$|R
5|$|In 1973 Adele Koh, a Malaysian {{journalist}} formerly {{living in}} Singapore, {{was appointed to}} work for Dunstan. She had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> by the Singaporean Government of Lee Kuan Yew for criticising its policies. The newspaper she had been working for, the Singapore Herald, was shut down {{by the government and}} she then moved to Australia. The two began a relationship in 1974, and married in 1976 in a small ceremony at Dunstan's residence. Dunstan was much older than Adele, who was in her 30s. She was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer in May 1978, and died in October after Dunstan had cared for her at her bedside for months. Her death seriously affected him and his own health began to suffer.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the monarchs listed below, the Kings of England and Great Britain from 1340–60, 1369-1420, and 1422–1801 also claimed the title of King of France. For a short time, this had some basis in factunder {{the terms of the}} 1420 Treaty of Troyes, Charles VI had recognized his son-in-law Henry V of England as regent and heir. Henry V predeceased Charles VI and so Henry V's son, Henry VI, succeeded his grandfather Charles VI as King of France. Most of Northern France was under English control until 1435, but by 1453, the English had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from all of France save Calais (and the Channel Islands), and Calais itself fell in 1558. Nevertheless, English and then British monarchs continued to claim the title for themselves until the creation of the United Kingdom in 1801.|$|E
5|$|Protestants in Franche-Comté had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the}} region, and {{had met in}} Montbéliard and Switzerland to organise the capture of Besançon. Desiring assistance, they enlisted some Swiss and Montbéliards to fight with them. Originally, the {{soldiers}} were incredibly well organised, with 300 soldiers coming from Switzerland and 150 coming from Montbéliard. No less than 6,000 men would be provided by the Holy Roman Empire if the city fell. The people of Besançon were on their guard, and the assault was carefully designed to be unexpected. According to their plans, the soldiers from Neuchâtel would enter Besançon through the Notre-Dame, and those from Montbéliard would enter the city through the Battant.|$|E
50|$|Placental {{expulsion}} (also called afterbirth) {{occurs when}} the placenta {{comes out of the}} birth canal after childbirth. The period from just after the baby <b>is</b> <b>expelled</b> until just after the placenta <b>is</b> <b>expelled</b> <b>is</b> called the third stage of labor.|$|R
50|$|Robert Wilson <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> {{from the}} Progressive Conservative caucus on November 20, 1980, {{and from the}} Progressive Conservative party on November 28, 1980.

5|$|The Battle of Besançon (21 June 1575) was a sectarian {{conflict}} between the Protestants and Catholics in the French city of Besançon {{in the region of}} Franche-Comté. Prior to the battle, the Huguenots, accused of heresy, had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from the city and fled to the County of Montbéliard and Switzerland; the outcasts formed an army and planned an attempt to retake Besançon and turn the city into a stronghold of the Protestant Reformation. By the time the armed Protestants had reached the city of Besançon however, their army had dwindled because of several mishaps. Nonetheless, the battle began and raged for several hours; the outcome was an overwhelming Catholic victory. The majority of the Protestant army managed to escape, but those who were captured were hanged as traitors. For over two centuries after the battle, Protestantism in Besançon was repressed.|$|E
5|$|The Restoration, {{along with}} {{a return to the}} pre-war Laudian church and the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, posed few {{problems}} for the sympathetic and quickly reformed Brasenose; only one fellow left without agreeing. For some, nominal allegiance to the new regime was the order of the day, supported by a weary college. The Restoration period was one of disciplinary laxity across the university; Brasenose was no different, with some of its students taking part in riots. Yate was instituted as successor – and somewhat retrospectively as predecessor – to Greenwood; six of the thirteen fellows that had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> returned; other personnel in the college were replaced. The period saw a rejuvenation of teaching in the University as a whole and a new cache of new thinkers, including Brasenose's Petty.|$|E
5|$|Treatt led the Coalition {{again at}} the 17 June 1950 election, which {{resulted}} in a hung parliament, with Treatt's Coalition gaining 12 seats and a swing of 6.7% for a total of 46 seats. With the Labor Party also holding 46 seats, the balance of power lay with the two re-elected Independent Labor members, James Geraghty and John Seiffert, who had <b>been</b> <b>expelled</b> from the party for disloyalty during the previous parliament. Under a legalistic interpretation of the ALP rules, Seiffert was readmitted to the party and, together with the support of Geraghty, McGirr and Labor were able to stay in power. On 20 June, Treatt declared that he and his party would not make any concessions or compromises to the Labor Party, particularly in regards to the election of a speaker. Treatt retained his seat with 76.09%.|$|E
50|$|According to S. Banasiak, 3,109,900 Germans <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> to the Soviet and British {{occupation}} {{zones in}} Germany and thereby registered by Polish officials between 1945 and 1950. Registration by Polish officials was not exhaustive, especially in 1945. An unknown number left without formal registration or <b>was</b> <b>expelled</b> by Soviet military authorities without notifying by Polish officials responsible for statistics. Also, especially in 1945, many Germans {{returned to their}} former homes and some <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> more than once.|$|R
50|$|Some of Tony Cliff's {{supporters}} in Birmingham <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> - Cliff himself could not <b>be</b> <b>expelled</b> being resident in Dublin and therefore beyond Healy's reach - {{and then when}} Grant attempted to defend the rights of Cliff's supporters he too <b>was</b> <b>expelled.</b> Cliff would regroup his supporters around the magazine Socialist Review and Grant similarly formed {{a group called the}} International Socialist Group. Most former members of the RCP had left the Trotskyist movement by the end of 1951.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1955 the Turkish {{government}} sponsored anti-Greek {{riots and}} pogrom in Istanbul. The dispute over Cyprus kept anti-Greek feelings in Turkey high. At {{the height of}} the intercommunal violence in Cyprus, thousands of Greeks <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from Turkey, mostly Istanbul. In March of that year all persons (over 6,000) with Greek citizenship <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> [...] "on the grounds that they were dangerous to the 'internal and external' security of the state." [...] Additionally, in September 1964, 10,000 Greeks <b>were</b> <b>expelled.</b> Cumhuriyet reported that 30,000 [...] "Turkish nationals of Greek descent had left permanently, in addition to the Greeks who had been expelled." [...] Within months a total of 40,000 Greeks <b>were</b> <b>expelled</b> from Istanbul.|$|R
