In his final years, he battled alcoholism, which partially contributed to his death from heat stroke in Dallas on August 9, 1937. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> and his wife Louise were divorced and he left no children. Cooley was buried in Grove Hill Memorial Park in Dallas.|$|E

5|$|After the {{revolution}} broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of {{what became the}} Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion {{was in favor of}} it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a concerted action by Western powers. Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.|$|E

However, following Gates's disastrous defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, the Continental Congress had selected Washington's choice, Major General Nathanael Greene, to replace the disgraced Gates as commander of the Southern Department. When Greene formally assumed command on December 3, 1780, he retained Kościuszko as his chief engineer. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> had been praised by both Gates and Greene.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades.|$|E

At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land.|$|E

5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used <b>by</b> <b>then.</b> <b>He</b> thought that it had been a good measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran the business for 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity <b>by</b> <b>then)</b> <b>he</b> started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona had {{virtually}} secured their La Liga title by {{the start of}} 2013, eventually equalling Real Madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. However, their performances deteriorated {{in the second half of}} the 2012–13 campaign, concurrently with Vilanova's absence due to ill health. After losing successive Clásicos, including the Copa del Rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the Champions League by Milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4–0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from Messi. Now in his ninth senior season with Barcelona, Messi signed a new contract on 7 February, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to €13million. He wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 March, in a league match against Rayo Vallecano; <b>by</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former Barcelona players Josep Samitier, László Kubala and Johan Cruyff. Since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased exponentially; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.|$|E

5|$|During one of {{the work}} parties, Stanley was sent to build a road and stairs leading to a {{memorial}} to the Japanese dead on Bukit Batok Hill (Marked with a Bukit Batok Memorial plaque today, only the stairs and road called Lorong Sesuai are still there to be seen). The chaplain of the regiment, well aware of Stanley's religious conviction and artistic background, requested him to decorate the asbestos walls at the altar area of a small open attap-roofed chapel at Bukit Batok. With charcoal salvaged from around the camp, he drew two murals: Nativity, which featured a Malay Madonna and Descent from the Cross in which he included soldiers in uniforms, using his comrades as models. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> was becoming ill and was suffering from a severe renal disorder complicated by amoebic dysentery. On 23 May 1942, Stanley was lying comatose and was sent to Roberts Barracks in Changi which was converted {{for use as a}} hospital for POWs to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|In 1787 Dennie was {{admitted}} to the sophomore class of Harvard College, where he was very popular with his peers. This popularity did not extend to his tutors, and he was suspended in December 1789 for six months after insulting the faculty. Dennie had difficulty finding suitable employment after earning his degree in 1790, but by 1793 he was practicing law (though earning very little for his work). In a January 1794 letter to his parents, however, Dennie reports that he had been appointed as a reader for the Episcopalian church in Charlestown, New Hampshire. Nevertheless, he insisted that this new vocation would not deter him from his goal of practicing law, though <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> was planning on remaining in New Hampshire to practice rather than returning to Massachusetts. Shortly after writing the letter, Dennie {{was admitted}} to the Court of Common Pleas and opened a practice in Charlestown. However, he rarely appeared in open court; indeed, he probably made only one appearance.|$|E
5|$|Like his father, Adams {{embarked}} on a political career {{with the support of}} the Boston Caucus. He was elected to his first political office in 1747, serving as one of the clerks of the Boston market. In 1756, the Boston Town Meeting elected him to the post of tax collector, which provided a small income. He often failed to collect taxes from his fellow citizens, which increased his popularity among those who did not pay, but left him liable for the shortage. By 1765, his account was more than £8,000 in arrears. The town meeting was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Adams was compelled to file suit against delinquent taxpayers, but many taxes went uncollected. In 1768, his political opponents used the situation to their advantage, obtaining a court judgment of £1,463 against him. Adams's friends paid off some of the deficit, and the town meeting wrote off the remainder. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> had emerged as a leader of the popular party, and the embarrassing situation did not lessen his influence.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge the specifics of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. <b>By</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E
5|$|Abt fell to seventh {{when he was}} {{overtaken}} by Prost at the first corner on lap ten, and the former defended from a large pack of cars. By the twelfth lap, Buemi had more usable electrical energy available and closed up to Piquet, overtaking him around the inside for fourth position at the seventh turn. Félix da Costa's vehicle stopped at turn eight on lap twelve. However, the deployment of a full course yellow flag was avoided when he received radio instructions from his team to perform a full reset, enabling him to rejoin the race. <b>By</b> <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> had dropped {{to the back of}} the field, and later became the race's first retirement. Upfront, Rosenqvist held a five-second advantage over Bird by the fourteenth lap, but the latter was being caught by Vergne by more than four-tenths of a second per lap. Although he had less electrical energy, Vergne caught Bird, who had been backed into Buemi, and moved in front of him at the start of the 16th lap with Bird electing not to defend the second position. The mandatory pit stops, during which all drivers need to change into a second car, began on the same lap. When Rosenqvist and Vergne entered the pit lane Buemi and Bird elected to remain on the circuit for another lap. Buemi was running quicker and overtook Bird at turn eleven on lap 17. He braked late for turn eleven but avoided going off the circuit. Piquet was affected by an electrical problem, ending his chances of finishing in a points-scoring position. Engel stopped his vehicle after making his pit stop, and became the event's second retirement with electrical problems. After the pit stops, Rosenqvist regained the first position, retaining most of his four-second advantage over Vergne. Di Grassi had been passed by Turvey but reclaimed sixth place from him shortly afterwards and started to close up to teammate Abt.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{was offered}} a higher ranking {{position}} within Indiana Gas at the Chicago headquarters, but <b>by</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> had {{become aware of the}} business's connection to the corrupt and disgraced monopolist Charles T. Yerkes. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago leadership. After the pipeline became fully operational in 1892, Haynes moved to Kokomo where he was made a supervisor of the Indiana Gas's local operations. The Indiana General Assembly began attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas be used more conservatively. He specifically recommended that the flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a figure that shocked the company's leaders. Despite his support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity. He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate artificial increases in well pressure. The court case continued until 1896, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed, including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among other companies and the field's wells began to run dry by 1905modern experts estimate as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet (30km3) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or misused.|$|E
