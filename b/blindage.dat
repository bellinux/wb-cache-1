In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of charge weight and blast position on damage effect of EPW (Earth Penetrating Weapon), theoretic analysis was combined with experiment data, the model of volume of funnel pit formed by blast was set up based on supposing that the warhead was instantaneous spherical explosion and the fragments ’ destructive effect could be neglected, then the model was discussed in detail.

It is very importanr to {{know what}} friction correction to make to stress-strain curves obtained in compression so that constitutive models of metals can be accurately checked. However, it recently became apparent that standard analytical models commonly used to correct for friction in the split Hopkinson pressure bar have some serious errors. In this paper, we report a novel method of determining the friction coefficient for the case of axial compressive dynamic deformation of annuli. The method combines numerical modelling with high-speed photography and has been validated using Rolled Homogeneous Amour (RHX) steel. 1...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{ubiquity of}} {{physical}} obstacles (e. g., buildings, hills, and <b>blindages,</b> etc.) in the real world, most of spatial queries ignore the obstacles. In this article, we study a novel form of continuous nearest-neighbor queries {{in the presence of}} obstacles, namely continuous obstructed nearest-neighbor (CONN) search, which considers the impact of obstacles on the distance between objects. Given a data setP, an obstacle set O, and a query line segment q, in a two-dimensional space, a CONN query retrieves the nearest neighbor p ∈ P of each point p′ on q according to the obstructed distance, the shortest path between p and p′ without crossing any obstacle in O. We formalize CONN search, analyze its unique properties, and develop algorithms for exact CONN query-processing assuming that both P and O are indexed by conventional data-partitioning indices (e. g., R-trees). Our methods tackle CONN retrieval by performing a single query for the entire query line segment, and only process the data points and obstacles relevant to the final query result via a novel concept of control points and an efficient quadratic-based split point computation approach. Then, we extend our techniques to handle variations of CONN queries, including (1) continuous obstructed k nearest neighbor (COkNN) search which, based on obstructed distances, finds the k(≥ 1) nearest neighbors (NNs) to every point along q; and (2) trajectory obstructed k nearest-neighbor (TOkNN) search, which, according to obstructed distances, returns the k NNs for each point on an arbitrary trajectory (consisting of several consecutive line segments). Finally, we explore approximate COkNN (ACOkNN) retrieval. Extensive experiments with both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithms under various experimental settings...|$|R
