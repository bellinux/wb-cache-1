5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai), {{also known}} as the {{bumblebee}} bat, is a vulnerable species of <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> the only extant member of the family Craseonycteridae. It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Myanmar, where it occupies limestone caves along rivers.|$|E

5|$|An all-rounder with a {{moderate}} first class record (averaging 32 with the <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> 40 with the ball), Cowdrey's debut as {{captain in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and took no wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was persuaded to step aside for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Flintoff was {{the leading}} {{performer}} for England, averaging 64.50 with the <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> claiming 14 wickets. Ashley Giles {{was the leading}} wicket taker in the series with 22. This series saw Ian Bell make his Test debut in the final Test of the series, where he compiled his maiden half-century. The main highlights for the West Indies were Chanderpaul's batting performance in scoring 437 runs {{at an average of}} 72.83, the highest in the series, and Bravo's 16 wickets.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Interstate League season, Levan was called up to the Phillies. He made his major league debut against the New York Giants, {{collecting}} his first hit in his second official at bat. Batting second in the lineup, he finished his first game 2-for-5, notching his first major league run batted in (RBI). The following day, he helped pitcher Curt Simmons, a former teammate in American Legion Baseball, earn his first victory over Andy Hansen of the Giants by hitting safely twice in four times at <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> scoring one run.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an edge that appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable to claim a site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Loxton {{played in}} the match against Northamptonshire, which started the day after Trent Bridge. With pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall injured and Keith Miller rested following a marathon effort in the opening Test, Loxton opened the bowling and took 2/22 from 15 overs the hosts were dismissed for 119. He made only 17 with the <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> took 0/7, again opening in the second innings as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. Loxton was rested for the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire; Brown scored a century in a drawn match.|$|E

5|$|Desmond Haynes was {{the fourth}} man to be {{dismissed}} for handling the ball in Test cricket, {{just over a year}} after Mohsin. Facing India in late 1983, Haynes had been struck on the <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> pad by the ball, which then headed towards the stumps. The West Indian batsman redirected the ball away from the stumps with his free hand. Upon being given out, Haynes—who was ignorant of the law regarding handling the ball—argued with the umpire about the dismissal. After asking the bowler, Kapil Dev, if he wanted to withdraw his appeal, the umpire sent Haynes back to the pavilion. The first instance in One Day Internationals was in 1986, when the Indian batsman Mohinder Amarnath knocked away a turning delivery from Australia's Greg Matthews that was heading for the stumps. In 1993, Graham Gooch became the only player to be dismissed for handling the ball after scoring a century. Playing defensively to try and draw the Test match against Australia, Gooch blocked a short ball from Merv Hughes. The ball flicked off his <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> fell towards his stumps, prompting Gooch to instinctively punch the ball away: Australia won the match by 179 runs.|$|E
5|$|Greece: The {{species has}} been {{recorded}} in the Pindus and Rhodopi Mountains of central and northern Greece. Here, M.alcathoe is usually found in stands of plane or alder trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> with M.mystacinus.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} the season strongly, with 19 wickets {{in the last}} three matches against Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. This included a haul of 5/28 and 2/37 as he helped New South Wales to a win over their arch-rivals Victoria, who had defeated them earlier in the season. His debut season ended with 26 wickets at 18.73. He did not surpass his debut innings with the <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> ended with 110 runs at 15.71.|$|E

50|$|Frank William Quinn (November 27, 1927 - January 11, 1993) was {{a pitcher}} in Major League Baseball for two {{seasons with the}} Boston Red Sox. He <b>batted</b> <b>and</b> threw {{right-handed}} and appeared in nine games in relief, receiving no decisions and striking out four batters in twenty-four innings. He <b>batted</b> <b>and</b> threw right-handed.|$|R
5|$|He {{then took}} 5/63 {{in the first}} innings of the Third Test at Headingley, {{removing}} Subba Row, May, Barrington and Ted Dexter {{at the top of}} the order, but Australia struggled with the <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> England lost only two wickets in reaching 62 in the second innings to level the series. Davidson took one of those wickets, removing Subba Row.|$|E
5|$|Healy was {{selected}} for the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies and played in every match after Fields was again forced out by injury. In the first warm-up match, she took two catches and did not bat as Australia lost to New Zealand by 18 runs. In the last warm-up match, she was again not required to <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> {{did not make a}} dismissal as the Australians defeated Pakistan by 82 runs.|$|E
5|$|If the {{designated}} hitter (DH) rule is in effect, each {{team has a}} tenth player whose sole responsibility is to <b>bat</b> (<b>and</b> run). The DH {{takes the place of}} another player—almost invariably the pitcher—in the batting order, but does not field. Thus, even with the DH, each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players.|$|E

Females give birth annually to a single offspring.|$|E

5|$|Miller was {{selected}} for an Australian XIa team comprising a mix of established international representatives and fringe playersfixture against the tourists prior to the Test series, but made only five runs with the <b>bat</b> <b>and</b> bowled only four overs, taking 0/8 in a rain-affected match that did not reach the second innings. In a Shield match against South Australia—led by national captain Don Bradman—at the Adelaide Oval, Miller {{had a chance to}} push for selection by performing well in front of the Australian captain, who was {{also a member of the}} three-man national selection panel.|$|E
