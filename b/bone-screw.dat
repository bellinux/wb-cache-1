40|$|The <b>bone–screw</b> {{interface}} {{has been}} indicated as the weak link in pedicle screw spine fixation. Bisphosphonate treatment {{may have the}} effect of improving <b>bone–screw</b> interface fixation in spine fusion by inhibiting bone resorption. An experimental study was conducted using a porcine model to evaluate the influence of alendronate treatment on bone–pedicle screw interface fixation. Eleven pigs in the treatment group received alendronate 10  mg/day orally for three months postoperatively. The other 11 pigs served as a control group. Posterior lateral fusion with the CD Horizon pedicle screw system was performed with autograft on the lumbar spine on all animals. Biomechanical torsion test and histomorphometric parameters of screw fixation were evaluated three months after the operation. The maximum torque and initial angular stiffness of the treatment group was higher than that of the control group, but there was no statistical significance. The <b>bone–screw</b> contact surface was 23. 3 [*]±[*] 10 % for the treatment group and 9. 8 [*]±[*] 5. 9 % for the control group (P[*]<[*] 0. 01).

40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} {{simulation of}} trabecular surface remodeling {{was performed to}} investigate the basic effects of a fixation screw on the trabecular structural changes in a vertebral body. Voxel-based finite elements were used to construct computational models of the bone and screw for an entire vertebral body with the screw and for the <b>bone-screw</b> interface. The remodeling simulation for the entire vertebral body showed that the implantation of the fixation screw caused changes in the mechanical environment in the cancellous bone, leading to trabecular structural changes at the cancellous level. The effect of the screw on trabecular orientation was greater in the regions {{above and below the}} screw than on that in front of the screw. In the case of the <b>bone-screw</b> interface, the trabecular structural changes depended on the load applied to the screw. It was suggested that bone resorption predicted in the pull-out loading case would be a candidate cause of loosening of the screw. The results indicate that the effects of the implanted screw on the trabecular structural changes would be more important for longer-term fixation. 1...|$|E

30|$|It is {{well known}} that an age-related {{reduction}} in bone density reduces the mechanical properties of the <b>bone–screw</b> interface. Enlarging the spaces in the trabecular meshwork limits the immediate mechanical grip of the screws and compromises integration at the interface between bone and metal, thereby facilitating loosening of the implant. Surgical treatment of the osteoporotic vertebral column is therefore burdened with a high incidence of implant failure due to pedicle screws loosening as a result of pull-out phenomena [4, 11 – 13].|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Our aim was {{to review}} the {{experimental}} literature {{to determine what is}} known about functional and morphological tissue reactions around orthodontically loaded temporary skeletal anchorage devices. METHODS: The PubMed electronic database and the reference citations in published articles were searched to the end of April 2006. The inclusion criteria were animal studies about orthodontically loaded skeletal anchorage consisting of metallic bone plates or screw implants of 2. 2 mm diameter or less. Data on healing time, force application, stability, side effects, and osseointegration were collected by 2 independent readers. RESULTS: Eight articles met the selection criteria. The healing times ranged from 0 to 12 weeks, and the amount of force varied from 25 to 500 g. Implant stability was generally achieved without severe side effects. Direct <b>bone-screw</b> contact was reported to be 10 % to 58 %, and osseointegration increased with loading time. Nevertheless, no significant difference in <b>bone-screw</b> contact was found between loaded and unloaded screw implants, or between tension and pressure sides of loaded implants.

40|$|Introduction: Screw loosening, {{a common}} {{complication}} of patients undergoing a semi-rigid fixation, {{is associated with}} the radiological finding of lucency within bone surrounding the implanted screw. Case report: A clinical and radiologic review is presented of a patient who underwent rigid fixation with L 4 - 5 interbody fusion and L 3 - 4 posterolateral dynamic stabilization with Zimmer Dynamic-to-Optima (DTO) hybrid fusion to non-fusion system (Zimmer Spine, Minneapolis, MN) with hydroxyapatite coated pedicle screws that exhibited lucency on radiographic studies which subsequently disappeared. An L 4 - 5 interbody fusion and L 3 - 4 posterolateral dynamic stabilization was performed. The patient did well clinically postoperatively. At 4  months postoperatively, X-rays of the lumbar spine demonstrated the appearance of lucency around the left L 3 pedicle screw, which began to resolve at 10  months, and continued to resolve on subsequent CT scan 1  year postoperatively. The patient's clinical status continued to improve, with no complications. Conclusions: The development of radiolucent lines around pedicle screws several months postoperatively may be due to loosening of the screws or due to a stress response at the <b>bone-screw</b> interface. The subsequent disappearance of this finding would suggest the ongrowth of bone at the osteoconductive hydroxyapatite coating or the protection of the <b>bone-screw</b> interface afforded by dynamic stabilization...|$|E

40|$|Bone {{drilling}} is a {{major part}} of orthopaedic surgery performed during the internal fixation of fractured bones. At present, information related to drilling force, drilling torque, rate of drill bit penetration and drill bit rotational speed is not available to orthopaedic surgeons, clinicians and researchers as bone drilling is performed manually. This research demonstrates that bone drilling force data if recorded in-vivo, during the repair of bone fractures, can provide information about the strength/quality of the bone. Drilling force does not give a direct measure of bone strength; therefore it has been correlated with the shear strength and screw pullout strength to determine the efficacy in estimating the bone strength. Various synthetic bone material densities and animal bones have been tested to demonstrate the use of drilling force data. A novel automated experimental test rig, which enables drilling tests, screw insertion and screw pullout tests to be carried out in a controlled environment, has been developed. Both drilling and screw pullout tests have been carried out in a single setting of the specimen to reduce the experimental errors and increase repeatability of the results. A significantly high value of correlation (r² > 0. 99) between drilling force & shear strength and also between drilling force & normalised screw pullout strength in synthetic bone material was found. Furthermore, a high value of correlation (r² = 0. 958 for pig bones and r² = 0. 901 for lamb bones) between maximum drilling force & normalised screw pullout strength was also found.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the clinical outcome of {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) reconstruction between the inside-out and the outside-in techniques and assessed radiographically whether surgical technique affects the position {{and direction of the}} bone tunnels. A patellar tendon ACL reconstruction was performed in 141 patients with inside-out (group I, n = 78) and outside-in technique (group II, n = 63). Clinical results were evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form; radiographic study was performed in anteroposterior, lateral, and notch views. Overall results in group I were normal in 23 % of cases, nearly normal in 55 %, and abnormal in 22 %; in group II there were normal results in 19 % of cases, nearly normal in 57 %, abnormal in 19 %, and severely abnormal in 5 %. Radiographic examination identified important differences between the two groups. The main differences between the two surgical techniques were related to the positioning of the femoral tunnel. With the inside-out technique the femoral tunnel was significantly more vertical, both in the frontal and the sagittal planes. Moreover, the femoral tunnel was higher when drilled from the inside, but {{the difference between the two}} techniques was not statistically significant. The differences found between the two techniques regarding the tibial tunnel were not significant, although in the inside-out group the tibial tunnel seemed slightly more lateral, vertical, and posterior.

40|$|A {{lot of new}} implant {{devices for}} spine surgery are coming onto the market, in which {{vertebral}} screws play a fundamental role. The new screws developed for surgery of spine deformities have to be compared to established systems. A biomechanical in vitro {{study was designed to}} assess the <b>bone–screw</b> interface fixation strength of seven different screws used for correction of scoliosis in spine surgery. The objectives of the current study were twofold: (1) to evaluate the initial strength at the <b>bone–screw</b> interface of newly developed vertebral screws (Universal Spine System II) compared to established systems (product comparison) and (2) to evaluate the influence of screw design, screw diameter, screw length and bone mineral density on pullout strength. Fifty-six calf vertebral bodies were instrumented with seven different screws (USS II anterior 8. 0  mm, USS II posterior 6. 2  mm, KASS 6. 25  mm, USS II anterior 6. 2  mm, USS II posterior 5. 2  mm, USS 6. 0  mm, USS 5. 0  mm). Bone mineral density (BMD) was determined by quantitative computed tomography (QCT). Failure in axial pullout was tested using a displacement-controlled universal test machine. USS II anterior 8. 0  mm showed higher pullout strength than all other screws. The difference constituted a tendency (P =  0. 108) when compared to USS II posterior 6. 2  mm (+ 19 %) and was significant in comparison to the other screws (+ 30 to + 55 %, P <  0. 002). USS II posterior 6. 2  mm showed significantly higher pullout strength than USS 5. 0  mm (+ 30 %, P =  0. 014). The other screws did not differ significantly in pullout strength. Pullout strength correlated significantly with BMD (P =  0. 0015) and vertebral body width/screw length (P <  0. 001). The newly developed screws for spine surgery (USS II) show higher pullout strength when compared to established systems. Screw design had no significant influence on pullout force in vertebral body screws, but outer diameter of the screw, screw length and BMD are good predictors of pullout resistance...|$|E

How-ever, obtaining adequate purchase with standard pedicle screw fixation remains a challenge in spines with poor bone quality due to complications such as screw loosen-ing, and migration or back-out [3 - 5]. Several techniques have been proposed to improve the <b>bone-screw</b> interface bone trajectory (more medial-to-lateral path) [6] and aug-mentation using bone cement [4, 5]. Furthermore, the inter-face strength may be increased by use of expandable pedicle screws, resorbable polymers, rib grafts, milled bone, and matchstick bone [7]. Fixation of the screw into the vertebral body is trad-itionally evaluated by determining the axial pullout strength of implanted screws. In the present study, the two most frequently used methods, augmentation with PMMA and large diameter pedicle screws, were tested.

40|$|Abstract- Progressive {{loosening}} of {{bone fixation}} screws is a well-documented phenomenon, induced by stress shielding and subsequent adaptive bone remodeling {{which results in}} bone loss around the screw. A set of two-dimensional computational (finite element) models was developed {{in order to test}} the effect of various screw profiles on the predicted extent of bone resorption. An algorithm simulating local bone adaptation to mechanical stimuli was developed and subsequently used to evaluate the biomechanical performances of the different screw profiles analyzed, i. e., triangular, rectangular and trapezoidal thread shapes. This remodeling algorithm predicted local bone gain or loss {{in the vicinity of the}} screw as a response to the resulted mechanical stress distribution. A dimensionless set of stress intensity parameters (SIP) was developed to quantify the <b>bone-screw</b> stress transfer, enabling a convenient rating of different screw performances according to the nature of expected adaptation of the surrounding bone. The results indicated that a wide rectangular screw profile is of superior biomechanical compatibility with bone compared to the other profile types. The present work demonstrated that bone remodeling computer simulations can be used as a powerful tool for evaluation of different design parameters of fixative screws, such as geometry, material characteristics and even coatings...|$|E
30|$|For {{follow-up}} of bone healing and callus formation, CR may be difficult, {{especially in the}} presence of overlying splints or casts. As CBCT can provide more detailed information on bone architecture in comparison to CR, it can also help in evaluation of the healing process, which can be over- or underestimated on CR [6]. As a cross-sectional technique and the possibility for multidirectional reformations and 3 -D reconstructions, CBCT is superior to CR in assessment of callus formation, osseous bridging and evaluation of residual fracture lines. In case of postoperative follow-up after placement of metallic hardware, incomplete healing as well as early detection of hardware loosening may be facilitated by CBCT. For hardware fractures, however, CR still remains the preferred method because of potential metallic streak artifacts on CBCT. The possible explanation for this potential discrepancy is related {{to the size of the}} metal objects. Indeed, at the <b>bone–screw</b> interface, higher contrast and spatial resolution of CBCT dominates the effect of the beam hardening owing to the relatively small size of metallic screws. Conversely, the beam hardening artifact surrounding large side plates in CBCT images compared with plain radiograph dominates the effect of better contrast resolution on CBCT [23]. Despite the use of current Metal Artifact Reduction sequences, the overall usefulness of MRI after screw fixation is limited due to metal artifacts.|$|E
40|$|When {{a patient}} is {{diagnosed}} with various spinal injuries, deformities, or advanced degeneration, it is commonly suggested that he/she undergoes surgery for spinal fusion. Most current procedures in spinal fusion restrict mobility in one or multiple levels of the spine so that, over time, new bone will grow between the levels creating a single motionless unit of bone. The bilateral pedicle screw system (BPSS) has long been {{considered to be the}} 2 ̆ 2 gold standard 2 ̆ 2 in spinal fusion. However, for patients with osteoporosis, adequate fixation within the <b>bone-screw</b> interface has continuously been difficult to achieve or has come with high risk of other forms of catastrophic damage. Reflecting this, a new pedicle screw design was developed and evaluated against current standard pedicle screws commonly used in spinal surgery. All screw designs were also tested with a common cement augmentation technique surrounding the circumference of the screw. All tests measured pullout strength, stiffness, energy to failure, toughness, and the amount of destruction to the surrounding synthetic bone. While the newly designed pedicle screw failed to produce significantly stronger pullout forces in comparison to the standard screws, it did show evidence of a longer lasting residual axial resistance and a safer mode of failure than the standard screw, hinting that the design may benefit individuals who experience screw pullout and are awaiting reinstrumentation...|$|E

Early implant-bone mechanical fixation is an important requirement for the successful performance of such implants. However, adequate osseointegration {{has been difficult to}} achieve especially in challenging disease states like osteoporosis due to reduced bone mass and strength. Here, we present a simple coating strategy based on passive adsorption of FN 7 - 10, a recombinant fragment of human fibronectin encompassing the major cell adhesive, integrin-binding site, onto 316 -grade stainless steel (SS). FN 7 - 10 coating on SS surfaces promoted α 5 β 1 integrin-dependent adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells. FN 7 - 10 -coated SS screws increased bone-implant mechanical fixation compared to uncoated screws by 30 % and 45 % at 1 and 3 months, respectively, in healthy rats. Importantly, FN 7 - 10 coating significantly enhanced <b>bone-screw</b> fixation by 57 % and 32 % at 1 and 3 months, respectively, and bone-implant ingrowth by 30 % at 3 months compared to uncoated screws in osteoporotic rats.

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} and {{evaluate}} a technique known as common average referencing (CAR) {{to generate a}} more ideal reference electrode for microelectrode recordings. CAR is a computationally simple technique, and therefore amenable to both on-chip and real-time applications. CAR is commonly used in EEG, where {{it is necessary to}} identify small signal sources in very noisy recordings. To study the efficacy of common average referencing, we compared CAR to both referencing with a stainless steel <b>bone-screw</b> and a single microelectrode site. Data consisted of in vivo chronic recordings in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats drawn from prior studies, as well as previously unpublished data. By combining the data from multiple studies, we generated and analyzed one of the more comprehensive chronic neural recording datasets to date. Reference types were compared in terms of noise level, signal-to-noise ratio, and number of neurons recorded across days. Common average referencing was found to drastically outperform standard types of electrical referencing, reducing noise by > 30 %. As a result of the reduced noise floor, arrays referenced to a CAR yielded almost 60 % more discernible neural units than traditional methods of electrical referencing. CAR should impart similar benefits to other microelectrode recording technologies—for example, chemical sensing—where similar differential recording concepts apply. In addition, we provide a mathematical justification for CAR using Gauss-Markov theorem and therefore help place the application of CAR into a theoretical context...|$|E

MethodsSix female sheep with bilateral ovariectomy- induced osteoporosis were employed in this experiment. After EPS insertion in each femoral condyle, the sheep were randomly divided into two groups: 3 sheep were bred for 3 months (Group A), while the other 3 were bred for 6 months (Group B). After the animals being killed, the femoral condyles with EPS were obtained, which were three-dimensionallyimaged and reconstructed by micro-CT. Histological evaluation was made thereafter. ResultsThe trabecular microstructure was denser at the screw-bone interface than in the distant parts in expansive section, especially within the spiral marking. In the non- expansive section, however, {{there was no significant}} difference between the interface and the distant parts. The regions of interest (ROI) adjacent to EPS were reconstructed and analyzed by micro-CT with the same thresholds. The three-dimensional (3 -D) parameters, including tissue mineral density (TMD), bone volume fraction (BVF, BV/TV), bone surface/bone volume (BS/BV) ratio, trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), and trabecular separation (Tb. Sp), were significantly better in expansive sections than non-expansive sections (P < 0. 05). Histologically, newly-formed bony trabeculae crawled along the expansive fissures and into the center of EPS. The newly-formed bones, as well as the bones at the <b>bone-screw</b> interface, closely contacted with the EPS and constructed four compartments.

Histomorphometric measurement and confocal microscopy were performed on basic fuchsin stained bone sections to examine the morphological characteristics of microdamage, bone resorption activity and spatial relationship between microdamage and bone resorption. Diffuse and linear cracks were coexisted in peri-screw bone. Intracortical bone resorption was significantly increased 2 weeks after screw installation and reach to the maximum at 1 month.

The sections were also stained and examined under ordinary light. Results: Three types of reactions were observed both on the histological sections and on the microradiographs. 1. The majority of the stable miniplates were easy to remove (34 / 42). The tissue samples collected consisted mainly in mature lamellar bone with some medullary spaces containing blood vessels, 2. two screws were highly osseointegrated and required the surgeon to remove them by trephining (2 / 42). They were surrounded by bone tissue which extended to the miniplate. The histological features were similar to the previous group, though the <b>bone-screw</b> contact was higher, and 3. in six samples obtained after unstable miniplate removal during the treatment, we observed either some woven bone trabeculae or loose connective tissue, without any histological sign of inflammation. Limitations and Conclusion: For evident ethical reasons, our data were limited {{by the size of the}} tissue fragments and the limited number of patients and variety of clinical presentations. The healing reactions consisted mainly in mature lamellar bone tissue sparsely in contact with the screw or the miniplate, with signs of a moderate remodelling activit...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{aimed to}} use the animal model of dynamic {{fixation}} to examine {{the interaction of the}} pedicle screw surface with surrounding bone, and determine whether pedicle screws achieve good mechanical stability in the vertebrae. Methods: Twenty-four goats aged 2 - 3 years had Cosmic ® pedicle screws implanted into both sides of the L 2 -L 5 pedicles. Twelve goats in the bilateral dynamic fixation group had fixation rods implanted in L 2 -L 3 and L 4 -L 5. Twelve goats in the unilateral dynamic fixation group had fixation rods randomly fixed {{on one side of the}} lumbar spine. The side that was not implanted with fixation rods was used as a static control group. Results: In the static control group, new bone was formed around the pedicle screw and on the screw surface. In the unilateral and bilateral dynamic fixation groups, large amounts of connective tissue formed between and around the screw threads, with no new bone formation on the screw surface; the pedicle screws were loose after the fixed rods were removed. The bone mineral density and morphological parameters of the region of interest (ROI) in the unilateral and bilateral dynamic fixation group were not significantly different (P > 0. 05), but were lower in the fixed groups than the static control group (P 0. 05); however the maximum pull force of the fixation groups was significantly less than the static control group (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Fibrous connective tissue formed at the <b>bone-screw</b> interface under unilateral and bilateral pedicle dynamic fixation, and the pedicle screws lost mechanical stability in the vertebrae...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} of this animal study were to evaluate if orthodontic loading {{has an impact}} on osseointegration of screws supporting miniplates, and to describe the histological components of the <b>bone-screw</b> interface. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty orthodontic miniplates were placed in the jaws of 10 dogs. After 2 weeks, a 125 g force was applied between the miniplates of one upper quadrant of each dog and between those of the controlateral lower quadrant. The others, nonloaded miniplates, were considered as controls. Five dogs were sacrificed 7 weeks after implantation and the remaining five dogs after 29 weeks [Short Term (ST) and Long Term (LT) groups, respectively]. Fluorochromes were injected at implantation and at sacrifice. Jaw quadrants were dissected, embedded, cut into undecalcified transverse sections through the screws and finally submitted to microradiographic analysis to allow assessment of bone-implant contact (BIC) and bone volume/total volume (BV/TV). The sections were observed under UV light and stained in order to examine them under ordinary light. RESULTS: Osseointegration occurred around 90 / 160 screws and consisted mainly in limited repair and remodelling processes of lamellar bone, without inflammation. Wide variations were observed in BIC and BV/TV, but without any significant difference, neither between the loaded and the nonloaded screws, nor according to the direction of load, whereas they were significantly higher in the LT than in the ST group. Nonosseointegrated screws were surrounded by fibrous tissue. Osteoblastic activity, when present in front of these screws, was not sufficient to achieve stability. CONCLUSIONS: Osseointegration underlying orthodontic anchorage was not affected by loading. BIC increased with time and varied according to implantation site. Particularly the tight-fitting screw insertion appeared crucial in determining the appropriate bone healing response...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{level to}} which bone screws are {{tightened}} is determined subjectively by the operating surgeon. It {{is likely that}} the tactile feedback that surgeons rely on is based on localized tissue yielding, which may predispose the screw–bone interface to failure. A limited number of studies have investigated the ratio between clinical tightening torque and stripping torque. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure, for the first time, the ratio between yield torque (Tyield) and stripping torque (Tmax) during screw insertion into the cancellous bone and to compare these torques with clinical levels of tightening reported in the literature. Additionally, a rotational limit was investigated as a potential end point for screw insertion in cancellous bone. Methods: A 6. 5 -mm outer diameter commercial cancellous bone screw was inserted into human femoral head specimens (n = 89). Screws were inserted to failure, while recording insertion torque, compression under the screw head, and rotation angle. Results: The median, interquartile ranges, and coefficient of variation were calculated for each of the following parameters: Tyield, Tmax, Tyield/Tmax, slope, Tplateau, and rotation angle. The median ratio of Tyield/Tmax and rotation angle was 85. 45 % and 96. 5 degrees, respectively. The coefficient of variation was greatest for the rotation angle compared with the ratio of Tyield/Tmax (0. 37 vs. 0. 12). Conclusions: The detection of yield may be a more precise method than the rotation angle in cancellous bone; however, <b>bone–screw</b> constructs that exhibit a Tyield close to Tmax may be more susceptible to stripping during insertion. Future work can identify factors that influence the ratio of Tyield/Tmax may help to reduce the incidence of screw stripping. Melissa K. Ryan, Aaron A. Mohtar, John J. Costi and Karen J.

40|$|Under normal conditions, loading {{activities}} {{result in}} microdamage {{in the living}} skeleton, which is repaired by bone remodeling. However, microdamage accumulation can affect the mechanical properties of bone and {{increase the risk of}} fracture. This study aimed to determine the effect of microdamage on the mechanical properties and composition of bone. Fourteen male goats aged 28 months were used in the present study. Cortical bone screws were placed in the tibiae to induce microdamage around the implant. The goats were euthanized, and 3 bone segments with the screws in each goat were removed at 0 days, 21 days, 4 months, and 8 months after implantation. The bone segments were used for observing microdamage and bone remodeling, as well as nanoindentation and bone composition, separately. Two regions were measured: the first region (R 1), located 1. 5 mm from the interface between the screw hole and bone; and the second region (R 2), located> 1. 5 mm from the <b>bone-screw</b> interface. Both diffuse and linear microdamage decreased significantly with increasing time after surgery, with the diffuse microdamage disappearing after 8 months. Thus, screw implantation results in increased bone remodeling either in the proximal or distal cortical bone, which repairs the microdamage. Moreover, bone hardness and elastic modulus decreased with microdamage repair, especially in the proximal bone tissue. Bone composition changed greatly during the production and repair of microdamage, especially for the C (Carbon) and Ca (Calcium) in the R 1 region. In conclusion, the presence of mechanical microdamage accelerates bone remodeling either in the proximal or distal cortical bone. The bone hardness and elastic modulus decreased with microdamage repair, with the micromechanical properties being restored on complete repair of the microdamage. Changes in bone composition may contribute to changes in bone mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Background: When {{performing}} arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis for end-stage ankle arthritis, internal fixation {{is performed}} using bone screws after appropriate preparation. However, optimal characteristics of bone screws have not been examined in terms of pressure force. Objective comparisons of <b>bone-screw</b> performance may provide information on procedures for arthroscopic ankle arthrodesis. The study objectives were {{to determine whether it}} was possible to measure compressive force changes using the newly developed device and to infer all screw characteristics from measurement results when used in actual surgeries. In addition, we performed experiments on cadavers to verify whether the experimental results could be applied to the joints of living subjects. Methods: Three types of screws (S 1, S 2, and S 3) were inserted into the unique measurement device, and the changes in pressure were measured for each 45 ° turn. Changes in pressure and maximum pressure force were recorded after the application of the screws. After reaching the maximum pressure in the simulated bone, further screw rotations were accompanied by a gradual pressure decrease to 0 MPa. We also measured pressure changes in a similar manner by inserting a miniature pressure sensor into the talocrural joints of cadavers. Results: The mean maximum pressure[*]±[*]standard deviation for S 1, S 2, and S 3 were 0. 832 [*]±[*] 0. 164 MPa, 0. 434 [*]±[*] 0. 116 MPa, and 0. 414 [*]±[*] 0. 127 MPa, respectively. Pressure slopes to the maximum did not significantly differ between the screws in the simulated bone, and a subsequent pressure decrease to 0 MPa was significantly more rapid for S 1 than for S 2 and S 3. Although pressure failure after the overtightening of screws was only observed in the simulated bone, patterns of pressure vs. rotation angle were similar in simulated and cadaveric bones. The pressure profile characteristics of three different screw types were determined. Conclusions: We were able to measure the compressive force changes using the newly developed device when the screws were inserted. On the basis of the measurement results, we were able to infer the characteristics of all screws when used in actual surgery. 博士（医学）・乙第 1403 号・平成 29 年 6 月 28 日Copyright © The Author(s). 2017 Open Access This article is distributed {{under the terms of the}} Creative Commons Attribution 4. 0 International License ([URL] which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

40|$|The {{most common}} failure in {{orthopaedic}} implants {{occurs at the}} <b>bone-screw</b> interface with screw pullout being a typical mechanical cause of fault. Even {{in the case of}} healthy bones with excellent initial fixation, micromotions experienced by the skeleton potentially lead to a progressive loosening. Although the micromotions might be dissipated ending in a long-term stability, they could also persist causing the vibration of the screw within the much softer surrounding bone tissue. As a result the interface would predictably get destroyed leading to increased liklihood of pullout. One reason for this is the mismatch between stiffnesses. The assessment of the interface becomes even more important in osteoporotic bone. Image-Guided Failure Assessment (IGFA) which integrates the application of a stepwise mechanical loading with the CT-scanning of each evolution, helps to know more about this type of failure. A conflict in CT-scanning of metal screws are the artifacts obtained on the image which disable the definition of an automated segmentation procedure and increase the difficulty to estimate the interface. Those artifacts are a consequence of the metal material and depend on the density and thickness/ volume involved. A detailed methodology was applied {{to come up with a}} new design of the current implant. First of all a Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) helped to clarify the weaknesses of the design. Later a morphological box and corresponding benchmarking were carried out to find solutions. After careful reasoning and assessment of the found alternatives, the validity of each proposal was examined. With the resulting configuration a Material Selection Approach was made in order to discriminate among all the available materials and find the ones that better fit the requirements of the project. With Nickel coated PEEK as a final solution, distinct thicknesses were also tried out to optimize the design. A final thickness of 100 μm and two different configurations with and without addition of a protective layer were chosen and applied to the final screws. A realistic test to assess the fatigue resistance was made in a Zwick machine. Ovine vertebral bodies were used to carry out the experiments. It was observed how a lot of the coating came off during the insertion affecting mainly the edges of the screw thread. Improvement of the surface treatment was then defined as an outlook. Other properties like hardness, roughness, friction coefficient and scratching resistance were as well evaluated. By means of XIPL image processing routines implemented by the Institute for Biomechanics within the OpenVMS environment, a script to get an automeated segmentation of the implant and the bone was defined. A validation procedure for the image rocessing routine was also created to assess the validity in comparison with a manually contoured solution, and good agreement was found...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of temporary skeletal anchorage in orthodontics during the eighties, osteosynthesis miniplates, modified with orthodontic attachments, have been increasingly used. However, no quantitative data about bone reactions around loaded miniplates, and only few prospective clinical studies with small numbers of patients, {{were found in the}} literature. Therefore, this project was set up to scientifically emphasize the use of miniplates for orthodontic anchorage with combined experimental and clinical approaches. The specific objectives of the experimental chapters of this thesis were to evaluate if orthodontic loading has an impact on bone reactions around screws supporting miniplates, and to describe the histological components of the <b>bone-screw</b> interface. The clinical chapters aimed to determine patients’, orthodontists’ and surgeons’ perceptions about miniplates, to assess their success rate and to describe the surgical techniques of placement and removal. The experimental study involved eighty miniplates, placed in the jaws of 10 dogs : 2 miniplates per jaw quadrant. After 2 weeks, coil springs applying a 125 g force were placed between the miniplates of an upper quadrant and the controlateral lower quadrant of each dog. The other miniplates were not loaded and were considered controls. Five dogs were sacrificed 7 weeks after implantation and 5 dogs after 29 weeks. Fluorochromes were injected at implantation and at sacrifice. Jaw quadrants were scanned with peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography. Undecalcified sections were carried out and submitted to microradiographic analysis to assess bone-implant contact and bone volume/total volume. The sections were finally observed under UV light, stained and examined under ordinary light. The success rate in this animal study was 53 % and the proportion of stable miniplates was significantly higher in the maxilla than in the mandible. No significant difference in success rate was found between loaded and nonloaded miniplates. Mobility occurred on average 5 weeks after placement. Bone mineral density was higher around mandibular than around maxillary miniplates, but was not significantly different around loaded and nonloaded miniplates. Bone implant contact and bone volume/total volume did not differ significantly neither between the loaded and the nonloaded screws, nor according to the direction of load, whereas they increased with time. Fifty-six percent of the screws were osseointegrated. Healing reactions showed mainly limited remodelling of lamellar bone. The remaining screws were fibro-integrated. Stability and osseointegration of titanium orthodontic miniplates were thus influenced by the recipient site anatomy, but not by loading. The clinical study focused on ninety-seven consecutive patients treated with miniplates, who completed questionnaires. A total of 200 miniplates were placed by nine oral surgeons, who filled out questionnaires after placement and removal surgeries. The 30 orthodontists treating these patients also completed questionnaires concerning miniplate success, handling complexity, and effectiveness. The success rate obtained in this clinical survey was 92. 5 %. Placement surgery, generally performed under local anesthesia, lasted on average 15 - 30 minutes per plate, and was considered by the surgeons to be very to moderately easy. Patients tolerated the miniplates well : 72 % of patients said they did not mind having the implant and 82 % reported that the surgical experience was better than expected, with little or no pain. The chief complaints were post-surgical swelling, lasting 5 days on average, and cheek irritation. The orthodontists rated these devices as easy to use and simplifying treatment. The removal surgery was shorter and considered easier than the placement surgery. Miniplates were thus well accepted by patients and providers, and were considered a useful tool especially for difficult treatments. (SBIM 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|E
