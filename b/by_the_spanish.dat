5|$|Epidemics accidentally {{introduced}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spanish</b> included smallpox, measles and influenza.

Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
