40|$|The Livigno area {{represents}} a good {{test for the}} groundwater system reconstruction in the mountain environment {{because it has a}} complex geological and tectonical setting. In order to characterize this aquifer, a multidisciplinary approach, based on lithological, geochemical, hydrogeological and geo-structural methods, has been adopted. The Livigno area is located at 1800 m s. l. m. in the central Alps (northern Lombardy – Italy). For the tectonic setting this area is comprise between the Err Bernina system (Lower Australpine) and the Ortles-Quatervals system (Upper Austroalpine). The most important regional fault is represented by Zebrù fault. This fault divides the sedimentary rocks constituted by Fraele and Monte Motto limestone (Lias) to crystalline basement, which is constituted by “Bormio phyllades” and “Punta Rossa Formation”. To the north of Zebru fault system the Alpisella fault system outcrops and divides the Monte Motto limestone by Triassic dolomites and limestones. In the Livigno area 32 springs were sampled and analyzed. In particular, in the Mine Valley (in the south part of the Livigno area) there is a peculiar spring, named “White”, which shows a peculiar unknown whitish deposition. The first step was to characterize that compound through the integration of several analytical techniques: XRD, SEM-EDX, FTIR, ICP-MS. Using this approach we tried to have a complete picture of the problem, also matching results with hydro-geochemical information. Via the elemental analysis with EDX was identified the presence of aluminum, sulfur, oxygen and silicon. Subsequent analysis and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>documentations</b> [1] allowed us to identify the following structure tridecameric of Na[Al 13 O 4 (OH) 24 (H 2 O) 12] (SO 4) 4 x 13 H 2 O, and detect an anomaly in the presence of rare earth elements (REE) in the whitish compound. The second step was to analyze closely at Livigno water, which confirmed this peculiarity in REE in the “White” spring. [1] I. N. Bhattacharya, P. K. Gochhayat, P. S. Mukherjee, S. Paul, P. K.

By a literature review, we identify four factors that can influence competition in clusters: the region's productivity, innovation, relationship with suppliers, and cooperation between companies. The research method is the single case study. The research techniques are the review of specific <b>bibliographic</b> and <b>documentation</b> of the studied cluster, and interviews with experts of the cluster. The main findings are: the cluster has high productivity, mainly by hi-tech machinery employed by the main companies; innovation is permanent and motivated by the imposition to medium and short companies of business goals by the main companies; the relationship with suppliers is problematic regarding the large-scale vendors by the lack of the practice of collective purchases in the area; and cooperation between enterprises is small, by the culture of the region that don´t appreciate depending on resources available outside the companies.

Some recommendations and policy implications were suggested. The paper concludes, by arguing, that common internal and external challenges need to be addressed in a systematic manner within the broader cultural and tourism policy context in which urban tourism is now implicated. There is a lack of literature on urban tourism within the Arab countries, which is attributed to that tourism in the Arab world is heritage dominated type.

We intend to investigate, according to Fraser-Honneth debate, whether such theoretical frameworks are consistent with the challenges able to face forms of judicialization expressed in {{the trial of}} the Allegation of Unconstitutionality number 4277 -DF by the Brazilian Supreme Court, criticizing speeches implied in votes of Justices, insusceptible to desestabilize the binary sexual identities. Through a monographic method (case study) and using jurisprudential research about the votes of the Brazilian Supreme Court’s Justices, we conclude that the vote of Justice Carlos Ayres de Brito, despite its progressive content, also establishes a binary structure and certain speeches setting heteronormative standards that impede participatory parity of gay couples. We hold that the ideia of “Fraternal Constitutionalism”, mentioned by the Minister, is linked to affirmative remedies, not transformative. We argue that the theory of Fraser reveals more theoretical consistency to criticize the argumentative strategy of the Justices, especially given the emphasis on transformative remedies and desconstructive proposal.

Neste trabalho, a documentação etnográfica, a discussão bibliográfica sobre o denominado catolicismo popular e a contextualização histórica articulam-se com a finalidade de compreender algumas facetas das relações entre os homens (devoto/folião) e divindades do catolicismo não institucionalizado. Por meio da devoção, os homens estabelecem com os santos um elo de reciprocidade em que o processo comunicacional passa muitas vezes pela linguagem do corpo. Assim, {{a performance}} ritual sacraliza o espaço cotidiano e atualiza o contato entre mundos distintos, de modo a promover a circulação não só de bens e de homens, durante os dias de Folia, como também de símbolos, concepções e memória coletiva.

La metodología partió de la situación actual de las ornamentaciones, luego la valoración patrimonial y de riesgos se diseñaron y aplicaron fichas técnicas para levantamiento de información {{relevante}} que demanda la carta de Nara para la valoración patrimonial y la metodología de gestión de riesgos de un muestreo estratificado, procediéndose a la recolección de la información de campo con 120 fichas levantadas, a través de entrevistas. La valoración patrimonial inicia con el proceso de identificación de valores patrimoniales mediante la Matriz de Nara, apoyándonos en la documentación bibliográfica o secundaria e información primaria de las fichas de registro. Una vez identificados los valores patrimoniales de las ornamentaciones, con el método de valoración patrimonial se procedió a estimar el Nivel de expresión mediante un análisis estadístico de regresión y correlación de los parámetros que lo constituyen estos son la expresión o autenticidad material, la autenticidad del espacio y la forma y la integridad que sumados constituyen el nivel de expresión, unidad de medida del valor patrimonial. Posterior, con información de las fichas de gestión de riesgos se aplicó el método de valoración de riesgos fundamentado bajo los criterios de la metodología ISO 31000 : 2009 de la Organización Internacional de Normalización para la Gestión de Riesgos de Bienes Culturales Patrimoniales y adaptado para la gestión de riesgos de las ornamentaciones se utilizó para la estimación de la magnitud de riesgo. Los resultados para la interpretación de cualificación cuantitativa de los resultados de la suma de la magnitud de riesgo y nivel de expresión que fue de 21. 3, que para esa calificación la escala de ponderación sugiere medidas y acciones de monitoreo, más estudios para acciones correctivas y emergentes, que guió para construir el tratamiento de riesgos, estructurado principalmente de acuerdo a las 5 etapas de control de riesgos sugeridas por el método aplicado, estas etapas enfocan: evitar, bloquear, detectar, responder y recuperar, que sustentaron las directrices para la formulación del plan de conservación preventiva basada en valores. The vulnerability to threats of anthropic origin of dissociation for {{the occurrence of}} risk in the ornamentation of the façades of the houses of the first order area {{of the city of}} Cuenca constitutes the problem addressed by the study. The methodology was based on the current situation of the ornamentation, then the patrimonial and risk assessment were designed and applied technical data sheets for relevant information demanded by the letter of Nara for the equity valuation and the risk management methodology of a stratified sampling, and the field information was collected with 120 tokens collected through interviews. The equity valuation begins with the process of identifying patrimonial values through the Matrix of Nara, supporting us in the <b>bibliographic</b> or secondary <b>documentation</b> and primary information of the records. Once the patrimonial values of the ornaments were identified, with the patrimonial valuation method we proceeded to estimate the level of expression through a statistical analysis of regression and correlation of the parameters that constitute these are the expression or material authenticity, the authenticity of the space and the form and integrity that together constitute the level of expression, unit of measure of the equity value. Subsequently, with information on the risk management sheets, the risk assessment method was applied based on the criteria of the ISO 31000 : 2009 methodology of the International Organization for Standardization for Risk Management of Cultural Heritage Properties and adapted for the management risk of ornamentation was used for the estimation of the magnitude of risk. Once the level of expression and the magnitude of risk were obtained, the method of priority of results was applied which determines and suggests the measures and actions necessary for the state of danger of the ornaments. The estimation of the magnitude of risk is summed up with the estimation result of the magnitude of risk and collated with the scale of weighting of results for the interpretation of quantitative qualification {{of the results of the}} sum of the magnitude of risk and level of expression that was of 21. 3, that for this classification the weighting scale suggests measures and monitoring actions, more studies for corrective and emergent actions, guiding to construct the treatment of risks, structured mainly according to the 5 stages of risk control suggested by the method applied, these steps focus on avoiding, blocking, detecting, responding and recovering, which underpinned the guidelines for the formulation of the value-based preventive conservation plan.

40|$|Federal {{agencies}} and their partners collect and manage {{large amounts of}} geospatial data but it is often not easily found when needed, and sometimes data is collected or purchased multiple times. In short, the best government data is not always organized and managed efficiently to support decision making in a timely and cost effective manner. National mapping agencies, various Departments responsible for collection {{of different types of}} Geospatial data and their authorities cannot, for very long, continue to operate, as they did a few years ago like people living in an island. Leaders need to look at what is now possible that was not possible before, considering capabilities such as cloud computing, crowd sourced data collection, available Open source remotely sensed data and multi source information vital in decision-making as well as new Web-accessible services that provide, sometimes at no cost. Many of these services previously could be obtained only from local GIS experts. These authorities need to consider the available solution and gather information about new capabilities, reconsider agency missions and goals, review and revise policies, make budget and human resource for decisions, and evaluate new products, cloud services, and cloud service providers. To do so, we need, choosing the right tools to rich the above-mentioned goals. As we know, Data collection is the most cost effective part of the mapping and establishment of a Geographic Information system. However, it is {{not only because of the}} cost for the data collection task but also because of the damages caused by the delay and the time that takes to provide the user with proper information necessary for making decision from the field up to the user's hand. In fact, the time consumption of a project for data collection, processing, and presentation of geospatial information has more effect on the cost of a bigger project such as disaster management, construction, city planning, environment, etc. Of course, with such a pre-assumption that we provide all the necessary information from the existing sources directed to user's computer. The best description for a good GIS project optimization or improvement is finding a methodology to reduce the time and cost, and increase data and service quality (meaning; Accuracy, updateness, completeness, consistency, suitability, information content, integrity, integration capability, and fitness for use as well as user's specific needs and conditions that must be addressed with a special attention). Every one of the above-mentioned issues must be addressed individually and at the same time, the whole solution must be provided in a global manner considering all the criteria. In this thesis at first, we will discuss about the problem we are facing and what is needed to be done as establishment of National Spatial Data Infra-Structure (NSDI), the definition and related components. Then after, we will be looking for available Open Source Software solutions to cover the whole process to manage; Data collection, Data base management system, data processing and finally data services and presentation. The first distinction among Software is whether they are, Open source and free or commercial and proprietary. It is important to note that in order to make distinction among softwares it is necessary to define a clear specification for this categorization. It is somehow very difficult to distinguish what software belongs to which class from legal point of view and therefore, makes it necessary to clarify what is meant by various terms. With reference to this concept there are 2 global distinctions then, inside each group, we distinguish another classification regarding their functionalities and applications they are made for in GIScience. According to the outcome of the second chapter, which is the technical process for selection of suitable and reliable software according to the characteristics of the users need and required components, we will come to next chapter. In chapter 3, we elaborate in to the details of the GeoNode software as our best candidate tools to take responsibilities of those issues stated before. In Chapter 4, we will discuss the existing Open Source Data globally available with the predefined data quality criteria (Such as theme, data content, scale, licensing, and coverage) according to the metadata statement inside the datasets by mean of <b>bibliographic</b> review, technical <b>documentation</b> and web search engines. We will discuss in chapter 5 further data quality concepts and consequently define sets of protocol for evaluation of all datasets according to the tasks that a mapping organization in general, needed to be responsible to the probable users in different disciplines such as; Reconnaissance, City Planning, Topographic mapping, Transportation, Environment control, disaster management and etc… In Chapter 6, all the data quality assessment and protocols will be implemented into the pre-filtered, proposed datasets. In the final scores and ranking result, each datasets will have a value corresponding to their quality according to the sets of rules that are defined in previous chapter. In last steps, there will be a vector of weight that is derived from the questions that has to be answered by user with reference to the project in hand in order to finalize the most appropriate selection of Free and Open Source Data. This Data quality preference has to be defined by identifying a set of weight vector, and then they have to be applied to the quality matrix in order to get a final quality scores and ranking. At the end of this chapter there will be a section presenting data sets utilization in various projects such as " Early Impact Analysis" as well as "Extreme Rainfall Detection System (ERDS) - version 2 " performed by ITHACA. Finally, in conclusion, the important criteria, as well as future trend in GIS software are discussed and at the end recommendations will be presente...|$|R

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} {{the design of}} an epidemiologic study assessing possible health effects from chemical waste disposal sites are reviewed. Such epidemiologic studies {{will most likely be}} prompted either by a known release of chemicals into the environment around the site, or by an unusual disease cluster in a population near the site. In the latter situation, a method for evaluating the health effects is needed, and one possible approach is discussed. In the former situation, it may not be obvious what health outcomes are relevant. Reported associations between health effects and chemicals in humans were reviewed. Studies from the occupational and environmental literature were classified by chemical and target organ affected and presented in tabular form. No attempt was made to critically evaluate the quality of evidence for each health effect, although <b>bibliographic</b> <b>documentation</b> was provided where possible. Episodes of chemical contamination of food, drinking water and other media were also reviewed and presented in a separate table. The organ sites likely to be affected by toxic chemicals from waste disposal sites depend heavily on the route of exposure and the dose that is received. Ingestion is the most frequently reported route of exposure in episodes of environmental contamination. These have affected the hepatic, renal, hematopoietic, reproductive, and central nervous systems. The type and severity of effects were dose-dependent. Direct skin contact is important in the occupational environment where dermal and central nervous system effects have been reported but seems less likely as a route of exposure for populations around waste disposal sites. Inhalation, unless at relative high concentrations or as a result of fire, is unlikely to be important, although hematopoietic, reproductive, and central nervous system effects have been reported in occupational studies...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the factors}} {{limiting}} agricultural development in ACP countries is the difficult access to information on research activities and development experiences. The identification of such information sources constitutes the first step towards {{a better understanding of}} agricultural sciences and techniques. Since CTA's prime objective is to facilitate access to agricultural information in ACP countries, it has undertaken the publication of a series of directories on information sources in the field of agriculture and rural development. The first directory dealt with information sources on tropical agriculture in EEC countries. The second which has just been published in English and French, deals with agricultural information sources in ACP countries. Produced with the cooperation of CAB-lnternational in the UK and the International Documentation Centre for Agriculture in Hot Regions (CIDARC) in France, it fulfills two objectives. First, it is a guide for researchers, trainers, extension workers, planners and documentalists engaged in information searches. Second, it helps to promote information exchanges among different ACP countries and between them and EEC countries. It can also help decision-makers to plan their national policies. This directory includes 337 agricultural information services (libraries, <b>documentation</b> centres, <b>bibliographic</b> databases and <b>documentation</b> networks), research institutes, teaching establishments and development organizations in ACP countries. It deals with all agricultural sectors: agronomic research, teaching and extension work, rural sociology and economics, animal and vegetable production, forestry, aquatic sciences and fishing, agricultural equipment, natural resources, food and nutrition sciences and the environment (a classification of these information services by field is given in Table 1). Apart from the directory itself, which is classified by country in alphabetical order, this publication includes an index of the main fields covered by each centre and a list of acronyms. Each entry includes the name of the information service followed by that of its parent organization, its address, date of establishment, and the name and title of the person to contact in addition to the staff numbers. It specifies the field of interest of the centre, its geographical coverage, its documentation resources, its users, the goods and services that it provides, its budget and its documentation cooperation service. The index was inspired primarily by that used by AGROVOC, the multilingual thesaurus of agricultural terminology and the categories used by AGRIS. The detailed analysis of the data contained in this directory reveals the current situation of agricultural documentation in ACP countries. It shows that the first agricultural information services date from the last century. The Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture created its national agricultural library in 1876. Since the 1920 s, the number of such centres has increased rapidly. At the current rate, one can hope to see more than 500 agricultural information sources in ACP countries by the year 2000 A geographical breakdown of this data reveals a strong development in West Africa which hosts more than 36 % of the agricultural information services of ACP countries (see Table 3). Documentation centres appear to be concentrated mainly in the capitals to the detriment of rural areas which would make much-later use of such information. These centres offer traditional services: providing bibliographic searches, summary reviews, lists of documents received, and catalogues of publications and periodicals as well as services for selected diffusion of information and for bibliographic searches. However, the summaries and progress reports receive relatively little attention {{despite the fact that they}} are highly regarded by 'information consumers'. The same is the case for the services of consolidation, evaluation and updating of information. It is true that researchers, teachers and students, who are the main users of these information services, are capable of doing such summaries and analyses themselves. Nevertheless, the demand for summarized information remains high. The dearth of such material is due in part to the lack of competent staff The collections of these information services are, generally speaking, relatively modest. Some centres, however, do have significant documentation resources. On average, each one contains 3217 books, 1534 reports, 375 publications of the parent organization 169 periodical titles and 495 microfiches. As far as equipment is concerned even though ACP countries are the least computerized, it is reassuring to learn that nearly a third of the information services have microcomputers although of many different brands. This diversity of equipment, which also applies to software, is no doubt a result of supply and demand but it creates problems of compatability which makes it difficult to exchange data needed for documentary cooperation. An analysis of such data also reveals that there is a greater reproduction capacity than previously thought. If only 7. 4 % of the information services have their own microfilm reproduction workshops, 55 % of the centres have microfilm or microfiche readers. Finally, the most significant phenomenon in the development of information services in ACP countries over the last decade has been the emergence of documentation networks and the exchange of information and experiences. All of the synergies and economies of scale have been exploited: interlibrary loans development of collective catalogues for periodicals and reference works, standardization of working methods, and promotion of the exploitation of their documentation capital. National sectoral networks have emerged in the Congo (REDICA), Cote d'lvoire (REDACT) and Senegal (REDAS). At regional level, the approach taken has been the establishment of a network reflecting the major socioeconomic and geopolitical concerns. One notes the presence of PADIS, oriented towards socioeconomic development in Africa of POPIN-AFRICA oriented towards the population problems of this continent, and RESADOC in Mali which is primarily concerned with problems related to drought, desertification and environmental protection. At the international level, AGRIS and CARIS remain the main global information systems. The establishment of these networks, no matter what their level, in conjunction with the use of computerized facilities, clearly shows the vitality of the documentation supply in ACP countries. It is certain, however, that these structures remain fragile and do not get sufficient attention or support. A new item must be added to the priorities of these centres: the analysis of agricultural information to provide products that respond better to the real needs of users for summarized documents. In this field, as in many others, the availability of human resources will be the determining factor. For more details, contact: Thiendou Niang.

40|$|Background: One of {{the control}} tools to reduce malaria {{transmission}} {{is the use of}} LLINs. However, several studies show that household bed net use is quite low. A study was developed to better understand the cultural factors that might explain these gaps in Benin. One reason mentioned is that bed nets can catch on fire and cause harm. This paper presents a summary of these findings, their analysis and the ensuing issues. Methods: This anthropological study is based on an inductive qualitative approach, including 91 semi-structured interviews conducted from July 2011 to March 2012 in a health district in Southern Benin. Results: Fifty-six persons stated that bed nets can catch on fire but do not always refer to specific facts. However, 34 of the 56 people narrate specific events they heard or experienced. 39 accounts were geographically located and situated in time, with various details. In 27 situations, people were burned, for which 12 people reportedly died. Discussion: The disparity between these results and the dearth of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>documentation</b> in the initial search prompted a more in-depth literature review: 16 contributions between 1994 and 2013 were found. Bed net fires were noted in 10 countries, but it is impossible to ascertain the frequency of such events. Moreover, bodily harm can be significant, and several cases of death attributed to bed net fires were noted. Conclusions: Indisputably, the use of bed nets to reduce the impact of this terrible disease is an optimal control method. However, the perception that LLINs have a potentially negative effect hinders the use rate in the real world, at least for some. If some people fear the risk of fires, this possibility must be addressed during information and prevention sessions on malaria, with a communication strategy tailored to specific social contexts. Moreover, all possible measures should be taken to limit the harm suffered by individuals and their families...|$|E
40|$|Known {{primarily}} as a composer for the wind band, few American composers have received the notoriety and widespread acclaim that David Maslanka has since 1970. His works for wind ensemble are now considered standard repertoire and are played frequently by high school, college-level, and professional ensembles alike. Additionally, his works for chamber groups and soloists have continued to gain in popularity. As of the writing of this document, Maslanka has composed concertos for saxophone, euphonium, flute, marimba, trombone, and piano. Early in 2005, he completed his first large-scale work for solo clarinet with wind ensemble accompaniment: Desert Roads. Desert Roads is comprised of four movements—each with a unique perspective and stylistic approach to the concerto medium. ^ This document begins with a detailed biography of the composer’s life and works. There is {{an emphasis on the}} people, places, and events that contributed to Dr. Maslanka’s compositional style. Chapter 2 offers a history of Desert Roads and pays special attention to Dr. Margaret Dees and her leadership in the commissioning of the work. Chapters 3 – 6 provide analysis and discussion of the structural elements Desert Roads. Additionally, there is discussion of the chorales of J. S. Bach where appropriate. Chapters 3 – 6 also include graphic illustrations of each movement {{at the end of the}} chapter. Chapter 7 offers some concluding remarks and performance considerations for clarinetists, conductors, and scholars. In addition to the customary and required copyright and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>documentation,</b> the appendix of this doctoral document contains a reproduction of the Bach chorales employed within Desert Roads as well as the text from Richard Beale’s On the Subway Platform. Furthermore, the appendix contains the transcription of interviews conducted by the author, and an annotated list of Maslanka’s works for clarinet, giving scholars a context for which to better appreciate Desert Roads. ^ This document is intended to provide readers with a clear, thorough understanding of Desert Roads and contribute to a greater understanding of the music of David Maslanka. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{explained}} in Takhtajan’s preface {{this book is}} not a mere translation of his ‘The origin of Angiospermous plants’ (1961, in Russian), but an entirely new book. I find this true and not true. Comparing it with the Origin (1958 translation of the 1954 Russian version) {{the essence of the}} new book was there given in a nutshell. In size, chapter subjects, argumentation, and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>documentation,</b> the work is very much extended and it makes very interesting reading indeed. The sequence of the chapters is logical, almost always leading to distinct synthesis. Properly it is a critical commented survey of many opinions — Takhtajan being clearly in complete command of the huge literature on the subject — but from which the author follows his own line of choice and judgement, accepting or rejecting with brief but clear comments. The whole argumentation is admirably concise and rouses admiration for covering this vast subject, comprising taxonomy, plant distribution, morphology, palynology, genetics, population dynamics, flower biology, anatomy, paleozoology, etc. Major questions are embodied in subsequent paragraphs: polyphyletism is rejected; ancestors must be sought among heterosporous ferns or fern-like plants followed by pteridosperms and certain gymnosperms, although direct ancestors cannot be indicated; the basal flower type of angiosperms was bisexual. Takhtajan attaches great importance to occurrence of plants in small populations, especially in mountain plants, facilitating chance variations and genetic drift, rapid spread of mutant genes, which is important for evolution. This entails that missing links are almost never fossilized. Micro-evolution is equalized with macro-evolution. Neoteny (on which Takhtajan devoted a former work) can lead to despecialisation through which phenotypic simplification the complexity of the genome remains intact; it may provide for a maximum phenotypic effect by a minimal genotypic change. Primitive wood structure of early Winteraceous angiosperms is understandable by neotenic origin. Evolution of angiosperms was not only rapid, but also discontinuous as a result of neoteny. Developing in the mountains ‘in many [...] . small [...] . populations [...] . the earliest angiosperms found themselves under conditions most favourable to evolutionary radiation. And if we bear in mind that their evolution was closely tied to the evolution of insects and was based on the complex and peculiar mechanism of mutual selection, then the extraordinary speed of their initial differentiation becomes even more readily understandable. ’ Protection of the ovules arose as a selection against damage by ‘early pollinating insects’; this made simplification of their structure possible which led to smaller ovules (loss of thickened integuments, sclerotesta, etc.) and enabled the angiosperms to observe the greatest economy of material in construction of the ovules and ♀ gametophyte, and it also made possible the perfection of the process of pollination. ‘The acquisition of the stigma was undoubtedly a very great event in the evolutionary history of seedplants. ’ ‘The primitive insects searched for pollen (beetles), nectar searching ones were a further perfection; this again led to a very great advance in cross-pollination; and as a corollary to a greatly increased rate of evolution, which still continues. ’ ‘Isolation of a population is well known to be a prelude to the formation of a new species. ’ The question of the hypothetical reconstruction of the first flowering plants is approached by the ‘hypothetico-deductive method’. Knowing the basic evolutionary pathways of angiosperms and the main lines of specialisation of their organs and tissues, we may by extrapolation extend these lines mentally into the past to the lowest possible level of specialisation’, but somewhat further on he writes ‘This reconstruction of the ancestors of the living angiosperms depends on the truth of the assumption that they combined in one plant all the most archaic characters that are now found distributed among the living fossils. ’ I have italicized in the citations two words that are in contradiction; furthermore I would {{like to point out that}} whereas each plant we know possesses both primitive and derived characters, we cannot make an exception for an ancestral plant; one which would contain all the archaic characters must logically be an idealized fiction...|$|E
40|$|Pericoronitis is a {{clinical}} condition concerning the inflammation of soft and hard tissues surrounding {{the crown of}} a partially erupted or impacted tooth. Inflammatory lesions of the soft tissues and very rarely the hard tissues, which are covering the teeth during their erupting procedures, consist usual problems of clinical treatment during the daily clinical oral and dental practice. Dentists are treating this clinical condition in various ways, using drugs or local surgery treatment {{most of which are}} successful. Despite the broad clinical and research studies of this condition, few studies in the International literature have been recorded with regard to pericoronitis. The aim of this study is the clinical and the histological analysis of the inflammatory cells and surrounding the pericoronitis lesion tissues with the light and the Transmission Electron Microscope in order to contribute at the reasons for this clinical pathogenicity. The present study analyses with X-Ray pictures the areas of the inflammation concerning pericoronitis, as well as, the histological morphology of epithelium, the cellular infiltration of the connective tissue and the mucosa in general in the region of pericoronitis. The material that was used in this study was taken after biopsy from 20 patients (incidents), that voluntary came as patients at the department of Dentoalveolar Surgical Clinic of Faculty of Dentistry at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, with clinical symptoms of pericoronitis at the third left or right mandibular molar. A clinical and radiographical examination was made and after estimation of the clinical condition, surgical extraction of the third mandibular molar was performed under local anesthesia. Two tissue samples of inflammatory tissue were surgically removed from the region where pericoronitis was estimated. The first tissue sample was placed in a container with neutral formalin 10 %, for fixation and observation under light microscope. The second tissue sample was placed in a container with gloutaraldehyde 3 %, for fixation and observation under Transmission Electron Microscope. On the tissue sample intended for examination with the light microscope, post stabilization, the typical method of dehydration and inclusion in paraffin was followed. Tissue samples 4 – 6 μm thick were obtained, which were stained with haematoxylin – iosin stain as well as Mallory stain. Afterwards a histological observation ensued {{with the use of a}} light microscope. On the tissue sample intended for examination with the Transmission Electron microscope, the required procedure of dehydration and enclosure in resin was adopted. Tissue samples 1 – 2 μm thick were received and were stained with a solution of azure of touloidin 1 % and borax 1 % in 60 o C temperature. Subsequent to study of the appropriate regions with the light microscope, thin sample tissues were selected and used for hypermicroscopic observation. After that, a histological observation ensued with the use of a Transmission Electron microscope to determine the type and degree of infiltration in the cellular population of the inflammatory tissue. In thirteen of our incidents an edema was diagnosed, in thirteen fibrosis in the connective tissue of the mucousa, in eighteen inflammatory infiltration of the connective tissue, in ten thickness of epithelium, in seven cornification of epithelium, in twelve parakeratosis and in three dyskeratosis. Combination of the histological findings led to the remark that in ten incidents edema and fibrosis were detected, in eight incidents edema and parakeratosis of the epithelium were detected, in four incidents parakeratosis and thickness of the epithelium were detected, in ten incidents inflammatory infiltration and fibrosis were detected, in seven incidents thickness of the epithelium and fibrosis were detected, in five incidents thickness of the epithelium and edema were detected, in ten incidents edema and inflammatory infiltration were detected, in nine incidents parakeratosis and inflammatory infiltration were detected, in three incidents dyskeratosis and inflammatory infiltration were detected, in eight incidents fibrosis and parakeratosis were detected and in five incidents cornification and fibrosis were detected. Also, in ten incidents edema – fibrosis – inflammatory infiltration were detected, in six incidents thickness of the epithelium – fibrosis – edema were detected, in five incidents parakeratosis – edema – fibrosis were detected, in eight incidents inflammatory infiltration – thickness of the epithelium – fibrosis were detected. It is a fact that in healthy individuals there is a balance between the pathogenetic microorganisms and the defense mechanism of the host. When a disturbance of this balance occurs in favor of the microbial factors, illness can manifest. The subgingival bacillar plaque and its metabolic products can activate antibody mediated or cellular immunogenic systems. Despite the fact that the antibody mediated immunogenic system mainly includes the production of antibodies against the microbial plaque, there is <b>bibliographic</b> <b>documentation</b> that the cellular immunogenic response refers to a concrete cellular population (CD 4 +, CD 8 + lymphocytes) that is identified both in the periodontal lesion and the endoalveolar infection. ...|$|E
