5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
25|$|The avian {{species in}} the park are 122, of which at least 97 are nesting. Important birds of prey with high {{conservation}} value include the griffon vulture, cinereous vulture, eastern imperial eagle and booted eagle. The park {{is one of the}} two nesting localities in the country of the lanner falcon and the common rosefinch. Rila Monastery Nature Park is an important sanctuary of the hazel grouse, rock partridge, western capercaillie, Eurasian pygmy owl, boreal owl, <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> white-backed woodpecker, red-breasted flycatcher, wallcreeper, Alpine accentor and Alpine chough. Most of the listed species have at least 5% of their total national population in the territory of the park.|$|E

50|$|At {{the base}} of the {{mountain}} there are abundant <b>black</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> as well as Japanese red foxes and Hokkaid≈ç brown bears. Near the summit, pika can be found.|$|R
5|$|There {{are more}} than 100 bird species in the park, {{including}} Eurasian eagle-owl, rock ptarmigan, alpine accentor, and chough. Golden eagles nest on rocky ledges, and sometimes in trees. Wallcreeper are found on steep cliffs. There are <b>black</b> <b>woodpeckers</b> and nutcrackers in the park's woodlands.|$|R
25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> the European green woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the Ural owl. The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E

One of the rare birds found in the park is the shore lark (Eremophilla alpestris), found in the alpine meadows, and the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), which migrates in the summer from Africa. The dense and mature forests of the area host eight types of woodpecker, including the white-backed, the middle spotted, the lesser spotted and the <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|E

500|$|A mated pair usually {{constructs}} a nest {{by improving}} a crevice by dropping sticks into it; {{it is then}} built {{on top of the}} platform formed. This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces, sometimes with birds still on them. Nest platforms can attain a great size. John Mason Neale notes that a [...] "Clerk was allowed by the Churchwarden to have for his own use all that the caddows had brought into the Tower: and he took home, at one time, two cart-loads of good firewood, besides a great quantity of rubbish which he threw away." [...] In his The Natural History of Selborne, Gilbert White notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the lintels of Stonehenge, and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting. The species has been recorded outcompeting the tawny owl (Strix aluco) for nest sites in the Netherlands. They can take over old nest sites of the <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker</b> (Dryocopus martius) and stock dove (Columba oenas). Breeding colonies may also edge out those of the red-billed chough, but in turn be ousted by larger corvids such as the carrion crow, rook or magpie.|$|E
60|$|The gloomy woods are {{inhabited}} by few birds: occasionally the plaintive note of a white-tufted tyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius albiceps) may be heard, concealed near {{the summit of}} the most lofty trees; and more rarely the loud strange cry of a <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> with a fine scarlet crest on its head. A little, dusky-coloured wren (Scytalopus Magellanicus) hops in a skulking manner among the entangled mass of the fallen and decaying trunks. But the creeper (Oxyurus tupinieri) is the commonest bird in the country. Throughout the beech forests, high up and low down, in the most gloomy, wet, and impenetrable ravines, it may be met with. This little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it really is, from its habit of following with seeming curiosity any person who enters these silent woods: continually uttering a harsh twitter, it flutters from tree to tree, within a few feet of the intruder's face. It is far from wishing for the modest concealment of the true creeper (Certhia familiaris); nor does it, like that bird, run up the trunks of trees, but industriously, after the manner of a willow-wren, hops about, and searches for insects on every twig and branch. In the more open parts, three or four species of finches, a thrush, a starling (or Icterus), two Opetiorhynchi, and several hawks and owls occur.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tis a pity, Father Martin, {{that your}} secret has grown old with you. If you had told it {{forty years ago}} truly you would not long have been lacking the spring-root. Even though you will never climb the {{mountain}} now, I will tell you, for a joke, how {{it is to be}} found. The easiest way to get it is by the help of a <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker.</b> Look, in the spring, where she builds her nest in a hole in a tree, and when the time comes for her brood to fly off block up the entrance to the nest with a hard sod, and lurk in ambush behind the tree till the bird returns to feed her nestlings. When she perceives that she cannot get into her nest she will fly round the tree uttering cries of distress, and then dart off towards the sun-setting. When you see her do this, take a scarlet cloak, or if that be lacking to you, buy a few yards of scarlet cloth, and hurry back to the tree before the woodpecker returns with the spring-root in her beak. So soon as she touches with the root the sod that blocks the nest, it will fly violently out of the hole. Then spread the red cloth quickly under the tree, so that the woodpecker may think it is a fire, and in her terror drop the root. Some people really light a fire and strew spikenard blossoms in it; but that is a clumsy method, for if the flames do not shoot up at the right moment away will fly the woodpecker, carrying the root with her." ...|$|E

50|$|Often {{the natural}} tree {{cavities}} {{are made by}} broken limbs, unless they are made by pileated <b>woodpeckers</b> or <b>black</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> the only tree-cavity-making animals who make a cavity large enough to normally accommodate a goldeneye. Average egg size is a breadth of 43.3 mm, a length of 59.3 mm and a weight of 64 g. The incubation period ranges from 28 to 32 days. The female does all the incubating and is abandoned by the male about 1 to 2 weeks into incubation. The young remain in the nest for about 24-36 hours. Brood parasitism is quite common both with other common goldeneyes {{as well as with}} other duck species, and even tree swallow and European starling eggs have been found mixed with goldeneye eggs. The broods commonly start to mix with other females' broods as they become more independent. Goldeneye young have been known to be competitively killed by other goldeneye mothers, common loons and red-necked grebes. The young are capable of flight at 55-65 days of age.|$|R
50|$|Adults are 40 to 49 cm long, span 66 to 75 cm {{across the}} wings, and weigh 250 to 400 g, {{with an average}} weight of 300 g.

They are mainly black with a red crest, and have a white line {{down the sides of}} the throat. They show white on the wings in flight. The flight of these birds is strong and direct, but has an undulating quality, similar to the relatively unique flight-style of all woodpeckers. Adult males have a red line from the bill to the throat, in adult females these are black. Two species found in the Old World, the white-bellied and <b>black</b> <b>woodpeckers,</b> are closely related and occupy the same ecological niche in their respective ranges that the pileated occupies in North America. The only North American birds of similar plumage and size are the ivory-billed woodpecker of the Southeastern United States and Cuba, and the related imperial woodpecker of Mexico. However, unlike the pileated, both of those species are extremely rare, if not extinct. Most reports of the ivory-billed woodpecker are believed to be erroneous reports of the far more common pileated.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker</b> {{measures}} 45 to 55 cm {{long with}} a 64 to 84 cm wingspan. Body weight is approximately 250 to 400 g on average. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 22.7 to 26 cm, the tail is 15.9 to 17.3 cm, the very long bill is 5 to 6.7 cm and the tarsus is 3.6 to 4 cm. It is easily the largest woodpecker in its range and {{is second in}} size only to the great slaty woodpecker amongst the woodpecker species certain to exist, although its average mass {{is similar to that}} of the Magellanic woodpecker of South America. The closely related pileated and white-bellied woodpeckers also broadly overlap in size with the <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker,</b> but both are somewhat smaller in average and maximal size and mass. The plumage of this crow-sized woodpecker is entirely black apart from a red crown. In males, the entire crown is red, but in females only the top hindcrown is red with the rest of the body all black. The juvenile <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker</b> is similar but is less glossy, with a duller red crown and a paler grey throat and bill [...] The piercing yellow eyes and manic, high-pitched calls of the <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker</b> have made it the villain of fairy tales throughout its range. Their voice is remarkable in that it has two different calls. One is a short single high-pitched note, a loud, whistling kree-kree-kree, done only twice in a row. The other is a screech-like shrill while in flight. Unlike other woodpecker species, the <b>black</b> <b>woodpecker</b> does not have a dipping, bounding flight but instead flies with slow, unsteady-seeming wing beats with its head raised.|$|E

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{exceptions}} to the general responses of migratory and non-migratory bird species. Among the European non-migratory forest specialists, Lesser Spotted Woodpeckers (Dendrocopos minor) declined from a very high population in the 1980 s, when they benefited from the widespread death of trees from acid rain (Flousek 1989). Bullfinches (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) have also declined, {{for reasons that are}} unknown (Siriwardena et al. 2001; Marquiss 2007), and have remained at a low level in parts of Europe. However, populations of both species appear to have stabilized over the past 5 to 10 [*]years. There are also regionally migrating species that show increasing abundance, such as Stock Doves (Columba oenas), which might profit not only from the increasing abundance of <b>Black</b> <b>Woodpeckers</b> (Drycopus martius), because they use old nesting holes made by woodpecker (Kosi≈Ñski et al. 2011) but also from increasing maize cultivation in agriculture, and Common Chiffchaffs (Phylloscopus collybita), which profit from an increase in the area of mixed forests (Gregory et al. 2007). Among the continentally migrating species, there is one species that has increased (Common Redstart, Phoenicurus phoenicurus; Fig.¬† 2 b). Common Redstarts breed in parks, gardens, sport fields, and other habitats where trees do not form a continuous canopy (Sedl√°ƒçek et al. 2004) and rely on areas with sparse vegetation for foraging (Martinez et al. 2010). Thus, the apparent increase may reflect a recovery from low numbers in the late twentieth century.|$|R
