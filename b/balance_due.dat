Afterwards, the band {{returned to the}} studio to record the album Destroy Erase Improve at Soundfront Studios in Uppsala, with Daniel Bergstrand as a producer. Shortly thereafter, the band went on a European tour supporting Machine Head for two months. During the tour, Nordin became ill and experienced difficulties with his inner ear <b>balance.</b> <b>Due</b> to the resulting chronic dizziness and vertigo, Nordin {{was forced to leave}} the tour and travel to Sweden. Machine Head's bassist Adam Duce offered to cover his absence; however, Meshuggah decided to continue as a four-piece. Sometimes Thordendal played bass, while other times the band performed with two guitars. In this lineup, Hagström would use a pitch shifter to play his guitar at an octave lower than usual.|$|E

25|$|Research {{conducted}} by the Kenexa Research Institute (KRI) evaluated how male and female workers perceive work–life balance and found {{that women are more}} positive than men in how they perceive their company’s efforts to help them balance work and life responsibilities.

The results indicated a shift in women’s perceptions about work–life balance. In the past, women often found it more difficult to maintain <b>balance</b> <b>due</b> to the competing pressures at work and demands at home.|$|E

Simulation results show that EEBASS is more energy efficient and balanced than traditional data-centric storage mechanisms in sensor network. I...|$|R

Based on this model, we design proactive local logical route maintenance, summary-based membership update, and logical location-based multicast routing algorithms in large-scale MANETs. 1...|$|R

2500|$|A {{recurring}} concept within Final Fantasy settings {{is the use}} {{of important}} magical crystals: in early games, they represented the Japanese classical elements, and would be instrumental in keeping the world in <b>balance.</b> <b>Due</b> to this, control over the crystals forms part of a chosen games' core narrative. The concept of crystals was introduced into the original game by game designer Koichi Ishii. Since then, crystals have taken prominent roles in Final Fantasy III, Final Fantasy IV, Final Fantasy V, Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy IX. They took minimal roles in Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XII. Crystals also took a central role in Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XV, which both used the crystal-based Fabula Nova Crystallis lore: overt references such as terminology and branding were removed from Final Fantasy XV to help with marketing. Crystals were included in A Realm Reborn as a central plot due to being given [...] "short shrift in recent titles". Most titles feature names inspired from various cultures' history, languages and mythology, including Asian, [...] European, and Middle-Eastern. In-game items such as weapons follow this tradition: the two most notable are Excalibur and Masamune, derived respectively from the Arthurian sword and legendary Japanese swordsmith.|$|E
