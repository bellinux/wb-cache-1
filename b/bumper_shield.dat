The impact damage was compared to an industry ballistic limit equation for a spherical aluminum projectile of similar diameter and was shown to have slightly less damage than the expected results. In addition, an aluminum mesh double <b>bumper</b> <b>shield</b> was fired upon in order to verify its higher protection per aerial density as well as its higher projectile break-up ability. An impact at 459 ± 50 m/s resulted in superior shielding performance over an aluminum monolithic shield of equivalent areal density, based on the ballistic limit equation; however projectile break up did not occur.

Stuffed Whipple <b>bumper</b> <b>shields</b> are used for meteoroid and debris impact protection of the European module of the International Space Station (the Columbus APM). A total of 56 simulations were carried out to investigate the impact processes occurring for shaped charge jet impact. Sensitivity studies were carried out on the influence of projectile shape, pitch, yaw and strength at 11 km/s to determine the range of debris cloud morphologies. The debris cloud structure was shown to be highly dispersed, and no projectile remnant was observed at the centre of the cloud. The mass of an aluminium sphere producing equivalent damage to a shaped charge jet projectile was in the range 1. 5 to 1. 75 times greater than the mass of the shaped charge jet projectile. Upon loading by the dispersed debris cloud, the interim bumper failed by spallation, producing fragments moving at 2 km/s or less. The fragments distorted the rear wall (pressure wall) of the shield but did not perforate it. The experimental data show rear wall deformation but to a lesser degree. Perforation of the rear wall, observed for one test, was not reproduced by the simulation.

Especially for manned missions space debris constitutes an increasing danger. Design and optimization of debris shields require experimental and numerical simulation techniques. At the Ernst-Mach-Institut, three high-performance two-stage light gas guns, high-speed visualization and measurement devices like image converter cameras, X-ray systems, drum cameras in connection with a high power Cu-vapour pulse laser, as well as dynamic stress monitoring systems are available.

40|$|Analysis of {{interaction}} occurring between space debris and orbiting structures {{is of great}} interest to the planning and survivability of space assets. Computer simulation of the impact events using hydrodynamic codes can provide some understanding of the processes but the problems involved with this fundamental approach are formidable. First, any realistic simulation is necessarily three-dimensional, e. g., the impact and breakup of a satellite. Second, the thickness of important components such as satellite skins or <b>bumper</b> <b>shields</b> are small with respect to the dimension of the structure as a whole, presenting severe zoning problems for codes. Thirdly, the debris cloud produced by the primary impact will yield many secondary impacts which will contribute to the damage and possible breakup of the structure. The problem was approached by choosing a relatively new computational technique that has virtues peculiar to space impacts. The method is called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics...|$|R

To improve the evaluation of survivability during conceptual design, metrics are proposed {{for the assessment of}} survivability as a dynamic, continuous, and path-dependent system property. Two of these metrics, time-weighted average utility loss and threshold availability, are then incorporated into a tradespace study on the survivability of future space tug vehicles to orbital debris. A value-based design approach, Dynamic Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration, is taken to evaluate survivability based on the relationship between stochastic space tug utility trajectories and changing stakeholder expectations across nominal and disturbed environmental states. Results of the tradespace study show that moderate levels of <b>bumper</b> <b>shielding</b> and access to an on-orbit servicing infrastructure benefit space tugs with large exposed cross-sectional areas while active collision avoidance only delivers value to extremely risk-averse decision makers.

40|$|AbstractThe {{important}} {{components of}} a spacecraft require protective shielding from space debris impact. However, shields increase the total weight of a spacecraft. Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) is well known as a high-strength and light-weight material. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate availability of CFRP <b>bumper</b> <b>shields.</b> The kinetic energies of the debris clouds generated from the bumpers were focused on. Hypervelocity impact experiments were conducted on aluminum alloy and CFRP bumpers. Based on the results of preliminary experiments, it was possible to identify the origin of a crater on a witness plate as being aluminum or CFRP by examining the crater surface. The kinetic energies of fragments in debris clouds were calculated using debris cloud images captured with a high speed camera and the results of microscopic examination of craters on witness plates. When the CFRP bumper had larger thickness than the projectile diameter, the CFRP bumper seemed to reduce the kinetic energy of debris cloud than the aluminum alloy bumper. Consequently, CFRP debris bumper is considered to show availability if debris smaller than the bumper thickness impacts on the bumper...|$|R

40|$|Beside a short remark on the "hydrodynamic {{theory of}} rod projectiles", the paper {{deals with the}} {{terminal}} behaviour of cylindrical projectiles against semi-infinite targets. Experimental data of EMI, completed by results of some other authors, are presented. Crater parameters like depth, diameter and volume and their dependence on projectile velocity (up to 5000 m/s), projectile and target material properties as well as L/D-ratios (1 - 32) will be discussed. Mainly the projectile materials and tungsten sinter-alloys are considered. Target materials are mild steel and high strength steel, an Al-alloy and a tungsten sinter-alloy. The {{results show that the}} influence of material density on the crater dimensions is considerable greater than the influence of strength. The L/D-ratio destines the velocity dependence of crater depth, diameter and volume. In the case of short cylinders (L/D= 1), the crater depth is nearly proportional to v sub 2 / 3 (v sub p = projectile velocity) in the dydrodynamic regime. The slope of the penetration curves decreases with increasing L/D and converges for rods a saturation. A consequence of this saturation is the existence of a so-called "tangent velocity", above which an optimal increase of efficiency is only realized by increasing the projectile mass and not the velocity. Furthermore, ballistic limits of real targets like single plates and symmetric double plates (meteorite <b>bumper</b> <b>shield)</b> are taken into account. The expected better performance of "segmented rods" is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of hypervelocity impact crater formation in metallic and composite space debris shields has been investigated. Both normal and oblique impact crater formations {{have been investigated}} using 2. 2 -mm-thick aluminum (At 2017), carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and aramid fiber reinforced plastic (AFRP) space debris shields in a two-stage light gas gun. A cylindrical projectile made of high-density polyethylene (14 mm in diameter and length) at a muzzle speed of 5. 0 +/- 0. 2 km/s is used to create the craters in the debris <b>bumper</b> <b>shields.</b> The microscopic study reveals the formation of adiabatic shear bands near the crater zone, from where the secondary cracks emerge, ultimately resulting {{in the formation of}} the craters in thin aluminium plates at impact angles of 90, 51, and 64 deg. On the other hand, surface delamination zones caused by the peeling of surface piles surrounding the impact and exit craters are observed in the case of CFRP and AFRP debris shields at normal impact. To estimate the temperature near the craters, time-integrated spectrum of the light emission during the crater formation is recorded. The measurements are taken in the near-UV region of the spectrum. Based on the CN emission from the projectile material, the temperature of the debris cloud during normal and oblique impacts at 5 km/s are estimated to be between 7300 +/- 300 and 7600 +/- 300 K, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{composites}} with multi-functional {{capabilities are}} {{of great interest}} to the designers of aerospace structures. Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) reinforced with high strength fibers provide a lightweight and high strength alternative to metals and metal alloys conventionally used in aerospace architectures. Novel reinforcements such as nanofillers offer potential to improve the mechanical properties and add multi-functionality such as radiation resistance and sensing capabilities to the PMCs. This paper reports the hypervelocity impact (HVI) test results on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber composites reinforced with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Woven UHMWPE fabrics, in addition to providing excellent impact properties and high strength, also offer radiation resistance due to inherent high hydrogen content. SWCNT have exceptional mechanical and electrical properties. BNNT (figure 1) have high neutron cross section and good mechanical properties that add multi-functionality to this system. In this project, epoxy based UHMWPE composites containing SWCNT and BNNT are assessed for their use as <b>bumper</b> <b>shields</b> and as intermediate plates in a Whipple Shield for HVI resistance.

The practical upper limit to the velocity distribution is on the order of 40 km/s and is associated with the natural environment. The velocity distribution of the man-made component peaks at 9 - 10 km/s with maximum velocity in the 14 - 16 km/s range. Experience in space has verified that the "high probability of impact" particles are in the microgram to milligram range. These particles can have very significant effects on coatings, insulators, and thin metallic layers. The surface of thick materials becomes pitted and the local debris component is enhanced by ejecta from the impact events. In this paper, the HYPER facility is described which produces a reasonable simulation of the man-made space debris spectrum in a controlled environment. The facility capability is discussed in terms of drive geometry, energetics, velocity distribution, diagnostics, and projectile/debris loading. The facility has been used to study impact phenomena on Space Station Freedom's solar array structure, the calibration of space debris collectors, other solar array materials, potential structural materials for use in space, electrical breakdown in the space environment, and as a means of clarifying or duplicating the impact phenomena on surfaces which have been exposed in space...|$|R

The coma of Comet Tempel 1 exhibits highly non-uniform spatial distribution of dust, as found at comet Wild 2, with bursts of impacts of up to 1000 particles over km scales near closest approach surrounded by void regions of many kilometers with no impacts. These data are consistent with passage through clouds of particles resulting from fragmentation of larger aggregates emitted from the nucleus. These fragmentation products dominate the total dust production of small particles, with only a small contribution likely from direct emission from the nucleus. The derived overall mass distribution is similar to that found at comet Wild 2 with the total mass dominated by large particles. The average cumulative mass index α = 0. 65 ± 0. 08 (where the particle flux is defined by ϕ (>m) = km −α) but a better fit is obtained with α = 0. 85 ± 0. 08 for particle masses below 10 − 10 kg and a significantly lower value for higher masses...|$|E
40|$|The Altair Lunar Lander {{is being}} {{designed}} for the planned return to the Moon by 2020. Since {{it is hoped that}} lander components will be re-used by later missions, studies are underway to examine the exposure threat to the lander sitting on the Lunar surface for extended periods. These threats involve both direct strikes of meteoroids on the vehicle as well as strikes from Lunar regolith and rock thrown by nearby meteorite strikes. Currently, the lander design is comprised of up to 10 different types of pressure vessels. These vessels included the manned habitation module, fuel, cryogenic fuel and gas storage containers, and instrument bays. These pressure vessels have various wall designs, including various aluminum alloys, honeycomb, and carbon-fiber composite materials. For some of the vessels, shielding is being considered. This program involved the test and analysis of six pressure vessel designs, one of which included a Whipple <b>bumper</b> <b>shield.</b> In addition to the pressure vessel walls, all the pressure vessels are wrapped in multi-layer insulation (MLI). Two variants were tested without the MLI to better understand the role of the MLI in the impact performance. The tests of performed were to examine the secondary impacts on these structures as they rested on the Lunar surface. If a hypervelocity meteor were to strike the surface nearby, it would throw regolith and rock debris into the structure at a much lower velocity. Also, when the manned module departs for the return to Earth, its rocket engines throw up debris that can impact the remaining lander components and cause damage. Glass spheres were used as a stimulant for the regolith material. Impact tests were performed with a gas gun to find the V 50 of various sized spheres striking the pressure vessels. The impacts were then modeled and a fast-running approximate model for the V 50 data was developed. This model was for performing risk analysis to assist in the vessel design and in the identification of ideal long-term mission sites.

40|$|Spacecraft {{honeycomb}} structures {{provide the}} primary shielding against meteoroid and debris impact for unmanned spacecraft {{in orbit around}} the Earth. Hypervelocity impact velocities for spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit can reach speeds of 15 - 16 km/s yet, for the particle diameters of interest, experimental test facilities are limited to maximum velocities in the range 7 - 8 km/s. Previous tests onto aluminium and cadmium facesheets with honeycomb core (or cylindrical equivalent) and composite facesheets with aluminium honeycomb core have identified that the honeycomb core influences the impact process (typically called "channelling"). Tests also identified that the shielding performance was altered under oblique incidence impact. Hydrocode computer simulations {{can be used to}} explore the velocity regime beyond the capabilities of existing experimental test facilities. In order to investigate the impact processes on honeycomb and to evaluate damage equation methodologies at velocities beyond the experimental test regime, a simulation programme was defined using the hydrocodes AUTODYN- 2 D and 3 D. First 2 D axisymmetric, simulations of normal impact on single and double honeycomb were carried out and compared with published test data. Good agreement was obtained. To model the required geometry, Lagrange, Shell and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) solvers were coupled together. Further 2 D simulations were then carried out at velocities of 7, 11 and 14 km/s on two spacecraft honeycomb structures representative of those used in unmanned spacecraft. The ballistic limit was identified and, for impacts above this limit, the post-perforation debris cloud characteristics were calculated by evaluating the momentum recorded on a witness plate or by calculating a momentum pressure function of the post-perforation debris cloud. A honeycomb damage equation, based on the semi-infinite penetration equation, was compared with the simulation results. It shows better agreement with both experimental test results and 2 D simulations than the Whipple <b>bumper</b> <b>shield</b> (Christiansen-Cour-Palais) formulation previously applied to honeycomb data, and therefore provides a means to characterise single honeycomb shielding performance as part of spacecraft design and verification activities. The simulation methodology was extended and two 3 D oblique incidence simulations were carried out at 11 km/s. These simulation results were also consistent with the equation predictions.

These objects can cause considerable damage to spacecraft structure, the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station which are orbiting around the earth at altitudes of 300 to 500 km/s in the LEO. Damage occurs when the debris traveling at hypervelocity impact (HVI) the spacecraft structure. Hence there is necessity to not only develop spacecraft with good shielding, but also develop a means of spacecraft pressure wall repair. A NASA EPSCoR grant for designing a portable friction stir welder to repair the hypervelocity impact damage caused was the driving force for this thesis topic. A detailed understanding {{of the extent of}} damage to the spacecraft shielding system was necessary to understand repair requirements expected for the design of a space-bound Friction Stir Welder. A spacecraft shielding system can consist of a double <b>bumper</b> <b>shielding</b> system placed ahead of the pressure wall. The current goal {{of this study was to}} determine the damage area of the pressure wall, using the new grid less Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) meshing techniques and the regular Lagrangian meshing technique. The approach was to model and validate the damage area due to the HVI against existing test data, and to conduct a parametric study for various impactor shapes, velocities and impact scenarios. The software tools used for modeling were PATRAN for the Lagrangian models and LS-Prepost for SPH modeling. The simulation was analyzed in LS-DYNA, a non-linear finite element dynamic analyzer. Simulations were initially conducted using a spherical projectile; later parametric studies were conducted with varied impactor shapes. The materials for the plate and impactor were alloys of Al (6061 -T 6, l 100 -O, 2024 -T 4). It was observed that the model developed using SPH meshing technique generated the debris cloud as in the actual impact scenario, unlike the Lagrangian meshing technique which had problems with mesh tangles. Hence the SPH technique provided a potential means of predicting pressure wall damage due to HVI...|$|R
50|$|These newer cars can be {{identified}} by their silver sight <b>shields</b> (<b>bumper</b> filler panels) which Ford used on specially painted fleet-ordered cars. They also had the luxury chrome mirrors {{like one of the}} pilot cars. Even though the body-colored sport mirrors were still a Torino option in 1976, they could not be installed on a fleet-ordered specialty-painted car, as Ford had no provision for producing those mirrors in anything other than the regular production colors listed for that year; since the 2B bright red was a special fleet-ordered color for the '76 model year, the cars came equipped with the chrome mirrors. The body-side mouldings were installed on these cars and the stripe was, unlike the pilot cars, integrated with the mouldings.|$|R
40|$|To prolong a {{lifetime}} of the ITER first diagnostic mirrors some protective shutters can be engaged. A concept of an elastic shutter that operates frictionless in vacuum has been studied at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany. Under actuation two shutter arms (∼ 2 m long) bend laterally between two pairs of limiting <b>bumpers</b> thus <b>shielding</b> the optical aperture or opening it for measurements. To increase the shutter efficiency the transition time between its open and closed states can be minimized. This demands a fast shutter that operates in fractions of a second and exhibit essentially dynamic behavior, like impacts with the bumpers that cause the shutter arms’ bouncing and oscillations. The paper presents numerical studies of the shutter dynamic behavior using the explicit and implicit 3 D FE transient structural modeling. Simple 1 D analytical model was developed to predict the shutter impact kinetic energy that mostly determines its further dynamic response. The structure sensitivity to different parameters was studied and ways for its optimization were laid down. A parametric shutter mockup with easily changeable mechanical characteristics was manufactured. A test program aimed for further shutter optimization, basing on the analysis performed and engaging powerful capabilities of the parametric shutter mockup is discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{meteoroid}} flux measurements and models for low orbital altitudes of the Space Station {{has been made}} in order to provide information that may be useful in design studies and laboratory hypervelocity impact tests which simulate micrometeoroids in space for design of the main wall of the Space Station. This report deals with the meteoroid flux mass model, the defocusing and shielding factors that affect the model, the probability of meteoroid penetration of the main wall of a Space Station. Whipple (1947) suggested a meteoroid <b>bumper,</b> a thin <b>shield</b> around the spacecraft at some distance from the wall, as an effective device for reducing penetration, which has been discussed in this report. The equations of the probability of meteoroid penetration, the average annual cumulative total flux, and the equations for the thickness of the main wall and the bumper are presented in this report...|$|R
