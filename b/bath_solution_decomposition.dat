40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} {{effects of}} leukotriene (LT) C 4 on ion transport across equine tracheal epithelium. Sample-Tracheal epithelium from cadavers of 24 horses considered free of respiratory tract disease. Procedures-Mucosae were mounted into Ussing chambers, and short-circuit current (Isc) was monitored over time. Effects of LTC 4 were examined for various conditions, including addition of amiloride (10 μM) to the mucosal <b>bath</b> <b>solution,</b> addition of bumetanide (10 μM) to the serosal <b>bath</b> <b>solution,</b> addition of barium (1 mM) to the serosal <b>bath</b> <b>solution,</b> and substitution of gluconate for chloride and HEPES for bicarbonate in <b>bath</b> <b>solutions.</b> Electrolyte transport was assessed via 22 Na and 36 Cl isotope fluxes. Results-Addition of LTC 4 (50 nM) to the serosal <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> caused {{an increase in}} Isc for basal conditions and a larger increase after pretreatment with amiloride. The increase was negated {{in part by the}} addition of bumetanide to the serosal <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> and further reduced by substitution of HEPES for bicarbonate in <b>bath</b> <b>solutions.</b> Remaining current was reduced to values less than those before treatment with LTC 4 by the addition of barium to the serosal solution. There was a small increase in Isc after the addition of amiloride and substitution of gluconate for chloride. Radioisotope flux indicated that addition of LTC 4 to the serosal <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> increased chloride secretion and reduced sodium absorption. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-LTC 4 stimulated chloride secretion through a predominately bumetanide-sensitive pathway, with a smaller contribution from a bicarbonatedependent pathway. Thus, LTC 4 appears to be a potential mediator of airway hypersecretion in horses...|$|R

40|$|Both {{stimulation}} of purinergic receptors by ATP and {{activation of the}} cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibit amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport and activate Cl-secretion. These changes in ion transport may well affect cell volume. We therefore examined whether cell shrinkage or cell swelling do affect amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in epithelial tissues or Xenopus oocytes and whether osmotic stress interferes with regulation of Na+ transport by ATP or CFTR. Stimulation of purinergic receptors by ATP/UTP or activation of CFTR by IBMX and forskolin inhibited amiloride-sensitive transport in mouse trachea and colon, respectively, by a mechanism that was Cl- dependent. When exposed to a hypertonic but not hypotonic <b>bath</b> <b>solution,</b> amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport was inhibited in mouse trachea and colon, independent of the extracellular Cl- concentration. Both inhibition of Na+ transport by hypertonic <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> and ATP were additive. When coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, activation of CFTR by IBMX and forskolin inhibited the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in a Cl(-) dependent fashion. However, both hypertonic and hypotonic <b>bath</b> <b>solutions</b> showed only minor effects on amiloride-sensitive conductance, independent of the bath Cl- concentration. Moreover, CFTR-induced inhibition of ENaC could be detected in chocytes even after exposure to hypertonic or bypotonic <b>bath</b> <b>solutions.</b> We conclude that amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption in mouse airways and colon is inhibited by cell shrinkage by a mechanism that does not interfere with purinergic and CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC...|$|R

40|$|An {{inwardly}} rectifying, ATP-regulated K+ channel with {{a distinctive}} molecular architecture, ROMK 1, was recently cloned from rat kidney. Using patch clamp techniques, we {{have investigated the}} regulation of ROMK 1 with particular emphasis on phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes. Spontaneous channel rundown occurred after excision of membrane patches into ATP-free <b>bath</b> <b>solutions</b> {{in the presence of}} Mg 2 +. Channel rundown was almost completely abolished after excision of patches into either Mg(2 +) -free bathing solutions or after preincubation with the broad-spectrum phosphatase inhibitor, orthovanadate, in the presence of Mg 2 +. MgATP preincubation also inhibited channel rundown in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the effect of the specific phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (1 microM) and calyculin A (1 microM) was also investigated. The presence of either okadaic acid or calyculin A failed to inhibit channel rundown. Taken together, these data suggest that rundown of ROMK 1 involves a Mg(2 +) -dependent dephosphorylation process. Channel activity was also partially restored after the addition of MgATP to the <b>bath</b> <b>solution.</b> Addition of exogenous cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) catalytic subunit led to a further increase in channel open probability. Addition of Na 2 ATP, in the absence of Mg 2 +, was ineffective, suggesting that restoration of channel activity is a Mg(2 +) -dependent process. Addition of the specific PKA inhibitor, PKI, to the <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> led to a partial, reversible inhibition in channel activity. Thus, PKA-dependent phosphorylation processes are involved in the modulation of channel activity.

For experiments internodal cells were isolated. Cytoplasmic droplets were formed in an iso-osmotic <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> according to a modified procedure. Ion channels with conductances of 48 pS and 170 pS were detected by the patch-clamp technique. In the absence of K+ in the <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> the 170 pS channel was not observed at negative pipette potential values. When Cl- on either the vacuolar side or the cytoplasmic side was partly replaced with F-, the reversal potential of the 48 pS channel shifted conform to the Cl- equilibrium potential with similar behavior in droplet-attached and excised patch mode. These results showed that the 48 pS channel was a Cl- channel. In droplet-attached mode the channel rectified outward current flow, and the slope conductance was smaller. When Chara droplets were formed in a <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> containing low (10 + 8 M) Ca 2 +, then no Cl- channels could be detected either in droplet-attached or in inside-out patch mode. Channel activity was restored if Ca 2 + was applied to the cytoplasmic side of inside-out patches. Rectification properties in the inside-out patch configuration could be controlled by the holding pipette potential. Holding potential values negative or positive to the calculated reversal potential for Cl- ions induced opposite rectification properties.

Using a standard <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> (containing Na+, Ca 2 +) and an electrode solution containing K+ in current-clamp recordings, GHRP- 2 (10 nM) depolarized the membrane potential of the cells triggering a burst of action potentials. Voltage-clamp recordings indicated that GHRP- 2 produced a slowly inactivated inward current with a slight reduction in outward current. The inward current was blocked by the Ca 2 + channel blocker, Co 2 + (0. 5 mM). Ca 2 + currents were then isolated using tetraethylammonium <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> and an electrode solution containing Cs+. Ovine somatotrophs possess transient (T type) and long lasting (L type) Ca 2 + currents. The L type current was abolished by addition of nifedipine (3 mu M) to the <b>bath</b> <b>solution</b> and T type current was isolated on this basis. Current-voltage relationships indicated an increase in both T and L type Ca 2 + currents in response to GHRP- 2. The voltage-dependent inactivation curve for T type Ca 2 + current was shifted towards a less negative level by the peptide. Intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +](i)) in somatotroph-enriched populations was specifically increased by GHRP- 2 but this effect was totally abolished by blockade of membrane Ca 2 + channels. These data show that GHRP- 2 causes an influx of Ca 2 + leading {{to an increase in}} [Ca 2 +](i) in ovine somatotrophs.
