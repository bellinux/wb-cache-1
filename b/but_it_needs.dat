5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{demands a}} high level of {{physical}} activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.|$|E

25|$|Most {{igniters}} in {{gas turbine}} applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to automotive spark plugs. The igniter {{needs to be}} in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used. In can-annular and annular combustors (see Types of combustors below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.|$|E

500|$|A dynamo can amplify a {{magnetic}} field, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> a [...] "seed" [...] field {{to get it}} started. For the Earth, {{this could have been}} an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a T-Tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had {{a magnetic}} field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind. However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Such effects may still provide a small bias {{that are part of the}} boundary conditions for the geodynamo.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Nolan is a vocal proponent for the {{continued}} use of film stock over digital recording and projection formats, summing up his beliefs as, [...] "I am not committed to film out of nostalgia. I am in favor {{of any kind of}} technical innovation <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to exceed what has gone before and so far nothing has exceeded anything that's come before". Nolan's major concern is that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying: [...] "I think, truthfully, it boils down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [...] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo." ...|$|E
500|$|With Benson's help, Walpole {{had come}} to terms with the loss of his faith. Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was too {{concerned}} for his father's feelings to tell him he was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay missioner at the Mersey Mission to Seamen in Liverpool. He described that as one of the [...] "greatest failures of my life... The Mission to Seamen was, and is, a splendid institution... <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> men of a certain type to carry it through and I was not of that type." [...] The head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work, and Walpole resigned after six months.|$|E

2500|$|However, not all reviews were so glowing. While {{they were}} highly {{complimentary}} of the acting {{skills of the}} players, Picture Play Magazine found the film engrossing, but were disappointed in the film's ending, which they called [...] "weak". Screenland was also less than enthusiastic about The Crime Doctor, while again praising the actors, but added [...] "There's material here for an engrossing melodrama, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> a somewhat brisker pace and more 'punch' than are accorded it." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{generally}} spicy, berry-flavored and soft on the palate and produces wine {{with a relatively}} high alcohol content, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> careful control of yields for best results. Characteristic flavor profiles on Grenache include red fruit flavors (raspberry and strawberry) with a subtle, white pepper spice note. Grenache wines are highly prone to oxidation with even young examples having the potential to show browning (or [...] "bricking") coloration that can be noticed around the rim when evaluating the wine at an angle in the glass. As Grenache ages the wines tend to take on more leather and tar flavors. Wines made from Grenache tend to lack acid, tannin and color, and it is often blended with other varieties such as Syrah, Carignan, Tempranillo and Cinsaut.|$|E

Prompted in a television interview for comments, the governor of South Sinai, Mohammad Abdul Fadhil Shousha, initially said: [...] "What is being said about the Mossad throwing the deadly shark [...] to hit tourism in Egypt is not out of the question. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> time to confirm."

2500|$|Dan Jolin {{offered more}} {{positive}} {{thoughts on the}} season, giving it 3 stars out of 5 in his review for Empire. He felt it was beneficial that Iron Fist released after Luke Cage, instead of before as originally planned, in order for Doctor Strange to release to introduce the MCU to [...] "all his Eastern-mystical baggage", and called Iron Fist [...] "a fresh presence" [...] compared to [...] "the less ostentatious power-sets and moody, conflicted heroism" [...] of the other Defenders. Jolin did criticize that showrunner Buck had [...] "no sense of connection to his subject" [...] as previous Marvel Netflix showrunners had, and felt {{it was not until}} the sixth episode [...] "that you really feel the pulp martial-arts-movie-riffing origins, and that’s thanks to its director, RZA. He finally gives the show a proper sense of flair, shamelessly reveling in the genre’s campier elements through a fun, three-act combat-challenge structure. It’s enough to make you wish they made him the showrunner." [...] He concluded, [...] "Iron Fist works some fantastical flavor into the MCU’s down-to-earth Defenders nook, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> more proper kung-fu flair than showrunner Buck allows." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} ensure {{long-term}} compliance with the SGP deficit and debt criteria, the member states have since the SGP-reform in March 2005 striven towards achieving their country-specific Medium-Term budgetary Objective (MTO). The MTO is the set limit, that the structural balance relative to GDP needs to equal or be above for {{each year in the}} medium-term. Each state select its own MTO, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to equal or be better than a calculated minimum requirement (Minimum MTO) ensuring sustainability of the government accounts throughout the long-term (calculated on basis of both future potential GDP growth, future cost of government debt, and future increases in age-related costs). The structural balance is calculated by the European Commission as the cyclically-adjusted balance minus [...] "one-off measures" [...] (i.e. one-off payments due to reforming a pension scheme). The cyclically-adjusted balance is calculated by adjusting the achieved general government balance (in % of GDP) compared to each years relative economic growth position in the business cycle (referred to as the [...] "output gap"), which is found by subtraction of the achieved GDP growth with the potential GDP growth. So if a year is recorded with average GDP growth in the business cycle (equal to the potential GDP growth rate), the output gap will then be zero, meaning that the [...] "cyclically-adjusted balance" [...] then will be equal to the [...] "government budget balance". In this way, because it is resistant to GDP growth changes, the structural balance is considered to be neutral and comparable across an entire business cycle (including both recession years and [...] "overheated years"), making it perfect to be used consistently as a medium-term budgetary objective.|$|E

2500|$|Armageddon was {{originally}} slated for release mid-2012, {{but it was}} delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, [...] "It's the longest I have spent with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready". He explained he had approached Armageddon {{in a different way}} than his previous albums, [...] "I haven't sat down to write an album, I've just been writing whatever I feel. I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to be there and I think it lifts the album. [...] I've done most of it myself and I've really taken my time." [...] While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained it gave him a broader perspective, and while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song before. Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, [...] "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, do you love me too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that my little boy (Hudson) is going to inherit." [...] When asked to give five words that could describe the album Sebastian used the words [...] "dark", [...] "reflective", [...] "happy", [...] "appreciative" [...] and [...] "anxious".|$|E
