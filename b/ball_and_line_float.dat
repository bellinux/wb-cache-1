Suits include: spades on fish <b>and</b> <b>line</b> <b>floats,</b> hearts as hats, diamonds as hats and boxes, clubs as {{head and shoulders}} of Napoleon looking at a sunrise...|$|R
60|$|But {{it was too}} late. A surge {{right and}} left, a vicious tug, <b>and</b> Betty's <b>line</b> <b>floated</b> {{on the surface of}} the water.|$|R
50|$|The game {{focuses on}} the Creature phase of the larger game, with {{elements}} of Nintendogs and Drawn to Life. Spore Creatures characters are <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> generated 2.5D. Unlike the characters of Spore, creatures are completely 2D, but the environments remain 3D.|$|R

50|$|Grichuk drew {{widespread}} {{attention for}} his raw power and bat speed in 2015. As of August 11, 2015, the average exit velocity {{of all his}} batted balls on the season was seventh {{in the major leagues}} at 93.17 mph. The average for all fly <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> drives only was fourth at 97.79 mph.|$|R
50|$|In geometry, the Beltrami-Klein model, {{also called}} the {{projective}} model, Klein disk model, and the Cayley-Klein model, {{is a model of}} hyperbolic geometry in which points are represented by the points in the interior of the unit disk (or n-dimensional unit <b>ball)</b> <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> are represented by the chords, straight line segments with ideal endpoints on the boundary sphere.|$|R
50|$|On defense, Walker had {{extensive}} knowledge {{of where to}} play for each hitter, what the pitcher was going to throw, and where to position himself accordingly. He understands how to read the path and angle of the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> how it ricocheted off the wall. His arm strength and accuracy often made it intimidating for baserunners to take extra bases. He is adept at mimicking catching long fly <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> drives {{that he was actually}} unable to catch, often fooling hitters into settling for singles when they could have taken extra bases.|$|R

50|$|Buck Showalter {{helped keep}} {{him with the}} Yankees through 1995, when George Steinbrenner sought to trade him. Steinbrenner was {{frustrated}} by the team's difficulty in placing him {{in any of the}} traditional baseball player molds. He had good speed, but rarely stole bases. In center, he was highly capable at tracking down fly <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> drives, but had a weak throwing arm. He was a consistent hitter, but only had mild home run power. Throughout the early 1990s he hit {{in the middle of the}} order as management tried to figure out where his best fit was.|$|R
2500|$|... {{never leave}} the buddy unless the buddy is trapped or {{entangled}} and cannot be freed without additional assistance. In this case the diver must mark {{the position of the}} distressed diver with a <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>float</b> or other locating device.|$|R

50|$|A {{stick with}} a {{set-back}} head and toe-side protrusion, with the handle positioned vertically, covers substantially more of the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> can reduce off heel deflection errors in stopping. Using the set-back head in the more comfortable or natural stopping angle puts a vertical area of shaft above the ball {{while at the same}} time aligning centre <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> a <b>line</b> projected through the centre of the handle.|$|R
50|$|Reflex action test: In the {{so-called}} “ball {{on the wall}} test”, applicants must push a button when 2 moving objects (a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> a <b>line</b> or wall) collide. Eventually the screen is divided into 2 parts, requiring concentration on 2 collisions. Finally, 4 parts are simultaneously seen, and one's attention must be on all of them. Sometimes the <b>balls</b> return <b>and</b> collide again. All of the images vary in speed.|$|R

In sporting goods, Bridgestone market golf <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> clubs <b>and</b> tennis <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> rackets. Bridgestone's <b>line</b> of bicycles is Japan's most extensive – see above information re. Anchor Cycles.|$|R
25|$|PUTCO is in {{the process}} of {{upgrading}} their ticketing equipment to the 'Automatic Smart Card Fare Collection and Tracking System' to reduce long <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> cash. The contact-less 'Smart Card' also allows passengers to quickly enter the bus by simply placing the card on the reader, thus reducing driver-passenger contact.|$|R
40|$|Ink-jet {{printing}} methods may {{be utilized}} for efficient micro-deposition of solder bumps, spacer <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> adhesive sealant/bond <b>lines</b> {{in the manufacture}} of display panels. Advantages realized by this approach include data-driven, low-cost, high-speed, non-contact and environmentally friendly processing...|$|R
50|$|Droplines may be set either down {{underwater}} cliffs or just in {{the water}} column. They have a weight {{at the bottom of}} the <b>line</b> <b>and</b> a <b>float</b> at the top. They are not usually as long as longlines and have fewer hooks.|$|R
50|$|Both fast sailing {{ships and}} early steam ships holding mail {{contracts}} between Great Britain and Australia were also {{often referred to}} as packets. These included several ships of James Baines' Black <b>Ball</b> <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> the Orient <b>Line.</b>|$|R
50|$|A foul fly {{shall be}} judged {{according}} to the relative position of the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> the foul <b>line,</b> including the foul pole, and not {{as to whether the}} fielder is on foul or fair territory at the time he touches the ball.|$|R
5000|$|Lines with {{distance}} markers transverse the field every 10 metres {{perpendicular to the}} touch lines. The distances ascend from each goal line towards the halfway line, which is marked [...] "50" [...] (similar to a typical American football field). These lines, {{as well as the}} goal <b>lines,</b> dead <b>ball</b> <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> touch <b>lines</b> are 15 centimetres wide and white in colour, the only exception being the 40-metre lines, which are usually coloured red to distinguish them for the determination of 40-20 kicks in play.|$|R
5000|$|Opponents {{escalated}} {{the rate}} of infield shifting the employed against Adams in 2014, as it was already a league-wide trend. To foil the shift, he began {{to hit the ball}} more to left field (also a technique known as [...] "taking the pitch the other way") from the outset of the season. [...] Another difference from the season prior was that he did not hit his first home run until the eleventh game of 2014, which took place against the Chicago Cubs. The results of his modified approach began to show, as he was batting [...]357 with a [...]400 OBP and [...]548 SLG through that game. [...] Despite the drop-off in the power numbers, he continued to hit well against the shift. As of June 10, he was batting [...]390 (16 for 41) on ground <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> drives against the shift with three home runs for the year. He also did it without successfully bunting for a base hit.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} mussel farming on dusky {{dolphins}} {{has been studied}} in Admiralty Bay, New Zealand. Dusky dolphins are commonly seen in this area, which is also where the greatest density of farming activity is proposed. Apparently, dolphins rarely enter existing farms, and when they do, they usually swim quickly up the lanes and between rows of <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>floats.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1863 the Comet {{was sold}} to the Black <b>Ball</b> <b>Line</b> <b>and</b> renamed the Fiery Star. She was lost at sea on 12 May 1865 after a fire had broken out in her cargo of wool.|$|R
50|$|Crossley {{published}} {{three books}} of poetry: Aucassin and Nicolette and Other Poems, Prophets, Gods and Witches and Tragedy under Lucifer. His prose works showed his other interests: The History of Eton College Hunt, Chin Wag: The War Records of the Eton Manor Club <b>and</b> The <b>Floating</b> <b>Line</b> for Salmon <b>and</b> Sea Trout.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{the whale}} has been killed, {{a crew member}} called the [...] "diver" [...] jumps {{into the water and}} cuts a hole through the bottom and top of the whale's jaw, to which a tow <b>line</b> <b>and</b> <b>float</b> are attached. This holds the whale's mouth shut and {{prevents}} the carcass from filling with water and sinking. Hunters tow the whale to shore, where it is received by members of the village.|$|R
50|$|Knowing {{that alone}} on sea in a {{lifeboat}} the crew will all surely die, and with seconds to act, the captain hatches a risky plan. He realized that Elliot, who was last {{known to be}} taking a reading of the ship's speed using a Chip log, may have been killed before he pulled in the log <b>and</b> its <b>line</b> <b>floating</b> behind the ship. The captain surmises that he could abandon ship, but then use the line from the log to climb back aboard. He orders the crew to abandon ship, with Scott and Leroy planning to keep Mahia aboard with them. With the lifeboat away, Scott and Leroy return to the engine room to restart the engines and continue their plan of partially sinking the ship. Scott then goes to the bridge to pilot the ship, leaving Leroy to run the engines.|$|R
5000|$|In 1966, at {{the height}} of the Vietnam War, with many American {{soldiers}} dying, an extravagant White House ball ran on until 3am. Disgusted by this callousness, Gross recited Alfred Noyes' poem The Victory Ball in Congress in protest; the poem condemns the hedonism of a British Armistice <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> contains the <b>line</b> [...] "under the dancing feet are the graves".|$|R
5000|$|To {{increase}} his {{production at the}} plate, Bourjos began taking batting practice off a tee before the 2013 season. His strategy was to change his approach by hitting more ground <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> <b>line</b> drives, <b>and</b> fewer fly <b>balls.</b> In 2011, he had posted a ground ball rate of 46.8 percent. In 2013, he had raised that total to 58.7 percent, which was top-ten for hitters with at least 170 plate appearances. The extra practice and change in approach showed improved results. As of June 29, he had carried a [...]333 batting average, [...]392 on-base percentage and [...]457 slugging percentage and started to recoup a regular role. [...] However, in August, Bourjos took another pitch off his wrist from Jordan Lyles of the Houston Astros. [...] He attempted to rehabilitate it without surgery, but produced just five hits in 46 PA in August and September. Surgery was required to repair the wrist. [...] His final 2013 batting line included a [...]274 AVG, [...]333 OBP, [...]374 SLG, three doubles, three triples and three home runs with six stolen bases in 55 total games and 196 PA.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} new design of {{microstrip}} directional coupler with high directivity. This directional coupler uses corrugated coupled <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> conductor {{in the ground}} plane of microstrip to enhance coupling. Based on this structure, directional coupler having 4. 4 % bandwidth has been designed at 4500 MHz with 10 dB coupling and 35 dB directivity. The designed directional coupler has been fabricated and tested for {{the validity of the}} design. Measured results are presented in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Hanging culture {{relies on}} either a raft or {{longline}} system (with buoys <b>and</b> <b>lines)</b> that <b>floats</b> {{on the sea}} surface from which the cultured scallops are suspended, usually on ropes {{to which they are}} attached in some manner. Rafts are considerably more expensive than the equivalent distance of longline and are largely restricted to sheltered areas. However, raft systems require much less handling time. Longlines have proved effective for most farms to date and have the added advantage of being able to be completely submerged (with the exception of marker buoys) so to reduce visual pollution. From a raft or longline a variety of culture equipment can be supported. The main advantage of any form of hanging culture is in the exploitation of mid-water algal populations that cannot be fully utilized in other forms of culture.|$|R
25|$|The dead <b>ball</b> <b>lines</b> <b>and</b> the touch-lines (side lines) {{make up the}} {{boundary}} {{of the field of}} play. If the ball (or any part of the body of a player in possession of the ball) touches the ground on or beyond any of these lines, the ball is said to be dead and play must be restarted.|$|R
5000|$|Orange Grove Boulevard is a main {{thoroughfare}} in Pasadena and South Pasadena, California. Each New Year's Day, the Rose Parade participants <b>and</b> <b>floats</b> <b>line</b> up before dawn on Orange Grove Boulevard, facing north, {{for the beginning}} of the parade. South Orange Grove has been the address of the affluent, both the famous and the infamous, since the early 1900s. The Los Angeles Times said: [...] "When a stranger comes to Pasadena now, the real-estate agent shows him Orange Grove Avenue.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a robot referee for robot soccer. This idea is {{implemented}} using a service robot that moves along one of the field sides, uses its own cameras to analyze the game, and communicates its decisions to the human spectators using speech, and to the robot players using wireless communication. The robot uses a video-based game analysis toolbox that is able to analyze the actions at up to 20 fps. This toolbox includes robots, <b>ball,</b> landmarks, <b>and</b> <b>lines</b> detection <b>and</b> tracking, as well as refereeing decisionmaking. This robot system is validated and characterized in real game situations with humanoid robot players. This research was partially supported by FONDECYT (Chile) under Project Number 1061158...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} evolutional {{design of}} antennas for passive IC tags used at UHF-band. The shape of wire antennas is optimized using the genetic algorithm (GA) aiming at maximization of feeding {{power to the}} IC tag to lengthen the communication distance as well as minimization of the antenna size. The characteristics of the antennas printed on a dielectric substrate are evaluated using the moment method in the optimization processes. Genotypes for GA are introduced to express the shapes of lattice antennas which include loops <b>and</b> <b>floating</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>and</b> spiral antennas. It is shown that optimized antennas satisfy the required condition, and have smaller sizes in comparison with conventional meander antennas...|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{grinding}} compared. Report based on study of grinding silicon nitride powder {{in preparation for}} sintering into solid ceramic material. Attrition, vibratory, <b>and</b> <b>ball</b> mills <b>lined</b> with reaction-bonded silicon nitride tested. Rates of reduction of particle sizes and changes in chemical compositions of powders measured so grinding efficiences and increases in impurity contents from wear of mills and media evaluated for each technique...|$|R
5000|$|The ferry {{system has}} {{its origins in}} the [...] "mosquito fleet", a {{collection}} of small steamer lines serving the Puget Sound area during the later part {{of the nineteenth century}} and early part of the 20th century. By the beginning of the 1930s, two lines remained: the Puget Sound Navigation Company (known as the Black <b>Ball</b> <b>Line)</b> <b>and</b> the Kitsap County Transportation Company. A strike in 1935 forced the KCTC to close, leaving only the Black Ball Line.|$|R
