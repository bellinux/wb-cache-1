40|$|Premixed flames {{are widely}} used in {{domestic}} cookers. However, full utilization of premixed flame is usually restricted by its narrow operation range. Redesigning the <b>burner</b> <b>cap</b> {{is the focus of}} the present study. Two swirl burners, where the swirling flow is induced by two different methods, are proposed. It is found that compared to the Benchmarking cooker, both swirl burners are able to yield a higher heating efficiency under most of the operation conditions tested. Swirl Burner II shows lower CO emission than the Benchmarking cooker. Besides, Swirl Burner II has wider operation range. However, {{there is no evidence that}} Swirl Burner I can reduce the pollutant emission, or enlarge the operation range. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

While performing a monologue, {{he would turn}} off the <b>burners</b> and <b>cap</b> the steam-filled cans, creating a vacuum that eventually caused the cans to buckle, the sounds of which were then picked up, processed, and amplified back to the audience.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation model {{for determining the}} intervals of preven-tive replacement of the system's components. The application of the Weibull distri-bution has been proved to be efficient in the approximation of many forms of delay, while numerical integration supported by Simpson formula and Fortran software {{has been applied to}} simulate optimum values of the preventive replacement of the components of the rotary <b>cap</b> <b>burner</b> SAACKE, type SKV 60 in the marine steam boiler, {{on the basis of the}} available data gathered through the system's exploitation and through empirical assumptions.
