5|$|Clarke was {{appointed}} the first Resident Commissioner in <b>Basutoland</b> (today Lesotho) and took office on 16 March 1884. In the preceding years, <b>Basutoland</b> had become unruly. In 1879, an uprising by Chief Morosi was quelled but led to intertribal strife over {{the partition of}} his land. The Cape government sought to regain control in 1880 by extending the Cape Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to <b>Basutoland,</b> which provided for the disarmament of natives. Attempts {{to enforce the law}} resulted in the Basuto Gun War of 1880 to 1881. Unrest continued until it was agreed in 1884 to place the territory under direct British control.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} in <b>Basutoland,</b> Clarke drew praise from the {{economist}} John A. Hobson in his treatise Imperialism for his devotion to the education {{and development of the}} native people, while Viscount Bryce noted that his approach fostered goodwill amongst native people towards Britain. In Zululand, Clarke granted considerable authority and special judicial functions to the hereditary chiefs; and was commended by Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, for his action in the face of potential famine. He recommended to the Imperial Government the return from exile of Dinuzulu, the paramount chief. While in Southern Rhodesia, he was appointed to protect the interests of native people against the overarching ambitions of the British South Africa Company.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} India, where he lost an arm to a tiger. Moving to Africa, he was Resident Magistrate of Pietermaritzburg in 1874. He {{was made up}} to Captain in December 1875. He was Aide-de-Camp to Sir Theophilus Shepstone, the Special Commissioner of South Africa in 1876 on his mission to the Transvaal. He was {{appointed}} Special Commissioner to South Africa in 1876. He was Political Officer and Special Commissioner of Lydenburg in 1877. During the First Boer War, Clarke was twice mentioned in despatches. He was brevetted Major in April 1880 in recognition of his services during operations in South Africa. He was Resident Magistrate of <b>Basutoland</b> in 1881. He was promoted to Major in November 1882. He was Commissioner of Cape Police in 1882. He was seconded to the Sultan of Turkey's army in command of a regiment of the Egyptian Gendarmerie in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{was raised}} in Bedfordshire and educated at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He entered a {{theological}} college after graduation and was ordained a priest in 1911. He spent {{the next several years}} as a missionary in Africa, stationed on Zanzibar and in <b>Basutoland,</b> before returning to Europe as an army chaplain during the First World War. There, he met {{and fell in love with}} a young nurse, Grace Eileen Joly Beresford Buck, a development over which he eventually quit the Church of England and left his wife, Sybil. Returning to England after the war, Keable resigned his ministry and began to write novels: his first, 1921's Simon Called Peter, became a runaway success and launched Keable into a life of literary celebrity. Increasingly disillusioned with the hypocrisies he saw in contemporary British life, he and Buck left Europe for Tahiti in 1922. The couple lived there happily until Buck's death in childbirth in 1924, after which Keable's health began to fade. He nonetheless struck up a later relationship with a Tahitian woman, Ina, with whom he had a son, and continued to publish novels until his death of a kidney condition in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Heterodontosaurus tucki (SAM-PK-K337) was discovered during the British-South African expedition to South Africa and <b>Basutoland</b> (former name of Lesotho) in 1961-1962. Today, it {{is housed in}} the Iziko South African Museum. It was excavated on a mountain {{at an altitude of}} about , at a locality called Tyinindini, in the district of Transkei (sometimes referred to as Herschel) in the Cape Province of South Africa. The specimen consists of a crushed but nearly complete skull; associated postcranial remains mentioned in the original description could not be located in 2011. The animal was scientifically described and named in 1962 by palaeontologists Alfred Walter Crompton from South Africa and Alan J. Charig from the United Kingdom. The genus name refers to the different-shaped teeth, and the specific name honors George C. Tuck, a director of Austin Motor Company, who supported the expedition. The specimen was not fully prepared by the time of publication, so only the front parts of the skull and lower jaw were described, and the authors conceded that their description was preliminary, serving mainly to name the animal. It was considered an important discovery, as few early ornithischians were known at the time. The preparation of the specimen, i.e. the freeing of the bones from the rock matrix, was very time consuming, since they were covered in a thin, very hard, ferruginous layer containing haematite. This could only be removed by a diamond saw, which damaged the specimen.|$|E

25|$|A {{new wave}} of discontent spread amongst the {{different}} Xhosa tribes on the colonial frontier, {{and there was another}} uprising in <b>Basutoland</b> under Moirosi after the Gaika-Galeka War. The Xhosa under Moirosi were put down with severe fighting by a colonial force, but their defeat notwithstanding, the Basutos remained restless and aggressive for several years. In 1880, the British colonial authorities attempted to extend the Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to <b>Basutoland,</b> attempting a general disarmament of the Basutos. Further fighting followed the proclamation, which did not have a conclusive end, although peace was declared in December 1882. The imperial government took over <b>Basutoland</b> as a crown colony, on the understanding that Cape Colony should contribute £18,000 annually for administrative purposes. The authorities of the Colony were glad to be relieved in 1884 of the administration of the Transkei, whose administration had already cost them more than £3,000,000.|$|E
25|$|Lagden {{was born}} in Maseru, <b>Basutoland,</b> which {{corresponds}} to present-day Lesotho. His older brother, Ronald Owen Lagden, had also been born in Maseru, and was a first-class cricketer and England rugby union representative. Their father, Sir Godfrey Yeatman Lagden, was an Englishman who had been Resident Commissioner in <b>Basutoland,</b> while their mother was a South African, the daughter of Henry Bousfield, the first Bishop of Pretoria. The brothers were sent to school at Marlborough College, but then went their separate ways, with Ronald going on to Oriel College, Oxford, and Reginald going on to Pembroke College, Cambridge.|$|E
25|$|<b>Basutoland,</b> {{home of the}} Basotho people, {{had been}} under the nominal control of the Cape Colony since 1872. However the Cape {{government}} had allowed the Basotho leadership to keep much of their traditional authority and independence. As allies and trading partners of the Cape, the Basotho were also well-equipped with firearms.|$|E
25|$|The Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal is a British {{campaign}} medal {{which was}} awarded {{to members of the}} Cape Colonial Forces who took part in three campaigns in and around the Cape of Good Hope, in <b>Basutoland</b> in 1880–1881, in Transkei in 1880–1881 and in Bechuanaland in 1896–1897.|$|E
25|$|When Rhodes {{became a}} member of the Cape Parliament, the chief goal of the {{assembly}} was to help decide the future of <b>Basutoland.</b> The ministry of Sir Gordon Sprigg was trying to restore order after the 1880 rebellion known as the Gun War. The Sprigg ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its policy of disarming all native Africans to those of the Basotho nation.|$|E
25|$|The Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal was {{authorised}} in December 1900 as {{a retrospective}} award for veterans of three campaigns which were fought in South Africa between 1880 and 1897. The medal was for award to the officers, non-commissioned officers and {{men of the}} Colonial Forces who were engaged on active service during the campaigns in <b>Basutoland</b> (1880–1881), Tembuland and Griqualand East in Transkei (1880–1881), and Bechuanaland (1896–1897). Three campaign clasps were authorised at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Lagden {{was born}} in Maseru {{in what was then}} the British colony of <b>Basutoland</b> (now Lesotho). He is {{one of only a handful}} of {{first-class}} cricketers to be born in that country. Lagden had a younger brother, Reginald, who was a first-class cricketer for Oxford's rivals, Cambridge University, as well as playing with Surrey. Their father, Godfrey, later appeared in a single first-class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club at the age of 54. Ronald Lagden was educated at Marlborough College and Oriel College, Oxford.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} states {{to emerge from the}} Mfecane was the Sotho Kingdom founded at Thaba Bosiu by Moshoeshoe I around 1821 to 1822. It was a {{confederation}} of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the Cape. The Orange Free State slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of <b>Basutoland.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was {{considerable}} unrest in Cape Colony {{in the period}} from 1878 to 1885 – sparked {{in part by the}} attempts of the British Colonial Office to impose a system of confederation on Southern Africa and to disarm all Africans in the Cape. In a short period of time, there was the Anglo-Zulu War, chronic troubles with the Basutos (which prompted the Cape to relinquish control of <b>Basutoland</b> to the imperial authorities) as well as a series of conflicts with the Xhosa which were followed by the First Boer War of 1881 and the Bechuanaland disturbances of 1884.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} part of the African continent was dominated in the 19th century by a set of struggles to create within it a single unified state. While the Berlin Conference of 1884–5 sought to draw boundaries between the European powers' African possessions, it also set the stage for further scrambles. Britain attempted to annex first the South African Republic in 1880, and then, in 1899, both the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. In 1868, Britain annexed <b>Basutoland</b> in the Drakensberg Mountains following an appeal from Moshesh, the leader of a mixed group of African refugees from the Zulu wars, who sought British protection against the Boers.|$|E
25|$|Hobson {{was born}} in Maseru, in present-day Lesotho (formerly the British colony of <b>Basutoland).</b> He {{is one of only}} a small number of {{first-class}} cricketers to be born in that country. Hobson's sole appearance for Orange Free State came in December 1970, against Border during the 1970–71 season of the Currie Cup. In the match, played at East London's Jan Smuts Ground, he opened the bowling with Michael Jones, taking 0/64 from 15 overs in the first innings. While batting, he came in tenth in the batting order in both innings, scoring five runs in the first and 25 in the second. His team lost by six wickets, having followed on.|$|E
25|$|In 1892 Galpin was {{transferred}} to Queenstown, where he was to remain {{until his retirement in}} 1917. By now his herbarium specimens had grown to about 1500 in number. He made extensive collecting trips to mountains in the Eastern Cape, including Great Winterberg, Katberg, Stormberg and Andriesberg. In 1904 his wife accompanied him on a trip to the <b>Basutoland</b> border where they collected around Ben MacDhui and Satsannasberg. In 1897 he set out on a trip from Port Elizabeth to Humansdorp, Knysna, George, Riversdale, Swellendam and Caledon districts, ending in Cape Town. Here he spent some time at the Bolus Herbarium. In 1905 he visited Rhodesia with the British Association, collecting at the Victoria Falls and the Matopos.|$|E
25|$|Boyes was {{the younger}} brother of George Wroughton Boyes, who also played {{first-class}} cricket for Natal. The brothers were both born in Maseru, in present-day Lesotho (formerly part of the British colony of <b>Basutoland).</b> They represent two {{of only a handful}} of first-class cricketers to be born in that country. Harry Boyes played his only match for Natal in December 1939, against Border in Queenstown. A middle-order batsman, he made five runs in the first innings and six in the second. Three other players – John Beveridge, Cecil Warner, and Murray Whitehead – were also making their first-class debuts in the match, which was part of 1929–30 season of the Currie Cup. Boyes died in Pietermaritzburg in 1979, aged 71.|$|E
25|$|Boyes was {{the younger}} brother of Harry Boyes, who also played {{first-class}} cricket for Natal. The brothers were both born in Maseru {{in what is now}} Lesotho (previously part of the British colony of <b>Basutoland).</b> They represent two {{of only a handful of}} first-class cricketers to be born in that country. George Boyes played his only match for Natal in December 1939, against Orange Free State in Bloemfontein. He made three runs in the first innings and six not out in the second, and was in the middle when the winning runs were hit. The match was not part of the Currie Cup, which was not being contested during the 1939–40 season. Boyes died in Pietermaritzburg in 1986, aged 75.|$|E
25|$|Piers {{was born}} in Leribe (or Hlotse), {{in what is now}} Lesotho (previously part of the British colony of <b>Basutoland).</b> He is {{one of only a handful}} of {{first-class}} cricketers to be born in that country. Both of Piers' matches for Orange Free State came in March 1948, towards the end of that season's Currie Cup. On debut against Western Province, he scored 24 and 6, while in the next match, against Eastern Province, he scored a duck in the first innings and 11 run in the second. In all four of his innings, he came in ninth in the batting order. Despite making his debut at the age of 17, Piers played no further matches for Orange Free State. He died in Randburg, a suburb of Johannesburg, in September 2005, aged 76.|$|E
25|$|Whether by {{or against}} the wish of the home government, the limits of British {{authority}} continued to extend. The Basotho, who dwelt in the upper valleys of the Orange River, had subsisted under a semi-protectorate of the British government from 1843 to 1854; but having been {{left to their own}} resources on the abandonment of the Orange sovereignty, they fell into a long exhaustive warfare with the Boers of the Orange Free State. On the urgent petition of their chief Moshesh, they were proclaimed British subjects in 1868, and their territory became part of the Cape Colony in 1871 (see <b>Basutoland).</b> In the same year, the southeastern part of Bechuanaland was annexed to Britain under the title of Griqualand West. This annexation was a consequence of the discovery there of rich diamond mines, an event which was destined to have far-reaching results.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the Anglo-Boer wars, Britain set about unifying the four colonies including the former Boer republics into a single self-governed country called the Union of South Africa. This was accomplished {{after several years of}} negotiations, when the South Africa Act 1909 consolidated the Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange Free State into one nation. Under the provisions of the act, the Union became an independent Dominion of the British Empire, governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with the British monarch represented by a Governor-General. Prosecutions before the courts of the Union of South Africa were instituted {{in the name of the}} Crown and government officials served in the name of the Crown. The British High Commission territories of <b>Basutoland</b> (now Lesotho), and Bechuanaland (now Botswana), Swaziland continued under direct rule from Britain.|$|E
25|$|Barr {{was born}} in Quthing, {{in what is now}} Lesotho (previously part of the British colony of <b>Basutoland).</b> He is {{one of only a handful}} of {{first-class}} cricketers to be born in that country. Barr made his first-class debut at the age of 17, playing against Natal during the 1929–30 season of the Currie Cup. He continued making regular appearances for Orange Free State until the 1937–38 season, but never played more than two matches in a single season. Barr's highest first-class score was an innings of 43 against Eastern Province in February 1937, made from third in the batting order. He finished his career with a batting average of only 14.56, and never bowled at first-class level. Barr died in October 1973 in Ficksburg, which lies on the border between Lesotho and Orange Free State Province.|$|E
25|$|The {{colonies of}} British Bechuanaland and <b>Basutoland</b> were now {{included}} in the customs union between the Orange Free State and Cape Colony. Pondoland, another native territory, {{was added to the}} colony in 1894. The act dealt with natives who resided in certain native reserves and provided for their interests and holdings. It also awarded them certain privileges that they had hitherto not enjoyed, and also required them to pay a small labour tax. This was in many respects the most statesmanlike act dealing with natives on the statue-book. In the parliamentary sitting of 1895, Rhodes was able to report that the Act had been applied to 160,000 natives. The labour clauses of the act, which were not being applied, were repealed in 1905. The clauses had some success as they prompted many thousands of natives to fulfil their labour requirements to be exempted from the labour tax.|$|E
25|$|A {{succession}} of wars followed from 1858 to 1868 between the Basotho kingdom and the Boer republic of Orange Free State. In the battles that followed, the Orange Free State {{tried unsuccessfully to}} capture Moshoeshoe's mountain stronghold at Thaba Bosiu, while the Sotho conducted raids in Free State territories. Both sides adopted scorched-earth tactics, with large swathes of pasturage and cropland being destroyed. Faced with starvation, Moshoeshoe signed a peace treaty on 15 October 1858, though crucial boundary issues remained unresolved. War broke out again in 1865. After an unsuccessful appeal for aid from the British Empire, Moshoeshoe signed the 1866 treaty of Thaba Bosiu, with the Basotho ceding substantial territory to the Orange Free State. On 12 March 1868, the British parliament declared the Basotho Kingdom a British protectorate {{and part of the}} British Empire. Open hostilities ceased between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. The country was subsequently named <b>Basutoland</b> and is presently named Lesotho.|$|E
25|$|Elsa Chauvel {{was born}} Elsie May Wilcox in Collingwood, Melbourne, Australia on 10 February 1898. Her parents were Irish actor Edward Wilcox, also known by his stage name Edward Sylvaney, and Australian Ada Worrill. Elsa had an elder brother named Kyrle. In her early years, Elsa was often {{involved}} in her parents' theatrical performances, often {{under the name}} Elsie Sylvaney. While still a child, Elsa and her family travelled to South Africa, where they formed a travelling troupe. Elsa and Kyrle typically portrayed children onstage, but also used makeup to play adults when necessary. When {{the success of the}} family's shows waned, they returned to Cape Town, where, in 1909, youngest sibling Terry was born. Following World War One, in which Kyrle fought, the family travelled to Johannesburg. Here, Elsa performed in chorus lines, and later appeared in such plays as The Thirteenth Chair, A Royal Divorce, and Sign of the Cross. Following a successful stage tour in <b>Basutoland,</b> the family returned to Australia in 1924.|$|E
500|$|Clarke served until 1893. John A. Hobson, in Imperialism, A Study (1902), {{summed up}} Clarke's work in <b>Basutoland</b> saying that, {{along with other}} administrators like Sir George Grey and Lord Ripon, he [...] "...brought sympathy and {{knowledge}} {{to the establishment of}} careful experiments in self-government." [...] Hobson compares the approach to imperialism in <b>Basutoland</b> with that in Rhodesia and the Cape Colony, noting that [...] "in the former it is devoted to protecting and aiding the education and development of the native people, while in the latter two, the policy allows for the exploitation of the people and lands by white colonists." [...] The Paris Evangelical Missionary Society honoured him in appreciation for his work to bring about peace and good governance.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Marshal James Clarke [...] (24 October 1841 – 1 April 1909) was a British colonial {{administrator}} and {{an officer of}} the Royal Artillery. He was the first Resident Commissioner in <b>Basutoland</b> from 1884 to 1893; Resident Commissioner in Zululand from 1893 to 1898; and, following the botched Jameson Raid, the first Resident Commissioner in Southern Rhodesia from 1898 to 1905.|$|E
500|$|Under Imperial Administration through Clarke, <b>Basutoland</b> {{once again}} {{demonstrated}} the loyalty seen under previous Imperial rule {{and returned to}} prosperity, supplying neighbouring territories with grain and livestock, as well as labour for the Kimberley Diamond Fields. James Bryce (later Viscount Bryce) noted in his Impressions, after his tour of Southern Africa in 1897, that Clarke combined tactfulness with firmness in order to inspire goodwill towards the British government. While he suppressed the more [...] "noxious" [...] customs of the native people, he did not allow Europeans to own land and mineral prospectors were forbidden: the only whites permitted to reside were officials, missionaries and certain traders. Clarke's policy was to reinstate the tribal institutions and to govern through the recognised chiefs, amongst whom Letsie, son of Moshesh, was paramount. An annual pitso (national assembly) was held to debate questions of welfare. The white authorities only intervened when disturbances occurred between natives.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's tenure {{marked a}} {{difference}} in policy: {{instead of trying to}} divide and rule and undermine the power of the hereditary chiefs, he granted considerable authority to them. He applied a similar approach to that of his previous work in <b>Basutoland.</b> His view was that the native people were [...] "better able to manage their own affairs than we can do it for them, though they need our help in international matters and in matters between white and black." [...] He gave special judicial functions to Hlubi of the Basotho, Mehlokazulu of the Ngobese and Mpiyakhe of the Mdlalose, enabling them to try certain cases referred to them by Resident Magistrates. In 1895, according to Harriette Colenso, the Zulu people approved of direct rule with Clarke as Resident Commissioner. However, when Clarke was appointed Resident Commissioner in Rhodesia in 1898, Charles Saunders replaced him and he bowed to pressure from settlers and officials to minimise Dinuzulu's influence over the Zulu people, especially during the Second Boer War.|$|E
500|$|Earning a small wage, Mandela {{rented a}} room in the house of the Xhoma family in the Alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, Alexandra always {{remained}} a special place for him. Although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a Swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter. To save money and be closer to downtown Johannesburg, Mandela moved into the compound of the Witwatersrand Native Labour Association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the Queen Regent of <b>Basutoland.</b> In late 1941, Jongintaba visited Johannesburg—there forgiving Mandela for running away—before returning to Thembuland, where he died in the winter of 1942. Mandela and Justice arrived a day late for the funeral. After he passed his BA exams in early 1943, Mandela returned to Johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in Thembuland. He later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he [...] "simply found [...] doing so, and could not do otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|Keable {{returned}} to the UK in 1914 {{as a result of}} illness, precipitated perhaps by the rigour of service upon which Weston insisted in Zanzibar. He was offered a church posting in Sheffield but declined, fearing [...] "the pull of Rome" [...] if left within reach of Catholic influences in Britain. Instead, he made two attempts to enlist for armed service during the First World War; ill health thwarted both, so he {{returned to}} Africa for mission work, becoming rector of three parishes (including Leribe, <b>Basutoland),</b> under the diocese of the Bishop of Bloemfontein. He published some ten devotional works and works on missionary practice during this time, including The Loneliness of Christ, and a book of verse titled Songs of the narrow way. The damaging effects of the illness he had suffered were compounded by an assault while in the field: accounts vary, with some friends recalling that Keable received a blow to the head from a [...] "powerful native", and others describing a gunshot wound to the thigh, inflicted by a (probably drunk or deranged) Mosutu. Keable's biographer Cecil has suggested that the whole incident may have been a fabrication of Keable's.|$|E
2500|$|Promoted to major-general on 23 March 1882, Gordon {{was sent}} to the Cape to aid in {{settling}} affairs in <b>Basutoland,</b> but he returned to the United Kingdom after only a few months. The principle problem faced by Gordon in South Africa was <b>Basutoland</b> (modern Lesotho), a small kingdom whose ruler, King Moshoeshoe had decided to have his nation become a British protectorate rather be annexed by the Orange Free State. One of Moshoeshoe's sons, Prince Masupha had rebelled in protest against his father's plans. Before settling out on a trip to mediate {{the end of the civil}} war in <b>Basutoland,</b> Gordon met with Cecil Rhodes in Cape Town to seek his advice. Rhodes later recalled he and Gordon got along [...] "capitally together".|$|E
2500|$|The {{duration}} of the <b>Basutoland</b> Campaign was from 13 September 1880 to 27 April 1881. Following {{the end of the}} Zulu wars [...] from 1877 to 1879, Cape of Good Hope Governor Henry Bartle Frere and Prime Minister Gordon Sprigg attempted to disarm the Basotho and ordered them to hand in their firearms. Some chiefs reluctantly complied, but were almost immediately attacked by chiefs who had refused to comply, such as Lerothodi and Moletsane. In September 1880 they also attacked white administrators and, as a result, troops were mobilised and the Basuto Gun War broke out. Various encounters ensued until February 1881, when an armistice was arranged. Peace was eventually concluded in May 1881. Veterans of this campaign were awarded the <b>Basutoland</b> Clasp.|$|E
2500|$|In the memorable {{summary of}} the {{historian}} De Kiewiet: [...] "In South Africa, the heat of drought easily becomes the fever of war [...]" [...] The drought had started in 1875 in Gcalekaland and had spread {{to other parts of}} the Transkei and <b>Basutoland,</b> also to the Cape Colony controlled Ciskei. By 1877, it had become the most severe drought ever recorded. In 1877, the ethnic tensions began to emerge, particularly between the Mfengu, the Thembu and the Gcaleka Xhosa. A wedding celebration in September 1877 was the scene of a bar fight when the tensions emerged after Gcaleka harassed the Fengu in attendance. Later in the same day, Gcaleka attacked a Cape Colony police outpost which was manned predominantly by a Fengu ethnic police force.|$|E
