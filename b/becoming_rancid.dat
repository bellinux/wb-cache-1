As fast-food chains routinely use different fats in different locations, trans fat levels in fast food can have large variations. For example, an analysis of samples of McDonald's French fries collected in 2004 and 2005 found that fries served in New York City contained twice as much trans fat as in Hungary, and 28 times as much as in Denmark, where trans fats are restricted. At KFC, the pattern was reversed, with Hungary's product containing twice the trans fat of the New York product. Even within the United States there was variation, with fries in New York containing 30% more trans fat than those from Atlanta.|$|E

6000|$|The zobo, or {{cross between}} the yak and hill cow (much {{resembling}} the English cow), is but rarely seen in these mountains, though {{common in the}} North West Himalaya. The yak {{is used as a}} beast of burden; and much of the wealth of the people consists in its rich milk and curd, eaten either fresh or dried, or powdered into a kind of meal. The hair is spun into ropes, and woven into a covering for their tents, which is quite pervious to wind and rain;* [The latter is, however, of little consequence in the dry climate of Tibet.] from the same material are made the gauze shades for the eyes used in crossing snowy passes. The bushy tail forms the well-known [...] "chowry" [...] or fly-flapper of the plains of India; the bones and dung serve for fuel. The female drops one calf in April; and the young yaks are very full of gambols, tearing up and down the steep grassy and rocky slopes: their flesh is delicious, much richer and more juicy than common veal; that of the old yak is sliced and dried in the sun, forming jerked meat, which is eaten raw, the scanty proportion of fat preventing its <b>becoming</b> very <b>rancid,</b> so that I found it palatable food: it is called schat-tcheu (dried meat). I never observed the yak to be annoyed by any insects; indeed at the elevation it inhabits, there are no large diptera, bots, or gadflies to infest it. It loves steep places, delighting to scramble among rocks, and to sun its black hide perched on the glacial boulders which strew the Wallanchoon flat, and on which these beasts always sleep. Their average value is from two to three pounds, but the price varies with the season. In autumn, when her calf is killed for food, the mother will yield no milk, unless the herdsman gives it the calf's foot to lick, or lays a stuffed skin before it, to fondle, which it does with eagerness, expressing its satisfaction by short grunts, exactly like those of a pig, a sound which replaces the low uttered by ordinary cattle. The yak, though indifferent to ice and snow and to changes of temperature, cannot endure hunger so long as the sheep, nor pick its way so well upon stony ground. Neither can it bear damp heat, for which reason it will not live in summer below 7000 feet, where liver disease carries it off after a very few years.* [Nevertheless, the yak seems to have survived the voyage to England. I find in Turner's [...] "Tibet" [...] (p. 189), that a bull sent by that traveller to Mr. Hastings, reached England alive, and after suffering from languor, so far recovered its health and vigour as to become the father of many calves. Turner does not state by what mother these calves were born, an important omission, as he adds that all these died but one cow, which bore a calf by an Indian bull. A painting of the yak (copied into Turner's book) by Stubbs, the animal painter, may be seen in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, London. The artist is probably a little indebted to description for the appearance of its hair in a native state, for it is represented much too even in length, and reaching to too uniform a depth from the flanks.] Lastly, the yak is ridden, especially by the fat Lamas, who find its shaggy coat warm, and its paces easy; under these circumstances it is always led. The wild yak or bison (D'hong) of central Asia, the superb progenitor of this animal, is the largest native animal of Tibet, in various parts of which country it is found; and the Tibetans say, in reference to its size, that the liver is a load for a tame yak. The Sikkim Dewan gave Dr. Campbell and myself an animated account of the chase of this animal, which is hunted by large dogs, and shot with a blunderbuss: it is untameable and horridly fierce, falling upon you with horns and chest, and if he rasps you with his tongue, it is so rough as to scrape the flesh from the bones. The horn is used as a drinking-cup in marriage feasts, and on other grand occasions. My readers are probably familiar with Messrs. Huc and Gabet's account of a herd of these animals being frozen fast in the head-waters of the Yangtsekiang river. There is a noble specimen in the British Museum not yet set up, and another is preparing for exhibition in the Crystal Palace at Sydenham.|$|R

6000|$|... 'The Indians {{enter into}} the Cueva del Guacharo once a year, near midsummer, armed with poles, by means of which they destroy {{the greater part of}} the nests. At this season several {{thousands}} of birds are killed; and the old ones, as if to defend their brood, hover {{over the heads of the}} Indians, uttering terrible cries. The young, which fall to the ground, are opened on the spot. Their peritoneum is extremely loaded with fat, and a layer of fat reaches from the abdomen to the anus, forming a kind of cushion between the legs of the bird. This quantity of fat in frugivorous animals, not exposed to the light, and exerting very little muscular motion, reminds us of what has been long since observed in the fattening of geese and oxen. It is well known how favourable darkness and repose are to this process. The nocturnal birds of Europe are lean, because, instead of feeding on fruits, like the Guacharo, they live on the scanty produce of their prey. At the period which is commonly called at Caripe the [...] "oil harvest," [...] the Indians build huts with palm-leaves near the entrance, and even in the porch of the cavern. Of these we still saw some remains. There, with a fire of brushwood, they melt in pots of clay the fat of the young birds just killed. This fat is known by the name of butter or oil (manteca or aceite) of the Guacharo. It is half liquid, transparent without smell, and so pure that it may be kept above a year without <b>becoming</b> <b>rancid.</b> At the convent of Caripe no other oil is used in the kitchen of the monks but that of the cavern; and we never observed that it gave the aliments a disagreeable taste or smell.|$|E

50|$|NOPs {{all have}} similar sources and applications, but the {{materials}} themselves {{can be quite}} different, depending on how they are made.

Odor is a significant property which is different from NOP to NOP. Most NOPs are still quite similar chemically to their parent vegetable oils and as such are prone to <b>becoming</b> <b>rancid.</b> This involves autoxidation of fatty acid chains containing carbon-carbon double bonds and ultimately the formation of odoriferous, low molecular weight aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids.

50|$|The label {{states that}} Nutella {{does not need}} to be refrigerated. This is because the large {{quantity}} of sugar in the product acts as a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. More specifically, the sugar acts as a preservative by binding the water in the product, which prevents the microorganisms from growing. In fact, refrigeration causes Nutella to harden because it contains fats from the hazelnuts. When nut fats are placed in cold temperatures they become too hard to spread. Hazelnuts contain almost 91 percent monounsaturated fat, which are known to be liquid at room temperature and solidify at refrigerator temperatures. Room temperature allow the product to have a smooth and spreadable consistency because the monounsaturated oils from the hazelnut are liquid at this state. In addition, the palm oil used in Nutella does not require refrigeration because it contains high amounts of saturated fat and resists <b>becoming</b> <b>rancid.</b> Therefore, Nutella can be stored at room temperature in the cabinet without going rancid before the Best Before date. The remaining ingredients in Nutella, such as cocoa, skimmed milk powder, soy lecithin, and vanillin also do not require refrigeration. Hence, Nutella {{does not need to}} be put in the refrigerator after opening.|$|E
50|$|Murumuru {{butter is}} rich in lauric, {{myristic}} and oleic acid.

The quality of Murumuru butter is similar to the seed fat of the Tucumã palm and coconut palm, but it has the advantage of providing greater consistency because of its melting point (33 C), which is superior to that of the Tucumã palm (30 °C) and coconut palm (22.7 °C). The quality of Murumuru butter makes it possible to mix it with other vegetable butters that have a lower melting point. It {{can also be used to}} partially substitute cocoa butter in chocolate, providing a firmer consistency in environments where the temperature is higher.Murumuru butter has the great advantage of having a low acidity value (4% to 5%), especially when made from fresh seeds, which reduces the cost of refinement.Murumuru butter was highly valued in Europe and the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, when it served as an ingredient in vegetable creams and soaps. Today, we know that soaps containing Murumuru butter together with Ucuuba butter leave a protection layer onthe skin similar to silicone, only it does not clog the pores.The combination of these two butters is an excellent treatment for dry and tired skins.In hair products, Murumuru butter helps to maintain curls, while nourishing and strengthening hair roots. Murumuru butter is used in small amounts in shampoos (0.5% to 1%) and formulas for conditioners, creams, soaps, lipsticks and deodorants (0.5% to 8%).|$|E

Samples containing the transition minerals iron and copper were very susceptible to oxidation, <b>becoming</b> <b>rancid</b> rapidly. Low levels of zinc addition, between 2 - 10 % of the recommended daily allowance (RDA), led to spreads with acceptable oxidative stability and a textural profile comparable to the controls over the storage period examined...|$|E

In addition, antioxidant molecules are employed to prevent unsaturated oil products from <b>becoming</b> <b>rancid</b> during storage and thus extend oil life. The modification –chemical or enzymatic- of natural antioxidants in order to increase their misci-bility and/or stability towards the action of light and/or oxygen renders a series of “semisynthetic ” antioxidants with great impact in the food and feed industries. In this review, we will discuss the enzymatic modifications of antioxidant vitamins C and E. L-Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is the major water-soluble natural antioxidant acting as a free radical scavenger, and plays an important role in regenerating vitamin E. However, due to the low miscibility of ascorbic acid with -tocopherol, it is necessary to use ascorbyl fatty acid derivatives. Thus, esters of L-ascorbic acid with long-chain fatty acids (esp. palmitic or stearic) are employed as additives (E- 304) in foods rich in lipids. The enzymatic synthesis of acyl L-ascorbates offers some advantages compared with the current chemical process, such as its high regioselectivity and the moderate re-action conditions. Vitamin E enhances the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation acting as a free radical scavenger and is generally administered in the form of all-rac [...] tocopheryl acetate or succinate to increase its stability. Several approaches have been described for the enzyme-catalysed synthesis of vitamin E acetate, based on the transesterification of vinyl acetate with vitamin E, or the regioselective hydrolysis of -isophorone followed by reaction with isophytol.

Fecha de lectura: 22 - 05 - 2009 Antioxidants protect cells {{against the}} effects of harmful free radicals and {{play an important role}} in preventing many human diseases (e. g. cancer, atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, inflammatory disorders, etc.) and aging itself. In addition, antioxidant molecules are employed to prevent unsaturated oil products from <b>becoming</b> <b>rancid</b> during storage, thus extending oil life. The modification of natural antioxidants in order to increase their miscibility and/or stability towards the action of light and/or oxygen renders a series of “semisynthetic” antioxidants with great value-added in the food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. These antioxidant derivatives may have impact not only as food preservatives but also as components of functional foods and nutraceuticals. Vitamin E (acting as a free radical scavenger) enhances the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids towards peroxidation and, to increase its stability, is generally administered in the form of all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate. Several approaches have been described for the enzyme-catalysed synthesis of vitamin E acetate, e. g. the regioselective hydrolysis of α-isophorone followed by reaction with isophytol. We have investigated the modification of antioxidant vitamin E by acylation with vinyl acetate catalyzed by lipases. Several parameters have been probed: (1) the source of the enzyme and its water content; (2) the effect of the carriers; and (3) the composition of the reaction medium. Resveratrol (trans- 3, 5, 4 '-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic phytochemical found in grapes and wine that is biosynthesized in response to pathogenic attack or stress conditions. It possesses a variety of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumour, cardioprotective and immunomodulatory bioactivities. As part of our interest in regioselective biotransformations of polyhydroxylated compounds, we have investigated the one-step enzymatic synthesis of acylated or glycosylated resveratrol by enzyme-catalyzed processes. Such modifications could render derivatives bearing different acyl- or glucosyl- groups in various positions, which may beneficially affect their bioavailability and/or pharmacological properties. Although the three phenolic groups of resveratrol at positions 3 -, 5 - and 4 ’- exhibit very similar chemical reactivity, our results suggest that the regioselectivity of the acylation can be controlled by an adequate selection of the biocatalyst. Regarding the glucosylation, we have investigated the modification of resveratrol by glucosyltransferases, with starch as glucosyl donor. We studied several parameters: (1) source of the enzyme, (2) presence of cosolvents, (3) reaction temperature, (4) weight ratio donor (starch) : acceptor (resveratrol). We obtained 14 new resveratrol glucosides, which were further characterized by HPLC-MS and NMR. Using Rancimat test and Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity assay (TEAC), we studied the antioxidant capability of all new derivatives of tocopherol and resveratrol. To know the surfactant properties of resveratrol glucosides, we measured the variation of the surface tension vs concentration in order to determinate the value of critical micellar concentration. Apart from this, we have characterized a new group of epoxy-activated supports, called DilbeadsTM, based on methacrylate, to immobilize enzymes (Dilbeads TA, DVK, SZ, EZ, NK and RS). Scanning electron microscopy, mercury intrusion porosimetry analysis and nitrogen adsortion isotherms were employed. We have studied the distribution of a sterol sterase within Dilbeads using fluorescence confocal microscopy and a FITC-labelled enzyme. Most of the enzyme molecules are confined in a surface layer of 10. 5 μm width. There is an apparent diffusional limitations of enzyme molecules to reach the center of the bead particle, which can be caused by several factors including: (1) the tortuosity of the pore structure; (2) the steric hindrance exerted by the enzyme molecules that are immobilized in the shell of the particle. 1...|$|E
