We will recall the classical Hitchin-Kobayashi correspon-dence (Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau theory) of stability and Hermitian-Einstein metrics on holomorphic vector bundles; and some generaliza-tions of the classical Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence, specially, we will focus on non-compact case; furthermore, We’ll discuss the Dirich-let boundary problem of Hermitian-Einstein equations (or quiver Vor-tex equations) and some related heat flow in gauge theory.

In the first part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk,</b> I will present a DHT we have developed recently in our group which maintains desirable properties under worst-case churn. In the second part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk,</b> we will briefly look at another challenge of prime importance in P 2 P computing, namely selfishness.

I will discuss how self-scattering of dark matter particles can affect cluster collisions and mergers and how we can use observations to study the particle physics properties of dark matter. A particularly interesting scenario {{will turn out to be}} dark sectors with new light mediators and I will dedicate the second part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk</b> to laboratory searches for such new states.

40|$|During this decade, the Amazon {{region in}} South America has {{suffered}} two severe droughts {{in the short}} span of five years –– 2005 and 2010. The 2005 drought, dubbed a once-in-a-century drought, {{has been the focus}} and driver of many studies on the drought sensitivity of Amazon forests. These studies present a complex, and sometimes contradictory, picture of how these forests have responded to the 2005 drought. In particular, Saleska et al. (Science, 2007) reported excessive greening of the forests in response to the drought. But, this has now been proven by Samanta et al. (GRL, 2010) to be artifact of atmospheric-corruption of the satellite data analyzed by Saleska et al. (2007). In the first part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk,</b> I will focus on the Saleska et al. and Samanta et al. studies. On the heels of the 2005 drought, came an even stronger drought in 2010, as indicated by record low river levels in the 109 years of bookkeeping. How have the forests responded to this record-breaking drought? Did they green-up or brown-down? I will address this in the second part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk.</b> The objective <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk</b> will be to emphasize the care required in analysis and interpretation of satellite data...|$|R

40|$|Colour {{refinement}} is {{a simple}} algorithm that partitions the vertices of a graph according their "iterated degree sequence. " It has very efficient implementations, running in quasilinear time, and a surprisingly wide range of applications. The algorithm has been designed {{in the context of}} graph isomorphism testing, and it is used an important subroutine in almost all practical graph isomorphism tools. Somewhat surprisingly, other applications in machine learning, probabilistic inference, and linear programming have surfaced recently. In the first part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk,</b> I will introduce the basic algorithm as well as higher dimensional extensions known as the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm.

40|$|Justice O’Connor rightly called {{federalism}} “our oldest {{question of}} constitutional law. ” 1 But the constitutional {{balance between the}} nation and the states is hardly what the cool kids are talking about these days. My first-year con law students show up each Fall expecting to learn about same-sex marriage, flag burning, and abortion; they’re plainly disappointed when they pick up the syllabus and see how much of the course {{is going to be about}} government structure. The first part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk</b> resists that intuition. The notion that federalism is passé is so tragically wrongheaded that I can’t bear to leave it alone. As we say in North Carolina, “it hurts my heart. ” And thinking about why one should care about federalism can actually tell us a lot about the meaning of the federalism we have. The second part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk</b> explores how the Constitution protects federalism. I’ll conclude by addressing what federalism needs to survive as a constitutional principle...|$|R
40|$|Before I {{proceed to}} deal with the subject <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk</b> today, I think it {{necessary}} to make a reference to a contemporary event which has a relevance to the topic <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk.</b> The contemporary event I am referring to is the arrest of Jayendra Saraswati styled as the Shankaracharya of Kamkoti Peetham. Adya Shankaracharya established four monasteries (mutts) at four places in India; Badrinath, Dwaraka, Puri and Shringeri. The priests heading these Mutts have been traditionally dubbed as Shankaracharyas. Kamkoti Mutt is not the one established by Adya Shankaracharya. However, the Hindus, at least in the South, have been revering the head of this mutt as a Shankaracharya. Mutts are monasteries and not temples, though a temple may be attached to a monastery. Heads of these mutts are concerned with religious affairs only and are not expected to dabble in political affairs. The last incumbent of the office of Shankaracharya of Kanchi wa...|$|R
40|$|In my {{presentation}} I {{will argue}} that the syntactic phenomena associated with the left periphery can be accounted for {{with the help of the}} “edge feature ” introduced by Chomsky (2008). I thus take a somewhat conservative view of the left periphery, more in line with the account in Holmberg & Platzack (1995) than in line with many recent attempts that are based on Rizzi (1997), like e. g. Sigurðsson (2008) and Hróarsdóttir et al. (2007). Taking Swedish as <b>my</b> point <b>of</b> departure, I will run through the different options in the C-domain, showing how they can be accounted for in the chosen framework. Next, I will discuss how the cross-linguistic variation found in the C-domain of V 2 -languages can be handled, and in the third part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>talk</b> I will broaden the account to non-V 2 languages, discussing among other things the Romance data that Rizzi (1997) is based on.
