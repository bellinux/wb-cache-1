5|$|After {{retiring}} from hockey Phillps ran his own lumber company and later moved to Toronto in 1920. After having a tooth pulled in 1923, {{he died of}} <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning</b> {{at the age of}} 40. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was founded in 1945, Phillips was inducted as part of the first class of inductees. He was also inducted into the Northwestern Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1987.|$|E

There, Glenn begins to pray for the {{well-being}} of his fellow survivors, while T-Dog receives medical treatment for <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Meanwhile Carl goes in and out of consciousness, and briefly recalls his encounter with the deer before going into a seizure. A distraught Lori opines to Rick about ending Carl's suffering, but Rick insists on keeping him alive.|$|E
5|$|Hesketh-Prichard {{died from}} sepsis on 14 June 1922, at the ancestral {{home of his}} wife at Gorhambury, Hertfordshire, England. His obituarists {{ascribed}} this to an obscure form of <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning</b> brought on by gassing in the trenches during his war service. However, his ailments, including fatigue, heartdigestiveneurological disorders, appendicitis, cognitive problems, depression, anxiety â€” are today recognised as differential symptoms of malaria. Left untreated they sometimes lead to organ failure and death.|$|E

5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning</b> in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 he {{embarked}} upon {{a series}} of drawings and watercolours of Hyde Park, which were due to be exhibited in London. Hunter hoped {{to move to the}} city permanently, as he found it livelier than Glasgow and the art market was more secure. However, his health deteriorated and he began to suffer badly from stomach pains. He died in Glasgow in the Claremont Nursing Home on 7 December 1931, aged 54. The cause of death was cardiac failure due to <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning,</b> following an unsuccessful gall bladder operation. A member of Glasgow Art Club, work by Hunter was included in the club's Memorial Exhibition of 1935, in memory of those of its members who had died since the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning.</b> Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than to say he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1870s, as {{a member}} of the Coroner's jury in New York, Dr. Hamilton agreed with Dr. William A. Hammond in that {{hydrophobia}} was a disease of the nerve centers and not a <b>blood</b> <b>poison.</b> In 1874, he read a paper, entitled Suicide in Large Cities, with Reference to Certain Sanitary Conditions which tend to Prevent its Moral and Physical Causes at the Health Congress of the American Public Health Association in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] In his paper, he argued that suicides were more strongly felt in metropolitan areas due to the use of intoxicating drinks or narcotics, nervous disease, seduction, immoral habits, and disappointment.|$|R

50|$|In most cases, vampires {{were able}} to heal {{themselves}} from minor injuries within a very brief period of time. Some vampires, such as Count Dracula, could heal from severe burns or broken bones within the span of a few hours, whereas most other vampires might require several days to heal exactly the same injury. Vampires {{were not able to}} regenerate missing organs or severed portions of their anatomy, with the exception of hair and skin. Apart from periodic inconveniences, injuries like these would not critically impair a vampire's effectiveness. Because the ichor was similar in function to <b>blood,</b> <b>poisons</b> and other toxic substances that were circulated in its bloodstream would adversely affect a vampire, although no dosage was large enough to cause death.|$|R
5|$|The Capitol {{has also}} been witness to murder and death. Rep. William P. Taulbee had been a congressman from Kentucky from 1884 to 1888. Charles E. Kincaid, a {{journalist}} for The Louisville Times, had accused Taulbee of adultery and involvement in a Patent Office scandal, which had ruined Taulbee's political career. On February 28, 1890, the ex-congressman and the reporter ran into {{one another in the}} Capitol, and Taulbee assaulted and embarrassed Kincaid by tweaking the much smaller man's nose. Kincaid ran home, grabbed a pistol, and, when he encountered Taulbee on a marble staircase leading from the House chamber down to the dining room, shot him in the face just below Taulbee's left eye. Taulbee died two weeks later, and Kincaid was acquitted after claiming self-defense. Journalists and others claim that whenever a reporter slips on these steps, Taulbee's ghost briefly appears. Former President and then-Rep. John Quincy Adams suffered a stroke at his desk in the House chamber on February 21, 1848, and was taken into the Speaker's Room. His physical condition was too precarious to permit him to be moved, and he died at the Capitol two days later. Many people claim to have heard Adams' ghost denouncing slavery late at night in National Statuary Hall, and one Congressional staff member claims that by standing in the spot where Adams' desk once stood a person can still hear the former president's ghostly whisper. James A. Garfield {{was a member of the}} House from 1863 to 1881 before assuming the Presidency in March 1881. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau, a disgruntled office seeker, on July 2, 1881, at 9:30a.m. as he walked through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington, D.C. Garfield died of heart failure brought about by <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning</b> (itself caused by poor medical care) on September 19, 1881, while recuperating at a beach house near Long Branch, New Jersey. Witnesses have seen Garfield's specter walking solemnly through the halls of Congress.|$|E

5000|$|Married {{for centuries}} and now living {{half a world}} apart, two vampires wake as the sun goes down. Adam sits holding a lute, in his {{cluttered}} Detroit Victorian, as Eve wakes up in her bedroom in Tangier, surrounded by books. Rather than feeding on humans, they are like addicts, dependent on local suppliers of the [...] "good stuff" [...] because they fear contamination from <b>blood</b> <b>poisoned</b> by the degradation of the environment. Adam visits a local blood bank {{in the dead of}} night, masquerading as [...] "Dr. Faust", paying [...] "Dr. Watson" [...] for his coveted O negative, while Eve relies on their old friend Christopher Marlowe, who faked his death in 1593 and now lives under the protection of a local man.|$|R

50|$|She {{assaulted}} Lady Death's fortress in Oblivion, {{but after}} a long battle she was stabbed through the heart with the Scythe, degenerating into a pool of blood. Armageddon resurrected her with his power and took her as a servant, ordering her to kill Lady Death. She attacked Lady Death's forces and then sneaked off to attack Armageddon, her plan all along to steal his blood and power. The raw energy and chaotic power in his <b>blood</b> <b>poisoned</b> her, and she collapsed unconscious. Nightmare was taken from her and used to attack Armageddon. He died, but in a final act of defiance unleashed an Uncreation Wave to destroy everything in the cosmos. The effect of the Wave was altered by Mitchell Wardlow, who managed {{to use it to}} create eight different parallel universes. Purgatori recovered just in time to be swallowed by the Uncreation Wave.|$|R
25|$|At {{about the}} time this {{expedition}} was initiated, an ongoing feud between Gwinnett and the commander of Georgiaâ€™s Continental troops, General Lachlan McIntosh, resulted in a duel in which both parties were wounded.

60|$|It {{was a time}} of {{stubborn}} {{effort and}} crushing strain. Some of the men were sick and all had lost their vigor. The fierce sun had not burned but bleached their skin; their <b>blood</b> was <b>poisoned</b> by the miasma the land breeze blew off at night.

25|$|The aerobic {{bacteria}} found in poultry housing can {{include not only}} E. coli, but Staphylococcus, Pseudomona, Micrococcus and others as well. These contaminants can contribute to dust that often cause issues with the respiratory systems of both the poultry and humans working in the environment.

5000|$|Thomas Wayne is alluded in Batman: Arkham City. The Monarch Theatre (the {{site of the}} Wayne murders) is {{featured}} in Arkham City. Near the gates of Ra's al Ghul's hideout, Batman collapses {{from the effects of}} the Joker's <b>blood</b> <b>poison</b> and sees a vision of his parents in front of a light, imploring their son to come into it and reunite with them. However, Batman shrugs it off and continues on. If the player visits the site of the murder, Batman discovers a pair of chalk outlines resembling his parents' bodies, as well as a bouquet of flowers and a tape recording from Hugo Strange, taunting the Dark Knight. The player then has the option to [...] "pay respect" [...] to the site, causing Batman to kneel at the site for a time. The Waynes' murders is also briefly mentioned in one of the Penguin's interview tapes during which Penguin tells Strange of being overjoyed after hearing the Waynes had been murdered, revealing hatred of the Wayne family due mainly to the Cobblepot family's long standing feud with the Wayne family.|$|R
50|$|Organophosphate {{poisoning}} occurs {{most commonly}} as a suicide attempt in farming {{areas of the}} developing world and less commonly by accident. Exposure can be from drinking, breathing in the vapors, or skin exposure. The underlying mechanism involves the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), leading to the buildup of acetylcholine (ACh) in the body. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and can be confirmed by measuring butyrylcholinesterase activity in the <b>blood.</b> Carbamate <b>poisoning</b> can present similarly.|$|R
25|$|With fan {{frustration}} {{after the}} McFarland match, a rematch was arranged for 4 July, with Welsh facing just one {{opponent in the}} {{four and a half}} months between the bouts, Phil Brock. Welsh was meant to fight Dick Hyland, but <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning</b> to the Welshman's hand meant the Hyland fight did not take place. The Brock encounter, held at Vernon, California, was Welsh's first 25-round bout and ended in a terribly one-sided victory with a plucky Brock losing on points.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Moss {{became ill}} with <b>blood</b> <b>poisoning.</b> The illness {{required}} him to travel to San Francisco for treatment.
