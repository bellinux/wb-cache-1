5|$|A {{warm front}} can produce snow for a period, as warm, moist air {{overrides}} below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to {{rain in the}} warm sector <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by units from a Volkswagen Golf mounted <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E
5|$|During wartime, Swift {{became a}} special constable with {{responsibility}} for traffic control. He was enrolled in the RAF, and travelled to France after the Invasion of Normandy, but was stationed well <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line and did not see combat. This did not prevent risk to his life, however, as in 1944 a Dakota on which he was a passenger {{was involved in a}} near miss.|$|E

5|$|The SAR {{task force}} mission leader, Capt. Fred Boli in Sandy 01, called the rescue {{off for the}} time being because it was too dangerous. The {{remaining}} aircraft exited to the south across the Song Meiu Giang. The area was just too hot.

The North Vietnamese, alerted by the American's intense efforts to find the navigator, increased their efforts to find Hambleton.|$|E
5|$|The Zara class carried {{three times}} the armor {{protection}} of the preceding Trentos. Their heavy armor made the Zaras the best-protected cruisers until {{the introduction of the}} , laid down in 1945 by the United States. This additional armor would have made the ships decidedly nose-heavy, so to offset this the rear of the ship was raised by one deck <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> funnel. The result was excellent watertight integrity and protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} triarii {{were reduced to}} 600 per legion, forming 10 maniples of 60 men each. The triarii still made up the third line in the legion, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line of hastati and the second line of principes, but the rorarii and accensi were phased out. Leves had been {{replaced}} with velites, who had a similar role but were also attached to principes and triarii.|$|E

5|$|On 11 May, with Chinese forces {{slackening}} their offensive, 3rd Ranger Company was recalled to Kimpo Airfield for parachute proficiency training, {{above the}} objections of the 3rd Infantry Division commanders who considered the company invaluable. The company spent several weeks in division reserve, and undertook various missions such as convoy security and guarding command posts, as well as surveillance and visiting patrols <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines. In one of these rearguard actions, the Rangers evacuated a rundown village only to have {{one member of the}} unit, Corporal Dave Rauls, captured by three Chinese infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1972, the Easter Offensive, {{the largest}} {{combined}} arms {{operation of the}} entire Vietnam War, was in its third day. An early morning flight of two United States Air Force EB-66 aircraft was led by Bat 20, piloted by Lt. Col. Robert Singletary. Hambleton was a navigator aboard Bat 21. The two aircraft were escorting a cell of three B-52s. Bat 21 was configured to gather signals intelligence, including identifying North Vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming. Bat 21 was destroyed by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile and Hambleton was the only survivor, parachuting <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines into a battlefield filled with thousands of North Vietnamese Army soldiers.|$|E

Biroul A.

5|$|Trautmann {{joined the}} Luftwaffe as a radio {{operator}} in 1941. During training, he showed little aptitude for radio work, {{and transferred to}} Spandau to become a Fallschirmjäger (paratrooper). He served first in Occupied Poland, though being stationed far <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line resulted in boredom for his regiment, which resorted to sports and practical jokes to pass the time. One such practical joke involving a car backfired on Trautmann, resulting in a staff sergeant burning his arms. Trautmann was court-martialled, and received a three-month prison sentence. At {{the start of his}} confinement, Trautmann came down with acute appendicitis, and spent the remainder of his sentence in a military hospital.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the random {{approximate}} travelling wave solutions of the stochastic KPP equations. Two new {{properties of the}} stochastic KPP equations are obtained. We prove the ergodicity that for almost all sample paths, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wave <b>front</b> x = γt, the lower limit of 1 ∫ t t 0 u(s, x) ds as t →∞is positive, and ahead of <b>the</b> wave <b>front,</b> <b>the</b> limit is zero. In some cases, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wave <b>front,</b> <b>the</b> limit of 1 ∫ t t 0 u(s, x) ds as t →∞exists and is positive almost surely. We also prove that <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wave <b>front,</b> for almost each ω, the solution of some special stochastic KPP equations converges to a stationary trajectory of the corresponding stochastic differential equation. In front of wave <b>front,</b> <b>the</b> solution converges to 0 which is another stationary trajectory of the corresponding SDE. We also study the space derivative of the solution for large time. We show that away from <b>the</b> wave <b>front,</b> for almost all large t the solution is flat in the x-direction for almost all sample paths. ...|$|R

5|$|Australia also formed {{small-scale}} raiding and reconnaissance forces, most {{of which}} were grouped together as the Allied Intelligence Bureau. Z Special Unit conducted raids far <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, including a successful raid on Singapore in September 1943. M Special Unit, coastwatchers and smaller AIB units also operated behind Japanese lines to collect intelligence. AIB parties were often used to support Australian Army units and were assigned to inappropriate tasks such as tactical reconnaissance and liaison. AIB missions in Timor and Dutch New Guinea were also hampered by being placed under the command of unpopular Dutch colonial administrators. The RAAF formed a specially-equipped unit (No.200Flight) in 1945 to support these operations by transporting and supplying AIB parties in areas held by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, Baker was {{transferred}} to the 13th Aero Squadron after its commander, Captain Charles Biddle, requested that he join the squadron as a flight commander. Though reluctant to leave the 103rd, Baker felt that Biddle would not have requested him without confidence in his abilities. On July 20, the 13th Squadron recorded its first confirmed kill during a flight led by Baker; he and two other men shot down a German plane. In August, Baker and another pilot were promoted and given command of their own squadron; Baker was given charge of the 141st Aero Squadron, composed of 26 pilots and 180 enlisted men stationed <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, where they had to wait for equipment to arrive before leaving for the front.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E

5|$|In {{this type}} of new Roman legion, the 900 triarii formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each, which were in turn part of 15 , larger units {{made up of a}} maniple of triarii, a maniple of rorarii and a maniple of accensi. The triarii stood in the third line of the legion, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line of hastati and the second line of principes, and in front of the rorarii and accensi. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin-armed skirmishers who were attached to maniples of hastati, would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire and cover the advance of the hastati, spear armed infantry.|$|E
