5|$|In 1975, a {{study found}} no fish {{species on the}} creek. However, brook trout have been {{observed}} at seven locations on Solomon Creek. Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run. Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes-Barre. Above of the South Wilkes-Barre <b>borehole,</b> {{a number of other}} fish species have been observed. These include eastern blacknose dace, bluegill, creek chub, fallfish, minnows, northern hog sucker, and white sucker. However, there are no species of fish downstream of the <b>borehole.</b> Out of 46 sites on the creek, 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout. 2.6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries. This area is in Hanover Township, Laurel Run, and Bear Creek Township.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company Ltd was {{established}} by a private Act of Parliament in 1853 to provide water to the residents of Cambridge and the surrounding area; by 1976, the population served had risen to approximately 275,000. With the rising demand, the company purchased a <b>borehole</b> outside Sawston, constructing pumping equipment and integrating the water from that <b>borehole</b> into their system in 1979. Tests undertaken both before the purchase, and in 1979, had demonstrated that the water was safe for public consumption. During the late 1970s, concerns were expressed {{about the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, and as a result a European Directive was issued in 1980 requiring nations of the European Community to establish maximum acceptable levels of PCE in water; the United Kingdom did this in 1982. PCE was discovered in the borehole; it was not tested for earlier because {{there was no need to}} regulate the levels. As a result, the Cambridge Water Company was forced to cease pumping the water, and instead find a new <b>borehole</b> elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company were {{a company}} {{responsible}} for providing potable water to the inhabitants of Cambridge and the surrounding areas. In 1976, they purchased a <b>borehole</b> outside Sawston to deal with rising demand. In 1980, a European Directive was issued requiring nations of the European Community to establish standards {{on the presence of}} perchloroethene (PCE) in water, which the United Kingdom did in 1982. It was found that the Sawston <b>borehole</b> was contaminated with PCE that had originated in a tannery owned by Eastern Counties Leather. Prior to 1980, there was no knowledge that PCE should be avoided or that it could cause harm, but the Cambridge Water Company brought a case against Eastern Counties Leather anyway.|$|E

5|$|Drilling {{boreholes}} {{through the}} Hamilton Group shales in the subsurface can be problematic. The Marcellus has {{a relatively low}} density, and these shales may not be chemically compatible with some drilling fluids. The shale is relatively fragile, and may fracture under pressure, causing a problem in circulating the drilling fluid back up through the <b>borehole</b> known as lost circulation. The formation may also be under-pressurized, further complicating the drilling process.|$|E

40|$|Circular to subcircular <b>boreholes</b> {{were found}} on the {{surfaces}} of three different bivalve shells (Mactra chinensis, Felaniella usta, and Nuttallia japonica) that were pushed onto the sand beach at Sagot Cape, Baengnyeongdo, Korea. The <b>boreholes</b> are characterized by beveled holes that are parabolic in cross section. The <b>boreholes</b> are classified into the ichnospecies Oichnus paraboloides, probably drilled by a naticid gastropod Glossaulax didyma didyma living in the Baengnyeong tidal flat. In the case of Mactrashells, <b>boreholes</b> are observed more or less evenly on left and right valves, and 96 % of <b>boreholes</b> are located on the umbo. This may suggest that the life position of the Baengnyeong bivalves did not dictate the preference of G. Â didyma didyma in the Baengnyeong tidal flat ecosystem. The clustered distribution of the <b>boreholes</b> in the umbo area indicates a strong site selectivity for <b>boreholes</b> that is quite a common phenomenon in many naticid gastropods.

5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and <b>borehole</b> mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined {{typically}} contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% uranium oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E

5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign <b>borehole,</b> encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company {{brought a}} case against Eastern Counties Leather in the High Court of Justice, wanting £1 million in damages {{for the cost of}} finding a new <b>borehole</b> and an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to decontaminate the original one, and an injunction to prevent any more use of PCE. They argued that Eastern Counties Leather were liable in three ways; first, in negligence, second, in nuisance, and third, under the rule developed in Rylands v Fletcher. The case came before Kennedy J, who dismissed all three of the Company's claims. On the matter of negligence, he held that the damage had to be reasonably foreseeable, as was required under Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd; he applied this same test to the claim under nuisance. Applying the case of Hughes v Lord Advocate, Kennedy found that the harm was not reasonably foreseeable, and both actions under nuisance and negligence must fail.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water {{and the quality of the}} aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new <b>borehole</b> water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of the lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{the lake}} was fed by the River Westbourne {{entering}} at the Italian Garden at the north-western end of the Long Water. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the river had become polluted, and so water was then pumped from the Thames. The water is now supplied by three boreholes drilled into the Upper Chalk. The first <b>borehole</b> {{is located at the}} Italian Gardens, the second at the Diana Memorial and the third, drilled in 2012 to a depth of 132m, is within 50m of the Diana Memorial. The Long Water runs south-east from this point to Serpentine Bridge, where the lake curves to the east, following the natural contours of the land. At the eastern end, water flows out of the lake via a sluice in the dam, forming a small ornamental waterfall at the Dell. The outflow has not historically maintained the waterfall, and re-circulation pumps were installed in the Dell, below the dam, to sustain this feature. The restoration work in 2012 restored the flows into the Serpentine and this waterfall is now restored as originally designed. Historically the river flowed due south from this point, marking the boundary between Westminster and Kensington, but since 1850 it has been diverted into a culvert, running underground to reach the Thames near Chelsea Bridge.|$|E
