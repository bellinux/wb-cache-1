40|$|To {{compensate}} for the poor quality of thick-plate blanking parts in cross-section, this paper suggests using the optimizing bilateral ring gear holder parameters to increase burnish zone and improve cutting precision. With the <b>bilateral</b> <b>gear</b> ring, the hydrostatic pressure of shear deformation zone will increase, plasticity of the material will be lifted to maximum {{and quality of the}} cross section will be raised. This paper establishes 8 mm AISI- 1020 fine blanking model by DEFORM 2 D, analysis different ring gear parameters and clearance that are influenced the stress-strain and cross section quality to predict forming defects. By using the <b>bilateral</b> <b>gear</b> ring blank holder, the poor quality of thick-plate blanking section is successfully enhanced. Therefore, the <b>bilateral</b> <b>gear</b> ring blank holder is vital {{to improve the quality of}} blanking parts and provide the reliable theory basis for the practical engineering application...|$|E
