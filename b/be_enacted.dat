5|$|The Amar {{brothers}} {{noted that}} such a plan could <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> by the passage of laws in as few as eleven states and would probably not require Congressional approval, though this is not certain (see Debate above).|$|E
5|$|Following Mark Warner's {{withdrawal}} from the race in October, Bayh looked to gain {{the most in the}} field of candidates. He immediately began to call former Warner supporters, hoping they would support his campaign. During a visit to New Albany, Indiana, the candidate called for the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to <b>be</b> <b>enacted.</b> Later in the month, he made a stop in Nevada to discuss senior issues with Nevada's gubernatorial candidate Dina Titus.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{political}} parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished. In its manifesto for the 2011 general election, the Workers' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws, which allow arrests and detention without trial only under strict conditions, should <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> to replace the ISA. The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013.|$|E

50|$|The Illinois Department of Revenue has {{increased}} in size {{in line with the}} creation of new taxes within the state and the expansion of existing taxes. A gasoline tax <b>was</b> <b>enacted</b> in Illinois in 1927, the sales tax <b>was</b> <b>enacted</b> in 1933; the state income tax <b>was</b> <b>enacted</b> in 1969, and the first lottery tickets were sold in 1974.|$|R
5|$|After the Convention of 1901–02, the General Assembly did {{not call}} another general {{convention}} in the twentieth century. Two proposals for constitutional amendment since the 1960s {{that might have been}} passed by the General Assembly and sent to the voters for ratification referendum have failed to <b>be</b> <b>enacted,</b> but both remain current topics of periodic political discussion. Virginia remains the only state to ban governors serving consecutive terms, and it is only one of two states still selecting both trial and appellate judges by the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} decree, the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The decree {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the decree was likely to <b>be</b> <b>enacted,</b> prices probably would have risen.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, President Bush {{signed into}} law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal {{legislation}} to <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> with Obama as its primary sponsor. In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was {{signed into law}} in September 2007. Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections, and the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.|$|E
50|$|In {{subsequent}} years, other discriminatory laws <b>were</b> <b>enacted.</b> Quotas <b>were</b> <b>enacted</b> {{limiting the}} number of Jews admitted to high schools and universities to their percentage of the general population.|$|R
50|$|The Contact Lens Practitioner's Act <b>was</b> <b>enacted</b> in 1995. This was {{the first}} ever optometry related {{legislation}} in Singapore. This Act <b>was</b> <b>enacted</b> {{in response to the}} surge of contact lens related complications from the rising popularity of wearing contact lenses then. After the Act <b>was</b> <b>enacted,</b> only registered Contact Lens Practitioners can practice contact lens. Qualified optometrists were also able to register to practice contact lens in Singapore.|$|R

5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1946, Novikov {{submitted}} to Stalin plans that would {{lay the groundwork}} for the modern Soviet air force and the industry that would supply it. On April 22, 1946, however, before these could <b>be</b> <b>enacted,</b> Novikov was stripped of his rank and titles and then arrested. The reason for this was that at the Potsdam conference it was discovered that the United States had better spy planes than the Soviet Union. He was interrogated and tortured the next day and again between May 4 and May 8, 1946 by Lavrentiy Beria before being forced to read a confession to the Politburo implicating Marshal Zhukov. Novikov was tried by the Military Collegium and sentenced to fifteen years in a labor camp.|$|E
5|$|The first formal {{scientific}} {{description of}} the common stingray, as Raja pastinaca, was authored by the father of taxonomy Carl Linnaeus in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae. It has since been placed in the genus Dasyatis. There are at least 25 earlier references to this ray in literature, under various non-binomial names such as Raja corpore glabro, aculeo longo anterius serrato in cauda apterygia, Pastinaca marina prima, and Pastinaca marina lævis. Many of these early accounts, including Linnaeus', also incorporated information from other species. Consequently, the designation of a lectotype is warranted {{in the interests of}} taxonomic stability, but this has yet to <b>be</b> <b>enacted.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tuition {{programs}} that <b>were</b> <b>enacted</b> {{at the state}} level in the late 1960s and early 1970s did not survive legal challenges. However, later initiatives for students in poorly performing school districts <b>were</b> <b>enacted</b> and survived legal challenges.|$|R
5000|$|To Johnson, {{the first}} {{question}} was whether the Kentucky acts were constitutional. If constitutional, which act should be applied? [...] The suit was filed after the legislation of 1797 <b>was</b> <b>enacted,</b> but before the legislation of 1812 <b>was</b> <b>enacted.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SSA <b>was</b> <b>enacted</b> {{to replace}} the Social Security Act 1947. In 1999, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 <b>was</b> <b>enacted,</b> in which the {{provisions}} in the SSA concerning the administration of social security payments were split into a separate Act.|$|R
5|$|Although Jinnah {{initially}} opposed separate electorates for Muslims, he {{used this}} means to gain his first elective office in 1909, as Bombay's Muslim representative on the Imperial Legislative Council. He was a compromise candidate when two older, better-known Muslims who were seeking the post deadlocked. The council, {{which had been}} expanded to 60 members as part of reforms enacted by Minto, recommended legislation to the Viceroy. Only officials could vote in the council; non-official members, such as Jinnah, had no vote. Throughout his legal career, Jinnah practised probate law (with many clients from India's nobility), and in 1911 introduced the Wakf Validation Act to place Muslim religious trusts on a sound legal footing under British Indian law. Two years later, the measure passed, the first act sponsored by non-officials to pass the council and <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> by the Viceroy. Jinnah was also appointed to a committee which helped to establish the Indian Military Academy in Dehra Dun.|$|E
5|$|General Lucius Fairchild, the United States consul at Liverpool, {{wrote to}} his {{government}} recommending that the gallantry of the Englishmen {{who were involved in}} the rescue effort be recognised. The Secretary of State supported his recommendation and the United States Congress moved to award the newly instituted Lifesaving Medal to the lifeboat men. However, a delay of 17 months followed during which a change in legislation had to <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> to allow the medals to be issued to non-US nationals. Finally in 1877, the United States government awarded first-class Gold Lifesaving Medals to the twenty-seven men of the Mersey Docks and New Brighton RNLI lifeboat station who survived the incident, while the families of the three deceased lifeboat men were awarded a sum of $200.00 in gold in lieu of a medal. The medals were conferred in a public ceremony in Liverpool Town Hall on 27 February 1877.|$|E
5|$|Players {{may only}} be {{transferred}} during transfer windows that are set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from {{the last day of}} the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis. As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances. This was to enable the 'home grown' rule to <b>be</b> <b>enacted,</b> whereby the League would also from 2010 require at least 8 of the named 25 man squad to be made up of 'home-grown players'.|$|E
50|$|Some {{portions}} of the United States Code have <b>been</b> <b>enacted</b> as positive law and other portions have not <b>been</b> so <b>enacted.</b> In case of a conflict between {{the text of the}} Statutes at Large and the text of a provision of the United States Code that has not <b>been</b> <b>enacted</b> as positive law, the text of the Statutes at Large takes precedence.|$|R
50|$|No {{legislation}} {{based on}} the LRCC's recommendations <b>were</b> <b>enacted</b> during the first ten years of the Commission's existence. The Commission did not issue a final report until its fifth year. Finally, in 1983, legislation <b>was</b> <b>enacted</b> that implemented one of its reports.|$|R
50|$|The High Court judged 108 persons (including 106 Ministers). In total {{the courts}} {{investigated}} more than 300,000 people, classifying 180,000 of them without any indictment, and finally fewer than 800 executions <b>were</b> <b>enacted.</b> Three successive general amnesties <b>were</b> <b>enacted,</b> in 1947, 1951 and 1953.|$|R
5|$|When the Indiana Territory {{was first}} created, no {{provision}} was {{allowed for the}} creation of popularly elected government. Congress granted the President power to appoint a General Court to serve as a legislative and judicial branch of the territorial government. The court consisted of five members, and the President delegated the task of choosing the members to the Governor of the territory. This remained the form of government until 1805 when Congress granted the territory the right to legalize slavery if they so choose. In doing so, they removed the court's legislative powers, leaving it with only judicial authority, but still to be appointed by the President through the Governor. The formation of a new legislative council was approved and each county in the territory was granted the right to elect one representative to it. The council had the authority to pass laws, but they all had to be approved by the Governor before they could <b>be</b> <b>enacted.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{period has}} also been used {{in a wide range}} of popular culture. William Shakespeare's plays on the lives of the medieval kings have proved to have had long lasting appeal, heavily {{influencing}} both popular interpretations and histories of figures such as King John and Henry V. Other playwrights have since taken key medieval events, such as the death of Thomas Becket, and used them to draw out contemporary themes and issues. The medieval mystery plays continue to <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> in key English towns and cities. Film-makers have drawn extensively on the medieval period, often taking themes from Shakespeare or the Robin Hood ballads for inspiration. Historical fiction set in England during the Middle Ages remains persistently popular, with the 1980s and 1990s seeing a particular growth of historical detective fiction. The period has also inspired fantasy writers, including J. R. R. Tolkien's stories of Middle-earth. English medieval music was revived from the 1950s, with choral and musical groups attempting to authentically reproduce the original sounds. Medieval living history events were first held during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the period has inspired a considerable community of historical re-enactors, part of England's growing heritage industry.|$|E
5|$|With {{the merger}} of Tanganyika and Zanzibar on 23 April, there were {{concerns}} that the Umma Party would stage a coup; Operation Shed was designed to provide for intervention should this happen. Shed would have required a battalion of troops, with scout cars, to be airlifted to the island to seize the airfield and protect Karume's government. However, the danger of a revolt over unification soon passed, and on 29 April the troops earmarked for Shed were reduced to 24 hours' notice. Operation Finery was cancelled the same day. Concern over a possible coup remained though, and around 23 September Shed was replaced with Plan Giralda, involving the use of British troops from Aden and the Far East, to <b>be</b> <b>enacted</b> if the Umma Party attempted to overthrow President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. An infantry battalion, tactical headquarters unit and elements of the Royal Marines would have been shipped to Zanzibar to launch an amphibious assault, supported by follow-on troops from British bases in Kenya or Aden to maintain law and order. Giralda was scrapped in December, ending British plans for military intervention in the country.|$|E
