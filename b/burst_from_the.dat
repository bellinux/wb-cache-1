The RF noise <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lightning makes the initial part of the open channel unusable and the ionization disappears quickly because of recombination at low altitude and high atmospheric pressure.

Both Spannochi and the wounded Marcognet became prisoners. Having lost five cannon, Kollowrat decided to suspend his drive until Latour and Riesch came up on his flanks. Anxious about his open left flank, he sent two grenadier battalions back in search of Riesch's column.|$|E
25|$|Ireland is then {{uninhabited}} for 300 years, until {{a second}} group of people arrive. They are led by Partholón, who is descended from Noah through Magog. They sail to Ireland via Gothia, Anatolia, Greece, Sicily and Iberia. They include Partholón’s wife Delgnat, their four chieftain sons, and others. When they arrive, {{there is only one}} open plain, three lakes and nine rivers. They clear four more plains and a further seven lakes <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground. Named figures are credited with introducing cattle husbandry, ploughing, cooking, dwellings, trade, and dividing the island in four. They battle and defeat the mysterious Fomorians, who are led by Cichol Gricenchos. Eventually, Partholón and his people (now 5,000 men and 4,000 women) die of plague in a single week. Only one man, Tuan mac Cairill, survives. Like Fintán, he lives for centuries in a number of forms, so that he can recount Irish history.

25|$|On 14 June 1807, Marchand led his {{division}} at the Battle of Friedland. Ney's corps formed the right flank, hidden in the Sortlack Wood. At 5:30 PM, Emperor Napoleon ordered a 20-gun battery to fire a salvo, signalling Ney to attack Bennigsen's left flank. As the VI Corps <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> forest, Marchand took position on the right while Bisson formed to his left. Sweeping Russian light troops before him, Marchand diverged slightly {{to the right to}} push his opponents into the river. This opened a gap between the two divisions, which Russian cavalry tried to exploit. With the help of Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg's cavalry, the enemy horsemen were dispersed. As Ney's troops advanced, they were enfiladed from the opposite bank of the river by a storm of cannon fire. As the soldiers hesitated, Bennigsen hurled a mass of cavalry at Bisson's left flank, causing Ney's corps to recoil. However, Claude Perrin Victor's I Corps arrived to beat back the Russians. This gave Ney and his officers time to rally the VI Corps and repulse the Russian Imperial Guard. At 8:30 PM, the troops of Marchand and Bisson seized Friedland itself.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{repetitive}} X-ray <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> accretion-powered pulsar GRO J 1744 − 28 show {{similarities to}} the type II X-ray <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rapid Burster. Several authors (notably Lewin et al.) have suggested that <b>the</b> <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> GRO J 1744 − 28 are type II <b>bursts</b> (which arise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sudden release of gravitational potential energy). In this paper, we present another similarity between these sources. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of GRO J 1744 − 28 show that at least 10 out of 94 bursts are followed by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) with frequencies of ∼ 0. 4 Hz. The period of the oscillations decreases over their ∼ 30 – 80 s lifetime, and they occur during a spectrally hard “shoulder ” (or “plateau”) which follows the burst. In one case the QPO show a modulation envelope which resembles simple beating between two narrow-band oscillations at ∼ 0. 325 and ∼ 0. 375 Hz. Using EXOSAT observations, Lubin et al. found QPO with frequencies of 0. 039 to 0. 056 Hz following 10 out of 95 type II <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Rapid Burster. As in GRO J 1744 − 28 the period of these oscillations decreased over their ∼ 100 s lifetime, and they occurred only during spectrally hard “humps ” in the persistent emission. Even though the QPO frequencies differ {{by a factor of}} ∼ 10, we believe that this is further evidence that a similar accretion disk instability is responsible for <b>the</b> type II <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> these two sources.
