40|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus antennatus (Risso, 1816) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea. Monthly samplings of <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> from June 2006 to May 2007 were landed by the trawl fleet in two northwest Sicilian fishing harbours (San Vito Lo Capo and Terrasini). The carapace length (CL) frequency distribution of females ranged between 15. 00 and 59. 00 mm, whereas male CLs ranged between 17. 00 and 34. 00 mm. The estimated parameters of the Von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) for San Vito lo Capo females and males were: CL∞ = 65 mm, K = 0. 58 y− 1 and CL∞ = 41 mm, K = 0. 71 y− 1, respectively; while for Terrasini females and males these were: CL∞ = 69 mm, K = 0. 65 y− 1 and CL∞ = 37 mm, K = 0. 8 y− 1, respectively. In this study, we update the information on stock structure and growth parameters of the <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> in two northwest Sicilian fishing grounds and compare these results with other data recorded in the Mediterranean Basin...|$|E

40|$|The 2 nd International Symposium on Submarine Canyons (INCISE 2014), 29 th September- 1 st October 2014, Edinburgh. [...] 1 pageThe {{offshore}} {{displacement of}} commercial bottom trawling has {{raised concerns about}} the impact of this fishing practice on the deep seafloor. This study focuses on the analysis of sediment accumulation rates from sediment cores collected along the axes of La Fonera (Palamós), Arenys, Besòs and Foix submarine canyons, distributed along the Catalan margin (northwestern Mediterranean), where an intensive bottom trawl fishery has been active during several decades. 210 Pb chronology, occasionally supported by 137 Cs dating, indicates a rapid increase of sediment accumulation rates since the 1970 s, in coincidence with a strong impulse in the industrialization of the trawling fleets of this region. Such increase has been associated to the enhanced delivery of sediment resuspended by trawlers towards the canyon¿s interior and to the rapid technical development at that time, in terms of engine power and gear size. This change has been observed in La Fonera Canyon at depths greater than 1700 m, while in the other canyons it is restricted to shallower regions (~ 1000 m in depth) closer to fishing grounds. Two sampling sites from La Fonera and Foix submarine canyons that exhibited high sediment accumulation rates (0. 6 ¿ 0. 7 cm/y) were reoccupied several years after the first chronological analyses. These two new cores reveal a second and more rapid increase of sediment accumulation rates in both canyons occurring circa 2002 and accounting for almost 2 cm/y. This second change {{at the beginning of the}} XXI century has been attributed to a preferential displacement of the trawling fleet towards fishing grounds surrounding submarine canyons (targeting the priced <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> deep-sea <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus antennatus) and also to technical improvements in trawling vessels, presumably related to subsidies and aids provided by the European Commission to the fishing industryPeer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This work, {{framed within}} the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, {{is focused on}} Sardinian {{southern}} continental margins marine habitat mapping. Aim of this thesis is to produce predictive marine habitat mapping, starting from a detailed geomorphologic study integrated with biological and oceanographic data coming both from original direct surveys than from bibliographic data. Underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROV), coupled with multibeam echo-sounder (MBES), enabled to perform interpretative hypothesis validation, controlled sampling and detailed observation of specific mesophotic habitats with noninvasive protocols, which are particularly relevant for habitats of conservation interest. Marine habitat mapping represents the best estimation {{of the distribution of}} habitats in a place and at a particular time, this goal have been focused on target biocoenosis A 4. 26 – “Mediterranean coralligenous communities moderately exposed to hydrodynamic action” and A 4. 713 – “Caves and overhangs with Corallium rubrum”, as defined by EUNIS classification (European Nature Information System), subsequently reunite under the name of Coralligenous Biocoenosis for the mapping of which has been reached a high level of confidence. Principal drivers for seabed habitat distributions include the type of seabed substrate, depth, light availability and the energy of water movements. For the very first time on Sardinian southern margin a multidisciplinary approach has been used to study the relationship between biotic and abiotic components of marine habitats and how seabed morphologic features influences different benthic biocoenosis development styles, geomorphologic characteristics of settlement for substrates could be important factors structuring benthic biodiversity, by affecting sediment accumulation rates, bottom currents and, ultimately, the rates of food supply.

40|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp,</b> Aristeus antennatus, is {{a commercially}} {{important}} crustacean, in the Mediterranean Sea, {{which has been}} listed as a priority species for fishery management. Hypervariable microsatellite markers could be a useful tool to identify genetic stocks among geographically close fishing grounds. Potential microsatellite markers (97) identified from next-generation sequencing of an individual shrimp using a 454 GS Junior Pyrosequencer were tested on a preliminary panel of 15 individuals representing the four worldwide genetic stocks of the species from which 35 polymorphic loci were identified and used to characterize an additional 20 individuals from the Western Mediterranean Sea.

40|$|We {{investigate}} long-term {{changes in}} the Mediterranean marine resources driving the trawl fisheries by analysing fishers ’ perceptions (Traditional Ecological Knowledge, TEK) throughout the Mediterranean Sea during the last 80 years. To this end, we conducted an extended set of interviews with experienced fishers that enabled us to classify species (or taxa) as ‘decreasing ’ or ‘increasing ’ {{both in terms of}} abundance, as well as average size in the catch. The aspect that most clearly emerged in all the investigated areas over time was the notable increase of fishing capacity indicators, such as engine power and fishing depth range. Atlantic mackerel, poor cod, scorpionfishes, striped seabream, and John Dory dem-onstrated a decreasing trend in the fishers ’ perceived abundance, while Mediterranean par-rotfish, common pandora, cuttlefish, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and mullets gave indications of an increasing temporal trend. Although, as a rule, trawler captains did not report any cataclys-mic changes (e. g. extinctions), when they were invited to estimate total catches, a clear de-creasing pattern emerged; this being a notable finding taking into account the steep escalation of fishing efficiency during the past century.

40|$|As {{part of two}} {{research}} projects for analysing bycatch and discards, we quantified catch composition, catch rates, bycatch and discard,, in two important commercial bottom trawl fisheries (crustacean and fish trawls) off the Southern coast of Portugal (Algarve). Stratified sampling by onboard observers took place from February 1999 to March 2001 and {{data were collected from}} 165 tows during 52 fishing trips. Commercial tat-get species included crustaceans: <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Aristeus antennatus), deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), Norway lobster (Nepharops norvegicus); and fishes: scabreams (Diplodus spl). and Pagellus Spp.), horse Mackerels (Trachurus spp.) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius). The trawl fisheries are characterised by considerable amounts of bycatch: 59. 5 % and 80. 4 % of the overall total catch for crustacean and fish trawlers respectively. A total of 255 species were identified, which belonged to 15 classes of organisms (137 vertebrates, 112 invertebrates and algae). Crustacean trawlers had higher bycatch biodiversity. Bony fish (45. 6 % and 37. 8 %) followed by crustaceans (14. 6 % and 11. 5 %) were the dominant bycatch components of both crustacean and fish trawlers respectively. The influence of a number of factors (e. g. depth, fishing gear, tow duration and season) on bycatch and discards is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{variation}} {{at eight}} microsatellite loci was studied in nine {{populations of the}} <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus antennatus to investigate whether distinct stocks {{are present in the}} Western Mediterranean Sea. A high level of gene flow and no evidence of genetic partitioning were discovered. No significant variation was found (FST = 0. 00673, P-value = 0. 067) even when shrimps from exploited and those from deep-water unexploited grounds were compared. No evidence of reduction or expansion of population size in the recent past was found, as indicated by the bottleneck and interlocus g-tests. Our results are consistent with previous studies using mitochondrial gene methods and allozymes, indicating that, for this species, extensive pelagic larval dispersal and adult migration are probably responsible for the genetic homogeneity observed. In particular, due to a different bathymetric distribution of males and females, reported to be associated with different water masses and hence with possible differential dispersal capacity between sexes, the hypothesis of sex-biased dispersal was tested. Mean values of corrected assignment indices and mean relatedness values were higher for males, suggesting that females are the more widely dispersing sex. Molecular assessment of A. antennatus from the Western Mediterranean provides data of biological and evolutionary interest for the successful management of such a highly valuable fishery resource...|$|E

40|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus antennatus and {{the giant}} red shrimp Aristaeomorpha foliacea are among the major {{economic}} resources in the Mediterranean Sea and represent the main target of the western and central Mediterranean deep sea (400 800 m) fisheries. In this paper, data on abundance (both number and biomass) of A. antennatus and A. foliacea resulting from the MEDITS surveys from 1994 to 2004, carried out with common protocols in seven Mediterranean FAO GFCM Geographical Sub Areas (GSAs), have been analyzed using standardized methodologies. Both red shrimps species occur almost exclusively on the “meso bathyal” stratum (500 800 m). The distribution pattern appears quite different for the two species, but no significant trends in density and biomass (neither at geographical nor at temporal level) could be detected. Sardinia shows the highest abundance for both species, although with some local negative tendencies along time. A very high interannual variability was detected in all areas. Comparing the present results to those recorded by Cau et al. in 2002, {{a more or less}} stable status of the deep sea red shrimps stocks was observed, which is not an encouraging finding when considering the reduction in fishing capacity and the management measures adopted by the EU in recent years...|$|E
40|$|Seven target {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs; IUPAC nos. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180) and the {{organochlorine}} pesticides (OCPs) hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its related metabolites (p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDD) were quantified in edible tissues from seven marine species (European hake, red mullet, blue whiting, Atlantic mackerel, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp,</b> European flying squid, and Mediterranean mussel) from the Gulf of Naples {{in the southern}} Tyrrhenian Sea (Italy). PCBs 118, 138, and 153 were the dominant congeners in all the species examined. The concentrations of all PCBs (from not detectable to 15, 427 ng g(- 1) fat weight) exceeded those of all the DDTs (from not detectable to 1, 769 ng g(- 1) fat weight) and HCB (not detectable to 150. 60 ng g(- 1) fat weight) in the samples analyzed. The OCP concentrations were below the maximum residue limits established for fish and aquatic products by the Decreto Ministerale 13 May 2005 in all the samples analyzed; therefore the OCPs in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea species {{are unlikely to be}} a significant health hazard. Conversely, the mean concentrations of PCBs exceeded (greatly in some cases) the current limits (200 ng(- 1) fat weight) set by the European Union for terrestrial foods. Although the manufacture and use of PCBs are banned or highly restricted, these compounds still are important persistent chemical contaminants in the Gulf of Naples...|$|E
40|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus antenantus {{supports}} {{an important}} commercial fishery in the Western Mediterranean, adjacent Atlantic waters and Mozambique Channel (western Indian Ocean). This study investigates its genetic structure by examining {{a total of}} 506 individuals from Mediterranean, Atlantic and Indian Ocean locations. In order to identify putative genetic stocks, sequences from 16 S rDNA (546 bp) and COI (514 bp) genes were used. Genetic diversity, estimated by haplotypic and nucleotidic diversity, was lower in the Western Mediterranean than in samples from other locations. The high haplotypic diversity of the Eastern Mediterranean, Atlantic and Indian Ocean samples reflects the occurrence {{of a number of}} private haplotypes, which are also responsible for significant genetic divergence between these samples and the Western Mediterranean ones. The analysis of mismatch distributions, neutrality tests, and star-like patterns present in the network of haplotypes provided consistent inference of past population expansion in the Western Mediterranean, Atlantic and Mozambique Channel regions.

Being able to trace the seafood to its certified source is vital for guaranteeing that only seafood certified as sustainably caught bears an eco label. This is assured by seafood supply chains´ compliance with a chain of custody standard and by documenting full traceability of the product. This study analyses the traceability performance of a supply chain of a decapod crustacean, <b>blue</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> (A. antennatus, RISSO 1816) in a case study of a harbour in North-Eastern Spain, Palamós. A quality label (“Marca de Garantía de la Gamba de Palamós”) and its chain of custody standard serve as a reference for traceability in this study. The main objective was {{to find out if the}} supply chain was ready for a certification against the MSC Chain of Custody (CoC) Standard. Traceability was examined using Process Mapping and Critical Traceability Point Analysis (CTPA), a combination of the qualitative methods structured interview, observation and documentation analysis. The results show that there are deficiencies that could hamper a potential certification. This is mainly due to a lack of unique identifiers on the traceability documentation, potential origin fraud and undocumented sales. Traceability performance was found to be better at companies with a wider distribution range. While some businesses seem to be ready to get certified, the majority does not. Potential improvements include the implementation of a central traceability model, product packing and organisation of the buyer collective. Recommendations focus on enhanced traceability controls by authorities and fishermen´s association and correct multiplication of commercial labels when splitting occurs. More research about traceability performance of non-industrialised supply chains is needed...|$|E
