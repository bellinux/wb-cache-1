5|$|A {{study of}} nine {{different}} bivalves with widespread distributions in tropical marine waters {{concluded that the}} mussel, Trichomya hirsuta, most nearly reflected in its tissues the level of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn, Co, Ni, and Ag) in its environment. In this species there was a linear relationship between the sedimentary levels and the tissue concentration of all the metals except zinc. In the Persian Gulf, the Atlantic pearl-oyster (Pinctada radiata) is considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> bioindicator of heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> treatment for individuals with depression.

5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and is thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies {{should not be used}} to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant. Finasteride is likely an effective treatment for acne.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} career as a bowling all-rounder. He made his Test debut in 1907, {{primarily}} as a left arm orthodox spinner who was considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> lower-middle order right-hand batsman. As Macartney was initially selected for his flexibility, his position in the batting order was frequently shuffled and he was largely ineffective. His most noteworthy Test contribution in his early career was a match-winning ten wicket haul at Headingley in 1909, before being dropped in the 1910–11 Australian season. It was around this time that Macartney befriended Trumper and began to transform himself from a bowler who batted in a defensive and technically correct manner, into an audacious attacking batsman. He reclaimed his Test position and made his maiden Test century in the same season, before establishing himself as the leading batsman in the team.|$|E
5|$|When Fall Gelb (Case yellow) {{began on}} 10 May 1940, the Stuka helped swiftly neutralise the {{fortress}} of Eben Emael, Belgium. The {{headquarters of the}} commander responsible for ordering {{the destruction of the}} Belgian Army-held bridges along the Albert Canal was stationed in the village of Lanaken (14km/mi to the north). However, the Stuka demonstrated its accuracy when the small building was destroyed by four direct hits. As a result, only one of the three bridges was destroyed, allowing the German Army to rapidly advance in the opening days of the Battle of Belgium. The Ju 87 proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> asset to Army Group B in the Low Countries. In pitched battles against French armoured forces at Hannut and Gembloux Ju 87s effectively neutralised artillery and armour.|$|E
