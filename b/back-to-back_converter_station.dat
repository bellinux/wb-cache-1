40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study about the synchronization {{effects of the}} PWM carrier signals of a <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> for grid connection of Wind Energy Conversion Systems based on Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generators. It is demonstrated {{by means of a}} spectral analysis that, with the proper synchronization of the carrier signals of both the rectifier and inverter stages, the rms value of the current through the DC-link capacitors is greatly reduced. As a result, the number of capacitors needed to build the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> decreases, whereas its life cycle is expanded, so that the Wind Energy Conversion System becomes more cost effective. It is shown that the worst case occurs when the phase difference between both carrier signals is Â±[pi]/ 2, yielding the highest rms value of the DC-link capacitors current. In that case the harmonic with the highest rms value is located at twice the switching frequency. The theoretical analysis is compared with experimental results from a 10 Â kW <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> in order to validate the effects of the carrier signals phase shift on the DC-link capacitors current. <b>Back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> PWM modulator Synchronization of carrier signal Ripple current...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for power flow control between utility and {{microgrid}} through <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converters,</b> which facilitates desired real and reactive power flow between utility and microgrid. In the proposed control strategy, the system can run in two different modes depending on the power requirement in the microgrid. In mode- 1, specified amount of real and reactive power are shared between the utility and the microgrid through the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converters.</b> Mode- 2 is invoked when the power that can be supplied by the DGs in the microgrid reaches its maximum limit. In such a case, {{the rest of the}} power demand of the microgrid has to be supplied by the utility. An arrangement between DGs in the microgrid is proposed to achieve load sharing in both grid connected and islanded modes. The <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converters</b> also provide total frequency isolation between the utility and the microgrid. It is shown that the voltage or frequency fluctuation in the utility side has no impact on voltage or power in microgrid side. Proper relay-breaker operation coordination is proposed during fault along with the blocking of the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converters</b> for seamless resynchronization. Both impedance and motor type loads are considered to verify the system stability. The impact of dc side voltage fluctuation of the DGs and DG tripping on power sharing is also investigated.

40|$|Abstract — A {{comparison}} between a matrix <b>converter</b> and a <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> feeding a passive load {{is presented in}} this paper, {{with the aim of}} determining the converter topology which yields the highest output power per switches number. The comparison has been performed for different values of the output frequency. For each output frequency the load power has been increased until one of the switching devices reaches the maximum thermal stress, so defining the maxi-mum output power of the converter. For this purpose, a sim-plified thermal model has been used to evaluate the junction temperature of the switches {{on the basis of the}} switch losses. An accurate computer model of both converters has been implemented taking into account the modulation laws and the real characteristics of the switching devices.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the control and}} protection of a microgrid that is connected to utility through <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converters.</b> The <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> connection facilitates bidirectional power flow between the utility and the microgrid. These converters can operate in two different modes-one in which a fixed amount of power is drawn from the utility {{and the other in}} which the microgrid power shortfall is supplied by the utility. In the case of a fault in the utility or microgrid side, the protection system should act not only to clear the fault but also to block the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converters</b> such that its dc bus voltage does not fall during fault. Furthermore, a converter internal mechanism prevents it from supplying high current during a fault and this complicates the operation of a protection system. To overcome this, an admittance based relay scheme is proposed, which has an inverse time characteristic based on measured admittance of the line. The proposed protection and control schemes are able to ensure reliable operation of the microgrid...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2013. Major: Electrical/Computer Engineering. Advisor: Ned Mohan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 80 pages. A filter {{is required to}} eliminate the high frequency switching ripple present in the input current of AC/AC pulse-width modulated (PWM) converters. Design of such filters requires an estimation of the higher harmonic components present in various voltages and currents. Due to pulse-width modulation (PWM), the matrix converter generates switched currents at its input and the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> generates switched input voltages which flows distorted currents. This dissertation presents simple closed form analytical expressions for the RMS input current ripple of the matrix converter and RMS input voltage ripple of a DC-link based <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter.</b> The design of DC-link capacitor in a <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> requires the estimation of ripple current flowing through it which is also analytically computed. The expressions evaluated are independent of variation of load frequency, output alignment angle, switching frequency, etc. and {{is a function of}} known parameters like the modulation indices of the converters, the load and its power factor, DC-link voltage, etc. A systematic step-by-step procedure is presented to design various input filter components from the specifications of allowable THD in the grid current, permissible distortion in the input voltage, allowable inverter current ripple and reactive current drawn by filter capacitor. The converters are modeled for the grid frequency component in order to evaluate the design for input power factor, voltage drop across the filter, maximum possible real power transfer, etc. A damping resistance has been designed ensuring minimum ohmic loss. The analytical estimation of the ripple quantities and the proposed design procedure have been validated by simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a laboratory prototype. A comprehensive comparison between the passive filter component requirements of a matrix converter and a DC-link based <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> is studied under different operating conditions.

30|$|The working {{principles}} for the low-frequency disturbance-generating device are summarized as follows. The step-down transformer transfers the medium-voltage to U 1, {{which is the}} working voltage of the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter,</b> and the converter outputs the desired disturbance voltage waveform according to the modulation wave signal. The step-up transformer then transfers the low voltage level disturbance voltage to the medium-voltage level. Finally, the disturbance voltage is realized at the high side of the wind turbine transformer. The grid adaptability test can then be performed. Because of the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter,</b> the wind turbine is completely isolated from network, and so the disturbances cannot affect the voltage at the grid access point.

Due to bulky electrolytic capacitor, the space {{occupied by the}} converter is more. The other disadvantage of <b>back-to-back</b> <b>converter</b> is that at low frequency, the value of output current is low as the current is not equally shared among the switches of the converters.
