5|$|Just {{two years}} after opening, a flood in March 1904 did serious damage to the structure. However, the owners hired the Horseheads Bridge Company, run by the Perkins brothers. They charged $7,000 (1904 USD) to {{complete}} repairs of the bridge. With the reopening of the bridge, and along with the newly constructed Erie Railroad station, a new revitalization came to Skinners Falls and Milanville, including an acid company, creamery, and a dairy company, which helped raise income for the bridge using the $0.22 toll. One company that could not make it is the Skinners' timber rafting, which had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>business</b> for over 140 years. In 1914, J. Skinner was the new owner, but the company was devastated when one of their timber rafts collided with a Myers family-owned ferryboat, killing four. The blame {{was placed on the}} ferry operator. However, along with the tragedy, the lack of riverside forests made it hard for timber rafting to prosper and in 1914, they closed their doors.|$|E

Roosevelt issued an order to {{suppress}} prostitution near military bases—affecting the red-light districts of Reno and Las Vegas. When this order was lifted in 1948, Reno officials tried to shut down a brothel as a public nuisance; this action was upheld by the Nevada Supreme Court in 1949. In 1951, both Reno and Las Vegas had closed their red-light districts as public nuisances, but brothels continued to exist throughout the state.|$|E
25|$|Although Lanying was sorrowful {{about her}} father’s death, she began {{working at the}} age of 60 after the Culture Revolution.

This was a dangerous experiment because the melting point of gallium arsenide is 1238 Celsius degrees. However, she finished successfully and became the first person in the world who had made this experiment successfully. Because of this work in gallium arsenide, the government in China named a gallium arsenide company(Chinese: 中科稼英) after her in 2001. This company has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>business</b> for over than 10 years.|$|E

Each year, the downtown square is adorned with lights and spotlighted during the Denton Holiday Lighting Festival.|$|E

Ole Kirk constructed a larger workshop, and worked towards expanding his business even further. When the Great Depression hit, Ole Kirk had fewer customers and had to focus on smaller projects. He began producing miniature versions of his products as design aids. It was these miniature models of stepladders and ironing boards that inspired him to begin producing toys.|$|E
