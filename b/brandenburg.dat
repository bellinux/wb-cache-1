5|$|In 1611 John Sigismund, Elector of <b>Brandenburg</b> {{was allowed}} by the Commonwealth sejm to inherit the Duchy of Prussia fief, {{after the death of}} Albert Frederick, the last duke of the Prussian Hohenzollern line. The <b>Brandenburg</b> Hohenzollern branch led the Duchy from 1618.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Przemysł II {{concluded}} his first alliance with Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia. At first {{an ally of}} the Margraves of <b>Brandenburg,</b> Mestwin II could expel his brother and uncles from Pomerania and became sole ruler in 1271, but shortly after he was defeated and even imprisoned by them; this caused him to cede the province of Gdańsk to Margrave Conrad of <b>Brandenburg</b> in exchange for aid against his foes. Despite Mestwin II retaining the feudal sovereignty over the territory, the <b>Brandenburg</b> Margraviate still occupied the main castles and fortresses of the city even after the restoration of Mestwin II in the ducal throne. With his knowledge that his forces are too weak against <b>Brandenburg,</b> the Pomeranian Duke decided then to make an alliance with the Greater Poland rulers, Bolesław the Pious (who probably was his first-cousin) and Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Ordered as {{battleship}} A, <b>Brandenburg</b> {{was laid}} down at AG Vulcan in Stettin in May 1890.

Fitting out work followed and was finished, {{with the exception of}} the installation of her guns, by the end of September 1893, when she was transferred to Kiel. There, her guns were mounted, and on 19 November <b>Brandenburg</b> was commissioned into the fleet. Sea trials began four days later; on the first day of trials, Wilhelm II and a delegation from the <b>Brandenburg</b> provincial government came aboard the ship to observe. On 27 December, the ship received a flag bearing the coat of arms of <b>Brandenburg,</b> which was flown on special occasions. At the end of the month, <b>Brandenburg</b> was formally assigned to the II Division of the Maneuver Squadron.|$|E

5|$|<b>Brandenburg</b> changed {{sides in}} return for Polish {{withdrawal}} of claims to Ducal Prussia, declaring Frederick William the sole sovereign in the Duchy with the treaties of Wehlau on 19 September and Bromberg on 6 November.

5|$|In {{reality the}} House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of <b>Brandenburg,</b> had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political expediency, Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the <b>Brandenburg</b> elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with <b>Brandenburg</b> possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able to counteract the growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E

Finally, together with his uncle, his aunt Jolenta, Bishop Mikołaj I of Poznań and other Greater Poland dignitaries the prince went to the border frontier in Drezdenko, where solemnly brought Ludgarda to her new home. The alliance between Greater Poland and Pomerania was directed against <b>Brandenburg</b> and in 1274, resulted {{in more than one}} retaliatory expedition against Greater Poland; taken by surprise, the princes watched how without major obstacles the <b>Brandenburg</b> army came to Poznań, and burned the main fortress of the city.

After the exercises ended, she returned to what was now the Reserve Division of the North Sea, where she conducted further training. In mid-1911, she was transferred to the Training and Experimental Ships Unit, where she participated in training exercises in the Baltic. <b>Brandenburg</b> again temporarily returned to the III Squadron for the fleet maneuvers in August and September, and on 16 October she was again decommissioned. In 1912, she was allocated to the Marinestation der Ostsee, where she remained inactive for the following two years.|$|E
5|$|From 1619 to 1640, George William was elector of <b>Brandenburg</b> and duke of Prussia. He strove, but proved {{unable to}} break the {{dominance}} of the Electorate of Saxony in the Upper Saxon Circle. The Brandenburg-Saxon antagonism rendered the defense of the circle ineffective, and it was subsequently overrun by Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years' War. While George William had claimed neutrality before, the presence of Wallenstein's army forced him to join the Catholic-Imperial camp in the Treaty of Königsberg (1627) and accept garrisons. When the Swedish Empire entered the war and advanced into <b>Brandenburg,</b> George William again claimed neutrality, yet Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden compelled George William to join Sweden as an ally by occupying substantial territory in Brandenburg-Prussia and concentrating an army before the town walls of Berlin. George William did not conclude an alliance, but granted Sweden transit rights, two fortresses and subsidies. Consequently, Roman Catholic armies repeatedly ravaged <b>Brandenburg</b> and other Hohenzollern lands.|$|E
