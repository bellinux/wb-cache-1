5|$|Electric {{cars and}} plug-in hybrids when {{operating}} in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise {{as compared to}} vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine, thereby reducing harmful noise health effects. However, <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds.|$|E
5|$|New Method for Representing by Dots... (1839) {{put forth}} Braille's {{plan for a}} new writing system with which <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> could write letters that could be read by sighted people. Called decapoint, the system {{combined}} his method of dot-punching with a new specialized grill which Braille devised to overlay the paper. When used with an associated number table (also designed by Braille and requiring memorization), the grill could permit a blind writer to faithfully reproduce the standard alphabet.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} sales of hybrid electric vehicles in several countries, {{some members of the}} blind community have raised concerns about the noise reduction when those vehicles operate in all-electric mode, as <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard. Although a 2009 study found no statistically significant difference in pedestrian crashes involving quiet hybrid vehicles when compared to noisier vehicles when both types of vehicles were travelling in a straight line, it found a doubling of hybrid vehicle pedestrian crashes when reversing or parking etc. at slow speeds.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} one of its founders, Francis Joseph Campbell served as RNC's first principal, from 1871 until his {{retirement}} in 1912.

5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented his work to his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Chandler urged {{implementation}} of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal Rural Electrification Act. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment and in 1938, proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the Ohio River flood of 1937.

5|$|In early 1869, Johnson {{identified}} {{the need for}} a school for the blind in the new state of West Virginia; with statehood, deaf and blind West Virginia children attended schools for the deaf and blind in neighboring states (with West Virginia paying their tuition). Johnson began corresponding with West Virginia Governor William E. Stevenson, canvassing across the state to arouse public sentiment in support of a school for the blind. Despite rebukes from prominent West Virginian politicians, Johnson became the leading advocate for a state institution for the blind. He and other educated <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> staged an exhibition in the legislative chamber of the West Virginia House of Delegates, which was praised by the legislators.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, the talking weasel Koppa, on a quest for the Land of the Golden Condor. They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling woman who has the power to <b>blind</b> <b>people</b> and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at the condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to deepen the {{understanding}} of grown-up <b>blind</b> <b>people’s</b> non-verbal communication, including body expressions and paralinguistic (voice) expressions. More specifically, the thesis includes the following three studies: <b>Blind</b> <b>people’s</b> different forms of body expressions, <b>blind</b> <b>people’s</b> non-verbal conversation regulation and <b>blind</b> <b>people’s</b> experience of their own non-verbal expressions. The {{focus has been on}} the blind participants’ competence and on their subjective perspectives. I have also compared congenitally and adventitiously blind in all of the studies. The approach is mainly phenomenological and the qualitative empirical phenomenological psychological method is the primary methodological source of inspiration. Fourteen blind persons (and also some sigthed persons) participated. They have no other obvious disability than the blindness and their ages vary between 18 and 54. Data in the first two studies consisted of video recordings and data in the last study consisted of interviews. The overall results can be summarized in the following three points: 1. There are (almost) only similarities between the congenitally blind and adventitiously blind persons concerning their paralinguistic expressions. 2. There are mainly similarities between the two groups with respect to the occurrences of different body expressive forms. 3. There are also some differences between the groups. For example, the congenitally blind persons seem to have a limited ability to use the body in an abstract and symbolic way and they often mentioned that they have been told that their body expressions deviate from sighted people’s norms. But the persons in both groups also struggle to see themselves as unique persons who express themselves {{on the basis of their}} conditions and their previous experiences...|$|R
