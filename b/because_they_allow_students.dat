5000|$|In the {{province}} of Quebec, {{the majority of students}} must attend college prior to entering university. Upon completion of a two-year pre-university program, such as in Sciences or Humanities, or a three-year technical program, such as Nursing or Computer Science, college graduates obtain a college diploma, which is a prerequisite access for university-level studies. Although the previously mentioned college programs are typical, they are not offered in every institution in {{the province}}. Moreover, while a few other pre-university programs with various concentrations exist, many other technical/career programs are available depending on the college of choice. For example, Dawson College in Montreal has nearly sixty different programs leading to a college diploma. Special programs, such as physical rehabilitation therapy, are offered in some colleges as well. These programs are particularly interesting <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> to enter professional university programs, such as physiotherapy (which consists of an integrated Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy and Master of Physical Therapy), without having to meet the usual grade and course prerequisites required from students holding a pre-university science diploma. A similar option is offered for college nursing graduates as they can pursue their studies in university to obtain a Bachelor of Nursing in two years (rather than the usual three or four years, depending on whether the student has completed a college diploma in Quebec). Additionally, whereas aspiring medical students are usually required to complete an undergraduate degree before applying to medical schools, Quebec college graduates have the option to enter: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The basic {{concepts}} {{in the field}} of computer architecture have proved to be difficult to teach by just describing them. The discrete nature of processor behaviour, and the lack of powerful abstract models for modelling this behaviour, means that a complete detailed description is necessary. Many students find passive classroom study insufficiently motivating and interesting- specially in subjects such as: assembly language programming, input-output management, data-path behaviour, etc. To practice with real systems is the ideal solution but real systems are often costly or too complex. Interactive simulators do not have these disadvantages and then they are a very valuable complement of lectures and readings, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>allow</b> the <b>student</b> to try and to see what happens. This interactive practice with a simplified representation of a computer, that mimics a real one, increases the student interest in the field and makes his understanding more complete and durable. We present a Java applet that supports student understanding of assembly language programming. After testing its success among students it will serve as a base to develop more applets oriented to other computer architecture issues. We have chosen Java technology because it is integrated in the web and then universally available. Java applets are also easier to maintain and distribute than native applications, and they can be embedded in web documents.

50|$|The term virtual {{patient is}} used to {{describe}} interactive computer simulations used in health care education. The special focus is targeted on the simulation of clinical processes with virtual patients. Virtual patients combine scientific excellence, modern technologies and the innovative concept of game-based learning. Virtual patients allow the learner to take {{the role of a}} health care professional and develop clinical skills such as making diagnoses and therapeutic decisions. Virtual patients have also been considered computer-based simulations designed to complement clinical training. The use of virtual patient programmes is increasing in healthcare, partly in response to increasing demands on health care professionals and education of <b>students</b> but also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>allow</b> opportunity for <b>students</b> to practice in a safe environment.There are many different formats a virtual patient may take. However the overarching principle is that of interactivity—a virtual patient will have mechanisms for the learner to interact with the case and material or information is made available to the learner as they complete a range of learning activities. Interactivity is often included with questions, specific decision-making tasks, text-composition etc. and is non-sequential. Most systems provide quantitative and qualitative feedback.|$|R

40|$|Digital circuit {{simulation}} {{programs are}} powerful in education <b>because,</b> unlike paper, <b>they</b> <b>allow</b> <b>students</b> {{to explore and}} verify {{the behavior of a}} physical system. Unfortunately, learning to navigate the interfaces to these tools can be time consuming and useless from a pedagogical perspective. Our central aim is to build a tool that <b>allows</b> <b>students</b> to sketch circuit schematics on a Tablet PC and then simulate these circuits directly. Our hypothesis is that such a recognition tool will enable students to spend less time fighting with the interface and more time learning the material. We will test this hypothesis by completing a version of this tool for use in Harvey Mudd College’s digital circuit design class, E 85, starting in the fall of 2007 1. Our primary challenge is to construct a free-sketch recognition system that places few constraints on users’ drawing styles and performs robustly enough {{to be used in the}} classroom. Free-sketch recognition—recognition without placing any constraints on the user’s drawing style—is difficult because the symbols in a sketch may vary in position, rotation, and scale, and because sketches are messy. Free-sketch recognition is complicated by the added challenge of grouping strokes into individual objects. Simple temporal and spatial grouping techniques are not robust because symbols may overlap and because the user may draw two symbols in parallel. On the other hand, naively matching all templates to all parts of the user’s sketch is computationally intractable. To address these challenges we adapt, extend and combine a number of state-of-the-art approaches to solving more constrained sketch recognition problems. Our approach first labels individual strokes as wires or gates using a conditional random field (CRF) and then groups labeled strokes into individual shapes. Because strokes with the same label belonging to different symbols are separated in time and space, boundaries between individual symbols are easier to detect than in the unlabeled sketch. These grouped strokes will then be recognized using a graph-based isolated-shape recognition 1 After successfully using the tool at HMC, we plan to make it available for others teaching similar courses...|$|R
