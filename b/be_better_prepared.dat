5|$|The Students' Observatory was {{constructed}} in 1886 on the Berkeley campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature {{in order for the}} observatory to provide practical training to civil engineers. Very quickly, the Students' Observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy, so that they would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> to go on to use the facilities at Lick Observatory. This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and astronomy in the mid-1890s, with the Students' Observatory becoming the home of the Berkeley Astronomy Department.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{influenced}} the {{decision made by}} the Australian Government in October 1942 to recall the 9th Division to Australia. Most importantly, the Government and {{the commander of the}} Australian Military Forces, General Thomas Blamey, wanted to relieve the 6th and 7th Divisions from combat in the New Guinea Campaign and Blamey considered the 9th Division to <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> for this responsibility than the Australian Army's militia forces or US Army units. The commander of Allied forces in the South West Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, had also been pressing the US and Australian Governments for reinforcements to conduct offensive operations against Japanese positions. Other factors influencing the Australian Government's decision were a desire to concentrate the Australian Army in a single theatre, the increasing difficulty in finding replacements for the 9th Division's casualties given the Army's manpower shortages, the political difficulties associated with implementing reforms to permit militia units to serve outside Australian territory, and concerns that a prolonged absence from Australia would affect morale among the 9th Division's soldiers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of Cyclone Alby, an appeal for relief in the {{affected}} region was made by The Lord Mayor's Distress Relief Fund. The unprecedented scale of damage prompted meteorologists to vastly improve forecasting {{in the region to}} <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> for a similar storm in the future. At the time, little to no warning was given to residents in the South-West Land Division; this was the result of Alby's abrupt acceleration along a cold front, a complex forecasting situation. It was also regarded as a [...] "wake up call" [...] for the region, reminding residents that they are not immune to the effects of tropical cyclones. Cyclone Alby {{has been used as a}} benchmark to compare future storms in the region to, such as Severe Tropical Cyclone Bianca in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Western {{governments were}} {{prompted}} to form specialist anti-terrorist units following the [...] "Munich massacre". During the 1972 Olympic Games, a firefight between {{a group of}} hostage-takers and West German police left a police officer and all the hostages dead. The British government, worried {{that the country was}} unprepared for a similar crisis in the United Kingdom, ordered the formation of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) Wing of the SAS, which became the UK's primary anti-terrorist and anti-hijacking unit. The SAS had taken part in counter-insurgency operations abroad since 1945, and had trained the bodyguards of influential people whose deaths would be contrary to British interests. Thus, it was believed to <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> for the role than any unit in the police or elsewhere in the armed forces. The CRW Wing's first operational experience was the storming of Lufthansa Flight 181 in 1977, when a small detachment of soldiers were sent to assist GSG 9, the elite West German police unit set up after the events of 1972.|$|E

The resilience to withstand, recover and move on from crisis is now an issue requiring both academic study and wider understanding at all levels of society.

Countries, societies and economies that cannot develop better the capacity to prevent, resist and recover will be left vulnerable and exposed.

2500|$|By {{this time}} German {{officers}} had published what W. T. Stead called in 1901 [...] "various fantastic schemes" [...] for invading the United States, but contemporary observers {{saw them as}} unrealistic. In August 1901, von Tirpitz sent secret orders to Lieutenant Hubert von Rebeur-Paschwitz (later Vice Admiral), a naval attaché serving at the German embassy in Washington, D.C. Von Rebeur-Paschwitz left Washington to scout out the proposed landing location on Cape Cod, which he found to be unsuitable {{because it was not}} within sight of friendly naval artillery support. He recommended shifting the landing to the beach near the lighthouse at Manomet Point. This beach could be supported by German warships standing out from Cape Cod; it also included a nearby hill with a commanding view. The hill was to be taken as quickly as possible because it was seen as useful for army-directed artillery support of the initial stages of the intended troop advance northward toward Boston some [...] away. Von Rebeur-Paschwitz was already familiar with an up-to-date American defensive report authored by Captain Charles J. Train in mid-1901 as part of Train's duties for the US Navy Board of Inspection and Survey. Train, later made Rear Admiral, had written that Provincetown, Massachusetts, at the northern tip of Cape Cod, was the most vulnerable enemy landing location near Boston, and the short peninsula of Rockport, about [...] north of Boston, was the second-most vulnerable. Using Train's report as his foundation, Von Rebeur-Paschwitz reported back to Tirpitz his opinion that two attacking forces should be landed at these two points for a pincer approach to Boston, converging from Manomet Point and Rockport. After seeing von Rebeur-Paschwitz's report, von Schlieffen wrote in December 1901 that the inexperience of von Rebeur-Paschwitz in army operations cast serious doubts on his judgement regarding landing troop locations and major attack strategy. The existence of Train's seacoast defense report, said von Schlieffen, was a signal that the US was alarmed about possible enemy invasion in the Boston area. The Americans would likely <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>prepared</b> to fight off such an invasion in the near future.|$|E
