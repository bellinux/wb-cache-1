40|$|Abstract:- Decision {{making is}} one of the major {{attribute}} of a good leader. It is a core skill employers look for in job description. Decision making is basically the major role of managers and leaders. Despite of the fact it is done all the time and at almost all levels of a project, we have not stopped hearing the business news with news of how business flops with much loss as a result of <b>bad</b> <b>decision</b> that you tend to imagine “what were they thinking while making the decision? ” Or “What kind of person could have made such decision? ” The reality seems to be that most organizations aren’t run by good decision makers, let alone great ones. People tend to remember the stories of <b>bad</b> <b>decision</b> making than a great one. This is so due to human tendency to notice exception rather than expected and the result of a <b>bad</b> <b>decision</b> could be so painful that it memory keeps lingering in the mind. It is necessary in decision making to follow the necessary procedure and make the right choice using the right tool that fits for the particular situation to avoid the consequences of a <b>bad</b> <b>decision...</b>|$|R

Two years of tedious negotiations were completed in January 1999 and Amarillo Design Bureau, Inc. was born.|$|E

25|$|Distinguishing {{science from}} pseudoscience has {{practical}} implications {{in the case}} of health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education. Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive, and dangerous to patients, and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers, and the public as to what treatments are appropriate. Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making <b>bad</b> <b>decisions</b> in selecting curricula.|$|E

Schram explained that her [...] "very kind and very sweet" [...] character finds herself in an [...] "unfortunate situation of having lost someone in her life. The Cinderella that you'll see is a portrayal of someone that's desperate {{to get out of}} the situation that she's in. Because of that, some <b>bad</b> <b>decisions</b> are made and she's stuck in even more unfortunate circumstances. Though she's matured through her upbringing and being alone most of the time, she's naïve to the outer world." ...|$|E
500|$|As Alfred Gough sees it, Lana is a {{by-product}} of Clark and Lex's decisions. She will always love Clark, and Clark will always love her, but it was Clark's <b>bad</b> <b>decisions,</b> and Lex's [...] "basest instincts" [...] that make Lana the [...] "receptacle {{of all of these}} bad decisions", marking her as a tragic figure on the show. While Lana was with Clark, Kreuk characterizes her as a [...] "wimpy, whiny kind of girl"; with Lex, Lana is [...] "strong, powerful, and doesn't have to question, 'What is going on? What does he think? Does he love me? I don't know where I stand.'" [...] To clarify, Lana's relationship with Lex brings out a darkness that had not been seen in the character. This is evident in [...] "Nemesis" [...] when Lana manipulates her way into seeing Lionel, only to interrogate him about why he forced her to marry Lex, as well as leaving Lex to die in the underground tunnels. As Gough explains, {{by the end of the}} sixth season, Lana has shown that she can beat Lex at his own games.|$|E

500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his cycle of violence {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many <b>bad</b> <b>decisions,</b> which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision. The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence.

2500|$|However, {{the film}} has been criticized in the sailing world for being unrealistic, in {{particular}} {{for the lack of}} certain safety equipment deemed standard for sailboats navigating the open ocean such as an EPIRB, and other <b>bad</b> <b>decisions</b> of the main character.

[...] Director Chandor himself, who says he went sailing with his parents when young and later a few times as an adult, stated in an interview with German sailing magazine Segeln that everything that happened in the film could have happened in reality.
