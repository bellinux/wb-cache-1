5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product development has <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E
5|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> in {{sources in}} Egypt and Sudan.

In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the Dead Sea Valley, the Negev hills and Eilat.|$|E

5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of neurogenesis in and migration from the hippocampus in humans has already <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> Furthermore, age-related declines in the activities of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, are in place by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell quiescence in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the hippocampus.|$|E

25|$|Wax tablets {{were used}} for {{high-volume}} business records of transient importance until the 19th century. For instance, the salt mining authority at Schwäbisch Hall employed wax records until 1812.

25|$|Another {{important}} difference {{between male and}} female meiosis concerns the frequency of recombination between homologous chromosomes: In the male, almost all chromosome pairs are joined by at least one crossover, while more than 10% of human oocytes contain at least one bivalent without any crossover event. Failures of recombination or inappropriately located crossovers have <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> as contributors to the occurrence of nondisjunction in humans.|$|E

The NGO Survival International has reported that throughout the 1980s up to forty thousand gold prospectors entered Yanomami territory bringing diseases the Yanomami had no immunity to, the prospectors shot and destroyed entire villages, and Survival International estimates that up to twenty per cent of the people were dead within seven years.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefit of}} measles {{vaccination}} in preventing illness, disability, and death has <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million {{cases of the}} disease, 17,400 cases of intellectual disability, and 5,200 deaths. During 1999–2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide. Between 2000 and 2013, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from the disease.|$|E
25|$|Cold is {{a primary}} {{regulator}} of BAT processes and induces WAT browning. Browning in response to chronic cold exposure has <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> and is a reversible process. A study in mice demonstrated that cold-induced browning can be completely reversed in 21 days, with measurable decreases in UCP1 seen within a 24-hour period. A study by Rosenwald et al. revealed that when the animals are re-exposed to a cold environment, the same adipocytes will adopt a beige phenotype, suggesting that beige adipocytes are retained.|$|E

Retired Miami-Dade police officer (and licensed polygraph operator) Joe Harper will hook Stugotz up to a lie-detector, ask him if statements he made actually happened, and then announce the result, often with hilarious results.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{has greatly}} {{affected}} many fisheries around the world. As much as 85% of the world's fisheries may be over-exploited, depleted, fully exploited or in recovery from exploitation. Significant overfishing {{has been observed}} in pre-industrial times. In particular, the overfishing of the western Atlantic Ocean from {{the earliest days of}} European colonisation of the Americas has <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> Following World War Two, industrial fishing rapidly expanded with rapid increases in worldwide fishing catches. However, many fisheries have either collapsed or degraded to a point where increased catches are no longer possible.|$|E
25|$|Insectivorous birds prey {{upon the}} larva of the gypsy moth, but the egg {{clusters}} {{are protected by}} their hair coverings. The effects of bird predation have not been fully studied in North America, but it has <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> in Japan and Eurasia. When outbreaks of gypsy moths occur, bird predation has no {{significant effect on the}} population. Birds that consume gypsy moth larvae, pupae and adults include the bluejay, red-eyed vireo, rufous-sided towhee, northern oriole, catbird and the robin. The black-capped chickadee preys upon the entire life cycle, including the eggs.|$|E
