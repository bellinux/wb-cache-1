40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the mechanisms of Lactobacillus brevis antiviral activity towards HSV- 2 and to identify the bacterial components responsible for the inhibiting effect. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> and cell walls were prepared by lysozyme digestion of L brevis cells untreated or treated with LiCI to remove S-layer proteins. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> and cell wall fragments showed a dose dependent inhibitory effect on HSV- 2 multiplication. In order to characterize the inhibitory activity of L brevis, the <b>bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> was subjected to different physical and chemical treatments. The inhibitory activity was resistant to high temperature and proteases digestion and appeared to be associated with compounds with a molecular weight higher than 10 kDa. DNA, RNA and lipids isolated from bacterial cells were devoid of inhibitory effect. The antiviral activity of both <b>bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> and cell wall fragments obtained from L brevis cells after the S-layer removal was significantly reduced compared to untreated cells suggesting that the inhibitory activity is likely due to a heat-resistant non-protein cell surface bacterial component.

40|$|The human glycine tRNA {{synthetase}} gene (GlyRS) {{has been}} cloned and sequenced. The 2462 bp cDNA for this gene contains a large {{open reading frame}} (ORF) encoding 685 amino acids with predicted M(r) = 77, 507 Da. The protein sequence has approximately 60 % identity with B. mori GlyRS and 45 % identity with S. cerevisiae GlyRS and contains motifs 2 and 3 characteristic of Class II tRNA synthetases. A second ORF encoding 47 amino acids is found upstream of the large ORF. Translation of this ORF may precede the expression of GlyRS as a possible regulatory mechanism. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with a 13 kDa biotinylated tag with an apparent M(r) = 90 kDa. The fusion protein was immunoprecipitated from crude <b>bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> with human EJ serum, which contains autoantibodies directed against GlyRS, and with rabbit polyclonal serum raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted amino acid sequence of human GlyRS. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> containing the fusion protein catalyses the aminoacylation of bovine tRNA with [14 C]-gly at 10 -fold increased level above normal <b>bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> and confirms that the cDNA encodes human GlyRS...|$|E

OM 85 enhanced {{the expression of}} MAC- 1 and ICAM- 1 on monocytes and granulocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Maximal expression was achieved with 1 mg/ml <b>bacterial</b> <b>extract.</b> The effect on MAC- 1 expression was not due to the low concentration of endotoxin contaminating the preparation (less than 1 ng/mg) since polymyxin-B did not substantially affect the adhesion molecule upregulation induced by OM 85. In addition, OM 85 enhanced the expression of p 150, 95 on monocytes and granulocytes, and also increased expression of LFA- 1 on monocytes, but not on granulocytes. While MAC- 1 and p 150, 95 expression reached peak values between 1 and 6 h, levels of ICAM- 1 rose constantly for 10 h.

This phenomenon was believed to be due to immunologic cross reactivity between THP and the bacterial antigens for the same antibody. Our attempts to further purify and characterize these “cross reactive” antigens with ion exchange and molecular sieve chromatography were unsuccessful. When purified anti-THP antibody was conjugated to sepharose beads forming an immunoadsorption column capable of isolating THP and cross reactive antigens from solution, the <b>bacterial</b> <b>extracts</b> did not react with the affinity column. However, binding between THP and the <b>bacterial</b> <b>extracts</b> and between THP and whole bacteria were demonstrated.

Endophytic bacteria, microorganisms can found in the plant tissues, like leaves, branches and roots and able to produce various novel secondary metabolites for the medicinal applications. Methodology: Endophytic bacteria were isolated from the leaves of the adhatoda beddomei leaves. The extract from the culture was tested for the cytotoxicity in A 549 cell lines using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, dual staining and nuclear staining. Results: The expression of the apoptotic and proliferative genes were assessed with the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) comparing with the control gene. The inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>extract</b> was found to be 43. 97 μg/ml. With the dual staining the apoptotic cell percentage was significantly increased (P < 0. 001) and with the 40 μg/ml and 80 μg/ml concentration the apoptotic percentages observed as 67 % and 89 % respectively. Similar concentrations were used for the nuclear fragmentation (PI) and the cell cycle analysis (FACS) using WinMDI 2. 9 software.

Epimerization of {{thymidine}} diphosphate glucose in <b>bacterial</b> <b>extracts.</b> J. Bacteriol. 86 : 246 – 251. 1963. —Extracts of Pasteurella pseudotuberculosis type IV {{and several}} other bacteria catalyzed the reversible interconversion of thymidine diphosphate (TDP) -d-glucose and TDP-d-galactose. Moreover, extracts of P. pseudotuberculosis catalyzed the synthesis of TDP-d-glucose from thymidine triphosphate and α-d-glucose- 1 -phosphate. The limitations of these observations and their possible significance are discussed...|$|R
