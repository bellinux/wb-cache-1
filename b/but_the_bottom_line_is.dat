500|$|Pilotwings 64 {{was well}} {{received}} by most reviewers. The game's combination of 3D graphics, realistic settings, and flight simulation were applauded by many news sources and major gaming publications. In his release {{review of the}} Nintendo 64, The Seattle Times contributor Steven L. Kent found that the flight mechanics and vast areas featured in Pilotwings 64 make {{it one of the}} most impressive games ever made. Glenn Rubenstein of the website GameSpot summarized, [...] "The graphics, sound, control, and all around excitement add up to make Pilotwings 64 one hell of a great ride." [...] Staff reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly, GamePro, and IGN all voiced positive comments on the game's polygon rendering and frame rates, as well as its sense of control and flying. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the game's large environments, exclaiming, [...] "You'll not believe just how huge the islands really are and, because certain elements are hidden at first, it'll take you months to see everything." [...] IGN's Levi Buchanan described this low-pressure, [...] "challenge without competition" [...] aspect of the game as a design philosophy adopted by later Nintendo titles such as Nintendogs. Rich Leadbetter of Maximum said that [...] "The sedate nature of the gameplay might not appeal to everyone, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> that PilotWings 64 is an unparalleled test of skill, dexterity and control. It is a game that you must own and whilst not quite in the same league of 'must-have'itude as Super Mario 64, it remains an astounding achievement and another triumph for Nintendo." [...] A Next Generation critic remarked that once beyond the introductory missions the game becomes satisfyingly challenging, and succeeds as both a flight simulation and an example of Nintendo's surrealistic gameplay: [...] "It's a weird mix of total realism and self-conscious videogame elements, and the two don't grate." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 28 October, after {{performing}} on V Graham Norton {{to promote the}} Singles compilation, Anderson {{made the decision to}} call it a day.

And, believe it or not, her big sister act for Issei's benefit is actually quite endearing.

40|$|Abstract The American success {{industry}} comprises an $ 11 billion for-profit {{enterprise that}} is growing by almost six percent {{every year in}} the United States and Canada (and increasingly in other countries). Purveyors of success teachings claim that they teach methods by which anyone, with enough commitment and vision, can “have it all. ” “Having it all” includes health, relationships, careers, and spirituality, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> for <b>the</b> success industry is almost always material wealth. This thesis argues that religious and theological memes characterize the modus operandi of the success industry, particularly themes derived from American Protestantism, in the form of Puritan theology and the history of revivalism in America. These undercurrent memes bypass critical filters, creating a distorted form of hidden theology of which many consumers of success events appear to be unaware. There is therefore a need for a countervailing response from the discipline of theology to add to the current discourse regarding the effects of the success industry and its role within a consumerist society...|$|R

Will Sam's tear-filled plea be the thing to save his big brother? The answer, as we now know, is no, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b> that this episode finally gave us the Demon Dean moments we've been imagining.

40|$|In Inner Lives: Voices of African American Women In Prison, Professor Paula Johnson {{has written}} about the most {{invisible}} of incarcerated women — incarcerated African American women. The number of women incarcerated in the United States increased by seventy-five percent between 1986 and 1991. Of these women, a disproportionate number are black women. The percentages vary by region and {{by the nature of}} institution (county jail, state prison or federal facility), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> remains <b>the</b> same. In every instance, black women are incarcerated at rates disproportionate to their percentage in the general population. In Inner Lives, Professor Johnson offers African American incarcerated women an opportunity to push back the veil of invisibility and to claim for themselves the right to control their stories and their own images. The women talk about the strengths they had to have to survive sexual abuse, physical abuse, lack of resources and drug addiction. They speak of the strength required to survive not only incarceration, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> awareness that they harmed their victims, the victims 2 ̆ 7 families, their own family members, and themselves.

The groove's the thang as these tasty tracks cruise on Rhodes-driven jazz, ambient beats, surf riffs, and post rock textures. The band brew all these elements into a mixture that travels the outer realms of progressive funk. Like Tortoise jamming with the Grateful Dead or Soft Machine exploring the Funkadelic catalog, these loose open-ended excursions raise the art of fusion to a new plateau. While each track works a groove toward heady epiphany, the album as a whole refuses to stay locked into any one genre.

All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free.

40|$|An {{automated}} external defibrillator (AED) is one of {{the greatest}} advancements in defibrillator technology in the past several decades. Its purpose is to treat sudden cardiac arrest, the leading cause of death in this country. An AED checks the heart’s rhythm and will dispatch an electric jolt when needed to reestablish the organ’s normal electrical pattern. The magic of this portable device is that anyone can use it and it is relatively inexpensive to purchase. Studies have shown that access to AEDs can improve the odds of surviving a cardiac arrhythmia outside of the hospital and the American Heart Association estimates that an AED can improve a person’s chances of surviving the cardiac event by 49 – 75 %. Not everyone shares the same enthusiasm for the widespread availability of AEDs. There is a patchwork of statutes, rules, and regulations concerning the use of AEDs, and a number of entities are fearful of liability issues. While airlines are mandated to have AEDs on commercial aircraft, and Congress encourages the placement of these life-saving devices in federal buildings, private industries have resisted most proposed laws that require the installation of an AED on their premises. Health clubs, shopping centers, hotels, and country clubs are examples of businesses in this category.

5000|$|The Panthers {{came away}} with a 36-33, four-{{overtime}} victory after falling behind Notre Dame by two touchdowns, 17-3, at halftime. Conor Lee made the game-winning field goal, one of four overtime fields goals, during his perfect, 5-for-5 day to help lead the Panthers. His five field goals and 18 points are both Pitt records for a kicker; he also extended his school record of consecutive extra points without a miss to 100. LeSean McCoy lead the way on offense with 32 rushing attempts for 169 yards, his 5th straight 100-yard game, and one touchdown as he surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the season; he also had two catches for 23 yards. The Panthers fell behind {{in the first half}} when Notre Dame controlled the clock and took advantage of poor play by Pitt on offense. Quarterbacks Kevan Smith and Pat Bostick, who were playing in place of the injured started Bill Stull, who suffered a concussion in the previous game, were ineffective in the first half, and the running game couldn't get going as McCoy had only 5 yards on 3 carries. In total, the offense only had 71 yards and five first downs in the entire first half. The offense got back on track in the 2nd half as the Panthers scored 10 straight points to tie the game at 17. The Panthers first possession of the 3rd quarter went eight plays and 71 yards, including a converted fourth-and-one pass that Oderick Turner turned into a 37-yard gain. The Panthers next touchdown came on a 15-play, 70-yard drive that used 8:28 of time during the end of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th quarters. Pat Bostick, although he was intercepted three times in the game, persevered and stepped up his play in the second half, leading the Panthers on three critical scoring drives. After the game Bostick, speaking of his own performance, said, [...] ""I came out and made some mistakes out there, forced a couple of things, made a couple of plays.

While 2-line kites require sometimes significant push and pull arm movement to fly (especially true the larger the kite), {{the development of the}} 4-line kite required less arm movement. 4-line kites are flown with two lines on each handle: a top line (or power <b>line),</b> and a <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> (or brake line). 4-line kites can still be flown with push and pull arm movement, <b>but</b> if <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> brake <b>line</b> is pulled in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> edge of <b>the</b> kite stalls and will cause the kite to turn on that bottom edge. This results in tighter turns with less arm movement - this is important if sitting in a kite buggy.|$|R

If this is agreed, it must be in an operational from. However, difficulties may still emerge since opinions may differ about how to achieve. This is illustrated by differences in the views of economists about how sustainable development is to be achieved. Orthodox economists stress the importance of the accumulation of man-made capital to achieve this end whereas neo-Malthusians stress the importance of conserving natural resource and environmental capital. Both take an anthropocentric point of view. For political reasons the neo-Malthusian has had little support but it may eventually turn out to be correct. Economics is concerned with reducing economic scarcity and economists have traditionally suggested four main ways of doing this of which economic growth is one. However, neo-Malthusian economists believe that this may not be a sustainable strategy – it may result in future poverty. It should be noted that economic systems are embedded in social and natural systems and depend on these. Economic sustainability depends on the sustainability of these other systems. So from this point of view, it is just one of several <b>bottom</b> <b>lines.</b> Values must be considered in relation to sustainability. Economics is completely anthropocentric in its approach. Therefore, economic approaches to conservation and sustainability can be at odds with the values of deep ecologists or those willing to accord rights to other sentient beings or ecosystems independent of human wishes, or those who want to make use of value judgments other than those based on the measuring rod of money. Consequently economics evaluation is sometimes ineffective in resolving social conflict, including conflict about what should be sustained. As a rule economics alone should not be the final arbiter of social decisions. It is a part (often an important part) of the social evaluation process <b>but</b> not <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line,</b> or just one of many lines. conservation, sustainability, biodiversity, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
