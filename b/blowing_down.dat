5|$|September 15, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{parallels}} {{the shore of}} the Delmarva Peninsula as a tropical storm. Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents are without electricity because of high winds <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> power lines. More than 28people are forced to be rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding. Nine other people were from an apartment building near Great Mills. Two people are injured and one person is killed by carbon monoxide after losing power and running a generator inside their home. Also, a 12‑year-old boy is caught in flood waters and is swept a half mile (800m) down a drainage ditch before being rescued and treated for hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|Damage in South Korea was {{estimated}} at $4.2billion (₩5.15trillion KRW). Damage was heaviest in Gangneung, where about 36,000homes and 622military buildings were flooded. At the airbase in Gangneung, floods submerged 16jet fighters. Along the coast, high winds damaged 640boats and about 200,000marine buildings, and 265industrial buildings were also damaged. The heavy rainfall left mudslides in the country, one of which covered ten cars in Gangneung. Flooding and the landslides disrupted the country's infrastructure; the storm destroyed 274bridges and damaged roads and rails at 164locations. Rusa killed 300,000livestock and flooded 85,000hectares (210,000acres) of crop fields, representing 6% of the country's agricultural lands, mostly affecting fruit and vegetables. The storm caused the Vana H Cup KBC Augusta golf tournament to end early, and a stadium {{to be used for}} the 2002 Asian Games was damaged. Across the country, 88,625people were forced to evacuate due to the typhoon, and 17,046houses were damaged. High winds left 1.25million people after <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> 24,000power lines. There were 213deaths in the country, and another 33were missing and presumed dead; This made Rusa the deadliest typhoon in the country in more than 43years.|$|E

50|$|A <b>blow</b> <b>down</b> {{facility}} is a testing facility {{that relies on}} charging an energy reservoir (often a tank of pressurized gas) and releasing the energy over {{a relatively short time}} to produce test conditions at higher energy release rates than can be maintained continuously. Impulse facilities are a special case of <b>blow</b> <b>down</b> facilities that release their energy very rapidly to create very high enthalpy conditions over very short test times. Contrasting with <b>blow</b> <b>down</b> facilities are continuous facilities that can operate at a certain conditions continuously, such as some types of wind tunnels.|$|R

500|$|The storm {{system that}} {{eventually}} spawned the Wallingford tornado produced damaging winds {{and at least}} one tornado far before it reached the town. [...] The first tornado from this storm system touched down in South Kent, unroofing houses, <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> barns, and uprooting and tossing trees into the air. [...] It moved steadily southeast for , moving just south of New Preston, and then through Washington, before turning north and dissipating. [...] The next path of damage started further north along the Shepaug River. It is unknown whether this was a tornado or straight-line winds, but the damage path continued southeast for three miles before disappearing again. [...] More damage was reported near Waterbury, where a house was unroofed two miles west of the town. [...] In the town itself, branches and chimneys were damaged.|$|E
500|$|Daytime {{heating and}} {{nighttime}} cooling of the hilly slopes lead to day to night {{variations in the}} airflow, similar {{to the relationship between}} sea breeze and land breeze. [...] At night, the sides of the hills cool through radiation of the heat. [...] The air along the hills becomes cooler and denser, <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> into the valley, drawn by gravity. [...] This is known a katabatic wind or mountain breeze. [...] If the slopes are covered with ice and snow, the katabatic wind will blow during the day, carrying the cold dense air into the warmer, barren valleys. [...] The slopes of hills not covered by snow will be warmed during the day. The air that comes in contact with the warmed slopes becomes warmer and less dense and flows uphill. This is known as an anabatic wind or valley breeze.|$|E
500|$|The {{hurricane}} continued northeastward across northern Florida before emerging {{into the}} Atlantic between Mayport and St. Augustine. At the latter city, {{the storm was}} regarded as the most severe in 15 years; fences, trees, and crops were destroyed, and a few ships were driven aground, though the sea wall largely protected St. Augustine. Winds at Savannah, Georgia increased to hurricane strength {{on the night of}} October 5–6 and were accompanied by torrential rains. The storm surge there flooded wharves and other low-lying areas. The slow-moving storm buffeted the southern Georgia Sea Islands with a prolonged period of strong winds and heavy rain, <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> trees and destroying some houses. Rice plantations along the Altamaha River experienced significant losses. [...] "Unprecedented" [...] tides also flooded streets farther up the coast in Charleston, South Carolina, such that some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. Though damage there was generally minor, five slaves drowned when their fishing boat capsized in rough seas. As the hurricane moved away from the coast, several ships were lost off North Carolina. On October 8 and 9, Bermuda experienced strong winds as the storm passed nearby.|$|E

The storm surge led to beach erosion, damage to piers, and flooded roadways, with {{damage from the}} surge amounting to around $1million (2003USD, $ USD). The maximum sustained wind from the storm recorded in Mississippi was , at the Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport, while the airport and Keesler Air Force Base both reported a peak wind gust of [...] Tropical Storm Bill dropped moderate to heavy rainfall across the state, peaking at [...] in Van Cleave. The moderate wind gusts, along with the saturated ground, downed trees in several locations. 34roads in Pike and Walthall Counties were blocked by fallen trees, and two homes were damaged. Additionally, power outages were reported near the coast. The rainfall flooded streets in various portions {{of the state and}} led to overflown rivers. An overflown creek in Pearl River County flooded structures and roadways. The outer rainbands of Bill {{produced a}} weak tornado that touched down briefly in Waveland, <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> several trees which resulted in minor damage to roofs. Statewide damage accrued to $5million (2003USD, $ USD), primarily from flooding.|$|E

PR sought to alleviate this by building water softening plants at the main watering points on its network, frequently chemically testing the water and eventually fitting all locomotives with <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> apparatus with which the driver could purge sludge from the boiler.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the counterattack, voices {{could be}} heard on {{loudspeakers}} at the shrines of Abbas and Hussein, directing orders for the insurgency to attack the Republican Guard. In the closing days of the uprising, the shrines were heavily damaged by artillery and rocket fire from helicopters. Many rebels and their civilian sympathizers barricaded themselves into the buildings. Video recordings show the people dancing in euphoria and calling for the aid of America and Iran, which never came. Once the loyalist forces surrounded the shrine, {{the leader of the}} assault and a henchman of Saddam, Kamal Hussein Majid, stood on a tank and shouted: [...] "Your name is Hussein and so is mine. Let us see who is stronger now." [...] He then gave the order to open fire on the shrine. After <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> the doors, the Guard rushed in and killed a majority of those inside with automatic weapons fire.|$|E
2500|$|The Santa Anas are {{katabatic}} winds—Greek for [...] "flowing downhill", arising {{in higher}} altitudes and <b>blowing</b> <b>down</b> towards sea level. Santa Ana winds originate from high-pressure airmasses over the Great Basin and upper Mojave Desert. Any low-pressure area over the Pacific Ocean, {{off the coast}} of California, can change the stability of the Great Basin High, causing a pressure gradient that turns the synoptic scale winds southward down {{the eastern side of the}} Sierra Nevada and into the Southern California region. Cool, dry air flows outward in a clockwise spiral from the high pressure center. This cool, dry airmass sweeps across the deserts of eastern California toward the coast, and encounters the towering Transverse Ranges, which separate coastal Southern California from the deserts. The airmass, flowing from high pressure in the Great Basin to a low pressure center off the coast, takes the path of least resistance by channeling through the mountain passes to the lower coastal elevations, as the low pressure area off the coast pulls the airmass offshore.|$|E
