25|$|A <b>buddy</b> <b>line</b> {{is a line}} or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater {{to avoid}} separation in low visibility conditions. A <b>buddy</b> <b>line</b> is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A <b>buddy</b> <b>line</b> is a means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but will more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a <b>buddy</b> <b>line</b> is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E

50|$|The My <b>Buddy</b> doll <b>line</b> was a toy brand made by Hasbro in 1985 {{with the}} {{intention}} of making a doll to appeal to little boys and teach them about caring for their friends. This idea was both innovative and controversial for its time, as toy dolls were traditionally associated with younger girls. Hasbro also introduced a companion Kid Sister marketed toward girls. Hasbro discontinued the line {{before the start of the}} 1990s and Playskool took over production, making changes to the likeness and clothing.|$|R

As the two struggle to reach land, the villain cuts the previously hidden balloon tail hanging from Buddy's horse's mouth, allowing {{the horse to}} deflate. The villain moves on, back to the racetrack, whilst Buddy is left to push his horse out of the lake. The tired creature can {{not seem to be}} motivated, until, as part of an oncoming rain shower, a bolt of lightning suddenly strikes the horse's behind! And lightning continues to strike Our Hero's steed as they near the finish <b>line.</b> <b>Buddy</b> and his enemy are again neck and neck, and just {{before the end of the}} race can be reached by either, both fall into mud puddles. With Cookie cheering him on, Buddy wins the race, for another bolt of lightning sends his horse galloping, underground, to the other side of the finish <b>line.</b> <b>Buddy</b> is awarded the mail contract, and Buddy and Cookie give the much-abused horse a kiss.|$|R

5000|$|Stripes {{was well}} {{received}} by critics and audiences. It holds an 86% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. In his Chicago Sun-Times review, Roger Ebert praised it as [...] "an anarchic slob movie, {{a celebration of}} all that is irreverent, reckless, foolhardy, undisciplined, and occasionally scatological. It's a lot of fun". Janet Maslin of The New York Times called it [...] "a lazy but amiable comedy" [...] and praised Murray for achieving [...] "a sardonically exaggerated calm that can be very entertaining". In his review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr praised the performances of Harold Ramis and Bill Murray: [...] "the affable Harold Ramis, becomes its genuine dramatic center: his struggles to keep his <b>buddy</b> Bill in <b>line</b> have a strange urgency and poignance".|$|R
5000|$|A shot-for-shot {{remake of}} the show's opening credits aired January 23, 2014 on Adult Swim as an {{installment}} of current television series Parks and Recreation star Adam Scott's The Greatest Event in Television History.

The theme song [...] "My Life" [...] by Billy Joel is actually sung by Joel instead of the sound-alike version used for the original TV series. In an extended mock [...] "making-of" [...] documentary preceding the opening credits remake, Hanks, Scolari, and Joel make cameo appearances.

5000|$|Scuba divers {{generally}} have no voice communication and are generally restricted to visual signalling. this {{is limited by}} line of sight and visibility, which may be poor. In some cases scuba divers may be connected by a tether, or <b>buddy</b> <b>line,</b> which allows communication by line signals, and professional scuba divers often tow a surface marker buoy, which {{may be used to}} transmit a very limited range of signals to surface personnel, mainly location of the diver, and if the diver needs help.|$|E

Each competitor also must tow a buoy to identify his/her position underwater at all times when in the water. Competitors in the Monk Competition (refer below) are permitted to use one buoy between a pair of competitors provided a <b>buddy</b> <b>line</b> is used (i.e. wrist to wrist). An exposure suit (i.e. wetsuit with hood) is required where the water temperature is less than 14 degrees Celsius.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} his overt idiocy, Beavis {{possesses}} a number of character strengths. He can be inadvertently witty and, when discussing subjects that neither he nor Butt-Head understand, he {{is more likely to}} guess the actual mechanisms at work. Also, on the rare occasion that a female exhibits interest in one of the duo, it is usually Beavis who gets the attention. This could be because of Beavis' somewhat childlike temperament, which is less off-putting than Butt-Head's crasser, more blatantly sexual approaches. For example, when the two encounter members of the opposite sex, Butt-Head will typically lead off with a smug opening line such as [...] "Hey, baby", which invariably flops; Beavis, on the other hand, will usually approach the woman with a less obvious [...] "Hi!" [...] or [...] "Hey, how's it going?". Easily influenced by Butt-Head, however, Beavis will often imitate his <b>buddy's</b> cruder pick-up <b>lines.</b> Beavis has also shown instances of insight on such topics as the true meaning of Christmas, or in his analysis of a video by Korn. However, in both instances Beavis seems to be either in a trance or possessed, and shortly afterward he displays no recollection of what he just said.|$|R
50|$|The 1935 NFL Championship Game {{was held}} on December 15, 1935, at University of Detroit Stadium (some sources call it Titan Stadium) in Detroit. The game was played in a {{snowstorm}} in front of 12,000 spectators. It was the 3rd annual title game for the NFL. The champion of the Western Division was the Detroit Lions (7-3-2) and the champion of the Eastern Division was the New York Giants (9-3). On the opening drive of the game, the Lions Glenn Presnell threw a 36-yard pass to Frank Christensen, and Ace Gutowsky threw another long pass to Ed Klewicki at the Giants' 8-yard line. Gutowsky then ran {{the ball into the}} end zone to give the Lions a 7-0 lead. The Lions scored again after Christensen intercepted a pass thrown by New York's Ed Danowski and ran it back to midfield. Three plays later, Dutch Clark ran 40 yards for a touchdown. In the fourth quarter, the Lions blocked a punt, and George Christensen recovered the ball on the Giants' 22-yard line. Ernie Caddel ran the ball in from the one-yard line for the Lions' third touchdown. The Lions added to their lead late in the game after Parker intercepted a pass from New York quarterback (and former University of Michigan star) Harry Newman on the Giants' 45-yard line and returned it to the nine-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Buddy</b> Parker ran for the touchdown as the Lions won the championship by a final score of 26-7.|$|R
