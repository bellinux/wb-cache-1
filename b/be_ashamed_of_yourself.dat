500|$|On 20 October 2010, {{following}} a live BBC News at Six report outside Parliament covering the 2010 Spending Review, Robinson silently took the anti-war, anti-cuts placard {{that had been}} waved directly behind him throughout, broke it in two and stamped on it. Afterwards, another protester, who had climbed {{the steps of the}} gantry where the BBC were broadcasting to film the protest on a mobile phone, said: [...] "You should <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> mate. Shame on you!" [...] Robinson replied [...] "I'm not remotely ashamed of myself. Why should I be ashamed of myself?" [...] He wrote in his blog afterwards: [...] "I lost my temper and I regret that. However, as I explained afterwards to the protesters who disrupted my broadcast, there are many opportunities to debate whether the troops should be out of Afghanistan without the need to stick a sign on a long pole and wave it in front of a camera". Some days later, Robinson read out a jokily ambiguous [...] "letter of apology" [...] on the comedy game show Have I Got News for You, broadcast on 4 November 2010.|$|E

5000|$|According to Dukore, Shaw {{changes the}} last scene significantly, {{but he also}} [...] "alters and embroiders every scene, every page, {{virtually}} every line". He changed the spelling Gitta's name to emphasise {{that it should not}} be pronounced with a hard G. He also changes the husband's name from Alphons to Alfred, possibly because Alphons sounds slightly too comic in English. Shaw repeatedly undercuts the romantic fervour of the original in which Gitta is left at the end to brood on her guilt. In Shaw's version, Alfred assures Jitta that her guilt is a form of self-indulgence: [...] "How you enjoy being miserable, Jitta.... You think yourself such a jolly romantic figure... yet you <b>are</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> because you <b>were</b> not found stretched on his dead body, with the limelight streaming on your white face, and the band playing slow music." [...] For Dukore, this undercutting of moral posturing allows the characters to genuinely interact {{in a way that is}} absent in the original play. The characters [...] "begin to understand themselves and each other, try to come to terms, make an effort to arrive at a decision and to act upon new knowledge". Shaw also alters the sub-plot about the unpublished book. In Trebitsch's version, Alphons wishes to destroy the book, which is presented as a radical masterpiece, but Gitta forces him to accept it. In Shaw's version he is not convinced that it's a masterpiece at all, and thinks no-one would ever believe he wrote it.|$|R

6000|$|The old butler, however, was not {{thinking}} of her; he had thoughts of a simpler order in his mind. He was reflecting that he had once valeted the nephew of the late Lord Justice Hawthorn, {{and in the midst}} of this low-class business the reminiscence brought him refreshment. Over and over to himself he conned these words: [...] "I interpylated in between them, and I says, 'You ought to <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> yourself; call <b>yourself</b> an Englishman, I says, attackin' of old men and women with cold steel, I says!'"

6000|$|It {{is perhaps}} no worse for an Infidel to be drunk than a Christian, but my friend found this tipsy blasphemer's case so revolting, {{that he went}} to the hand-bag, took out the empty claret-bottle, and seeking a solitary corner of the boat, cast the bottle into the water, and felt a thrill of {{uncommon}} self-approval as this scapegoat of all the wine at his grocer's bobbed off upon the little waves. [...] "Besides, it saves carrying the bottle home," [...] he thought, not without a half-conscious reserve, that if his penitence were ever too much for him, he could easily abandon it. And without the reflection that the gate is always open behind him, who could consent to enter upon any course of perfect behavior? If good resolutions could not be broken, who would ever have the courage to form them? Would it not be intolerable to be made as good as we ought to be?

60|$|The {{worst of}} doing a big thing out hunting {{is the fact that}} in nine cases out of ten they who don't do it are as well off as they who do. If there were any penalty for riding round, or any mark given to those who had ridden straight,--so that justice might in some sort be done,--it would perhaps be better. When you have nearly broken your neck to get to hounds, or made your horse exert himself beyond his proper power, and then find yourself, within three minutes, {{overtaking}} the hindmost ruck of horsemen on a road because of some iniquitous turn that the fox has taken, the feeling is not pleasant. And some man who has not ridden at all, who never did ride at all, will ask you where you have been; and his smile will give you the lie in your teeth if you make any attempt to explain the facts. Let it be sufficient for you at such a moment to feel that you <b>are</b> not <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself.</b> Self-respect will support a man even in such misery as this.|$|R

6000|$|Yet Mrs. Woodford, on her {{way through}} the Cathedral nave, was aware of {{something}} leaning against one of the great columns, crouching together so that the dark head, supported on the arms, rested against the pillar which fluted the pier. The organ was pealing softly and plaintively, and the little gray coat seemed to heave as with a sob. She stood, impelled to offer to take him with her into the choir, but a verger, spying him, began rating him in a tone fit for expelling a dog, [...] "Come, master, none of your pranks here! <b>Be</b> not you <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> to <b>be</b> lying in wait for godly folk on their way to prayers?

6000|$|Oh, my dear friends, {{have not}} {{some of you}} {{sometimes}} had such thoughts? Then hear {{the word of the}} Lord to you: [...] "When--whensoever-- whensoever the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive." [...] "Have I any pleasure in the death of him that dieth? saith the Lord, and not rather that he should be converted, and live?" [...] True, most true, that the Lord is unchangeable: but it is in love and mercy. True, that God's will and law cannot alter: but what is God's will and law? The soul that sinneth, it shall die? Yes. But also, the soul that turneth away from its sin, it shall live. Never believe the devil when he tells you that God hates you. Never believe him when he tells you that God has been too hard on you, and put you into such temptation, or ignorance, or poverty, or anything else, that you cannot mend. No. That font there will give the devil the lie. That font says: [...] "Be you poor, tempted, ignorant, stupid, be you what you will, you are God's child--your Father's love is over you, His mercy is ready for you." [...] You feel too weak to change; ask God's Spirit, and He will give you a strength of mind you never felt before. You feel too proud to change; ask God's Spirit, and He will humble your proud heart, and soften your hard heart; and you will find to your surprise, that when your pride is gone, when you <b>are</b> utterly <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and see your sins in their true blackness, and feel not worthy to look up to God, that then, instead of pride, will come a nobler, holier, manlier feeling--self-respect, and a clear conscience, and the thought that, weak and sinful as you are, you are in the right way; that God, and the angels of God, are smiling on you; that you are in tune again with all heaven and earth, because you are what God wills you to be--not His proud, peevish, self-willed child, fancying yourself strong enough to go alone, when in reality you are the slave of your own passions and appetites, and the plaything of the devil: but His loving, loyal son, strong in the strength which God gives you, and able to do what you will, because what you will God wills also.|$|R
6000|$|There is no darker temptation {{than that}} which comes over a man when the devil whispers to him such {{thoughts}} as these, [...] "God does not care for me--God hates me. Luck, and everything else is against me. There seems some curse upon me. Why should I change? Let God first change to me and then will I change towards Him. But God will not change; He has determined to have no mercy on me. I can see that; for everything goes wrong with me. Then what {{is the use of}} my repenting. I will go my own way--and what must be must." [...] Have you ever had such thoughts? Then hear the word of the Lord to you: [...] "When, whensoever, wheresoever, the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness which he has committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Have I any pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the Lord, and not rather that he should be converted and live?" [...] Never believe the devil when he tells you that God hates you. Never believe him when he tells you that God has been too hard upon you, and placed you in such circumstances of temptation, ignorance, poverty or anything else, that you cannot mend. What does the promise of your Baptism say? [...] "Be you poor, tempted, ignorant, stupid, be you what you will, you are God's child--your Father's love is over you, His mercy ready for you." [...] You feel too weak to change. Ask God's Spirit to give you a strength of will you never felt before. You feel too proud to change. Ask God's Spirit to humble your proud heart, to soften your hard heart; and you will find to your surprise that when your pride is gone, when you <b>are</b> utterly <b>ashamed</b> <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> and see your sins in their true blackness, and feel unworthy to look up to God, that then will come a nobler, holier, manlier feeling--self-respect, and a clear conscience, and the thought that, weak and simple as you are, you are in the right way; that God and the Angels of God are smiling on you; that you are in tune again with all earth and heaven, because you are what God wills you to be. Not His proud, peevish, self-willed child, fancying yourself strong enough to go alone, when you are really the slave of your own passions and appetites and the playthings of the devil; but His loving, loyal son through the strength of God, and able to do what you will, because what you will God wills also.|$|R
