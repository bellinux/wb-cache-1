40|$|This effort {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} relationship between shock-breakout pressure {{and the amount of}} micron-scale fragments ejected (ejecta) upon shock release at the metal/vacuum interface of Sn targets shocked with a supported shockwave. The results are compared with an analogous set derived from HE shocked Sn targets, Taylor shockwave loading. The supported shock-pulse was created by impacting a Sn target with a Ti 64 (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) impactor that was accelerated using a powder gun. Ejecta production at the free-surface or back-side of the Sn targets were characterized through use of piezoelectric pins and Asay foils, and heterodyne velocimetry verified the time of shock release and the <b>breakout</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} studies 3003 {{aluminum alloys}} for automobile heat exchangers. The effects of precipitation in homogenization treatments, recrystallization in extrusion and brazing on extrusion forming ability and final material properties are examined. At first, fine second phase particles were precipitated during the 460 C 9 h homogenization treatment and coarse particles were precipitated by homogenization treatments with 600 C 9 h. Second, when the precipitation were not plentiful and fine enough during extrusion, {{the amount of}} solution dominated the extrusion <b>breakout</b> <b>pressure,</b> and recrystallization was easier; on the contrary, the domination state was replaced by plentiful and fine precipitated particles, and recrystallization became more difficult. Additionally, the hardness after extrusion was lower in the complete recrystallization position, and higher in the incomplete recrystallization position. Finally, in brazing, the sample under the 460 C 9 h condition (a) underwent full recrystallization from partial recrystallization with a reduction in strength; the local position of {{the edge of the}} sample under the 600 C 9 h! 460 C 3 h condition (c) exhibited a second recrystallization and a significant drop in hardness.

40|$|Diesel engines, {{characterized}} by higher <b>breakout</b> <b>pressure</b> and compression ratio {{in comparison with}} gasoline engines, require particularly elevated tensile properties for their engine parts. In order to maintain both high strength and high ductility in the cylinder head, i. e., to obtain higher percent elongation without further reducing the tensile strength, AlSi 9 Cu 1 alloy was used to prepare the cylinder head in an aluminum diesel engine. At the same time, the effect of different modification elements, Na or Sr, and Fe content on the reduction of secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) was discussed, and the design of T 7 heat treatment parameters were analyzed {{in order to improve}} the tensile ductility. The result shows: (1) The SDAS is as small as 18 ± 3 μm for the Sr modified alloy. (2) The percent elongation of the alloy with Sr modification increases by 66. 7 % and 42. 9 %, respectively, compared with the unmodified alloy and the alloy with Na modification. (3) Lower Fe content alloy (0. 10 %) gives good results in percent elongation compared to the alloy with higher Fe content (0. 27 %); in particular, after Sr modification and T 7 heat treatment, the elongation of over 5 % is obtained...|$|E

30|$|Pore {{pressure}} {{along the}} rock segment ranges from 29.7  MPa at 3000  m to 31.3  MPa at 3183  m, giving an average value of 30.4  MPa. Ideally to ensure equilibrium and to deter fluid {{flow into the}} wellbore, the applied mud pressure should, at least, match the maximum pore pressure within the reservoir. Once a well bore is drilled, a pore pressure gradient is naturally established with the lowest magnitude occurring at the wellbore. This phenomenon is essential for enabling fluid flow towards the well. Hence, mud pressure is used to control the pressure gradient and fluid flow. It {{is also used to}} maintain well stability by preventing well collapse due to excessive shear and compressive stresses at the periphery of drilled cavities. The magnitude of mud pressure applied is therefore subject to many factors. Excessive high mud pressure may lead to tensile failure and loss of fluid during circulation. On the other hand, insufficient mud pressures may instigate compressive failure and wellbore <b>breakouts.</b> Mud <b>pressures</b> that are too low may not be sufficient to prevent uncontrollable inward flow and well collapse. A pressure gradient was established by setting the pore pressure at the wellbore surface to 23.95  MPa in order to initiate fluid flow.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the time-dependent {{evolution of a}} relativistic jet following its breakout through {{the surface of a}} massive compact star, as envisaged in the collapsar model of gamma-ray bursts. At breakout, the jet is tightly collimated by the pressure of its hot cocoon, which is created as the jet traverses the star. After <b>breakout,</b> the cocoon <b>pressure</b> drops and the jet expands toward its natural opening angle. We show that the evolving opening angle of the jet produces a stratification of the total energy with the off-axis angle, resulting in a universal morphology. The angular structure is largely independent of the initial beam pattern and depends only on the luminosity of the central engine. With the minimal assumption of a constant energy release we reproduce the theta^{- 2 } profile required to explain observations of afterglows. Comment: 4 pages, uses emulateapj (macros included).

40|$|The UCSD brine {{chemistry}} {{program is}} providing highly accurate {{models of the}} behavior of high temperature brines to be used by the geothermal community to optimize production, interpret formation behavior and assist in performance assessment. Models are now available as user-oriented programs packaged for both main frame and personal computers (IBM and Macintosh). A manual describing the models and their application to various geothermal problems has been developed and made available to potential users. Tutorial sessions have been held and future sessions are planned. Present models can be used to predict the behavior of many important geothermal processes. For example, the tendency for production fluids to form carbonate, silica and sulfate scales can be predicted as a function of brine composition, temperature and CO{sub 2 } partial pressure. The <b>breakout</b> <b>pressure</b> (onset of two phase flow) can be calculated as a function of temperature and brine composition. Preliminary models are available for characterizing H{sub 2 }S gas/liquid distributions and the acid-base properties of the H{sub S}S-H{sub 2 }O system as a function of brine composition, temperature and pressure. For the past year, a substantial part of this research has focused on the prediction of the properties of gases in the CO{sub 2 }-CH{sub 4 }-H{sub 2 }O system. We have developed highly accurate equations of state for each of the endmembers of the system for a pressure range of 0 to 8000 bar and temperatures from 0 to 1000 C. In order to treat the mixtures of importance to geothermal applications, a mixing model based on the end-members has been developed. The resulting equation of state for mixtures can be integrated analytically to obtain the free energies and enthalpies of the mixed gases for a temperature range of 50 to 1000 C and pressures from 0 to 3000 bar. Predictions of this model are within the accuracy of the experimental data and can predict the properties of the liquid phase, the gas phase and the coexistence of these phases with roughly equal accuracy...|$|E
40|$|How massive {{were the}} first stars? This {{question}} is of fundamental importance for galaxy formation and cosmic reionization.

Protostellar evolution is treated with a model that tracks the total energy of the star. A key difference compared to previous studies is allowance for rotation of the infalling envelope.

40|$|Abstract. How massive {{were the}} first stars? This {{question}} is of fundamental importance for galaxy formation and cosmic reionization. Here we consider how protostellar feedback can limit the mass of a forming star. For this we must understand {{the rate at which}} primordial protostars accrete, how they and their feedback output evolve, and how this feedback interacts with the infalling matter. We describe the accretion rate with an “isentropic accretion ” model: ˙m ∗ is initially very large (0. 03 M ⊙ yr− 1 when m ∗ = 1 M ⊙) and declines as m− 3 / 7 ∗. Protostellar evolution is treated with a model that tracks the total energy of the star. A key difference compared to previous studies is allowance for rotation of the infalling envelope. This leads to photospheric conditions at the star and dramatic differences in the feedback. Two feedback mechanisms are considered: HII region <b>breakout</b> and radiation <b>pressure</b> from Lyman-α and FUV photons. Radiation pressure appears to be the dominant mechanism for suppressing infall, becoming dynamically important around 20 M⊙. THE COLLAPSE OF PRIMORDIAL GAS CLOUDS Recent numerical studies have followed the gravitational collapse of perturbations from cosmological to almost stellar dimensions[1, 2].
