40|$|Rye bran, {{oat bran}} and <b>barley</b> <b>fibre</b> have been {{compared}} as additives in low-fat sausages and meatballs. The water/protein ratio and starch content were constant to allow direct comparisons. Oat bran {{was the best}} alternative in low-fat sausages due to its gelling ability upon heating. These sausages exhibited low process (0. 9 %) and frying losses (10. 9 %), and high values of firmness (11. 0 N) and sensory acceptance. The sausages containing <b>barley</b> <b>fibre,</b> with the highest amount of soluble β-glucan, had high losses (3. 8 % and 19. 6 %) and the lowest firmness (4. 6 N). Rye bran was suitable in meatballs, probably due to its particulate nature, which is more acceptable {{in this type of}} meat product, where the gelling properties are not as important as in sausages. There {{was no significant difference between}} the firmness of meatballs containing rye bran (6. 1 N) and the reference (7. 5 N), after pan-frying.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Butyric acid is {{produced}} by degradation of dietary fibre by microbiota and is crucial for maintaining a healthy colon. The physicochemical properties are important for butyric acid formation, and this study aimed {{to evaluate the use}} of malting to tailor the functional characteristics of <b>barley</b> dietary <b>fibre.</b> The effect of different steeping conditions was evaluated in laboratory-scale malting experiments with three different barley varieties. RESULTS: Steeping at 35 °C and with 0. 4 % (v/v) lactic acid resulted in a higher content of β-glucan and soluble fibre in malts than in those steeped at lower temperature and lower lactic acid concentration. Resistant starch increased, whereas the content of soluble arabinoxylan was lower. Dietary fibre components in Tipple were more affected by steeping conditions than the other varieties. The total contents of iron, phytate and amylose were little influenced by steeping conditions. CONCLUSION: The selection of steeping conditions during malting influences composition and the characteristics of dietary <b>fibre</b> in <b>barley.</b> However, the choice of barley variety is also important for tailoring of functional ingredients beneficial for colonic health...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} {{characteristics of}} native and bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) in oats and barley-based fermented products were studied {{in relation to}} the physico-chemical properties. Article I presents a parallel-randomized double blind clinical trial using a dairy-based product (control), an oat-based product (fermented with V 2, which is a mixture (1 : 1) of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. Thermophilus / Lactobacillus acidophilus) and a ropy, oat-based product (fermented with V 2 / Pediococcus damnosus 2. 6 (Pd)). The total cholesterol level in subjects fed the ropy, oat-based product was significantly reduced from 6. 08 mmol/L to 5. 82 mmol/L (4. 3 %), P = 0. 007 and this decrease differed significantly (6 %, P = 0. 022) from the value obtained for the group fed the dairy-based (control) product. A drop of 5. 5 % in LDL-cholesterol was also observed as compared with the run-in value in the group fed ropy, oat-based product. In article II, the ability of different lactic acid bacteria to influence the physico-chemical characteristics (content, viscosity and molecular weight) of dietary fibre in ?-glucan rich barley and oat concentrates was investigated. Two methodologies, one including filtration and another centrifugation-dialysis, to quantify the dietary fibre, were compared. The centrifugation-dialysis method generally resulted in significantly (P < 0. 05) higher values than the filtration method with the exception of soluble <b>barley</b> <b>fibres.</b> The insoluble fibre content was found to decrease after fermentation. The maximum viscosity of the soluble fibre in oat fibre concentrates decreased after fermentation. However, the molecular weight was apparently not affected. In article III, the molar mass and rheological properties of an exopolysaccharide (EPS) from Pediococcus damnosus 2. 6 were investigated. The EPS was observed to be a flexible chain polymer with molar mass, 4. 0 x 106 gmol- 1. Rheological behaviour of the EPS was compared to that of a commercial cereal ?-glucan (0. 359 x 106 gmol- 1). The maximum storage modulus G´max for EPS solution was lower than that for the cereal ?-glucan at all concentrations while the relaxation time, trelax was higher. In article IV, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) formation in rats fed fermented oat fibre concentrates was compared with that of rats fed native oat fibre concentrate. All the fermented fibre concentrates resulted in a higher propionic acid concentration in the distal colon (P< 0. 05), while rats fed Pd fermented fibre concentrate gave lower concentration of butyric acid (P< 0. 05, P< 0. 01) {{in all parts of the}} hindgut as compared with rats fed the native fibre concentrates. The fermented fibre concentrates seemed to favour the formation of acetic and propionic acid, while the native fibre concentrate favoured the formation of butyric acid...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that dietary fibre is good for the health. Cereals, and in {{particular}} the outer parts of the cereal kernels, are rich in dietary fibre. Rye bran, wheat bran, oat bran and <b>barley</b> <b>fibre</b> have been investigated regarding their suitability as additives in low-fat meat products. Two types of meat products, frankfurter-type sausages and meatballs have been evaluated in this thesis. In the sausages the meat protein network governs the texture and water-holding properties, whereas the meatballs have a more particulate structure, where a more crumble texture is perceived and the water-holding capacity is lower. Cereal bran particles can be difficult to add to a food-system without also adding a disagreeable sensation of grittiness. Evaluations of how the size and concentration of small rye bran particles in a continuous phase of varying viscosity influence the sensory perception of grittiness were performed. The threshold for the sensation of grittiness resulting from rye bran particles in a starch gel was very low and independent of the particle size. The particles were detected already at concentrations of 0. 1 - 0. 3 %, {{despite the fact that they}} were so small (20 - 180 μm). The rheological properties of the suspension medium did not influence the detection threshold. One reason for this obvious perception of grittiness of rye bran particles could be their irregular shape and hardness. One way of altering these adverse properties of the bran particles could be by treating them with hydrolytic enzymes. The xylanases and endoglucanases evaluated in this thesis did not increase the water-holding capacity of the rye or wheat bran or the viscosity of the aqueous phase. The water-holding capacity was probably reduced because of the lower amount of insoluble material after solubilization by the enzymes, while the lower viscosity showed that the solubilized dietary fibre were degraded into smaller molecules which could no longer contribute to the viscosity. Due to the gelling ability of the inherent β-glucan of the oat bran upon heating, it was found to be the most suitable for addition to low-fat sausages. These sausages exhibited low process and frying losses, together with high values of both firmness and sensory acceptance. The <b>barley</b> <b>fibre</b> gave a poor texture of the sausages and was the least preferred. This barley β-glucan could not form a gel, probably because of a smaller molecular weight and a less favourable structure, compared to the oat β-glucan. Rye bran is suitable for addition to meatballs, probably due to its particulate nature, which is more acceptable in this type of meat product, where the gelling properties are not as important as in sausages...|$|E
40|$|The {{enrichment}} of gluten-free {{baked products}} with dietary fibre {{seems to be}} necessary since {{it has been reported}} that coeliac patients have generally a low intake of fibre due to their gluten-free diet. In the present study different cereal fibres (wheat, maize, oat and barley) were added at 3, 6 and 9 g/ 100 g level into a gluten-free bread formulation based on corn starch, rice flour and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). Doughs were evaluated based on consistency, viscosity and thermal properties. Results showed that maize and oat fibre can be added to gluten-free bread with positive impact on bread nutritional and sensory properties. All breads with 9 g/ 100 g fibre increased the fibre content of control by 218 %, but they were rated lower than those with 3 and 6 g/ 100 g fibre due to their powdery taste. The formulation containing <b>barley</b> <b>fibre</b> produced loaves that had more intense color and volume comparable to the control. During storage of breads a reduction in crumb moisture content and an increase in firmness were observed. The micrographs of the crumb showed the continuous matrix between starch and maize and/or oat fibre obtaining a more aerated structure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Effect of {{microbial}} phytase supplementation on apparent ileal {{and total}} tract digestibility, utilisation of phosphorus (P) and protein in wet <b>barley</b> protein with <b>fibre</b> (WBPF), {{a by-product of}} the integrated starch [...] ethanol process, was studied in six ileal cannulated pigs (live weight 89 [...] 120 kg). Three dietary treatments containing microbial phytase either 0, 250 or 500 FTU kg- 1 dry matter (DM) were assigned using a two-period change-over design. WBPF was the sole source of P and protein in semi-purified experimental diet. WBPF phosphorus and crude protein contents were 5. 4 and 237 g kg- 1 DM, respectively. No inositol hexa- or pentaphosphates were found in WBPF, while only 1 g of P was {{in the form of}} inositol tetra- or triphosphates. Lysine, threonine, methionine and cystine contents in WBPF protein were 2. 4, 2. 8, 1. 3 and 1. 8 g 16 g- 1 N, respectively. Microbial phytase supplementation improved apparent ileal P (p< 0. 10) and calcium (p< 0. 05) digestibility in WBPF diets with no effect on total tract digestibility. No significant differences were found in the degradation of phytates in WBPF at the ileal or total tract level. Phytase supplementation tended to improve apparent ileal ash digestibility (p< 0. 10) and depressed that of ether extract in WBPF diets (p< 0. 05). Apparent ileal and total tract P digestibility in WBPF was very high even without microbial phytase supplementation (ileal digestibility: 58. 3 % and total tract digestibility: 59. 3 %). Daily P retention was the same for all treatments. Microbial phytase supplementation had no effect on apparent ileal or total tract crude protein digestibility (means 79. 5 and 83. 5 %, respectively) in WBPF. Apparent ileal cystine digestibility tended to decline after phytase supplementation (p< 0. 10), but otherwise the amino acid digestibilities in WBPF were similar. Average apparent ileal digestibilities of lysine, threonine, methionine and cystine in WBPF were 74. 1, 73. 1, 83. 2 and 81. 6 %, respectively. No differences were found in daily nitrogen retention between treatments. vo...|$|R
40|$|Fine tuning a {{nutritional}} strategy by incorporating dietary fibre (DF) in pig diets {{can help to}} improve gut health. Fermentation of DF, especially the soluble fraction, in pig intestines yields short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid, which {{have been found to}} improve gut health by favouring the growth of health-promoting bacteria such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, at the expense of pathogenic ones like Clostridium or Salmonella, which may enhance the health of host species. The presence of fermentable fibre in the pig diet can also contribute to reducing nitrogen (N) excretion, which can {{have a positive impact on}} the environmental footprint, one of the main concerns of a modern commercial pork production. The overall objective of this thesis project was to evaluate the fermentation characteristics of a selection of feedstuffs in the pig intestines and their potential impact on the gut environment and nitrogen excretion. The evaluation was performed by executing two projects using both in vitro and in vivo studies. The first project focused on the fermentation characteristics of hulless barley in comparison to hulled barley and oats and their effects on the gut environment, especially the production of fermentation metabolites. The rate of fibre fermentation in the intestines was first studied by means of an in vitro gas production technique. The results demonstrated that hulless barleys have higher fermentability and produce higher amounts of SCFA than hulled barley and oats. An experiment carried out on pigs confirmed that the fermentation of the soluble fibre fraction of hulless barley in the gut leads to increased production of SCFA and lactic acid, which in turn contribute to the growth of potentially beneficial microbiota and decrease potentially harmful bacteria, an indicator of improved gut health. This finding shows that gut health parameters may be modulated. Thus gut health could potentially be improved through feed formulation by a judicious selection of feed ingredients with specific fibre fractions, not only by the addition of isolated fibres, which is commonly recommended at present. The second project was executed to study the effect of some feedstuffs differing in their DF and protein content on fermentation characteristics and N excretion in pigs. The feedstuffs included wheat bran, wood cellulose, peas, pea hulls, pea inner fibre, sugar beet pulp, flax seed meal and corn distiller's dried grains with solubles. The results showed that peas and pea fibre-based diets produced higher amounts of SCFA and reduced N excreted, compared to others. In a parallel in vitro study, fermentation characteristics and bacterial protein synthesis was also studied using the same feed ingredients. The findings of the in vitro study corraborated the results of the in vivo experiment. These studies showed that peas and pea fibres have the potential to be used in pig diets in order to gain gut health-benefits and reduce N excretion. From this thesis, it can be concluded that sources and type of dietary fibre have a significant effect on the production of fermentation metabolites in the pig intestine and on N excretion. Among the feed ingredients studied, hulless <b>barley</b> and pea <b>fibres</b> seem to have the greatest potential to be included in pig diets as a source of fermentable fibre to modulate the gut environment, which in turn, extend possibly health-promoting properties and reduce N excretion from pigs. However, further research is needed to understand the specific health benefits of these fibre sources and to quantify the specific fibre components required to achieve these benefits...|$|R

Protein supplementation increased silage and total DM intake by about 0. 5 kg/day (P 0. 05). Milk yield (P 0. 1), protein content (P 0. 05) and protein yield (P 0. 01) were increased. Untreated DDS {{had no effect on}} milk yield or milk composition compared with the control diet. Treatment of TDDS increased milk and protein yield compared with DDS, and milk yields were similar to that obtained with rapeseed meal.

Liveweight gain was higher (P 0. 05) in cows fed on rapeseed meal diet than in cows fed on DDS.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present experiment was to {{study the effects of}} partial replacement of barley grain with <b>barley</b> <b>fibre</b> (BF) on animal performance, carcass traits and diet digestibility of growing dairy bulls. The feeding experiment comprised 20 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 12 Holstein-Friesian bulls, and four treatments (8 bulls per treatment). There were four diets with two offered at stage 1 (from the initiation of the study to 450 kg live weight) and four at stage 2 (from 450 kg live weight to slaughter). The control diet (BF 0) included grass silage (460 g kg 1 dry matter) and barley grain (540), BF 25 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (405) and BF (135), BF 50 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (270) and BF (270), and BF 75 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (135) and BF (405). At stage 1 there were only two treatments (BF 0 and BF 50) and at stage 2, all four treatments were included. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The mean initial live weight of the bulls was 261 kg and the mean final live weight 650 kg. At stage 1 there were no significant treatment differences in dry matter, energy or protein intakes or in live weight gain. At stage 2, replacing barley grain with BF led to a linear decrease of daily live weight gain (P < 0. 05) and a linearly reduced feed conversion (kg dry matter kg 1 live weight gain) (P < 0. 05). The apparent digestibility of the organic matter and neutral detergent fibre decreased linearly with increasing BF supplementation (P < 0. 001). The dressing proportion and the carcass fat score decreased linearly (P < 0. 05) with partial replacement of barley grain with BF. On carcass conformation, treatment had a significant (P < 0. 05) quadratic effect: the BF 25 and BF 50 diets were classified highest. The results indicate that 50 % of barley starch can be replaced with BF without affecting growth, but feed efficiency factors may decrease when barley starch is replaced with BF. At 75 % replacement, feed intake was reduced, which resulted in a lower energy intake and reduced level of performance. ...|$|E

The experiment comprised 24 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 8 Holstein-Friesian bulls and included four treatments. The control diet (C) consisted of moderate digestible (653 g digestible organic matter in dry matter (DM) grass silage (450 g kg- 1 DM), barley grain (275) and <b>barley</b> <b>fibre</b> (275) without protein supplementation. Three isonitrogenous experimental diets included also extra protein, i. e. (1) rapeseed meal (RSM) (supplementation 530 g DM per animal day- 1), (2) wet distillers solubles (WDS) (600 g) and (3) a mixture of barley protein (90 % of fresh weight) and wet distillers solubles (10) (BPWDS) (480 g). In all isonitrogenous diets the crude protein content of concentrate increased from 137 to 150 g kg- 1 DM (9 %) compared with the C diet. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The energy content of all diets was 11. 6 MJ kg- 1 DM. The live weight gain of the bulls tended to be higher with the BPWDS diet than with the C diet (C 1214 vs. BPWDS 1301 g d- 1; p = 0. 10), but the treatments had no significant effect on carcass gain, feed conversion or slaughter parameters. Only the BPWDS diet differed significantly from the C diet in DM (C 9. 69 vs. BPWDS 10. 38 kg DM d- 1; p < 0. 01) and energy intake (C 112. 4 vs. BPWDS 120. 3 MJ d- 1; p < 0. 05). The apparent organic matter digestibility (OMD) was 5 % higher in the BPWDS diet than in the C diet (p < 0. 001), but the RSM and WDS diets did not differ from the C diet in OMD. The results indicate that the supply of protein in dairy bulls is most probably adequate with moderate digestible, well-preserved grass silage and barley-based concentrates when intake of digestible organic matter is high enough to support microbial protein synthesis in the rumen. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{carbohydrate}} composition of finishing diet (fed from 80 to 107 kg of body weight) {{and the length of}} pre-slaughter fasting on pork quality were studied in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment with 80 crossbred pigs. The control finishing diet was based on barley and soybean meal, and the fibrous finishing diet was based on barley, <b>barley</b> <b>fibre,</b> faba beans, and rapeseed cake. These diets contained 465 and 362 g starch and 177 and 250 g dietary fibre per kg, respectively. The fasting times of 25 and 41 h were obtained by giving the pigs their last meal at different times. Longer fasting lowered the glycolytic potential of the longissimus lumborum muscle (P = 0. 01), whereas the finishing diet had no effect. Different muscles responded differently to the treatments. Longer fasting increased the ultimate pH of the semimembranosus muscle (P = 0. 02), but did not affect that of the longissimus lumborum and semispinalis capitis muscles. The finishing diets did not affect the ultimate pH of the investigated muscles. A diet × fasting time interaction was seen in the lightness of the semimembranosus muscle (P = 0. 05). The fibrous diet resulted in darker meat than the control diet did in pigs that were fasted for 25 h (P < 0. 05). Longer fasting darkened the meat colour in pigs fed the fibrous diet (P < 0. 05) but not in those fed the control diet. The meat from the semispinalis capitis muscle was darker in pigs fed the fibrous than those fed the control diet (P = 0. 04). The treatments did not affect the colour of the longissimus lumborum muscle. Longer fasting decreased drip loss from the meat of pigs fed the control diet (P < 0. 05). The eating quality of the pork was not influenced by the finishing diets or the fasting time. The pigs also grew equally fast on both finishing diets. In conclusion, a moderate alteration in the carbohydrate composition of a finishing diet or longer pre-slaughter fasting can have some effects on pork quality in crossbred pigs, but these effects vary in different muscles. ...|$|E
40|$|Oats {{are unique}} among the cereals {{due to its}} high content of mixed-linked (1 - 3),(1 - 4) ß-D-glucan (ß-glucan), a highly viscous dietary fibre {{component}} which may have several physiological effects. The aims of the thesis were to study the glycemic response and gastric emptying rate of an oat fibre test meal in diabetic subjects, to elucidate the mechanisms behind the serum cholesterol lowering effects of oat fibre, and to study the small bowel excretion of energy supplying nutrients as well as iron absorption from diets with oat bran, <b>barley</b> <b>fibre</b> and wheat bread. The specific effect of oat bran ß-glucan was studied by comparing the physiological effects of oat bran bread with added ß-glucanase {{with the effects of}} normal oat bran bread. Controlled diets were served in two-day periods to ileostomy subjects or as test meals with postprandial blood sampling. Ileostomy effluent was frequently sampled and immediately frozen. Radioisotope-technique was used for measurement of gastric emptying rate and of cholesterol and iron absorption. A portion of oat bran porridge (4 g ß-glucan) did not influence glycemic and insulinemic responses or gastric emptying rate compared to a low-fibre control meal in NIDDM subjects. Oat bran ß-glucan (8. 7 g/d) increased 24 -h bile acid excretion by 83 %, and by 93 % after the oat bran test meal (6 g ß-glucan), high in fat and cholesterol. Cholesterol absorption was unchanged while the excretion of endogenous cholesterol decreased after the oat fibre test meal. The changes in serum lathosterol concentration, reflecting cholesterol synthesis, correlated with changes in sterol excretion. Fat excretion increased and {{there seemed to be a}} delay in the lipid solubilization process observed as a reduced increase in serum chylomicron lipids. The oat ß-glucan did not influence small bowel nutrient excretion. Less than 50 % of the energy excreted with the oat and barley diets was supplied by the fibre per se. Iron absorption was lower from the oat bran diets compared to a low-fibre, low-phytate wheat diet. The iron absorption was related to the phytate content of the oat, barley and wheat diets independent of the amount of ß-glucan. In conclusion, the main physiological effect of oat fibre is an increase in bile acid excretion mediated by the ß-glucan. This induces several changes in cholesterol metabolism which most probably explains the cholesterol lowering effect of oat fibre. Oat fibre does not seem to decrease nutrient absorption from the small intestine but may delay the lipid absorption process...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 160 growing-finishing pigs with initial body weights of 27 kg and {{originating}} from eight farms {{were used in}} a performance trial to investigate the effects of dietary fibre content (medium or high) and growth-promoting feed additives (none, avilamycin, formic acid or formic acid-sorbate blend) on pig growth, the feed to gain ratio and the incidence of diarrhoea. Medium-fibre grower and finisher diets (188 and 196 g neutral detergent fibre (NDF) /kg dry matter (DM)) were composed of barley and soybean meal and the respective high-fibre diets (239 and 284 g NDF/kg DM) of barley, oats, <b>barley</b> <b>fibre,</b> peas, soybean meal and vegetable oil. Both medium- and high-fibre diets were similar in net energy (8. 7 MJ/kg) and ileal digestible lysine content (8. 0 and 6. 6 g/kg for grower and finisher diets, respectively). Avilamycin (40 mg/kg) was added to grower diets only whereas formic acid (8 g/kg) and formic acid-sorbate blend (8 g/kg formic acid and 0. 4 g/kg potassium sorbate) were added to both grower and finisher diets. No diet × additive interactions were observed in the performance or carcass characteristics of pigs. Dietary fibre content {{did not affect the}} growth or feed to gain ratio of pigs. In the growing period, pigs fed diets with avilamycin, formic acid or formic acid-sorbate blend grew faster and had a lower feed to gain ratio than did those fed diets without additives. The differences between the additives were not significant. In the finishing period, pigs fed acidified diets grew faster and utilised feed more efficiently than did those in the avilamycin group. Furthermore, formic acid-sorbate blend enhanced pig performance more than did plain formic acid. For the total fattening period, the average growth rates were 856, 878, 896 and 930 g/d and the feed to gain ratios 2. 55, 2. 51, 2. 43 and 2. 32 kg DM/kg gain for diets without additives and with avilamycin, formic acid and formic acid-sorbate blend, respectively. Additives improved the growth and feed to gain ratio compared to diets without additives. Performance was better with organic acid supplementation of grower and finisher diets than with avilamycin supplementation of grower diet only. In addition, formic acid-sorbate blend improved the feed to gain ratio more than did plain formic acid. In the growing period, additives decreased the incidence of diarrhoea in the medium-fibre diet. In the high-fibre diet, the incidence of diarrhoea was generally low, except in the avilamycin treatment. We concluded that formic acid and formic acid-sorbate blend were equally effective alternatives to the antibiotic avilamycin in grower diets. Since organic acids can be added to finisher diets as well, their use resulted in further improvements in pig performance compared to avilamycin which can be used in grower diets only. The efficacy of formic acid as a growth promoter was intensified with sorbate addition. v 2002 okEripainoksia saatavissa tekijält...|$|E
