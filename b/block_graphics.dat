5000|$|The {{method is}} one of the {{interpolation}} options available in the free software GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP). One way to visualise the ringing effect is to rescale a black and white <b>block</b> <b>graphic</b> and select Lanczos interpolation.|$|R
50|$|A {{supplemental}} feature {{was that}} the <b>block</b> <b>graphic</b> and box-drawing characters of code page 437 remained unchanged (IBM's official Central-European code page 852 did not have this property, making programs like Norton Commander look funny with corners and joints of border lines broken by accented letters).|$|R
5000|$|The {{screen memory}} {{occupies}} {{the space between}} $200 and $3FF. In addition to the standard 8 bits of screen RAM, there was an additional single bit RAM shadowing the $200 to $300 space. This was configured as a 9th bit write-only plane, and {{was used by the}} Microtan 65 for rudimentary, or [...] "chunky", graphics. Setting the 9th bit displayed a Minitel type <b>block</b> <b>graphic.</b>|$|R

50|$|The seminal {{use of this}} {{technology}} was in the TRS-80 where {{the only way to}} get discrete pixels on the screen that could be turned on and off individually, (all points addressable) was by the use of a 2×3 pixel matrix of <b>block</b> <b>graphics.</b> In the case of the TRS-80 these <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> were not incorporated into a font ROM, as later became the norm, but were generated directly from the logic pattern of six bits from the video RAM using a dedicated circuit made from logic gates.|$|E
5000|$|Character ROM - 2 KB (2716 EPROM) {{contains}} character definitions, {{characters are}} 8 x 13 pixels, the <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> were vertically divided in a 4:5:4 scheme, and horizontally in a 4:4 scheme.|$|E

50|$|Trying to kick-start the market, AT&T Corporation {{entered the}} fray, and in May 1981 {{announced}} its own Presentation Layer Protocol (PLP). This was closely {{based on the}} Canadian Telidon system, but added to it some further graphics primitives and a syntax for defining macros, algorithms to define cleaner pixel spacing for the (arbitrarily sizeable) text, and also dynamically redefinable characters and a mosaic <b>block</b> <b>graphic</b> character set, {{so that it could}} reproduce content from the French Antiope. After some further revisions this was adopted in 1983 as ANSI standard X3.110, more commonly called NAPLPS, the North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax. It was also adopted in 1988 as the presentation-layer syntax for NABTS, the North American Broadcast Teletext Specification.|$|R
5000|$|The Sinclair ZX80 and ZX81 {{relied on}} <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> {{characters}} for a low-resolution graphics of 64×48 pixels black-and-white or 32×48 in black, white, and dithered gray {{as seen in}} the ZX80 character set and ZX81 character set.|$|E
5000|$|The TRS-80 home {{computer}} additions included 64 semigraphics characters (0x80 through 0xAF) that implemented low-resolution <b>block</b> <b>graphics.</b> (Each block-graphic character displayed as a 2x3 grid of pixels, with each block pixel effectively controlled {{by one of}} the lower 6 bits.) ...|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} {{non-standard}} ASCIIs, ATASCII {{has its own}} special <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> symbols (arrows, blocks, circles, line segments, playing card suits, etc.) corresponding to the control character locations of the standard ASCII table (characters 0 - 31), {{and a few other}} character locations.|$|E
50|$|T <b>block</b> {{includes}} a <b>Graphic</b> Design room, a Resistant Materials room, a practical room and an ICT room.|$|R
50|$|Ideographic Description Characters is a Unicode <b>block</b> {{containing}} <b>graphic</b> characters {{used for}} describing CJK ideographs. They {{are not intended}} to provide a mechanism for the composition of complex characters, whether already encoded or not, but are used within Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS) for that purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Full-screen {{resolution}} {{generated by}} the SAA5050 was 480&times;500 pixels, corresponding to 40&times;25 characters. Each character position therefore corresponded to a 12&times;20 pixel space. Internally each character shape was defined on a 5&times;9 pixel grid. This was then interpolated by smoothing diagonals to give a 10&times;18 pixel character, with a characteristically angular shape, surrounded {{to the top and}} to the left by two pixels of blank space. This gave a particularly stable and flicker-free arrangement on interlaced displays. The alternate set of 2&times;3 <b>block</b> <b>graphic</b> characters were created on the same 12&times;20 pixel grid, so that the top two blocks were each 6&times;6 pixels, the middle two blocks each 6&times;8 pixels, and the bottom two blocks again 6&times;6 pixels (or two fewer in each direction, if the [...] "separated graphics" [...] control character had been sent).|$|R
5000|$|Development of a French teletext-like system {{began in}} 1973. A very simple 2-way {{videotex}} system called Tictac was also {{demonstrated in the}} mid-1970s. As in the UK, this led on to work to develop a common display standard for videotex and teletext, called Antiope, which was finalised in 1977. Antiope had similar capabilities to the UK system for displaying alphanumeric text and chunky [...] "mosaic" [...] character-based <b>block</b> <b>graphics.</b> A difference however was that while in the UK standard control codes automatically also occupied one character position on screen, Antiope allowed for [...] "non spacing" [...] control codes. This allowed Antiope slightly more flexibility {{in the use of}} colours in mosaic <b>block</b> <b>graphics,</b> and in presenting the accents and diacritics of the French language.|$|E
50|$|All non-UDG Spectrum {{characters}} can be {{mapped to}} Unicode. The three non ASCII-1967 characters ↑, £ and © are at U+2191, U+00A3 and U+00A9. The 2×2 <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> characters {{are in the}} Block Elements block at U+2580-U+259F although font support for the latter is not universal.|$|E
50|$|The Atari ST port {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} commercially released games for the system, coming out shortly after the computer's June 1985 launch. It utilizes mostly simple <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> with little enhancement for the ST's hardware capabilities and runs from within TOS, not a self-booting disk as most Atari ST games do.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his first}} London show, with a {{collection}} inspired by water, Goot was noticed for his “pragmatic modernism” of “liquid prints… colour <b>blocked</b> jersey and <b>graphic</b> simplicity.” ...|$|R
50|$|NoLimits 2 was {{released}} on 10 January 2014. As well as features from the original simulator, NoLimits 2 also includes transfer tracks, storage <b>blocks,</b> greatly improved <b>graphics</b> and more.|$|R
50|$|The VDPAU {{interface}} is to {{be implemented}} by device drivers, such as Nvidia GeForce driver, nouveau, amdgpu, to offer end-user software, such as VLC media player or GStreamer, a standardized access to available video decompression acceleration hardware {{in the form of}} application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) <b>blocks</b> on <b>graphics</b> processing units (GPU), such as Nvidia's PureVideo or AMD's Unified Video Decoder and make use of it.|$|R
5000|$|By {{selecting}} the appropriate 2 pixel text <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> character from the video ROM, {{even though the}} technical resolution was 80 x 100, the effective resolution was 160 x 100. Fig. 2 above uses the same graphics character normally used in an XCGA image to display a graphic in standard color text mode ...|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} ways to accomplish the emulation of a raster graphics. The first one {{is to create a}} low-resolution all-points-addressable mode using a set of special characters with all binary combinations of a certain subdivision matrix of the text mode character size; this method referred to as <b>block</b> <b>graphics,</b> or sometimes mosaic graphics.|$|E
50|$|Mazovia {{encoding}} is used under DOS {{to represent}} Polish texts. Basically it is code page 437 with some positions filled with Polish letters. An important feature {{was that the}} block graphic characters of code page 437 remained unchanged. In contrast, IBM's official Central-European code page 852 did not preserve all <b>block</b> <b>graphics,</b> causing incorrect display in programs such as Norton Commander.|$|E
50|$|The School's {{campus is}} located in central Ipswich, and {{features}} a mixture of historic buildings dating to its inception in 1892 and more modern facilities which have been added over the years. The buildings are spread around the campus, interspersed with many green areas and gardens. Facilities include the performing arts <b>block,</b> state-of-the-art <b>graphics</b> and art studios, gymnasium, swimming pool and specialised language classrooms.|$|R
5000|$|As {{indicated}} above, PETSCII {{provides for}} shifting between the power-on default (unshifted) uppercase+graphics character {{set and the}} alternative (shifted) lower+uppercase set (where the shifted set contains {{a subset of the}} <b>block</b> <b>graphic</b> characters of the unshifted set). The shift between modes is done by POKEing location 59468 with the value 14 to select the alternative set or 12 to revert to standard. On C64 the sets are alternated by flipping bit 2 of the byte 53272. On some models of PET this can also be achieved via special control code [...] which adjust the line spacing as well as changing the character set; the POKE method is still available and does not alter the line spacing. Thus, screen editor state changes, rather than the employment of separate ASCII codes, are used to choose between single-case (all capitals) and dual case. In the VIC-20, C64, and later machines (not including the CBM business computers), color codes supplement the other screen control codes. (The colors of the VIC-20 and C64/128 are listed in the VIC-II article.) ...|$|R
50|$|The college, {{which is}} {{under the control of}} the Mission College New Plymouth Trust Board, became an {{integrated}} secondary school, with an attached intermediate school in 1982. Buildings erected since then include the library, staff room and administrative facilities known as the Centennial Wing, a Mathematics block, Religious Studies <b>block</b> and <b>Graphics</b> workshops and a new 5-classroom block (including soft materials technology). The college is situated in spacious grounds which include tennis courts, netball courts and sports field.|$|R
50|$|The chip {{generated}} appropriate {{video output}} for a 7-bit input character code representing the current character {{on the text}} line, while {{keeping track of the}} effect of any of the various control characters defined by the teletext standard that had previously occurred in that text line, which could be used to change the foreground and background colour, switch to or from the alternate <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> character set, or various other effects.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes {{the number}} of {{characters}} in the font, dedicated to <b>block</b> <b>graphics,</b> could be halved if the system also supported an [...] "invert" [...] attribute, as half the characters in a full <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> font set are the logical inverse of {{the other half of}} the font set. Other tricks that were used to decrease {{the number of}} needed characters, was to use a space for the [...] "all bits are zero" [...] character, and to use character 7F hex for the [...] "all bits are on" [...] character, as character 7F hex (decimal 127) was often defined as an [...] "all pixels on" [...] character (this because of the fact that when using papertape punching out all seven holes, created the 7F hex [...] "byte" [...] which was considered to be the [...] "DEL" [...] or [...] "rub-out" [...] character). The assignment in ASCII of the rub-out character (to the code point 127) lead designers of VDUs to use [...] "rub-out" [...] for a character square filled with [...] "ink", which was often used to represent the cursor.|$|E
50|$|There are 11 <b>block</b> <b>graphics</b> characters, {{counting}} code point 0 {{which also}} doubles as space. Together with the 11 inverse video versions these 22 code points provide every {{combination of the}} character cell divided into 2×2 black-and-white block pixels for low-resolution 64×48 pixel graphics, or into 1×2 black, white or dithered gray wide block pixels for a 32×48 resolution. The 2×2 versions of these are also present in the Block Elements Unicode block.|$|E
50|$|Kaypro II - The first commercially {{released}} Kaypro was {{an immediate}} success, dominating its competition, the Osborne I microcomputer. The Kaypro II had a 9-inch internal monitor instead of the Osborne's tiny 5 inch display, and single sided floppy drives. A redesigned version of the Kaypro II was released in 1984 that allowed <b>block</b> style <b>graphics,</b> and had half-height drives. This version of the Kaypro II had a version of Space Invaders along with the typical ASCII games.|$|R
5000|$|After the Nick Jr. block {{ended its}} 21-year run on February 2, 2009, with Ni Hao, Kai-Lan {{as the last}} program to air, Nick Jr. shows {{continued}} to air in the same slot, but with the Nickelodeon branding. 7 months and 26 days later, Noggin was rebranded as Nick Jr. on September 28, with the block temporarily rebranded as Play Date. The <b>block</b> used <b>graphics</b> from the Nick Jr. branding that started on the same day.|$|R
5000|$|PETSCII {{also has}} a text mode, in which {{lowercase}} letters occupy the range $41 - $5A, and uppercase letters occupy the range $C1 - $DA. The text mode is not available at powerup, but must be actuated by holding one of the SHIFT keys and then press and release the Commodore key. Regardless of whether the chip has undergone this graphic [...] "shift", there are <b>block</b> <b>graphic</b> characters {{in the range of}} $E0-FF. This serves to distinguish PETSCII from those kinds of ASCII that go back no farther than ASCII-1967, so any text transfer between an 8-bit Commodore machine and one that uses 1967-derived ASCII would result in text where uppercase letters appear to be lowercase, and lowercase letters uppercase. There is no easy Boolean operation to change these cases to the proper case. Thus, as with other computers based on non-standard-ASCII character sets, software conversion is needed when exchanging text files and/or telecommunicating with standard ASCII systems. The other ranges are unchanged in shifted mode; this means that the other characters added in ASCII-1967 besides lowercase lettersi.e. the grave accent, curly braces, vertical bar, and tildedo not exist in PETSCII.|$|R
