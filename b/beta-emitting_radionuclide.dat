40|$|The {{mechanism}} of biological activation by <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> tritium was studied. Luminous marine bacteria {{were used as}} a bioassay to monitor the biological effect of tritium with luminescence intensity as the physiological parameter tested. Two different types of tritium sources were used: HTO molecules distributed regularly in the surrounding aqueous medium, and a solid source with tritium atoms fixed on its surface (tritium-labeled films, 0. 11, 0. 28, 0. 91, and 2. 36 MBq/cm 2). When using the tritium-labeled films, tritium penetration into the cells was prevented. The both types of tritium sources revealed similar changes in the bacterial luminescence kinetics: a delay period followed by bioluminescence activation. No monotonic dependences of bioluminescence activation efficiency on specific radioactivities of the films were found. A 15 -day exposure to tritiated water (100 MBq/L) did not reveal mutations in bacterial DNA. The results obtained give preference to a “non-genomic” {{mechanism of}} bioluminescence activation by tritium.

The Bremsstrahlung dose from patient administered Î²-ray emitted radionuclide has been calculated by extending the national council on Radiation Protection and measurement model of a point source in air to account for biologic elimination of activity. We have estimated the probability of bremsstrahlung production, specific Bremsstrahlung constant (defined by Zanzonico etÂ al.) and activity (Arelease) in bone cortical, bone compact, different regions of tooth enamel (enamel dentin junction (EDJ), enamel middle surface, enamel inner surface), different regions of dentin (outer surface, middle surface, enamel dentin junction (EDJ)), soft tissue, lungs and skeleton for different therapeutic <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide.</b> In the present calculations we have used modified atomic number (Zmod) defined for bremsstrahlung process. Proper localization and quantification of incorporated beta emitters in bone and tooth are possible, because Bremsstrahlung production is greater in bone and tooth than soft tissue due to their high modified atomic number (Zmod). Radionuclide therapy with pure Î²-ray emitters emitted in bone, tooth, soft tissue, lungs and skeleton does not require medical confinement of patients for radiation protection. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether bacterial genetic alteration is responsible for bioluminescence kinetics change under low-dose radiation exposure. The alphaemitting radionuclide 241 Am and <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> 3 H were used as the sources of low-dose ionizing radiation. Changes of bioluminescence kinetics of Photobacterium phosphoreum in solutions of 241 Am(NO 3) 3, 7 kBq/L, and tritiated water, 100 MBq/L, were studied; bioluminescence kinetics stages (absence of effect, activation, and inhibition) were determined. Bacterial suspension was sampled at different stages of the bioluminescent kinetics; the doses accumulated by the samples were close or a little higher than a tentative limit of a low-dose interval: 0. 10 and 0. 85 Gy for 241 Am, or 0. 11 and 0. 18 Gy for 3 H. Sequence analysis of the 16 S ribosomal RNA gene did not reveal a mutagenic effect of low-dose alpha and beta radiation in the bacterial samples. Previous results on bacterial DNA exposed to low-dose gamma radiation (0. 25 Gy) were analyzed and compared to those for alpha and beta irradiation.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to assess, by means of MCNPX simulations, the doses delivered around and throughout a solid tumor when the radioactive atom linked to each antibody is replaced by a 5 nm diameter nanoparticle composed of numerous radionuclides. A new model for a spherical vascularized tumor has been developed in which the antibody distributions inside the tumor can be uniform or heterogeneous. It is also possible to simulate a central necrotic core inside the tumor where the concentration of radiolabeled antibodies is assumed to be zero. Dosimetry calculations have been performed for the <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> Y 290 O 3. Preliminary results show that the irregularity of vasculature and the presence of a necrotic core have a noticeable influence on the deposited dose profiles. Moreover, with a total activity of 5 and 34 MBq for tumor radii of 0. 5 and 1. 0 cm, respectively, viable tumor cells can receive doses of up to 50 Gy, even if high nonuniformity of the total activity is observed in the tumor.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Much recent {{effort has}} been focused on the {{development}} of monitoring methods to calculate the percentage of biomass in the fuel used for energy generation in power plants. One possible method is based on measurements of radio-carbon concentration in combustion gases by liquid scintillation (LS) spectrometry. Fossil fuels contain no 14 C due to their age. Therefore, after the combustion of such fuels, the resulting CO 2 contains no 14 C as well. The only source of 14 C comes from the admixture of biomass containing modern carbon. 14 C is a <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> with a maximum beta energy of 156 keV. There is no emission of gamma rays during decay; therefore, no possibility of gamma spectrometry exists. A difficult task thus is to validate the method and to calibrate it in agreement with the known amount of biomass in the fuel. For this purpose, a set of samples was prepared that were mixtures of hard coal and biomass with a known percentage of carbon. The oxycombustion method was applied for sample preparation in which the combustion of the fuel is done in pure oxygen; therefore, the combustion gas contains mostly CO 2 and steam. The CO 2 from the gas sample is then adsorbed by 3 -methoxy-propylamine. A known amount of this absorbent was mixed with a scintillation cocktail and measured in the LS spectrometer. In this way, a calibration curve has been obtained, allowing quantitative measurements of biomass content in the fuel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only availableOne {{approach}} {{to the treatment of}} cancer is to direct <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> to the cancer site where the radiation destroys the cancer cells. This can be achieved by coordinating the radioisotope in a very stable environment and linking it to a specific biological targeting molecule, which interacts specifically with particular cancer cells. It is necessary to have extremely stable in vivo radionuclide complexes so that limited amounts of radiation are released {{to other parts of the}} body before the radionuclide can reach the cancer cells. Isotopes of radioactive Rhenium are characteristic of such a nuclide. Our emphasis was to obtain a Rhenium (III) metal ligand complex since the lower oxidation state is more kinetically inert relative to Rhenium (V). The method employed was to first produce the ReV-ligand complex, [ReVOCl(Sal 2 phen) ], by reacting a 1 : 2 molar ratio of TBA[ReVIIOCl 4] to Sal 2 phen. Next, [ReVOCl(Sal 2 phen) ] was reacted with three equivalents of triphenylphosphine to determine whether a mono-substituted ReV complex or a di-substituted ReIII complex was formed. After purifying the product by solvent extraction, the coordinated complex was reacted with ammonium hexaflurophoshate, NH 4 PF 6, to induce crystallization of the target compound, [ReIII(PPh 3) 2 (Sal 2 phen) ][PF 6]. Preliminary 1 H NMR, and FT-IT spectra suggest formation of trans-[ReIII(PPh 3) 2 (sal 2 phen) ]PF 6.

40|$|Peptide {{receptor}} {{radionuclide therapy}} (PRRT) consists in the systemic administration of a synthetic peptide, labelled with a suitable <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide,</b> able to irradiate tumours and their metastases via the internalization through a specific receptor, overexpressed {{on the cell}} membrane. After 15 years of experience, {{we can state that}} PRRT with 90 Y- labelled peptides is generally well tolerated. Acute side effects are usually mild, some of which are related to the co-administration of amino acids, such as nausea. Others are related to the radiopeptide, such as fatigue or the exacerbation of an endocrine syndrome, which rarely occurs in functioning tumours. Chronic and permanent effects on target organs, particularly the kidneys and the bone marrow, are generally mild if the necessary precautions are taken. Currently, the potential risk to kidney and red marrow limits the amount of radioactivity that may be administered. However, when tumour masses are irradiated with adequate doses, volume reduction may be observed. 90 Y-octreotide has been the most widely used radiopeptide in the first 8 - 10 years of experience. Unfortunately, all of the published results derive from different and inhomogeneous phase I/II studies. Hence, a direct comparison is virtually impossible to date. Nevertheless, even with these limitations, objective responses are registered in 10 - 34 % of patients. The optimal timing of 90 Y-DOTATOC in the management of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) -positive tumours {{and the way in which}} it should be integrated with other treatments have yet to be defined, and prospective phase II/III trials comparing the efficacy and toxicity of different schemes of 90 Y-DOTATOC administration are still warranted.

40|$|Compared with beta emitters, {{radionuclides}} that decay by {{electron capture}} or solely by isomerie transition are generally considered preferable for nuclear medicine {{because they do}} not release paniculate radiations from the nucleus during decay, and hence presumably con tribute less absorbed dose and biological damage to surrounding tissue. In this regard, the recent article by Rao, Govelitz, and Sastry (/) is of considerable interest because it reveals similar radiotoxicities for the elec tron-capture radionuclide Tl- 201 and the <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> Tl- 204, in spite of the 6 : 1 ratio of absorbed dose from Tl- 204 compared with Tl- 201 as computed by conventional dosimetrie methods. This observation implies that the radiobiological effectiveness is consid erably greater for radiations from Tl- 201 than for those from Tl- 204. As the authors point out, the radiations responsible for the local absorbed dose from Tl- 201 are principally low-energy electrons resulting from nonradiative Auger and Costcr-Kronig transitions. From questions asked by a number of individuals, it appears that these transitions are not familiar to all readers of the Journal. Hence, an explanation in relatively nontechnical terms may be useful. The Tl- 201 nucleus decays by electron capture, in which an electron, usually one occupying an inner shell, is captured by the nucleus. This process leaves a vacancy in the electron shell. The capture process reduces the atomic number of the nucleus by one to form Hg- 201 in an excited energy state. Decay to the ground state of Hg- 201 occurs by isomerie transition, in which energy is released, cither as 7 (radiative transitions) or through the process of internal conversion (nonradiative transi tions). In internal conversion, the released energy is carried from the atom by an electron ejected from a...|$|E

Radioisotope micro-power sources (RIMS) hold great promise for the development of small power sources for use in numerous applications, including micro electromechanical (MEMS) systems, due to the five orders of magnitude difference in the specific energy density available in radioactive decay versus chemical reactions. While a number of conversion schemes can be employed in RIMS, direct voltaic conversion technologies are compatible with the semiconductor manufacturing processes used in MEMS. A direct conversion solid-state betavoltaic RIMS device consists of a p-n semiconductor coupled with a <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide.</b> Liquid semiconductor betavoltaic devices were investigated simultaneously with the solid-state designs as an alternative concept designed to minimize radiation induced lattice damage that occurs in solid-state devices formed through interaction with high-energy charged particles. A liquid semiconductor RIMS device operates similarly to a solid-state semiconductor; however, the device uses Schottky and ohmic contacts that encapsulate a radionuclide in its liquid state. Radioisotopes used for the fabrication of solidstate semiconductor sources include ₃₃P and ₁₄₇Pm. Sulfur- 35 was selected as the isotope for liquid semiconductor tests because it can be produced in high specific activity and it is chemically compatible with the liquid semiconductor media under investigation.

40|$|Technetium- 99 (Tc) is a redox active, <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> and {{a mobile}} {{contaminant}} in groundwaters at nuclear {{facilities in the}} UK and USA. Additionally, it has been released to the natural environment in authorised and accidental discharges, {{and is expected to}} be a radiologically significant component of spent nuclear fuel due to its long half-life (2. 13 x 105 y) and potentially high environmental mobility. In terms of its environmental behaviour, the speciation of Tc is the major control on its mobility. Under oxic conditions the highly mobile TcO 4 - is expected to dominate whilst, under reducing conditions, poorly soluble reduced species (predominantly Tc(IV)) are expected. Here we apply XAS techniques to determine the speciation of Tc in a range of sediments that have been subjected to biologically mediated redox transformations. In sediments, microbially-mediated reactions control the development of sediment anoxia and, thus control Tc speciation and mobility. Experiments show that microbially mediated reduction of sediments led to reduction of soluble TcO 4 - to poorly soluble Tc(IV) during Fe(III) -reduction and the Tc was present as hydrous TcO 2 in a range of systems. We also studied the behaviour of Tc on reoxidation of the sediments with air, which is relevant to disturbance of Tc-contaminated sediments, and via microbially mediated “anoxic oxidation” with nitrate. Anoxic oxidation is relevant to proposed bioremediation plans for contaminated sites where reducing conditions are stimulated in the sub-surface by addition of organic matter. In this context, when environmental stewardship of these sites ceases, sub-oxic, nitrate-rich water may flush the anoxic area and mediate reoxidation of the sediments. On air reoxidation 50 - 80 % of the sediment bound Tc was remobilised to solution as TcO 4 - whilst on nitrate reoxidation typically < 10 % of the sediment bound Tc was remobilised. The speciation of the Tc remaining on the sediments was site- and biogeochemistry-specific with both a mix of hydrous TcO 2 and Tc(VII) being the most common form of Tc after reoxidation, but with one air reoxidised sediment containing only hydrous TcO 2...|$|E
30|$|Low-energy <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides,</b> such as 177 Lu and 131 I, are {{considered}} favourable to maximise the absorbed dose in tumours {{of this small}} size. For pragmatic reasons, the choice for a therapeutic radionuclide is often between the beta-emitters 90 Y and 177 Lu, as both are readily available. The latter choice (177 Lu) seems to be optimal, as the mean beta-energy of 0.133 MeV yields a high probability of cure in the 1 - to 3 -mm (0.5 to 14 mm 3) size range [3]. The high-energy beta-emitter 90 Y (0.933 MeV) shows optimal tumour control in the 28 - to 42 -mm range. Neither 213 Bi nor any other α-emitter was evaluated in the paper by O'Donoghue et al., but with the availability of 225 Ac generators [4] the short-range emitter 213 Bi has become a very interesting radionuclide for PRRT as well.|$|R

For radioimmunotherapy, a <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> labeled to a bivalent peptide is required. Therapeutic efficacy of these radionuclides depends on the E(max), physical half-life, and residence time of the radiolabel in the tumor. The (131) I radiolabel generally clears rapidly from the tumor after internalization and subsequent degradation of the bivalent l-amino acid peptide (l-a. a. peptide) in the tumor cells. To improve the residence time of the iodine label in the tumor, a new bivalent peptide was synthesized that is peptidase resistant and consists of 4 d-amino acids (d-a. a. peptide).

METHODS: The d-a. a. peptide was manually synthesized according to standard solid-phase Fmoc/HBTU (2 -[1 H-benzotriazole- 1 -yl]- 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) chemistry. The uptake and retention in the tumor of (111) In-/(125) I-labeled bivalent peptides (l-a. a. peptide and d-a. a. peptide) were studied in female BALB/c athymic mice with subcutaneous SK-RC- 52 RCC tumors. Tumors were pretargeted with the bispecific monoclonal antibody (bs-mAb) G 250 xDTIn- 1 and, 72 h later, mice were injected intravenously with one of both radiolabeled peptides. The effect of bs-mAb-diDTPA-bs-mAb (DTPA is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) bridging at the tumor cell surface on the internalization of the bs-mAb-diDTPA complex was investigated in SK-RC- 52 tumor-bearing mice. RESULTS: The maximum uptake and retention of (125) I-labeled l-a. a. peptide in the tumor were significantly lower compared with that of the (111) In-labeled l-a. a. peptide. In contrast, the tumor uptake and retention of the (125) I-labeled d-a. a. peptide) were {{similar to that of the}} (111) In-labeled l-a. a. peptide but were superior at later time points. The biodistribution of the radioiodinated d-a. a. peptide was highly similar to that of the (111) In-labeled d-a. a. peptide, and both radiolabeled peptides were retained significantly better in the tumor than the (111) In-labeled l-a. a. peptide. bs-mAb-diDTPA-bs-mAb bridge formation did not affect internalization of the bs-mAb-diDTPA complex. CONCLUSION: Uptake and retention in the tumor of the iodinated peptide after pretargeting with a bs-mAb can be significantly improved using d-a. a. peptides. Accordingly, the radiation dose to the tumor, correlating with the therapeutic efficacy of pretargeted RCC, can be enhanced substantially...|$|E
40|$|Pretargeted {{radioimmunotherapy}} (PRIT) {{with the}} <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide</b> 177 Lu {{is an attractive}} approach to treat carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) -expressing tumors. The therapeutic efficacy of PRIT might be improved using alpha-emitting radionuclides such as 213 Bi. Herein, we report and compare the tumor-targeting properties and therapeutic efficacy of 213 Bi and 177 Lu for PRIT of CEA-expressing xenografts, using the bispecific monoclonal antibody TF 2 (anti-CEA x anti-histamine-succinyl-glycine [HSG]) and the di-HSG-DOTA peptide IMP 288. Methods: The in vitro binding characteristics of 213 Bi-IMP 288 were {{compared with those of}} 177 Lu-IMP 288. Tumor targeting of 213 Bi-IMP 288 and 177 Lu-IMP 288 was studied in mice bearing subcutaneous LS 174 T tumors that were pretargeted with TF 2. Finally, the effect of 213 Bi-IMP 288 (6, 12, or 17 MBq) and 177 Lu-IMP 288 (60 MBq) on tumor growth and survival was assessed. Toxicity was determined by monitoring body weight, analyzing blood samples for hematologic and renal toxicity (hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, creatinine), and immunohistochemical analysis of the kidneys. Results: The in vitro binding characteristics of 213 Bi-IMP 288 (dissociation constant, 0. 45 +/- 0. 20 nM) to TF 2 -pretargeted LS 174 T cells were similar to those of 177 Lu-IMP 288 (dissociation constant, 0. 53 +/- 0. 12 nM). In vivo accumulation of 213 Bi-IMP 288 in LS 174 T tumors was observed as early as 15 min after injection (9. 2 +/- 2. 0 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g). 213 Bi-IMP 288 cleared rapidly from the circulation; at 30 min after injection, the blood levels were 0. 44 +/- 0. 28 %ID/g. Uptake in normal tissues was low, except for the kidneys, where uptake was 1. 8 +/- 1. 1 %ID/g at 30 min after injection. The biodistribution of 213 Bi-IMP 288 was comparable to that of 177 Lu-IMP 288. Mice treated with a single dose of 213 Bi-IMP 288 or 177 Lu-IMP 288 showed significant inhibition of tumor growth. Median survival for the groups treated with phosphate-buffered saline, 6 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288, 12 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288, and 60 MBq 177 Lu-IMP 288 was 22, 31, 45, and 42 d, respectively. Mice receiving 17 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288 showed significant weight loss, resulting in a median survival of only 24 d. No changes in hemoglobin, platelets, or leukocytes were observed in the treatment groups. However, immunohistochemical analysis of the kidneys of mice treated with 17 or 12 MBq 213 Bi-IMP 288 showed signs of tubular damage, indicating nephrotoxicity. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study shows {{for the first time that}} PRIT with TF 2 and 213 Bi-IMP 288 is feasible and at least as effective as 177 Lu-IMP 288. However, at higher doses, kidney toxicity was observed. Future studies are warranted to determine the optimal dosing schedule to improve therapeutic efficacy while reducing renal toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Intra-arterial {{microsphere}} radioembolization is {{an increasingly}} applied technique {{for treatment of}} unresectable liver tumors. During radioembolization, microspheres (diameter 30 μm) loaded with a high-energy <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclide,</b> such as yttrium- 90 (Y- 90) and holmium- 166 (Ho- 166), are instilled in the hepatic artery via a catheter. The majority of microspheres will accumulate {{in and around the}} liver tumors, because these are almost exclusively perfused by arterial blood, whereas the healthy liver tissue mainly depends on the portal vein for its blood supply. Prior to treatment, a scout dose of technetium- 99 m macro-aggregated albumin (Tc- 99 m-MAA) particles, which serve as microsphere-surrogates and aim to predict the in vivo distribution of the treatment dose of microspheres, is administered to the patient for treatment planning. Image-based assessment of both the scout dose and the treatment dose distribution (for therapy evaluation) can be performed by the nuclear imaging techniques Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In this thesis, quantitative nuclear imaging methods are developed, evaluated, and exploited to enable accurate assessment of the in vivo Y- 90 and Ho- 166 microsphere distribution for dosimetry in radioembolization. It was found with phantom experiments and Monte Carlo simulations that Y- 90 and Ho- 166 gamma-camera images are heavily affected by photon scatter, photon attenuation, and penetration of high-energy photons through the collimator septa. Extensive correction for all of these image degrading effects is required to enable reconstruction of quantitatively accurate Y- 90 and Ho- 166 SPECT images. However, hindered by the broad range and continuous nature of the photon energy spectra, only approximate correction models are included in current state-of-the-art clinical Y- 90 and Ho- 166 SPECT reconstruction algorithms. In contrast, model-based correction techniques for scatter, random, and attenuation effects are clinically available for Y- 90 PET imaging. Consequently, state-of-the-art clinical Y- 90 PET images were found to be superior to state-of-the-art clinical Bremsstrahlung SPECT images for assessment of the microsphere distribution after Y- 90 radioembolization. Motivated by the cost-effectiveness and wide availability of SPECT cameras, a new Y- 90 Bremsstrahlung SPECT reconstruction algorithm was developed, incorporating a fast Monte Carlo simulator for correction of the image degrading effects. The Monte Carlo-based reconstruction approach substantially improved the quantitative accuracy of Y- 90 Bremsstrahlung SPECT images, which may be used as an alternative to Y- 90 PET images for post-treatment dosimetry in Y- 90 radioembolization. The Monte Carlo-based reconstruction approach also improved the quantitative accuracy of Ho- 166 SPECT images, as was demonstrated in phantom experiments. Furthermore, it was shown in a clinical Ho- 166 radioembolization study that the in vivo distribution of both a scout dose and a treatment dose of Ho- 166 microspheres can be accurately quantified withSPECT. A scout dose of Ho- 166 microspheres was found to be a significantly better predictor for the mean radiation absorbed dose to the lungs, which is an important contra-indication for radioembolization, than a scout dose of Tc- 99 m-MAA microsphere-surrogates. These results indicate that treatment planning in radioembolization is improved by using the same quantifiable microspheres for scout dose and treatment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the course}} of {{decommissioning}} former nuclear facilities, the surrounding premises must be surveyed for possible contamination by radioactive material. A lot of fission or activation products (137 Cs, 134 Cs, 133 Ba, 60 Co, 152 Eu, etc.) can be detected quite easily using gamma spectrometry. Although pure <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides</b> such as 3 H, 14 C, and 90 Sr and the transuranic nuclides 238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu and 241 Pu are difficult to detect by gamma spectrometry, they can be detected using liquid scintillation counting (LSC) (3 H, 14 C, 90 Sr, 241 Pu) and alpha spectrometry (238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu). This paper demonstrates the sample preparation procedure for the determination of 3 H, 14 C, 90 Sr, 238 Pu, 239 Pu, 240 Pu, and 241 Pu by LSC and alpha spectrometry by appropriate chemical separation. The analyses showed that the ratios of activity concen-trations of Pu isotopes are constant. Thus, by defining a suitable key nuclide {{it was possible to}} determine a nuclide vector for Pu isotopes in soils for the premises of a former light-water research reactor...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{development of}} small passive, solid-state detectors for in-situ measurements of tritium, or other weak <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides,</b> on surfaces. One form of detector operates {{on the principle}} of thermally stimulated exoelectron emission (TSEE), the other by discharge of an electret ion chamber (EIC). There are currently two specific types of commercially available detector systems that lend themselves to making surface measurements. One is the thin-film BeO on a graphite disc, and the other is the Teflon EIC. Two other types of TSEE dosimeters (ceramic BeO and carbon doped alumina) are described but lack either a suitable commercially available reader or standardized methods of fabrication. The small size of these detectors allows deployment in locations difficult to access with conventional windowless gas-flow proportional counters. Preliminary testing shows that quantitative measurements are realized with exposure times of 1 [...] 10 hours for the TSEE dosimeters (at the DOE release guideline of 5, 000 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 } for fixed beta contamination). The EIC detectors exhibit an MDA of 26, 000 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 } for a 24 hour exposure. Both types of integrating device are inexpensive and reusable. Measurements can, therefore, be made that are faster, cheaper, safer, and better than those possible with baseline monitoring technology...|$|R
40|$|Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) {{peptides}} preferentially bind to alphavbeta 3 integrin, an integrin expressed on {{newly formed}} endothelial cells and on various tumor cells. When labeled with <b>beta-emitting</b> <b>radionuclides,</b> these peptides {{can be used}} for peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy of malignant tumors. These studies aimed to investigate whether tumor targeting and tumor therapy could be optimized by dose fractionation. The RGD-peptide DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2 was labeled with 111 In for biodistribution experiments and with 90 Y for therapy experiments. In mice with NIH:OVCAR- 3 ovarian carcinoma xenografts, optimal tumor uptake was obtained at peptide doses up to 1. 0 microg (4. 8 %ID/g). A peptide dose of 5 microg, required to administer the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) 90 Y-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2, was administered as 5 portions of 1. 0 microg. Tumor uptake of the fifth portion was significantly higher than that of the single 5. 0 microg portion (3. 3 %ID/g versus 2. 1 %ID/g). The therapeutic efficacy of 37 MBq 90 Y-DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2 (1 x 5. 0 microg) was compared with that of 37 MBq administered in five equal portions (5 x 1. 0 microg). No difference in tumor growth between the fractionated and the nonfractionated therapy was observed. In conclusion, dose fractionation resulted in higher radiation doses. However, therapeutic efficacy of the radiolabeled peptide was not significantly improved by dose fractionation...|$|R
