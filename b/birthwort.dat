The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. <b>Birthwort</b> has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{an early}} spring butterfly. Adults fly from April to June in a single brood. [...] The adults are active {{for no more than}} three weeks. The females lay their eggs singly or in small groups {{at the bottom of the}} host plants. The eggs are spherical and whitish at first, bluish colored before hatching. The {{caterpillars}} feed on <b>birthworts</b> (mainly (Aristolochia clematitis, Aristolochia rotunda, Aristolochia pistolochia, Aristolochia pallida). The special food of the larvae provides the toxic substances which then also go to the adults, making them inedible. The young caterpillars feed at first on flowers and young shoots, while after the second molt they feed on leaves. The pupae stay linked to a support by a silk belt for wintering and the new adults hatch the next spring.|$|R
