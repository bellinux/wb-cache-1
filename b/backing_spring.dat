40|$|Rubber forming is {{a common}} process for the {{fabrication}} of flanged metallic parts in the aerospace industry. The process enables cheap tooling, which is important since the product series are limited. In the process a rigid and a soft tool are combined to form a metal blank into the required shape. Most components made in this way are “flanged parts”, i. e. parts with a rather flat web plate and curved flanges at {{the periphery of the}} web plate. For flanged parts the determination of <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of the flanges, straight or curved, is important, since the forming dies compensated with the <b>spring</b> <b>back,</b> should result in accurate products. Like all metal forming processes elastic and plastic deformations are combined in the same process cycle. The elastic deformations result in <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and residual stresses, the ratio between these two depends on the shape of the product and the distribution of the plastic and elastic deformations. In this research an aluminium alloy was used. The low Young’s modulus of this alloy results in rather high elastic responses upon deformation. Other aspects that have been evaluated are the effect of processing parameters like friction and distribution of strains. For stretch flanges the strain is distributed evenly along the flange, but not for shrink flanges, where buckling plays a role. Experimental research shows that the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of the flanges depend on a number of variables like the thickness, flange geometry, and material parameters. The <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> of a flange is also a mixture of different contributions: <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to the bending over the bend line, <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to the curvature of the flange, and <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> due to in-plane deformations. The research performed focused on the different components of the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and their interaction. Analysis of the data resulted in a new parameter by which a number of variables could be captured. This improves the understanding of the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> phenomena and a generalization of the results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effect of process {{parameters}} such as Blank Holder Force (BHF) and Feed Rate, on the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> behavior of a polymer metal laminate (PML) system comprised of aluminum and polypropylene. Specimens were formed over a hemispherical punch in stamp forming process. A novel real time strain measuring system, ARAMIS, was employed to capture the strain evolution during forming. The results of this work indicate that both BHF and feed-rate exert influence in PML <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> behavior. Fundamental correlation between strain evolution during <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and {{the shape of the}} finished part will be presented. A major finding from this work is that aluminum dominates the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> behavior of PML in stamp forming...|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} of the metal to regain its original shape {{will result in the}} <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> when it is being formed to make aircraft components like outer body panels and brackets. When <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> occurs, the components will not meet the requirements of the design {{and there will be a}} need for shims to fit the component into place. This will lead to increase in weight, fabrication cost and also the assembly line time. So the Finite-Element Analysis (FEA) is used to accurately predict this deflection so that manufacturing processes can be optimized to produce a perfect output with least deviations from the design. This thesis bridges a relation between the experimentally evaluated <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and FEA calculated <b>spring</b> <b>back.</b> Also in order to validate the FEA Analysis regression analysis has been performed. Variations have been tabulated and graphed as it bridges the gap between experimentally evaluated <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> and analysis of the design...|$|R

Walker's improvement to the design was to facilitate true one handed opening of the knife. [...] This was accomplished by removing the weak <b>back</b> <b>spring</b> and adding a heat-treated stop pin to align the blade in the open position. [...] Walker added a detent ball to hold the blade in the closed position using the same spring force from the liner.|$|R

50|$|For {{producing}} single {{pieces as}} well as small batches with the same precision and efficiency as series-produced parts, a <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> compensation is helpful.

40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{studied the}} appropriate factors and conditions for laminated bamboo bending by Design of Experiments (DOE). The interested factors affecting the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> in laminates bamboo were (1) time, (2) thickness, and (3) frequency. This experiment tested the specimen by using high frequency machine and measured its <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> immediately and next 24 hours for comparing the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> ratio. Results from the experiments showed that significant factors having major influence to bending of laminates bamboo were thickness and frequency. The appropriate conditions of thickness and frequency were 4 mm. and 1. 5 respectively...|$|R
50|$|Land {{subsidence}} {{also allows}} brackish water intrusion into the Delta, an issue {{compounded by the}} diversion of up to 25% of the freshwater flowing into the Delta. The decreased volume of freshwater in the Delta has {{had a profound effect}} on its ecology. In most years, large dams in the Delta watershed fully hold <b>back</b> <b>spring</b> runoff; as a result the Delta is most susceptible to salinity intrusion between February and June. However, regulation provided by dams helps boost freshwater flows during dry summers and autumns, reducing the risk of salinity intrusion in these months.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this project, it {{is planned}} {{to carry out}} a {{complete}} microstructural characterization of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) currently used in the automotive industry. These steels have an elastic effect, called <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect, during the sheet metal forming of parts. This <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> is the main problem of this family of steels during the production process of the structural components of the automotive industry: especially for dimensional problems in automotive structural components. It is therefore necessary to evaluate changes in microstructure during the stages of sheet metal forming in order to know precisely the microstructural and mechanical behavior of material after being subjected to this effect. Steels studied in this research work are currently used by all major automobile industries, which are dual-phase (DP) 600 and 780. The <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect mechanical characterization was performed by means of a mechanical bending test, called as Air Bending. The results indicate that the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect in the DP 780 has the highest <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> rate due to its high mechanical strength due to Hall-Petchphenomenom. The comparison of analyses EBSD before and after bending tests showed a relation between the misorientation of grains and the <b>spring</b> <b>back</b> effect. The results obtained by microstructure analysis of EBSD confirmed the tendency of DP 780 absorb a greater amount of energy during the deformation, thus resulting in greater springback effect...|$|R
