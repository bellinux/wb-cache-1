25|$|Following on {{from the}} mod revival of the late 70s, the UK {{witnessed}} a revival of rude boy and skinhead fashion due to the popularity of ska punk, Oi! punk rock, rocksteady, and two tone music {{during the winter of}} discontent. In the early 80s, slim fitting mohair, tonic and houndstooth suits were popular, together with <b>basket</b> <b>weave</b> shoes, polo shirts, sta-prest trousers, Doc Martens, braces, Harrington jackets and pork pie hats popularized by bands like the Specials, UB40, the Bosstones, and Madness. In response to the racism of white power skinheads, 1980s rude boys wore checkerboard motifs to signify that both black and white people were welcome. Crew cuts and buzzcuts were worn by both sexes, and girls often incorporated hair bangs in a partially shaven style known as a Chelsea mohawk. In Brighton, the Skins of the 1980s fought the outlaw bikers and rockabilly guys, as the Mods and Rockers had previously done in the 60s.|$|E
25|$|Employing asymmetry, heavy massing, {{high quality}} brickwork, {{semi-circular}} forms and simplified ornamentation, {{the design of}} St Paul's combines characteristics of Gothic, Romanesque and Arts and Crafts styles. The church is constructed in dark-red-brown Flemish bond brickwork, with painted render dressings defining features such as string courses, copings, lintels and sills (internally and externally). Stepped and plain buttresses support the exterior walls, and arched openings are constructed from multiple rowlock (brick-on-edge) courses. The prominent roof form is clad with rib-and-pan profile metal sheeting (replaced in 1997), and features flared eaves supported on decoratively trimmed rafters with a raked soffit of tongue-and-groove boards. The nave end walls are topped with stone cross finials, and gable ends to the vestries and entrance porch are finished with <b>basket</b> <b>weave</b> patterned brickwork. The entrance porch features a radiating arch with deep angled brick jambs, rounded window openings and a boarded ceiling. The belfry atop the octagonal bell tower is enclosed with fixed timber louvres between brick piers of alternating, three-course bands of rendered and face brickwork capped by a concrete hemispherical cupola.|$|E
2500|$|Manicured locks — {{alternatively}} called salon locks or fashion locks — have numerous styling {{options that}} include strategic parting, sectioning and patterning of the dreads. Popular dreadlocked styles include cornrows, the braid-out style or [...] "lock crinkles", the <b>basket</b> <b>weave</b> and pipe-cleaner curls. Others include {{a variety of}} dreaded mohawks or lock-hawks, a variety of braided buns, and combinations of basic style elements.|$|E

50|$|A <b>basket</b> <b>weave</b> knot {{is made up}} of {{two sets}} of {{parallel}} lines drawn inside a rectangle such that the lines meet {{at the edges of the}} rectangle. For a true <b>basket</b> <b>weave</b> knot that can be tied with two strands, the number of intersections in each direction cannot have a common divisor. Within this constraint, there is no theoretical upper limit to the size of a <b>basket</b> <b>weave</b> knot. Thus, a knot that has two intersections in one direction can be lengthened with any odd number in the perpendicular direction. If the dimension n in the smaller direction is odd, it is always possible to construct a knot with n + 2 intersections in the other dimension. However, large <b>basket</b> <b>weave</b> knots have a tendency to twist and curl because they are completely flat.|$|E

5000|$|As a child Mabel McKay (Pomo) had {{dreams that}} foresaw her roles of a sucking doctor and basket weaver. During these dreams {{she learned to}} <b>weave</b> <b>baskets</b> as young as six years old and was {{inspired}} for designs and their special uses. McKay believed [...] "baskets are living entities, not just pretty objects to look at, and each basket has a particular purpose." [...] She connected baskets with her healing as a doctor and would give a patient a basket of their own. McKay began holding classes to share her <b>basket</b> <b>weaving</b> skills and helped to introduce traditional <b>basket</b> <b>weaving</b> to those outside of the Native American community. During the 1950s and 1960s McKay also made public-speaking engagements at universities and museums in California on Native American culture {{and the art of}} <b>basket</b> <b>weaving.</b> By 1975, McKay was known as the last remaining spiritual adviser of the Pomoans.
