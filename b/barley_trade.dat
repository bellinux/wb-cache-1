2500|$|After {{the battle}} in 1807, the British Navy began a six-year {{blockade}} of Denmark {{as part of the}} ongoing Napoleonic wars, cutting off the Monopoly <b>barley</b> <b>trade</b> which had supplied 80% of the Faroes Islanders' grain needs. To stave off famine, Nólsoyar Páll obtained a pass from the British, and brought a load of barley back with him in October 1807. The following summer, after two British ships in succession had plundered the Faroes of all Danish government property, he sailed back to Denmark {{at the request of the}} Tórshavn commandant to try to obtain more grain, but Royndin Fríða was seized by a British warship and irreparably damaged. Taken to London, he and his crew obtained the Privy Council's sympathy and a replacement ship, the North Star; in this ship they sailed soon after 17 November 1808 with what was to have been the first of several grain shipments, but were lost at sea, presumably in the heavy storms of November and December that year. The famine was not averted until 1810, when an arrangement was made with the British. The depth of the hatred between Nólsoyar Páll and the Tórshavn commandant is demonstrated by the latter expressing his satisfaction the next April at Páll's having not returned, even though he had asked him to sail for help. [...] This led to suspicion, which still persists, that the commandant had arranged Páll's death, perhaps by commissioning a Norwegian privateer (the Odin) to sink Páll's ship south of the Faroes.|$|E

The U. S. Export Enhancement Program (EEP) {{plays an important role}} to maintain U. S. market share in importing countries. Eliminating Canadian rail subsidy decreases Canadian offshore exports, but greatly increases its exports to the United States. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) increases feed <b>barley</b> <b>trade</b> within North America, but has little impact on world trade flows for feed barley. Canada benefits most under the Uruguay Round Agreement of GATT and the world free trade through significantly higher exports to offshore markets and the United States. Australia also gains from free trade.

40|$|The United States and Canada {{share the}} longest common border and largest {{bilateral}} trading {{relationship in the}} world. Recent trading agreements [...] CUSTA, NAFTA and WTO [...] have enhanced trade by encouraging elimination of many remaining trade barriers. However, one cause for concern {{about the effectiveness of}} these trade agreements has been the frequency of Canadian-U. S. trade disputes over bilateral wheat and <b>barley</b> <b>trade</b> arrangements and trade flows. To some extent, these disputes have arisen because of differences in and lack of harmonization between the domestic and trade policies implemented by the two countries, although other political factors have also clearly been important causes of these disagreements. Since 1986, many dimensions of the agricultural policies of both countries have undergone radical changes, perhaps especially with respect to small grains and oilseeds. Here we provide assessments of whether important aspects of the two countries' domestic and trade grains and oilseeds have converged toward harmonization since implementation of the Canada-U. S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989. It {{should also be noted that}} many of the changes in each countries' agricultural policies cannot be attributed to free trade agreements. Rather, they reflect government responses to budgetary pressures, commitments under international trade agreements, changes in the relative political importance of rural and urban voters, and other factors. Changes in General Levels of Support Producer Subsidy Equivalents are indicators of the proportion of total revenues from sales of a crop resulting from government subsidies and other income support policies such as tariffs. U. S. producer subsidy equivalents for wheat and other grains have declined substantially from their 1993 - 1995 average levels as a result of the decoupling of income support payments under the 1996 FAIR Act. Similarly, the average wheat, other grains and oilseeds producer subsidy equivalents reported for Canada over the same period overstate current producer subsidy equivalents because of the elimination of Canadian grain transportation subsidies in 1995. Thus, generally, levels of government support for wheat and small grains have fallen quite considerably both in the U. S. and in Canada, indicating some movement in the direction of policy harmonization for these commodities. Farm Income Supports Over the past twenty years, farm income support in Canada has been delivered throughseveral different programs. Increasing budgetary pressures and a greater focus on market orientation led to the elimination of the Gross Revenue Insurance Program and the western grain transportation subsidies by 1996. The only current direct income support program is the Net Income Stabilization Account (NISA), which provides modest subsidies on interest rates paid to farmers on moneys they themselves pay into an income stabilization account. In the United States during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, changes were made to the deficiency payment/loan rate farm income support programs for wheat and small grains that tended to reduce the size of government payments to wheat and barley producers. Then, in 1996, the FAIR Act changed the entire farm income support mechanism, largely decoupling direct government payments to producers of those crops from current production decisions. In summary, the distortionary effects of Canadian and U. S. income support programs for wheat and other grains have been substantially curtailed, especially over the past three years. Similarly, the distortionary effects of Canadian income support programs for oilseeds have also been reduced toward the relatively modest levels associated with the U. S. oilseeds program, which has changed relatively little over the past ten years. There has been convergence in this area of farm policy. Grain Marketing and Export Subsidy Programs To the extent that U. S. export subsidy programs have become subject to GATT disciplines and funding for the U. S. export enhancement program has been reduced, the U. S. has moved toward a less distortionary set of trade policies for grains and oilseeds. The removal of freight subsidies has also moved Canada's grains trade policy in a less distortionary direction. However, Canada's export marketing board policy for wheat and barley (operated through the Canadian Wheat Board) has not changed in recent years. With respect to export credit guarantees, both countries operate roughly comparable programs, although under the GSM- 103 program, the U. S. is able to offer somewhat longer term (3 - 7 year) lines of credit. These programs have been subject only to relatively modest changes over the past ten years. On balance, there has probably been less harmonization of U. S. and Canadian export policies than of the two countries' income support programs. Thus, export policies, particularly the existence of the U. S. export enhancement program and the marketing powers of the CWB, will continue to be part of bilateral trade issues. agricultural policy, harmonization and convergence, grains, oilseeds, International Relations/Trade, Q 1,...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} few years after the {{introduction}} of commodity markets, new exchanges opened with wild abandon, and speculative volume ballooned. Soon a directive titled The Notice of Firmly Curbing the Blind Development of the Futures Market was launched. In October 1994, the State Council rectified over 50 futures exchanges down to 15 futures exchanges, delisted 20 futures contracts (leaving 35), began issuing licenses to futures commission merchants for the first time while lopping their number by over 70%, restricted trading on foreign futures exchanges, introduced new rules and regulations, and shifted the control of the exchanges from local governments to regulatory authorities. DCE's market share then ranked No. 9 in China with Dry kelp as a pilot product. DCE traded soybeans and corn back then. [...] Continued abuse in the market brought forth the Second Rectification in 1998, most of the surviving 15 futures exchanges were restructured, and subsequently closed. Three national level future exchanges emerged: Shanghai Metal Exchange, Dalian Commodity Exchange, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. The number of futures contracts was cut back further to 12 from 35, and more brokers were closed, leaving just 175 standing from the early 1990s peak of 1,000. Margins were standardized and regulations further toughened. Trading on foreign futures exchanges was further restricted to a small number of large, global entities. Soybeans, soy meal and beer <b>barley</b> were <b>traded</b> at DCE.|$|R
40|$|Maintaining on-farm {{diversity}} of crop varieties has received increasing attention {{as a strategy}} for mitigating production risk and protecting food security in resource-poor farming systems with few opportunities for insurance or <b>trade.</b> <b>Barley</b> is grown under {{a wide range of}} environmental conditions and in marginal areas or seasons where the production of other cereals is limited. Food consumption preferences and variable tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses influence the mixture and number of varieties to be grown. Phenotypic diversity was determined using Shannon diversity index. An econometric approach has been applied to identify the social and economic factors that influence levels of diversity maintained on-farm. A high phenotypic diversity index (0. 79) was recorded from sampled barley varieties. Censored regression indicates that physical characteristics of the farm (land fragmentation index, farm size), agro climatic features of the site (altitude, rainfall, temperature) and household characteristics (only number of children) had a significant and positive impact on diversity and area allocation of barley. The significant negative relation of number of extension contact with barley diversity implies further attention and analysis...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} a town and its region in the late medieval period. The population, wealth, trade, and markets of Cambridge and its region are studied, as are {{the nature and extent of}} changes which occurred between 1450 and 1560, a period traditionally viewed as one of economic and social transition. Taxation records of the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries are used to analyse the population and wealth of Cambridge and its region. Rates of growth varied noticeably between different towns, sub-regions and parishes within the county. The trade of the town and its hinterland is shown through the purchases made by the Cambridge colleges and other institutions. The university expanded considerably during the fifteenth century and a number of new colleges were founded. Patterns of credit highlight the extent of London marketing networks, and demand from the capital appears to have stimulated the development of the malt <b>barley</b> and saffron <b>trades</b> in the region during the later fifteenth century. The markets and fairs of Cambridge and its region are explored, including the location of surviving markets and the regulation of marketing activity. Stourbridge fair, a major trading event held on the outskirts of Cambridge, grew significantly in this period, and the buyers and sellers who used this fair are examined. The purchases of King’s Hall and King’s College show the supply of food and fuel to the town, revealing the area of supply, the status and wealth of suppliers, and the prices of wheat over the period. Finally, the land and labour markets in the town are explored briefly, focusing on the property owned by Cambridge Corporation, and the impact of college building projects. This work concludes by highlighting particular factors which influenced the development of Cambridge and its region, including the university’s expansion, Stourbridge fair, and London trading links, while pointing to the limited extent of economic development generally over the 1450 - 1560 period...|$|R
