40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The major {{purposes}} of the research were {{to determine whether there}} were significant differences in breaking strength and elongation of the following types of seams in a polyester double-knit fabric: 1. seams stitched with threads of (a) mercerized cotton, (b) core-spun polyester/cotton, and (c) <b>bonded</b> <b>nylon</b> monocord. 2. seams stitched with (a) a narrow zigzag stitch, (b) a lockstitch made while stretching the fabric, and (c) an elastic straight stitch. 3. seams stitched (a) parallel to the wales and (b) parallel to the courses. 4. seams stitched with settings of (a) 9 stitches per inch, (b) 12 stitches per inch, and (c) 15 stitches per inch. Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater seam breaking strength and elongation than those seamed with <b>bonded</b> <b>nylon</b> monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean seam breaking strength and elongation than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected seam breaking strength and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch. For most comparable sets of zigzag specimens, increases in the number of stitches per inch were accompanied by increases in seam breaking strength and elongation. With the lockstitch, those differences which were significant indicated that the shorter stitches were related to greater breaking strength and elongation. Seams parallel to the courses were related to greater seam breaking strength and elongation than seams parallel to the wales...|$|E

40|$|The present work used {{ab initio}} density {{functional}} theory (DFT) to study two different physical phenomena crystallization fouling and clay-based polymer nanocomposites. In the first part, two foulant materials were studied including calcium carbonate, and calcium sulfate. The lattice energy and enthalpy of formations of each crystal system were predicted using DFT methods. The most stable forms of calcium carbonate foul ant, calcite and aragonite, were investigated. For calcium sulfate, both gypsum and anhydrite crystals were investigated. The thermodynamic solubility product of each crystal system, for both foul ants, was predicted from the lattice energy and enthalpy of formations. Comparison of the stability {{between the different}} crystal systems for the same foul ant material was carried out to elucidate the effect of crystal atomic configuration and space group on the stability of foulant materials. The effect of temperature on the formation and stability of foulant material was also carried out. The results obtained using DFT methods, for enthalpy of formation and thermodynamic solubility products, were comparable with the experimental data reported in the literature. In the second part, study has been made on the clay-based nylon 6 nanocomposite materials. The purpose {{was to understand the}} interfacial interactions between clay and polymer with and without surfactant component. Both sides of the clay were examined with nylon 6. In order to determine specifically the type of interfacial interaction between clay and nylon 6, the electron distribution around the whole system was predicted. The study was carried out at various isomorphic substitutions. The substitutions took place at both octahedral and tetrahedral layers of the clay. The strength between clay and nylon 6 was predicted by calculating the binding energy. The results obtained revealed that, the strength increases with the increase in the degree of isomorphic substitutions. The type of <b>bond</b> between <b>nylon</b> 6 and basal surface of the clay was found to be basically electrostatic interactions, and particularly hydrogen bonds. Whilst, the type of interactions between nylon 6 and clay edge surface was found to include covalent bonds as well as electrostatic interactions.

40|$|AbstractMicrowell {{platforms}} {{are frequently}} described for the efficient and uniform manufacture of 3 -dimensional (3 D) multicellular microtissues. Multiple partial or complete medium exchanges can displace microtissues from discrete microwells, {{and this can}} result in either the loss of microtissues from culture, or microtissue amalgamation when displaced microtissues fall into common microwells. Herein we describe the first microwell platform that incorporates a mesh to retain microtissues within discrete microwells; the microwell-mesh. We show that <b>bonding</b> a <b>nylon</b> mesh with an appropriate pore size over the microwell openings allows single cells {{to pass through the}} mesh into the microwells during the seeding process, but subsequently retains assembled microtissues within discrete microwells. To demonstrate the utility of this platform, we used the microwell-mesh to manufacture hundreds of cartilage microtissues, each formed from 5  ×  103 bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSC). The microwell-mesh enabled reliable microtissue retention over 21 -day cultures that included multiple full medium exchanges. Cartilage-like matrix formation was more rapid and homogeneous in microtissues than in conventional large diameter control cartilage pellets formed from 2  ×  105 MSC each. The microwell-mesh platform offers an elegant mechanism to retain microtissues in microwells, and we believe that this improvement will make this platform useful in 3 D culture protocols that require multiple medium exchanges, such as those that mimic specific developmental processes or complex sequential drug exposures...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to form {{uncompressed}} thermobonded 3 D wool nonwoven shell structures in one continuous process, and to study the controlling factors that govern this process. Lack of bonding between wool fibres and between wool and thermoplastic fibres was attributed to the wool fibre's low surface energy because of the lipids on the outer surface of wool fibres (epicuticle). To overcome this problem, three different surface treatments were investigated; chlorination, Hercosett and plasma. The purpose of these treatments was to raise the surface energy of wool fibres by bond scission and the introduction of new functional polar groups and ablation of the outer lipid layer or membrane. For thermobonding with wool fibres, low melting nylon fibres were chosen because of their high polarity and chemical compatibility with wool fibres. SEM, BSM and ESEM imaging techniques as well as tensile strength testing for single fibres, pair bonded samples and 3 D nonwoven shells were used to assess the samples. Results have shown {{that it is possible to}} thermobond wool and nylon fibres as 3 D shell structures, given that wool fibres are treated appropriately and the bonding temperature is controlled properly. Moreover, it has been found that, for pair bonded samples, the wrapping angle and the bonding angle have significant effects on the tensile strength and number of bonding points. Hercosett treated wool fibres yielded the strongest <b>bonds</b> with <b>nylon</b> fibres followed by plasma, chlorinated and untreated fibres.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate if atmospheric pressure plasma treatment could modify peel ply prepared composite surfaces to create strong adhesive bonds. Two peel ply surface preparation composite systems previously shown to create weak bonds (low fracture energy and adhesion failure) that were potential candidates for plasma treatment were Toray T 800 / 3900 - 2 carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) prepared with Precision Fabrics Group, Inc. (PFG) 52006 nylon peel ply and Hexcel T 300 /F 155 CFRP prepared with PFG 60001 polyester peel ply. It was hypothesized that atmospheric pressure plasma treatment could functionalize and/or remove peel ply remnants left on the CFRP surfaces upon peel ply removal. Surface characterization measurements and double cantilever beam (DCB) testing were used {{to determine the effects of}} atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on surface characteristics and bond quality of peel ply prepared CFRP composites. Previous research showed that Toray T 800 / 3900 - 2 carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites prepared with PFG 52006 peel ply and bonded with Cytec MetlBond 1515 - 3 M structural film adhesive failed in adhesion at low fracture energies when tested in the DCB configuration. Previous research also showed that DCB samples made of Hexcel T 300 /F 155 carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites prepared with PFG 60001 peel ply and bonded with Henkel Hysol EA 9696 structural film adhesive failed in adhesion at low fracture energies. Recent research suggested that plasma treatment could be able to activate these "un-bondable" surfaces and result in good adhesive <b>bonds.</b> <b>Nylon</b> peel ply prepared 177 °C cure and polyester peel ply prepared 127 °C cure CFRP laminates were treated with atmospheric pressure plasma after peel ply removal prior to bonding. Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment was capable of significantly increasing fracture energies and changing failure modes. For Toray T 800 / 3900 - 2 laminates prepared with PFG 52006 and bonded with MetlBond 1515 - 3 M, plasma treatment increased fracture energies from 460 J/m 2. Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment also increased fracture energies of Hexcel T 300 /F 155 laminates prepared with PFG 60001 and bonded with EA 9696 from 1500 J/m 2. It was demonstrated that atmospheric pressure plasma treatment was able to transform poor bonding surfaces into acceptable ones by reversing the negative effects of incorrect peel ply usage. To determine if the primary reason for adhesion was functionalization or removal, a number of experiments were performed. Surface characteristics of peel ply only and plasma treated samples were determined using contact angle (CA) measurements, FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). CA was used to assess solid surface energy that was useful to determine wetting of the adhesive on the adherend, one requirement of adhesion. FTIR and XPS were used to analyze composite surface chemistry, including the identification of functional groups that were a product of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment, as well as contaminants that can inhibit adhesive bonding. SEM was used to capture surface morphology to identify peel ply remnants and whether these remnants were physically removed or modified due to plasma treatment. This research supported that atmospheric pressure plasma treatment resulted in adhesion primarily due to functionalization of peel ply remnants, though a removal mechanism was not disproven. It was also shown that surface energy exhibited potential for predicting adhesion. Lastly, this research indicated that plasma treatment is a robust surface preparation, as strong bonds were observed up to 30 days after treatment...|$|R

40|$|Typical spider {{dragline}} silk {{tends to}} outperform other natural fibres and most man-made filaments. However, even {{small changes in}} spinning conditions can have large effects on the mechanical properties of a silk fibre {{as well as on}} its water uptake. Absorbed water leads to significant shrinkage in an unrestrained dragline fibre and reversibly converts the material into a rubber. This process is known as supercontraction and may be a functional adaptation for the silk's role in the spider's web. Supercontraction is thought to be controlled by specific motifs in the silk proteins and to be induced by the entropy-driven recoiling of molecular chains. In analogy, in man-made fibres thermal shrinkage induces changes in mechanical properties attributable to the entropy-driven disorientation of 'unfrozen' molecular chains (as in polyethylene terephthalate) or the 'broken' intermolecular hydrogen <b>bonds</b> (as in <b>nylons).</b> Here we show for Nephila major-ampullate silk how in a biological fibre the spinning conditions affect the interplay between shrinkage and mechanical characteristics.

40|$|The {{effective}} {{utilization of}} carbon nanomaterials, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and graphite, has been hindered due to difficulties (poor solubility, poly-dispersity) in processing. Therefore, {{a high degree}} of sidewall functionalization, either covalent or non-covalent, is often required to overcome these difficulties as the functionalized nanomaterials exhibit better solubility (either in organic solvents or in water), dispersity, manipulation, and processibility. This thesis presents a series of convenient and efficient organic synthetic routes to functionalize carbon nanomaterials. Carbon nanotube salts, prepared by treating SWNTs with lithium in liquid ammonia, react readily with aryl halides to yield aryl-functionalized SWNTs. These arylated SWNTs are soluble in methanol and water upon treatment with oleum. Similarly, SWNTs can be covalently functionalized by different heteroatoms (nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur). Using the reductive alkylation approach, a synthetic scheme is designed to prepare long chain carboxylic acid functionalized SWNTs [SWNTs-(RCOOH) ] that can react with (1) amine-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains to yield water-soluble biocompatible PEGylated SWNTs that are likely to be useful in a variety of biomedical applications; (2) polyethyleneimine (PEI) to prepare a SWNTs-PEI based adsorbent material that shows a four-fold improvement in the adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide over commonly used materials, making it useful for regenerable carbon dioxide removal in spaceflight; (3) chemically modified SWNTs-(RCOOH) to permit covalent <b>bonding</b> to the <b>nylon</b> matrix, thus allowing the formation of nylon 6, 10 and nylon 6, 10 /SWNTs-(RCOOH) nanocomposites. Furthermore, we find that the lithium salts of carbon nanotubes serve as a source of electrons to induce polymerization of simple alkenes and alkynes onto the surface of carbon nanotubes. In the presence of sulfide/disulfide bonds, SWNT salts can initiate the single electron transfer (SET) mechanism to functionalize carbon nanotubes with different alkyl/aryl groups. Using the reductive alkylation approach, we can also functionalize graphites by alkyl/carboxylic acid groups, making graphite soluble in organic solvents and water. Tailoring of graphite layers is also accomplished by using different metals in liquid ammonia. Finally, SWNT-epoxides/graphite epoxides are synthesized using m-CPBA. Quantification of the epoxide substituents on the nanotube/graphite surface is evaluated through the catalytic de-epoxidation reaction using MeReO 3 /PPh 3 as heterogeneous catalyst. In summary, the proposed covalent functionalization methods yield derivatized nanomaterials that can provide a solid platform for a number of exciting applications, ranging from material science to biomedical devices. Furthermore, the results presented in this thesis provide insight into the molecular chemistry at nano-resolution...|$|R
