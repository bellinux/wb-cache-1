30|$|On T 2 -WI the prostatic {{morphology}} {{is depicted}} with high resolution. The transition zone (TZ) {{of the prostate}} consists of nodular areas of stromal and glandular hyperplasia with varying signal intensity (SI), and is surrounded posteriorly and laterally by the peripheral zone (PZ) that usually has a more homogeneous high SI [26, 27]. PC can be identified on T 2 -WI as an ill-defined low SI area, contrasting well with the normal high background SI of the PZ, but often more difficult to distinguish in the TZ [28, 29]. The reported sensitivities and specificities for detection of PC with T 2 -WI range between 57  %- 88  % and 28  %- 94  %, respectively [18, 28, 30 – 41]. The lower specificities may be explained <b>by</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> low SI areas in the PZ mimicking PC. Nevertheless, T 2 -WI has been assumed to be the dominant sequence for the identification of PC in the TZ when interpreting imaging findings of a mpMRI exam [42, 43].|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} {{was made}} of the statistical correlations between the main foodstuff and nutrient intakes and the chief causes of mortality in 20 different countries, comprising 17 in Europe, and Canada, USA, and Japan.

Complex food patterns were identified and related both to geographical latitude and to levels of affluence; these, in turn, were related to complex patterns of mortality. Criteria for drawing special attention to specific associations were identified, based partly on statistical significance tests and also on strength-of-association yardsticks supplied <b>by</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> known causes.

A total of 22 normal undergraduate students (8 male and 14 females) of both sexes and between the ages of 18 and 27 years participated in the study. The age, weight and height of each subject was obtained and BMI was 2 estimated by the universal BMI formula (w/h). Blood pressure was measured and relative plasma viscosity (RPV) was determined by methods described previously by various researchers. Results obtained showed a positive statistical significance between BMI and RPV in all subjects and in both sexes. However, there was no statistical significance between the blood pressure indices with relative plasma viscosity in all subjects and in both sexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of providing care to diseased conspecifics {{must have been}} a turning point during the evolution of hominin sociality. On a population level, care may have minimized the costs of socially transmitted diseases at a time of increasing social complexity, although individual care-givers probably incurred increased transmission risks. We propose that care-giving likely originated within kin networks, where the costs may have been balanced by fitness increases obtained through caring for ill kin. We test a novel hypothesis of hominin cognitive evolution in which disease may have selected for the cognitive ability to recognize when a conspecific is infected. Because diseases may produce symptoms that are likely detectable via the perceptual-cognitive pathways integral to social cognition, we suggest that disease recognition and social cognition may have evolved together. Using agent-based modeling, we test 1) under what conditions disease can select for increasing disease recognition and care-giving among kin, 2) whether providing care produces greater selection for cognition than an avoidance strategy, and 3) whether care-giving alters the progression of the disease through the population. The greatest selection was produced <b>by</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> lower risks to the care-giver and prevalences low enough not to disrupt the kin networks. When care-giving and avoidance strategies were compared, only care-giving reduced the severity of the disease outbreaks and subsequent population crashes. The greatest selection for increased cognitive abilities occurred early in the model runs when the outbreaks and population crashes were most severe. Therefore, over the course of human evolution, repeated introductions of novel diseases into naïve populations could have produced sustained selection for increased disease recognition and care-giving behavior, leading to the evolution of increased cognition, social complexity, and, eventually, medical care in humans. Finally, we lay out predictions derived from our disease recognition hypothesis that we encourage paleoanthropologists, bioarchaeologists, primatologists, and paleogeneticists to test...|$|E
40|$|Ingegerd &Ouml;stman-SmithDivision of Paediatric Cardiology, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, SwedenAbstract: Athletic {{activity}} {{is associated with}} an increased risk of sudden death for individuals with some congenital or acquired heart disorders. This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused <b>by</b> <b>diseases</b> <b>with</b> autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan&rsquo;s syndrome. A policy of early cascade-screening of all first-degree relatives of patients with these disorders will therefore detect a substantial number of individuals at risk. A strictly regulated system with preparticipation screening of all athletes following a protocol pioneered in Italy, including school-age children, can also detect cases caused by sporadic new mutations and has been shown to reduce excess mortality among athletes substantially. Recommendations for screening procedure are reviewed. It is concluded that ECG screening ought to be part of preparticipation screening, but using criteria that do not cause too many false positives among athletes. One such suggested protocol will show positive in approximately 5 % of screened individuals, among whom many will be screened for these diseases. On this point {{further research is needed to}} define what kind of false-positive and false-negative rate these new criteria result in. A less formal system based on cascade-screening of relatives, education of coaches about suspicious symptoms, and preparticipation questionnaires used by athletic clubs, has been associated over time with a sizeable reduction in sudden cardiac deaths among Swedish athletes, and thus appears to be worth implementing even for junior athletes not recommended for formal preparticipation screening. It is strongly argued that in families with autosomal dominant disorders the first screening of children should be carried out no later than 6 to 7 years of age.

Little is known however why certain species are more susceptible to disease. This study examines coral disease prevalence and species susceptibility to disease using data collected over a four year period at 25 sites in the U. S. Virgin Islands. Twelve species of scleractinian coral were found to be affected <b>by</b> <b>disease.</b> Yellow band disease (YBD) and dark spots disease (DSD) were the most common diseases found on USVI reefs. Four dis-eases, YBD, DSD, white syndrome, and black band disease (BBD) were observed in three species; Montastraea annularis, Montastraea franksi and Siderestrea siderea. Siderestrea siderea was most frequently affected <b>by</b> <b>disease</b> <b>with</b> a total prevalence of 23 %, largely due to the high number of incidences of DSD. YBD was the second most common disease and had the highest prevalence in Montastraea annularis (5. 1 %).
