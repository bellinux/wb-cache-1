5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of the bones of juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E
5|$|A krsnik or kresnik {{was a man}} <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> caul, {{who could}} leave his body in spirit {{transformed}} into an animal. He fought demonic men called vukodlak (werewolves) and other evil agents. His victory meant that his village would have the abundance {{of all sorts of}} agricultural products. The krsnik was recorded in Istria, Gorski Kotar, the Kvarner Gulf, and parts of Slovenia. The benandanti were men <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> caul recorded in the region of Friuli in north-eastern Italy. They periodically fought for the fertility of the fields against male and female witches. The táltos, recorded in Hungary, were men and women born with teeth or some other physical peculiarity. They periodically fought each other in the shape of animals or flames. Their battles were often accompanied by storms. The winner would ensure abundant harvest for his village. The benandanti and the táltos were initiated at a certain age into their vocation by an older member of the same group, who visited them in a vision.|$|E

5|$|Another type of Romanian vampire is pricolici. These {{types are}} humans <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tail, {{and they can}} shape shift like a {{werewolf}} but they have control over their transformation. Their entire power is kept in their tail. In undeath, the pricolici remain in their wolf form.|$|E
5|$|Kirsty Howard was {{the final}} runner to carry the Queen's Baton {{at the opening of}} the 2002 Commonwealth Games, when she was chaperoned by England {{football}} captain David Beckham. <b>Born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rare condition in which her heart is back-to-front, she has been a resident in Didsbury's Francis House Hospice, for which she has raised over £5million.|$|E
5|$|Murray was <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bipartite patella, {{where the}} kneecap remains as two {{separate}} bones instead of fusing together in early childhood, {{but was not}} diagnosed {{until the age of}} 16.

25|$|From {{his studies}} into child development, Jean Piaget {{suggested}} that children were <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> innate animist worldview {{in which they}} anthropomorphized inanimate objects, {{and that it was}} only later that they grew out of this belief. Conversely, from her ethnographic research, Margaret Mead argued the opposite, believing that children were not <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> animist worldview but that they became acculturated to such beliefs as they were educated by their society.|$|R
5|$|Schmirler {{was born}} to parents Shirley and Art Schmirler. She was <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> club foot, which {{required}} her to wear a cast for two months. She had two older sisters, Carol and Beverley. She attended high school in Biggar, and moved to Saskatoon to attend university. She started out towards a degree in computer science, but transferred after her first year {{to work for a}} degree in physical education. She convocated with a Bachelor of Science in Physical Education in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Shishupala is a {{relative}} of Sri Krishna and he is <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lot of abnormal features. When Krishna touches him during his childhood, the child becomes normal. However {{a result of the}} broken curse, Krishna is destined to kill Shishupala. Krishna however promises Shishupala's mother that he would give his son a hundred chances before killing him.|$|E
5|$|The genes {{often found}} mutated in PanNETs are {{different}} from those in exocrine pancreatic cancer. For example, KRAS mutation is normally absent. Instead, hereditary MEN1 gene mutations give rise to MEN1 syndrome, in which primary tumors occur in two or more endocrine glands. About 40–70% of people <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> MEN1 mutation eventually develop a PanNet. Other genes that are frequently mutated include DAXX, mTOR and ATRX.|$|E

5|$|While other British and Northern European multi-horned sheep {{have a fine}} inner {{coat and}} a coarse, longer outer coat, Jacobs have a medium grade fleece and no outer coat. Lambs of the more {{primitive}} lines are <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> coat of guard hair that is protective against rain and cold; this birth coat is shed at 36months.|$|E
5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Allen was <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{deformed}} {{left arm}} {{from the effects}} of a rare object, known as Innocence. Abandoned by his parents, he was raised in a circus and meets clown Mana Walker (who adopts him when his contract with the circus expires). When Mana dies, Allen tries to resurrect him through Millennium Earl. Mana, revived as a demon known as an Akuma, cuts Allen's left eye. Allen's deformed left arm awakens as an anti-Akuma weapon, later called , and destroys Mana. His left eye allows him to see the souls of Akuma. Exorcist General Cross Marian soon adopts Allen as a disciple.|$|E
5000|$|The Contortionist's Handbook (2002) by Craig Clevenger {{is about}} the life of John Dolan Vincent, a drug-using forger who was <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> extra finger on his left hand.|$|R

5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|Born in Selma, Alabama, Mia was {{the fourth}} of six {{children}} of Bill and Stephanie Hamm. She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> club foot. Hamm spent her childhood on various United States Air Force bases {{around the world with}} her family. While living in Florence, Italy, Hamm first played soccer, which was hugely popular there; her entire family quickly became involved in the sport. At age five, then living in Wichita Falls, Texas, Hamm joined her first soccer team. Her father coached Mia and her newly adopted brother, 8 year old Garrett.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented <b>Born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E

5|$|In Greek folklore, a stikhio (στοιχείο) was {{a spirit}} that {{protected}} his territory against the adverse stikhio spirits from other territories. In Albanian tradition, a dragoi was a dragon-man with enormous {{strength and the}} power to fly; he was <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> caul. He saved his region from a kuçedra or kulshedra, a female serpentine demon. In Romanian folklore, there were no defenders against bad weather, which was produced by a gigantic flying serpentine creature called a balaur or a zmeu. A balaur could be controlled by an evil sorcerer called a şolomonar, who was able to ride on that demon. The notion of a şolomonar named a vîlva, who protected his village against attacks of vîlvas from other villages, was marginally encountered in some places of Romanian Banat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Baltic region of Livonia, people {{designated}} as werewolves went underground {{in the shape}} of dogs to fight against sorcerers who stole the shoots of the grain. If the werewolves failed to wrest the shoots, there would be famine. In Romania, strigoi were people <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> caul, which they donned upon reaching adulthood; this made them invisible. They then travelled in animal form to the meadow {{at the end of the}} world. There they fought each other all night, becoming reconciled in the morning. The reason for the fight is not specified. The Circassians told that, on a certain night of the year, their sorcerers fought with the sorcerers of the Abkhaz people, trying to suck each other's blood.|$|E
5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when homozygous, {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals are <b>born</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of}} the coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
