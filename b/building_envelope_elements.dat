40|$|Abstract. Buildings {{account for}} {{approximately}} 40 % {{of the global}} energy consumption and 36 % of total carbon dioxide emissions. At present many efforts are underway to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint of buildings by optimizing their performance. <b>Building</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> {{have a major impact}} on the performance of buildings. However, the best combination of the <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> for optimizing the performance of buildings is difficult to determine and is not known. Building performance analysis is mostly done through energy modelling by using a whole building simulation tool. However, this is a slow and a tedious process, and generally only a few cases are evaluated in a large range of possible scenarios. By combining a generic optimization scheme with energy modelling, the best combination of <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> can be determined and, thereby, it is possible to optimize the performance of buildings successfully subject to predefined constraints. This paper describes how the performance of an office building located in the suburbs of Colombo, Sri Lanka is optimized in terms of <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> through combined energy modelling and generic optimization. The optimized envelope design with its efficient utilization of daylight, not only reduces the annual energy consumption substantially, but also leads to better thermal comfort for the occupants...|$|E

Energy demand and also efficiency in housing sector generally depends on various circumstances: social sphere and state or municipal regulations, infrastructure of living area and energy supply, <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> conditions, population’s consumption habits, thinking manner (ownership) and climate conditions. Heat energy saving arrangements is the main for the refurbishment of prefabricated housing because thermal insulation is paramount to both heat energy savings and to repairing facade damage.

According to that the energy demands in household as well as energy conservation potential are very important parts of the management and development of energy sector. The paper presents the latest development in Building sector and in Energy Efficiency in Building sector involved Legislative aspects, Framework changes, which influence building renovation process in Latvia. Methods Refurbishment projects focused on the large stock of apartment buildings built before 1990. The standardized buildings comprise 65 % of the building stock. District heating is widespread in Latvia. For the whole building sector estimated saving potential of 30 - 50 % resulting in 15 PJ. For the public buildings estimated saving potential 20 - 60 % resulting in 2. 052 PJ. Refurbishment projects Latvia suggests a rehabilitation strategy in 3 groups with first groups of more simple and inexpensive measures and the last group for major rehabilitations. Group 1 : Water receiving devices adjustments and heat meters installation. Windows and doors packing/renovation, loggias glazing, change heat substations. (20 - 30 % savings/ 4. 5 years pay back). Group 2 : Insulation external walls and balks covering, ventilation in bathrooms and kitchens. (15 % savings additionally). Group 3 : Windows/doors replacement, individual heat meters, and thermo controller valves, insulation of cellars coverings, side walls, and gable roofs.

In this view, optimizing buildings energy efficiency and sustainability are crucial aspects, given their high energy saving potential {{with respect to the}} other sectors characterizing human activities.

First, the convection heat transfer coefficient is measured by heat flux meters (HFM) and thermography.

The measurement values were found to have a large disparity as expected due to the rapid change in weather conditions. But still a linear regression with low confidence interval was obtained. The thermography results from a small uniform wall segment were validated with HFM measurements and 4 % difference was found, which suggest that the two methods could be equally effective. Yet, thermography has the advantage of measuring surface temperature over large area of building element.

Physical testing has shown that ETFE foil cushions compare favourably to double glazing in terms of thermal and daylighting performance which was also noted {{as one of the most}} likeable feature by occupants. Environmental impact analysis has indicated that ETFE foils can reduce the environmental impact of a building through reduced environmental burden of both the construction and operation of the building. Secondly, a cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) was carried out for float glass, which considered the environmental impacts of glass manufacture. The embodied energy was calculated to be 13. 4 ± 0. 5 GJ per tonne while the total number of eco-points 243 ± 11 per tonne. It is shown that float glass is comparable to the use of steel, and highly preferable to the use of aluminium as a cladding panel. Finally, a concept design tool (FACADE) was developed by defining a large number of office facade models and employing dynamic thermal, daylighting and environmental impact modelling to create a database which can be accessed through a user friendly interface application. A parametric analysis has indicated that using natural ventilation where possible can reduce the environmental impact of offices by up to 16 %.

Both indoor laboratories and outdoor test cells have been developed in order to tackle the challenging issue of experimentally characterising innovative <b>envelope</b> <b>elements.</b> However, not always the experimental methodologies are fully and explicitly described in the available literature, and they are rarely compared to other types of experimental procedures. The aim of the present paper is to describe and review recent state of the art technologies for outdoor test cells. The paper starts with a short introduction on potentialities and limitations of outdoor facilities with respect to indoor laboratories and real buildings field tests, and it continues with a detailed classification and description of the most relevant outdoor test cells developed in recent years...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the various}} <b>{{building}}</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>elements,</b> the glass area {{takes up the}} largest portion in the office building design. However, a large area of glass can cause problems such as excessive solar radiation, thermal comfort, and glare. Thus {{it is important to}} install the glass area to an appropriate level, and control solar radiation and inflow of daylight with blind devices. This study aims to improve the visual performance of the work plane through the automatic control of the venetian blinds. A total of eight kinds of control strategies were chosen; Case 1 does not control the blinds, Case 2 with the blind slats fixed at the angle of 0 degree, Case 3 to 6 using the existing blind control programs, and Case 7 and 8 with improved blind control. Case 3 with 90 degrees had the best energy performance, but the average indoor illuminance was 113 lux, which is below the standards. Cases 4 and 5 showed higher levels of interior daylight illuminance with the average of 281 lux and 403 lux respectively. However, the fixed angles may have difficulties controlling excessive direct sunlight coming into the room and may cause glare. Cases 6 and 7 used sun tracking angle control and cut-off angle control, and the average interior illuminance was measured 250 lux and 385 lux respectively. Case 8 used the cut-off angle control in an hourly manner, satisfying the standard illuminance of 400 lux with an average interior illuminance of 561 lux. It was evaluated to be the best method to control direct solar radiation and to guarantee proper level of interior illumination...|$|E
40|$|In the {{perspective}} of the "Net Zero Energy Buildings" as specified in the EPBP 2010 / 31 /EU, herein a modular unglazed solar thermal facade component for facilitating the installation of active solar thermal facades has been conceived and designed to answer three considerations: (1) easily installable elements, offering high modularity to be sized for the specific needs of the buildings considered, (2) low-price unglazed technology, given by the industrial process already developed for the fridge evaporators, and (3) versatile modules to be used for both new buildings and for existing buildings for energy retrofitting. The existing buildings stock offers a high-potential opportunity to improve the energy efficiency when using such a system. Indeed, the <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> {{have a significant impact on}} energy consumptions and performances of the building, and this is a key aspect to consider during renovation. Considering buildings integrating solar thermal (BIST) by the means of facade retrofitting of solar thermal collectors (STC) opens up new challenges for engineers. Facade usage, compared to the traditional roof installations, offers two interesting potentialities: (1) increased available surfaces, and (2) minimization of the unwanted overheating problem, that appears in summer, thanks to the vertical tilt (as the energy production is almost constant over the year). This allows sizing the STC according to the actual heat needs and avoids as much as possible energy fluxes mismatch. The design methodology of such a modular component is the main contribution of the PhD work. The challenges are tackled via a parametric approach. Dynamic simulation tools support the design choices for the energy systems of BIST and to optimize the interactions between the envelope and the STC with the criteria of reducing the overall energy consumption. This methodology is described and applied to the design of a modular prototype of an innovative facade component integrating unglazed STC. We first analyze a variety of typologies of buildings as potential commercial targets of the facade component of unglazed STC integrated facade element. Both residential and non residential buildings are considered. The purpose of this analysis is to match the heat loads for properly sizing the facade elements for each typology. Benchmark models of buildings from the Department of Energy are used such as multifamily houses, hospitals, big and small hotels, schools, offices. These are simulated through EnergyPlus in three European locations (Stockholm, Zurich and Rome) in order to define the yearly heat loads for domestic hot water (DHW) and space heating (SH) needs. Finally, the prototype is conceived and designed as a low-cost product to implement into facades with the criteria of optimizing the energy production. The unglazed STC is combined with a simple configuration of combisystem in order to define some rule of thumbs through Trnsys. By the fact that the energy is produced at lower temperatures, if compared with glazed flat plate collectors, this technology is potential applicable to those buildings having the proper heat loads and the suitable system layout...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is {{becoming}} more and more important in different engineering applications. As far as the building sector is concerned, TES is considered a crucial feature to reach the net-Zero Energy Building (nZEB) goal. Commonly, TES in building is obtained using the sensible heat property of conventional building materials (building thermal inertia). The drawbacks of this strategy are: the low amount of thermal energy that can be stored; the overheating of the indoor environment that may occur if elevate amount of heat is collected by a conventional building material. On the contrary, the exploitation of the latent heat of dedicate materials (the so-called Phase Change Materials - PCMs) for TES purpose (Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage - LHTES) presents different advantages: it allows a much higher energy storage density; it allows "temperature selective" thermal energy absorption and release (by choosing the melting temperature range of the PCM). Moreover, since the storage is done at almost isothermal conditions, it is easier to match the energy demand of the building, with the requirements posed by indoor thermal comfort conditions. An exhaustive collection of both laboratory and commercial grade PCMs of different nature and for different purposes can be found in [1]. The exploitation of LHTES is now gaining popularity [2]: different applications of PCMs in construction are currently under investigation [3 - 5] and, sometimes, commercially available. The most common applications concern the incorporation of PCMs into opaque elements for indoor partitions, structural components and insulation layers. The adoption of PCMs may also occur in combination with active systems (e. g. air-based heating systems, floor heating). Furthermore, because of the ability of certain PCMs to transmit (part of) the visible spectrum of the solar radiation, some transparent/semi-transparent <b>building</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>elements</b> filled with PCMs have been also investigated [6 - 9]. Some systems based on PCMs integration into transparent components have also appeared on the market and have been adopted in some buildings too. The chemical stability and thermal reliability of PCMs and their live spam are key features to ensure the economic feasibility of exploiting LHTES. The requirements on the stability of the PCMs' thermal properties may depend on the different application of PCMs. However, as a general rule, it is mandatory that no relevant changes occur in the melting temperature and in the latent heat of fusion due to the thermal cycles the PCM undergoes. In common applications, such as in gypsum wallboard, thermal cycles are mostly caused by energy absorption and release by conduction and convection. If radiative transfers occur, only the long-wavelength infrared region is involved. On the contrary, in the case of PCMs contained into transparent elements and directly exposed to the solar radiation, the entire electromagnetic solar spectrum passes through and heats the materials. Thus, it may occur that the high energy radiation contained in the UV-VIS range negatively affects the thermal stability of PCMs. Thermal reliability of PCMs has been investigated since time. Accelerated thermal cycle test is usually adopted to simulate the ageing of the material. This technique consists in multi melt/freeze cycles (up to some thousands of cycles) conducted in laboratory by means of dedicated devices, under controlled and fixed conditions. The evolution of the thermal properties of the materials (i. e. the melting temperature and the latent heat of fusion) is then evaluated by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) on different samples of the material, which correspond to different ageing times. Following this procedure, several studies have been conducted to assess the thermal reliability of different PCMs. The literature survey reveals the lack of dedicated investigations that concern the chemical stability and thermal reliability of PCMs which are supposed to be directly exposed to the solar radiation. Although this application is not one of the main popular and developed, the use of PCMs in transparent components is under evaluation since time [6 - 9] and some solutions are already commercially available [10]. As mentioned above, this type of application may cause chemical instability and degradation. In fact, PCMs can be damaged by the combined action of the UV-VIS electromagnetic radiation and oxidative processes. The aim of this research is to characterize and analyze the evolution of the thermal properties, and to evaluate the thermal reliability, of a paraffin wax exposed to the solar radiation. The analysis is conducted on four samples of the same PCM collected at regular interval during an on-field experimental campaign on a PCM glazing [9], that was exposed to operative conditions in a test cell equipment for more than one yea...|$|E
