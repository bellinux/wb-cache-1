5000|$|The Jardin d'agrumes du Palais Carnolès is a two-hectare {{public garden}} devoted to citrus {{trees in the}} town of Menton, in the Alpes-Maritimes Department of France. It is {{classified}} as one of the Notable gardens of France by the French Ministry of Culture. It contains 137 varieties of citrus <b>trees,</b> including <b>orange</b> <b>trees,</b> <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees,</b> grapefruit, mandarin <b>orange</b> and lemon <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adrian died a {{few months}} later and was succeeded on 19 November 1523 by Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici as Clement VII. Giulio was Rucellai's illegitimate cousin, and soon {{appointed}} him Castellano of Castel Sant'Angelo. A book in dialogue form by Gian Giorgio Trissino on the Italian language is called Il Castellano; it records the discussions of Trissino, Rucellai and other friends in the small garden of Castel Sant'Angelo, with its <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The garden, {{whose name}} comes from the many <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> growing there, extends over the area of an ancient {{fortress}} built near the basilica of Santa Sabina by the Savelli family between 1285 and 1287, which, in turn, was built over an old castle constructed by the Crescentii in the tenth century. The garden is bordered by a wall that once surrounded the Savelli castle and other remains of the castle can also be still seen.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 17th century, Anne Marie Orsini, {{duchess of}} Bracciano and princess of Nerola, Italy, {{introduced}} the essence of <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>tree</b> as a fashionable fragrance by using it to perfume her gloves and her bath. Since then, the term [...] "neroli" [...] has been used to describe this essence. Neroli has a refreshing and distinctive, spicy aroma with sweet and flowery notes.|$|E
50|$|A rural {{agricultural}} area, Primero de Marzo {{is centered}} {{in a region}} well known for its high-quality production of petitgrain (orange essence) from the <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>tree</b> (citrus aurantium). This petitgrain is generally exported to Europe for use in perfumes and skin care products. The {{vast majority of the}} harvest, production, and sale of this crop of petitgrain is organized by members of the small credit and marketing cooperative Niño Jesus Ltd. Other important crops in the area include mandioca (yuca), ka'a he'ê (stevia), watermelon, tomato, pineapple, cotton, and soybeans. Fishfarming production of Tilapia is becoming increasingly important in the rural campos.|$|E
50|$|Neroli oil is an {{essential}} oil produced from the blossom of the <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>tree</b> (Citrus aurantium subsp. amara or Bigaradia). Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets. Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. Orange blossom {{can be described as}} smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred to with different names, {{is a result of the}} process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of enfleurage.|$|E
50|$|The {{plants in}} the garden were {{carefully}} picked to change colour with the seasons. The garden consists of 99 palm trees, 78 small palm <b>trees,</b> 62 <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees.</b> There are 42 varieties of shrubs from the Region of Valencia including cistuses, mastics, buddleia, pampas grass, and plumbagos. Honeysuckle and hanging Bougainvilea {{are two of the}} 450 climbing {{plants in the}} umbracle. It also has 5,500 carpet plants such as lotus, spanish Flags, and fig-marigolds. There are over a hundred aromatic plants including rosemary and lavender.|$|R
50|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{and ancient}} element of Greek cuisine is olive oil, {{which is used}} in most dishes. It is produced from the olive trees prominent throughout the region, and adds to the distinctive taste of Greek food. The olives are also widely eaten. The basic grain in Greece is wheat, though barley is also grown. Important vegetables include tomato, aubergine (eggplant), potato, green beans, okra, green peppers, and onions. Honey in Greece is mainly honey from the nectar of fruit trees and citrus trees: lemon, <b>orange,</b> bigarade (<b>bitter</b> <b>orange)</b> <b>trees,</b> thyme honey, and pine honey. Mastic (aromatic, ivory coloured resin) is grown on the Aegean island of Chios.|$|R
40|$|The causal {{agents of}} Citrus leprosis are viruses; however, extant {{diagnostic}} methods {{to identify them}} have failed to detect known viruses in orange, mandarin, lime and <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>trees</b> with severe leprosis symptoms in Mexico, an important citrus producer. Using high throughput sequencing, a virus associated with citrus leprosis was identified, belonging to the proposed Dichorhavirus genus. The virus was termed Citrus Necrotic Spot Virus (CNSV) and contains two negative-strand RNA components; virions accumulate in the cytoplasm and are associated with plasmodesmata—channels interconnecting neighboring cells—suggesting a mode of spread within the plant. The present study provides insights {{into the nature of}} this pathogen and the corresponding plant response, which is likely similar to other pathogens that do not spread systemically in plants...|$|R
50|$|Absolutes {{are usually}} more {{concentrated}} than essential oils. Also, {{the efficiency and}} low temperature of the extraction process helps prevent damage to the fragrant compounds. With {{a good understanding of}} the solvent they are using, extractors can produce absolutes with aromas closer to the original plant product than is possible with essential oils produced through distillation. Examples of this are rose otto (steam-distilled rose oil), as opposed to rose absolute, and neroli (steam-distilled oil from the blossom of the <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>tree),</b> as opposed to orange blossom absolute. Also, some raw materials are either too delicate or too inert to be steam-distilled and can only yield their aroma through other methods, such as solvent extraction or lipid absorption. Examples of these are jasmine, tuberose, mimosa, and beeswax.|$|E
40|$|Neroli {{essential}} oil is {{extracted from the}} fragant blossoms of the <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>tree.</b> It {{is one of the}} most widely used floral oils in perfumery. In this study chemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of neroli oil are investigated. The {{essential oil}} of fresh Citrus aurantium L. Flowers (Neroli oil) cultivated in North East of Tunisia (Nabeul) were analyzed by GC-FID and GC-MS. About 33 compounds were identified, representing 99 % of the total oil. Limonene (27, 5 %) was the main component followed by (E) -nerolidol (17, 5 %), α-terpinyl acetate (11, 5 %) and (E,E) -farnesol (8 %). Antimicrobial activity was determined by Agar-well-diffusion method against 6 bacteria (3 Gran-positive and 3 Gram-negative), 2 yeasts and 3 fungi. Neroli oil exhibited a marked antibacterial activity especially against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, Neroli oil exhibited a very strong antifungal activity determined by ABTS assay showed IC₅₀ values of 672 mg L-¹. Finally, this study may be considered as the first report on the biological properties of this essential oil. The results of this study have provided a starting point for the investigations to exploit new natural substances present in the essential oil of C. aurantium L. flowers...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} apoplastic enzymatic antioxidant system, {{composed by}} class I ascorbate peroxidases (class I APXs), class III ascorbate peroxidases (class III APXs), ascorbate oxidases (AAOs), and other class III peroxidases (PRX), of wood-forming tissues {{has been studied}} in Populus alba, Citrus aurantium, and Eucalyptus camaldulensis. The aim was to ascertain whether these enzymatic systems may regulate directly (in the case of APXs), or indirectly (in the case of AAOs), apoplastic H 2 O 2 levels in lignifying tissues, whose capacity to produce and to accumulate H 2 O 2 is demonstrated here. Although class I APXs are particularly found in the apoplastic fraction of P. alba (poplar), and class III APXs are particularly found in the apoplastic fraction of C. aurantium (<b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> <b>tree),</b> {{the results showed that}} the universal presence of AAO in the extracellular cell wall matrix of these woody species provokes the partial or total dysfunction of apoplastic class I and class III APXs, and of the whole plethora of non-enzymatic redox shuttles in which ascorbic acid (ASC) is involved, by the competitive and effective removal of ASC. In fact, the redox state (ASC/ASC+DHA) in intercellular wash fluids (IWFs) of these woody species was zero, and thus strongly shifted towards DHA (dehydroascorbate), the oxidized product of ASC. This imbalance of the apoplastic antioxidant enzymatic system apparently results in the accumulation of H 2 O 2 in the apoplast of secondary wood-forming tissues, as can be experimentally observed. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that since AAO uses O 2 to remove ASC, it could regulate O 2 availability in the lignifying xylem and, thorough this mechanism, AAO could also control the activity of NADPH oxidase (the enzyme responsible for H 2 O 2 production in lignifying tissues) at substrate level, by controlling the tension of O 2. That is, the presence of AAO in the extracellular cell wall matrix appears to be essential for finely tuning the oxidative performance of secondary wood-forming tissues.
