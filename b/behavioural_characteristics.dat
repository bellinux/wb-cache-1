25|$|Behavioural change {{theories}} are attempts {{to explain why}} behaviours change. These theories cite environmental, personal, and <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristics</b> as the major factors in behavioural determination. In recent years, there has been increased interest {{in the application of}} these theories in the areas of health, education, criminology, energy and international development with the hope that understanding behavioural change will improve the services offered in these areas. Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change. Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior, theories of change are more process-oriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior. Thus, from this perspective, understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation.|$|E
25|$|Domestication of moose was {{investigated}} in the Soviet Union before World War II. Early experiments were inconclusive, but {{with the creation of}} an moose-farm at Pechora-Ilych Nature Reserve in 1949 a small-scale moose domestication program was started, involving attempts at selective breeding of animals {{on the basis of their}} <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Since 1963, the program has continued at Kostroma Moose Farm, which had a herd of 33 tame moose as of 2003. Although at this stage the farm is not expected to be a profit-making enterprise, it obtains some income from the sale of moose milk and from visiting tourist groups. Its main value, however, is seen in the opportunities it offers for the research in the physiology and behavior of the moose, as well as in the insights it provides into the general principles of animal domestication.|$|E

25|$|Apart from Wallace, {{a number}} of {{scholars}} considered the role of sexual selection in human evolution controversial. Darwin was accused {{of looking at the}} evolution of early human ancestors through the moral lens of the 19th century Victorian society. Joan Roughgarden, citing many elements of sexual behaviour in animals and humans that cannot be explained by the sexual-selection model, suggested that the function of sex in human evolution was primarily social. Joseph Jordania suggested that in explaining such human morphological and <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristics</b> as singing, dancing, body painting, wearing of clothes, Darwin (and proponents of sexual selection) neglected another important evolutionary force, intimidation of predators and competitors with the ritualised forms of warning display. Warning display uses virtually the same arsenal of visual, audio, olfactory and behavioural features as sexual selection. According to the principle of aposematism (warning display), to avoid costly physical violence and to replace violence with the ritualised forms of display, many animal species (including humans) use different forms of warning display: visual signals (contrastive body colours, eyespots, body ornaments, threat display and various postures to look bigger), audio signals (ing, growling, group vocalisations, drumming on external objects), olfactory signals (producing strong body odors, particularly when excited or scared), behavioural signals (demonstratively slow walking, aggregation in large groups, aggressive display behaviour against predators and conspecific competitors). According to Jordania, most of these warning displays were incorrectly attributed to the forces of sexual selection.|$|E

It has a pointy snout, long legs, and almost complete toe webbing; the tympanum {{is large and}} distinct; and the overall body shape is similar to many Rana species. Like many frogs in the Rana genus, green and golden bell frogs are mostly aquatic, and only travel over land during periods of rainfall. It {{was removed from the}} genus because of anatomical differences with the family Ranidae. The bone and cartilage structural formations of the green and golden bell frog are closest to those of species in the family Hylidae; it was therefore reclassified.|$|E

50|$|Various {{attempts}} have been made to identify a single <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> that distinguishes humans from all other animals. Many anthropologists think that readily observable characteristics (tool-making and language) are based on less easily observable mental processes that might be unique among humans: the ability to think symbolically, in the abstract or logically, although several species have demonstrated some abilities in these areas. Nor is it clear at what point exactly in human evolution these traits became prevalent. They may not be restricted to the species Homo sapiens, as the extinct species of the Homo genus (e.g. Homo neanderthalensis, Homo erectus) are believed to also have been adept tool makers and may also have had linguistic skills.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Biometrics is a unique, {{measurable}} physiological or <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> of {{a person}} and finds extensive applications in authentication and authorization. Fingerprint, palm print, iris, voice, {{are some of the}} most widely used biometrics for personal identification. To reduce the error rates and enhance the usability of biometric system, multimodal biometric systems are used where more than one biometric characteristics are used. Approach: In this study it is proposed to investigate the performance of multimodal biometrics using palm print and fingerprint. Features are extracted using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and attributes selected using Information Gain (IG). Results and Conclusion: The proposed technique shows an average improvement of 8. 52 % compared to using palmprint technique alone. The processing time does not increase for verification compared to palm print techniques...|$|R
500|$|In 1874, English {{zoologist}} Alfred Henry Garrod {{published a}} study {{where he had}} examined various groups of birds and recorded which muscles of a selected group of five [...] they possessed or lacked. Noting that the muscle patterns were different among the steganopodes (classical Pelecaniformes), he resolved that there were divergent lineages in the group that should be in separate families, including frigatebirds in their own family Fregatidae. Urless N. Lanham observed in 1947 that frigatebirds bore some skeletal characteristics {{more in common with}} Procellariiformes than Pelecaniformes, though concluded they still belonged in the latter group (as suborder Fregatae), albeit as an early offshoot. Martyn Kennedy and colleagues derived a cladogram based on <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the traditional Pelecaniformes, calculating the frigatebirds to be more divergent than pelicans from a core group of gannets, darters and cormorants, and tropicbirds the most distant lineage. The classification of this group as the traditional Pelecaniformes, united by feet that are totipalmate (with all four toes linked by webbing) and the presence of a gular pouch, persisted until the early 1990s. The DNA–DNA hybridization studies of Charles Sibley and Jon Edward Ahlquist placed the frigatebirds in a lineage with penguins, loons, petrels and albatrosses. Subsequent genetic studies place the frigatebirds as a sister group to the group Suloidea, which comprises the gannets and boobies, cormorants and darters. Microscopic analysis of eggshell structure by Konstantin Mikhailov in 1995 found that the eggshells of frigatebirds resembled those of other Pelecaniformes in having a covering of thick microglobular material over the crystalline shells.|$|E

50|$|Although {{shopping}} {{addiction and}} compulsive purchase are conceptually different, they are interrelated {{and both are}} manifestations of the same problem: the lack of self-control when buying and to restrain impulses. Shopping addiction is understood as the eagerness for constantly making new purchases of unnecessary or superfluous things. The concept of compulsive purchase {{is related to the}} psychological process which causes many people {{not to be able to}} control their impulses and wishes of buying, and subjects them to reflexion and evaluation before purchasing. A basic <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> of people who have serious problems of consumer addiction is that their purchases are unnecessary and unsatisfactory. Addicts may feel pleasure or relief when they give in to the shopping wish, but regret it afterwards. In cases of people with severe problems of shopping addiction, this remorse can lead to very deep feelings of blame and discomfort.|$|R

50|$|A <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> of {{domestic}} pigs which they share with carnivores is nest building and bed making (although modern production systems often prevent these). Pigs root out wallows or depressions (digging with their snout) and the females (sows) will build nests {{in which to}} give birth. First the sow digs a depression {{about the size of}} her body. She then collects twigs, grasses and leaves, and carries these in her mouth to the depression, building them into a mound. She digs in smaller, finer material to the centre of the mound using her feet. When the mound reaches the desired height, she places large branches, up to 2 metres in length, on the surface. She enters into the mound and roots around to create a depression within the gathered material. She then gives birth in a lying position, which again is different from other artiodactyls which usually give birth in a standing position.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{aggressive}} and over-protectiveness as an adult, continuous socialization {{as early as possible}} could allow the dog to adjust. When Chow Chows have reached adolescence they reject authority from any other owner who failed to earn its admiration. Aggression can be one distinctive <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> in this breed, though while some are of an aggressive nature, many are known to be easy-going in nature - sometimes adopting an aloof disposition to individuals other than their owners. Aggression when it does appear is often towards other dogs of the same sex, especially Chows. Due to their strong hunting instincts, it is recommended that these dogs stay fenced, leashed, and away from cats and small dogs. This is why it is crucial that they are socialized early and consistently in order to act appropriately with strangers. At first, chow chows are very hesitant in interacting with strangers. However, this problem can be avoided if the owners train the chow chow at a young age.|$|R
5000|$|Territories may {{be held by}} an individual, a mated or unmated pair, or a group. Territoriality is {{not always}} a fixed <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a species. For example, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) either {{establish}} stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode. [...] Territories may vary with time (season), for example, European robins defend territories as pairs during the breeding season but as individuals during the winter. Resource availability may cause changes in territoriality, for example, some nectarivores defend territories only during the mornings when plants are richest in nectar. In species that do not form pair bonds, male and female territories are often independent, i.e. males defend territories only against other males and females only against other females. In this case, if the species is polygynous, one male territory probably contains several female territories, while in some polyandrous species such as the northern jacana, this situation is reversed.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{behavioural}} {{development is}} a complex phenomenon that refers to the setting up and the modification of behaviours throughout the animal’s life. The behavioural development is influenced by epigenetic parental effects and especially by maternal influences. We propose to review our works of postnatal and parental influences on behavioural in birds. So, in quail and hen, the mother’s presence during the mothering phase influences the feeding behaviour, the spatial exploitation, behavioural rhythm but also the emotive and social characteristics of their adoptive chicks. Moreover, the mother’s characteristics can also conduct their young to a particular behavioural developmental way. Indeed, we demonstrated that mother can non genetically transmit {{a part of her}} emotional reactivity, social motivation, food preference, circadian rhythm and relation to humans. More recently, we investigated the prenatal effects by the modulation of several hormones’ levels into the egg. We demonstrated that the life social environment and the <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the laying female (e. g., her relationship with human) influence the androgen levels in the egg and the emotional phenotype of the offspring...|$|R

At least some calendrical savants possess date calculation skills. A <b>behavioural</b> <b>characteristic</b> observed in many calendrical savants is increased response time for questions about more remote years.

Only two savants could be scanned and excessive head movement corrupted one savant's mental arithmetic data. Nevertheless, there was increased parietal activation during both mental arithmetic and date questions and this region showed increased activity with more remote dates.
