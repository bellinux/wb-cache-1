40|$|Deepwater {{operations}} in subsea production {{systems can be}} critically affected during transient events, such as shutdown periods, because {{of the formation of}} hydrates and/or wax deposits (see figure 1). Such formations/deposits can completely block production pipelines, thus requiring different technological solutions to restart production [1, 2]. In fact, during shutdown periods the fluid looses heat to the surrounding environment and hydrates can be formed even at relatively high temperatures, due to the high pressures involved in oil fields nowadays located around 2000 meter below sea level. A possible solution to avoid the formation of hydrates and wax deposits currently applied by the petroleum industry is to use heating protocols on subsea production systems. Typical heating protocols can be used to maintain the fluid temperature above critical levels, as well as to warm it up from the seawater temperature, or from a critical temperature, to a desired thermal profile [3].

Objective: The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate linear tooth displacement during processing of maxillary complete dentures submitted to two inclusion methods and conventional polymerization. Material and method: Twenty maxillary complete dentures were fabricated: G 1 – inclusion with silicone barrier, and G 2 – inclusion with dental stone type IV barrier. Points were marked on incisal surface of right central incisor and cusp of second molars to allow linear measurement of the replicas through the software AutoCAD. The evaluation of artificial teeth displacement for both groups was carried out in different moments: a) <b>waxed</b> denture; <b>b)</b> <b>waxed</b> denture partially invested with stone or silicone barrier; c) after complete flasking; d) denture into flask after polymerization; e) denture attached to the cast after deflasking; f) denture separated from the cast; g) denture after finishing and polishing; h) denture after storage in water at 36 ° during 7 days. Result: Linear alterations occurred on artificial teeth positioning for both groups and in all periods of inclusion, with higher alterations for group G 2. The data from phases c and d were significant different from other phases when compared intra groups, for both inclusion methods evaluated. Conclusion: Group G 2 exhibited the greatest alterations. After polymerization, group G 1 (Inclusion with silicone barrier complemented with dental stone type III) demonstrated higher distance between the points (expansion) while group G 2 revealed reduced distance (contraction). ...|$|R

We aimed to evaluate whether the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is associated with the prognosis of adult patients with HSP. Clinical data including the NLR of adult patients with HSP were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into three groups as follows: (a) simple recovery, (<b>b)</b> <b>wax</b> & wane without GI bleeding, and (c) {{development of}} GI bleeding. The optimal cut-off value was determined using a receiver operating characteristics curve and the Youden index. A total of 66 adult patients were enrolled. The NLR was higher in the GI bleeding group than in the simple recovery or wax & wane group (simple recovery vs. wax & wane vs. GI bleeding; median [IQR], 2. 32 [1. 61 - 3. 11] vs. 3. 18 [2. 16 - 3. 71] vs. 7. 52 [4. 91 - 10. 23], P< 0. 001). For the purpose of predicting simple recovery, the optimal cut-off value of NLR was 3. 18, and the sensitivity and specificity were 74. 1 % and 75. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|There is {{a global}} need for {{cost-effective}} and environmentally friendly tools for control of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne diseases. One potential way to achieve this is to combine already available tools to gain synergistic effects to reduce vector mosquito populations. Another possible way to improve mosquito control is to extend the active period of a given control agent, enabling less frequent applications and consequently, more efficient and longer lasting vector population suppression. We investigated the potential of biodegradable wax emulsions to improve the performance of semiochemical attractants for gravid female culicine vectors of disease, {{as well as to}} achieve more effective control of their aquatic larval offspring. As an attractant for gravid females, we selected acetoxy hexadecanolide (AHD), the Culex oviposition pheromone. As toxicant for mosquito larvae, we chose the biological larvicides Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) and Bacillus sphaericus (Bs). These attractant and larvicidal agents were incorporated, separately and in combination, into a biodegradable wax emulsion, a commercially available product called SPLAT (Specialized Pheromone & Lure Application Technology) and SPLATbac, which contains 8. 33 % Bti and 8. 33 % <b>Bs.</b> <b>Wax</b> emulsions were applied to water surfaces as buoyant pellets of 20 mg each. Dose-mortality analyses of Culex quinquefasciatus Say larvae demonstrated that a single 20 mg pellet of a 10 - 1 dilution of SPLATbac in a larval tray containing 1 L of water caused 100 % mortality of neonate (1 st instar) larvae for at least five weeks after application. Mortality of 3 rd instar larvae remained equally high with SPLATbac dilutions down to 10 - 2 for over two weeks post application. Subsequently, AHD was added to SPLAT (emulsion only, without Bs or Bti) to attract gravid females (SPLATahd), or together with biological larvicides to attract ovipositing females and kill emerging larvae (SPLATbacAHD, 10 - 1 dilution) in both laboratory and semi-field settings. The formulations containing AHD, irrespective of presence of larvicides, were strongly preferred as an oviposition substrate by gravid female mosquitoes over controls for more than two weeks post application. Experiments conducted under semi-field settings (large screened greenhouse, emulating field conditions) confirmed the results obtained in the laboratory. The combination of attractant and larvicidal agents in a single formulation resulted in a substantial increase in larval mosquito mortality when compared to formulations containing the larvicide agents alone. Collectively, our data demonstrate the potential for the effective use of wax emulsions as slow release matrices for mosquito attractants and control agents. The results indicate that the combination of an oviposition attractant with larvicides could synergize the control of mosquito disease vectors, specifically Cx. quinquefasciatus, a nuisance pest and circumtropical vector of lymphatic filariasis and encephalitis...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the responses of}} river deltas to both fluvial and marine environmental changes. Fluvial sediment flux, the predominant factor providing sediment to deltaic systems, can vary significantly over time, affecting delta formation and evolution. Hurricanes and cold fronts, which cause significant changes in coastal hydrodynamics, also greatly influence delta morphology. This thesis incorporates two areas of interest: a) the Ebro River in Spain, for which numerical simulations of long-term fluvial sediment fluxes were conducted using the hydrological transport model HydroTrend, and <b>b)</b> the <b>Wax</b> Lake Delta (WLD) in Louisiana, for which the morphological changes were investigated under different magnitudes of coastal storms by applying the numerical model Delft 3 D. The 4, 000 -years history of fluvial sediment flux for the Ebro delta was reconstructed based on climate changes and anthropogenic factors. The results demonstrate that long-term fluvial water discharge to the river mouth is controlled by changes in precipitation, which have a high annual variability but no long-term trend. Modeled suspended sediment load, however, has an increasing trend over time, which {{is closely related to}} anthropogenic land cover variations. The recent significant decrease in sediment flux (more than 99 %) is also attributed to human influences (dam emplacements). Hurricanes and cold fronts are the two major weather systems influencing the morphology of coastal wetlands along the Gulf of Mexico. Here, simulations show that Hurricane Rita, which made landfall 120 km to the west of WLD as a Category 3 hurricane in 2005, {{had a significant impact on}} the delta, with more than 500, 000 m 3 of bottom sediment eroded, while the simulated largest cold front in the 2008 - 2009 season (mean wind speed of 11. 4 m/s) caused net erosion of 100, 000 m 3. However, the cumulative impact of cold fronts in 2009 caused 1, 900, 000 m 3 of erosion on the WLD during 29 events, much higher than the erosion caused by the two hurricanes in 2008 (Gustav and Ike caused erosion of 500, 000 m 3). Winds and waves, hurricane tracks, and aboveground vegetation are the major driving forces of the morphological changes, while fluvial input and roots have a minor influence on delta morphology during hurricane events...|$|R
40|$|The {{eruption}} of the Permian Ora caldera of northern Italy during the Hercynian-Variscan tectonic cycle, {{represents one of}} the largest explosive eruptions on Earth, having erupted more than 1290 km 3 of material, and provides significant information on caldera eruption processes. Research on large caldera volcanoes (> 100 km 3) is important due to their potentially devastating global impacts on the natural world and human society. The absence of such an eruption in recent recorded history means fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding the processes related to these volcanoes. The Permian Ora caldera offers a unique opportunity to examine the eruptions of these gigantic systems because of the rare and exceptional preservation and exposure of the intra-caldera fill sequence. The {{purpose of this study is}} to document the lithofacies, and the stratigraphic architecture of the Ora caldera, and also to interpret processes such as the timing and nature of caldera collapse, eruption styles, pyroclastic flow processes within the intra-caldera and proximal extra-caldera settings, and caldera in-filling processes. The research approach adopted in this study included detailed field stratigraphic logging, petrographic analysis of componentry and texture, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility analysis (AMS) of pyroclastic flow patterns, and geochemical analysis. This study has established that the Ora Formation consists of rhyolitic ignimbrite deposits (67. 95 % – 77. 73 % SiO 2), with sub-ordinate basal volcanic lithic breccia and local interbedded surge layers. The ignimbrite succession is crystal-rich (~ 25 – 57 %; Ø 43 %), lithic-poor (0 – 46 %; Ø 2 %), has common juvenile clasts (0 to ~ 45 %; Ø 20 %), is ubiquitously welded, and has a relatively uniform main mineral population (volcanic quartz, sanidine, plagioclase, and biotite). The Ora Formation has been divided into four members (ORAa – ORAd) which consist of (a) a basal volcanic lithic breccia; (b) lithic-rich ignimbrite with minor surge lithofacies; (c) the dominant, thick(> 1 km thickness in total), coarse-crystal-rich ignimbrite (including the bimodal crystal sub-facies), with local interbedded vitrophyre, fine-crystal-rich, and lithic-rich ignimbrite, and minor surge lithofacies deposits; and (d) the fine-crystal-rich ignimbrite with minor lithic-rich ignimbrite lithofacies deposits. These members largely define the eruption phases, from vent opening (member a), vent clearing (member <b>b),</b> <b>waxing</b> and steady eruption (member c), to waning eruption stages (member d). Members a and b reveal caldera collapse occurred from the onset of eruption and identify potential source vent locations, whereas member c illustrates late stage overspill of material from the caldera system. The Ora caldera is proposed as being a volcano-tectonic system, which formed two pene-contemporaneous, coalesced caldera collapse depressions: Northern and Southern. This is interpreted to have occurred via rapid, relatively passive, piston style collapse events, producing a caldera complex approximately 42 x 40 km in size. The ignimbrite succession has a restricted compositional range. Nevertheless, detailed textural, compositional, mineralogical, and stratigraphic data support an eruption evolving from south to north, and the existence of a weakly zoned magma chamber. This is illustrated particularly by a subtle northwards decrease in modal free crystal biotite abundance across the deposit. Other major findings based on fieldwork and laboratory studies include: (i) the absence of a Plinian fallout deposit, indicating that a buoyant Plinian eruption column did not form; (ii) the eruption was marked by a low, continuously collapsing eruption fountain style, which was limited from the outset by catastrophic caldera collapse and decompression of the magma chamber; (iii) the vent was a fissure system with multiple discharge points, feeding more or less on-going, subtly different, pyroclastic flow pulses; (iv) the vertical lithofacies changes record temporal variation in eruption intensity, source material, and source location, demonstrating an incremental caldera in-filling process; (v) the AMS magnetic fabric of the ignimbrite succession indicates changing vertical and lateral pyroclastic flow directions and source locations of the flow pulses; (vi) the pyroclastic flow system was a hot and poorly expanded, high particle concentration, granular density current, with laminar shear forces close to the depositional boundary, and limited ash winnowing; and (vii) the eruption style and pyroclastic flow dynamics facilitated complete deposit welding, illustrated by plastically deformed juvenile shard and fiamme clast morphologies. This research has detailed for the first time the eruptive products and stratigraphy of the Ora Formation and reconstructed the eruption processes and evolution of the Ora caldera system. Key findings include identification of the relative timing of caldera collapse, the caldera in-filling processes, and delineation of a lithostratigraphic and chemical architecture within the deposits. These results highlight the vital role investigation of the intra-caldera deposit plays in understanding of caldera processes. The intra-caldera ignimbrite succession shares many of the general characteristics described for ignimbrites in the extra-caldera setting, which implies that classification schemes and models of pyroclastic flow and emplacement processes are largely transferable between the two settings...|$|R
40|$|Cryoprotectins are polypeptides {{that belong}} to the lipid {{transfer}} protein family (LTP). This protein family consists from five polypeptides in B. oleracea, which are called WAX 9 protein. Of these five proteins in this work four proteins were tested for lipid transfer or cryoprotective properties, their binding abilities to the thylakoid membranes and their molecular weight. Cryoprotectin (CPP) isolated from hardened cabbage leaves {{was used as a}} positive control. WAX 9 proteins were expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified by reverse phase chromatography. The purified proteins remained active for at least 4 months. In this work, I could show in vitro that in addition to the similarity in the nucleotide sequence the two WAX 9 A and WAX 9 E proteins were very similar in their activities. Both showed a high degree of lipid transfer activity and had no cryoprotective activity. The binding capacity of two lipid transfer proteins to the thylakoid membranes was weak. The other two proteins <b>WAX</b> 9 <b>B</b> and <b>WAX</b> 9 D, which are similar in nucleotide sequence, behaved as cryoprotectins and showed no lipid transfer activity. These two cryoprotective proteins showed in vitro strong binding to the thylakoid membranes. The WAX 9 proteins studied had either lipid transfer or cryoprotective activity but not both activities, resulting in a clear functional distinction between cryoprotection and lipid transfer. Molecular modelling of the binding of proteins to the membranes (Dr. De Lamotte, personal communication) predicted that two amino acids in the cryoprotective WAX 9 D (position T 27 and S 35 of the mature protein) {{play a crucial role in}} the binding to the membranes. These two amino acids were exchanged individually and together by directed mutagenesis. When the corresponding amino acids from the lipid transfer protein WAX 9 E were inserted at positions 27 and 35 of the cryoprotective WAX 9 D protein, the single amino acid substitutions did neither change the cryoprotective behavior of WAX 9 D, nor did they increase the residual lipid transfer activity. The double mutant, however, lost cryoprotective activity and gained a weak lipid transfer activity. The experimental results confirmed the prediction from molecular modelling about the strength of membrane binding of the WAX 9 proteins and also showed the close correlation between weak membrane binding and lipid transfer activity versus strong membrane binding and cryoprotective activity...|$|R

The reduction of the marginal gap between a crown and tooth abutment is an important goal in Fixed Prosthodontics. Smaller gap produce less gingival irritation and decrease cement washout, improving the clinical outcome and longevity of the restoration. Methods. From a master die, eight impressions were made using PVS material. These 8 impressions were poured twice each in type IV die stone to produce 16 samples. The techniques used to fabricate the metal copings were: A wax pattern coping and a CAD/CAM milled plastic coping. The dies were numbered from 1 to 8 and marked A for the 1 st pour group and B for the 2 nd pour group. Groups 1 and 2 were organized as follows: Group 1 (CAD/CAM) included the first four samples of group A and the last four samples of Group <b>B.</b> Group 2 (<b>WAX)</b> included the last four samples of Group A and the first four samples of group B.

In nature, the apolar epicuticular wax layer of plants that consists of several classes of hydrocarbons serves as the substrate that retains these contact kairomones. However, experiments on chemical footprints generally have used filter paper as substrate to study insect behavior. Here, we explored the ability of Trissolcus basalis (Scelionidae) females to discriminate between footprint cues left by male and female Nezara viridula (Pentatomidae) on leaves of their host plant Brassica oleracea (broccoli). Furthermore, we analyzed the chemical composition of the outermost wax layer of broccoli leaves to evaluate the degree of overlap in insect and plant cuticular hydrocarbons {{that could lead to}} masking effects in the detection of footprint cues. Our results showed that <b>B.</b> oleracea epicuticular <b>wax</b> retains the chemical footprints of adult bugs and allows T. basalis females to differentiate hosts of different sex. Traces of female bugs elicited more extensive searching behavior in egg parasitoids than traces of males. The application of n-nonadecane, a compound specific to male N. viridula, on the tarsi of female bugs prevented parasitoid females from distinguishing between host male and host female footprints. Analyses of B. oleracea leaves revealed that epicuticular waxes were mainly composed of linear alkanes, ketones, and secondary alcohols. Alkanes were dominated by n-nonacosane (nC 29) and n-hentriacontane (nC 31), while male-specific n-nonadecane (nC 19) was absent.

40|$|Consolidation of {{degraded}} {{and frail}} wood by impregnation with synthetic and natural polymeric compounds in solution {{is one of}} the most important operations of active conservation of wooden cultural heritage. The effectiveness of such a treatment depends essentially on the consolidant retention, penetration and uniformity of distribution, aspects that could be cumulated in the term of impregnation level and practically influenced by many and various factors. The purpose of this work was to look at some practical possibilities of characterising the impregnation level achieved in some consolidation treatments with different solutions of a frequently employed synthetic polymer (Paraloid <b>B</b> 72) and <b>waxes</b> (beeswax and modified paraffins as melts or in combination with linseed oil) using a simple optical microscopy technique in conjunction with an original method of samples preparation.

The examination in transmitted light (TLM) of the cross-cut micro sections and in reflected light (RLM) of the wooden blocks allowed the visualisation of the consolidation products and their distribution in the wood structure, but this was easier for the consolidants with high solids content (waxes), which partly filled the lumens, and much more difficult and relative in the case of the diluted Paraloid solutions which did not fill the lumens but only impart a very shiny, highly reflective aspect of the treated areas. In order to objectively appreciate the retention and penetration of consolidants into wood the method using ImageJ, a useful image processing software, was used to process the micrographs so that some quantitative estimations of the variation of the impregnation level with the penetration depth were obtained...|$|R
