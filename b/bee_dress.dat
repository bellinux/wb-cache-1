In a period of ten days, ending on July 1, 1933, 50,000 sq ft of showroom and light manufacturing space was rented at 550 Seventh Avenue. Adler also owned a 30-story bank and garment building on the opposite corner. It was known as 530 Seventh Avenue. The 24-story structure was occupied exclusively by high-class dressmakers.|$|E

50|$|D. D. Smalley, {{grandfather}} of artist and musician Frank Davis, {{was inspired by}} his grandson’s birth in 1941 and began production of what was eventually called the Hyde Park Miniature Museum. On display in the oversized attic of a house on Hyde Park Street was a range of artifacts, including 250,000 postage stamps wrapped in bundles of 100, dinosaur excrement and bones, Indian skulls, tools, handmade models, over 1,000 clocks, the U.S. Constitution in Braille, wax recordings, a three-toed horse hoof, short wave radio paraphernalia, <b>bee</b> tracking glasses, <b>dressed</b> fleas, and many other curiosities and miscellany, all carefully arranged and catalogued.|$|R
50|$|Shot on {{location}} in and around Salt Lake City, Utah, the unscripted half-hour series follows Clark and Baird as they purchase foreclosed houses at bidding auctions and quickly fix them up {{to get them back}} on the market and turn a profit. They also renovate and hold some houses, waiting for the value to go up further. They have no legal right to enter a house until they win the house at auction. When entering a house for the first time, they often have to kick the door down, since the houses don’t come with keys. Items Clark and Baird have found inside the homes include thousands of <b>bees,</b> wedding <b>dresses,</b> vehicles and television sets, as well as a house that was formerly a meth lab. They are able to make quick purchasing decisions based in large part on their understanding of specific neighborhoods and their values. When a foreclosed house doesn’t sell at auction, it is almost always subject to bank repossession, widely considered to be a negative result because banks are typically slower at turning around a foreclosed property.|$|R
