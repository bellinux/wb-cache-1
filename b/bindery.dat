5|$|The small edition {{was sold}} for $450; like the deluxe edition, {{it was set}} in Monotype Gill Sans, but in single columns. It was printed on Mohawk Superfine text by the Sun Hill Press, with the {{reproduction}} of the etchings printed on a Canon laser printer. The edition was then Smythe sewn at Spectrum <b>Bindery</b> and enclosed in a solander box. A bronze-boxed collectors' copy was also released, and retailed at $7,500.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{classes and}} {{vocational}} workshops, the orphanage operated its own printing press and <b>bindery</b> where it produced its own textbooks, Braille books, and German-language newspapers. It also operated a flour mill and bakery that produced 35,000 {{loaves of bread}} a year, a laundry and clothing-repair service, a carpentry, a pottery factory that produced all the clay utensils used in the orphanage, and a tree and plant nursery. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, a large brick and tile factory was erected on the premises, which produced one million bricks and 250,000 tiles annually.|$|E

50|$|Spiral Binding {{during this}} period {{continually}} opened trade <b>binderies</b> throughout the U.S. and had 10 <b>binderies.</b> In 1937, Western Pad and Tablet started binding its own books, using binding machines from Spiral Binding's Equipment Division. The Equipment Division created machines for trade businesses using Double-O Wire and other bindings, and enabled Spiral Binding to enter these markets for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Paper {{drilling}} is {{a technique}} used in trade <b>binderies</b> for providing large quantities of paper with round holes. The paper can be processed as loose leaves and in brochures (stitched, perfect bound). The holes usually serve for storage (filing), sometimes for decorative purposes.|$|R

25|$|The National Library {{has many}} {{examples}} of books with fine bindings in its holdings. These include under-painted vellum, Victorian carved wood and papier-mâché bindings, French art nouveau bookbinding and bindings by Bernard C. Middleton and the Gregynog Press binder, George Fisher.

25|$|Other labor-themed murals in the {{building}} are Isis Rodriguez’s illustration of the <b>Bindery</b> Women’s Local 125, which occupied {{the building}} in the early 1920s; Sebastiana Pastor's depicting {{the organization of the}} Chinese Ladies Garment Workers Union Local 341 in 1938; Ruby Neri (with Alicia McCarthy)'s personal work (in ball-point pen) on the theme of sign painting—an oblique tribute to Sign Painters' Local 510, which sanctioned the project; and Susan Greene's rendering of the Service Employees International Union's hotel and department store strike of 1941.|$|E
60|$|I've got {{the first}} volume {{launched}} safely; consequently, half of the suspense is over, and I am that much nearer the goal. We've bound and shipped 200,000 books; and by the 10th shall finish and ship the remaining 125,000 of the first edition. I got nervous and came down to help hump-up the binderies; and I mean to stay here pretty much all the time till {{the first days of}} March, when the second volume will issue. Shan't have so much trouble, this time, though, if we get to press pretty soon, because we can get more <b>binderies</b> then than are to be had in front of the holidays. One lives and learns. I find it takes 7 <b>binderies</b> four months to bind 325,000 books.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>binderies</b> {{creating}} {{books in}} this style {{during this period}} were the companies of Rivière and Zaehnsdorf. The largest collection of these masterpieces was the Phoebe Boyle one; over 100 jewelled bindings were sold in 1923. Jewelled bindings occasionally appear at auction; literature on them is surprisingly scant given their superb quality.|$|R
50|$|When {{the type}} was set and proof sheets were {{available}} from the publishers, a marked set, showing clearly both the old reading and the new, was submitted to Ellen for careful reading and approval. By early July 1911, the book was in the <b>binderies</b> of Pacific Press and the Review and Herald.|$|R
25|$|He {{took the}} {{elevator}} to the executive reception area on the third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a <b>bindery</b> supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed {{down the stairs to the}} pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
25|$|Today, modern {{bookbinding}} {{is divided}} between hand binding by individual craftsmen {{working in a}} one-room studio shop and commercial bindings mass-produced by high speed machines in a production line factory. There is a broad grey area between the two divisions. The size and complexity of a <b>bindery</b> shop varies with job types, for example, from {{one of a kind}} custom jobs, to repair/restoration work, to library rebinding, to preservation binding, to small edition binding, to extra binding, and finally to large run publisher's binding. There are cases where the printing and binding jobs are combined in one shop. A step up to the next level of mechanization is determined by economics of scale until you reach production runs of ten thousand copies or more in a factory employing a dozen or more workers.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{have been}} found with the maps as free leaves, rather than pasted down. Invariably these have been a library edition. Most of those seen have been bound in orange cloth. The front cover mimics the first edition dust jacket, silk-screened in black. Because several {{identical}} examples of the library edition have been reported, and because the endpaper maps show no evidence of having been glued down originally, {{it would not have}} come about as ad hoc rebinds by libraries. Rather, a major <b>bindery</b> is assumed to have sourced the text block directly from the publisher. Not enough specimens have been examined to know if library bindings were supplied for all the printings. This library edition trimmed a full 5mm from the text block's outside margin and a combined 3mm vertically.|$|E
50|$|The various {{editions of}} the Complete Works include a number of {{university}} press releases, as well as versions released from larger publishing companies. The Complete Works (especially in older editions) are often sought after by book collectors, {{and a number of}} <b>binderies</b> and publishing houses have produced leather bound and gilded releases for luxury book collecting.|$|R
25|$|Some {{businesses}} {{maximize their}} profit margins through vertical integration; book publishing {{is not one}} of them. Although newspaper and magazine companies still often own printing presses and <b>binderies,</b> book publishers rarely do. Similarly, the trade usually sells the finished products through a distributor who stores and distributes the publisher's wares for a percentage fee or sells on a sale or return basis.|$|R
50|$|After World War II, many {{customers}} {{wanted to bring}} their binding processes in-house. As a result, Spiral Binding sold some of their <b>binderies</b> and the equipment division flourished. This allowed Spiral Binding {{to be able to}} cater to customers of all sizes; from small customers who want to bind a few books at a time to large customers who want to buy equipment and supplies and bind in-house.|$|R
25|$|Addams and Starr {{were the}} first two {{occupants}} of the house, which would later become the residence of about 25 women. At its height, Hull House was visited each week by some 2,000 people. The Hull House was a center for research, empirical analysis, study, and debate, {{as well as a}} pragmatic center for living in and establishing good relations with the neighborhood. Residents of Hull-house conducted investigations on housing, midwifery, fatigue, tuberculosis, typhoid, garbage collection, cocaine, and truancy. Its facilities included a night school for adults, clubs for older children, a public kitchen, an art gallery, a gym, a girls' club, a bathhouse, a book <b>bindery,</b> a music school, a drama group and a theater, apartments, a library, meeting rooms for discussion, clubs, an employment bureau, and a lunchroom. Her adult night school was a forerunner of the continuing education classes offered by many universities today. In addition to making available social services and cultural events for the largely immigrant population of the neighborhood, Hull House afforded an opportunity for young social workers to acquire training. Eventually, Hull House became a 13-building settlement complex, which included a playground and a summer camp (known as Bowen Country Club).|$|E

50|$|Paper {{drilling}} machines {{are used in}} trade <b>binderies,</b> commercial print shops with finishing department, in-house print shops and copy shops. Depending on the volumes these companies operate {{many different types of}} paper {{drilling machines}} - from simple one- and two-spindle hand operated table top paper drills to standard motorised four- spindle paper drilling machines and fully automated, integrated paper drilling systems. These high performance paper drills can run in-line with other finishing equipment.|$|R

2500|$|A May 1916 Union Directory had 54 unions {{using the}} {{building}} for their meetings.

50|$|Bookbinding: In this two-year program, {{students}} learn fundamental hand-bookbinding techniques while producing {{a variety of}} binding structures in cloth, paper, leather, and vellum. Hands-on book repair and conservation techniques are taught, along with tool use and modification, edition binding techniques, and protective enclosures. The second year is focused primarily on fine leather bindings and more advanced finishing and conservation procedures. Graduates enter the field as bookbinders in custom <b>binderies</b> and university or institutional conservation labs or as self-employed bookbinders and book artists.|$|R
50|$|Although not {{as common}} as 4:1 pitch coil, some {{printers}} and <b>binderies</b> use 5:1 pitch coil. With five holes per inch, 5:1 pitch coil is more tightly wound and provides a neat and tidy appearance. However, the tight spacing of the coil and the smaller size of the holes used by this pattern limit the size of spines that are available. Spiral coil with 5:1 pitch is available in diameters ranging from 5 mm up to 25 mm. This means that documents larger than one inch thick cannot be bound using this hole pattern.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} bind {{documents}} with double loop wire a binding machine and a wire closer are required. Smaller organizations will often choose a small manual wire binding machine {{that offers a}} manual hole punch and a built in wire closer. Medium-sized users will often choose a wire binding machine with an electric punch and built in wire closer. The highest volume wire binding users such as <b>binderies,</b> print shops and in-plant printers will usually separate the punching and finishing stages of the binding process {{in order to increase}} productivity. These users will often use a heavy duty modular interchangeable die punch or an automated punching system along with either a manual or an electric wire closing machine.|$|R
2500|$|At IP, Allen was {{responsible}} for introducing {{the production of a}} series of inexpensive [...] "New World Paperbacks" [...] and made reissues of classic Marxist canon more readily available to a new generation of political activists and college students. During a cross-country sales trip, Allen had been convinced that the book trade was going to be dominated by the paperback format and that if IP were to survive in the new environment, it would need to retool its offerings. Old sets of book sheets not yet bound into covers were gathered up at the <b>bindery,</b> some having laid unused for years, and a new set of cover designs was commissioned. Fifteen titles were thus assembled at minimal cost and launched en masse onto the market, promoted by a special catalog. The inexpensive series gained ready acceptance in the market.|$|E
2500|$|By April 1923, he {{was again}} frequenting Viața Românească, at the Poporanists' new club in Bucharest. The modernist Felix Aderca, who also paid a visit, recalls that [...] "lily-white" [...] Rosetti was {{showing signs of}} senility, {{describing}} medieval genealogies to a <b>bindery</b> foreman. Also that year, Rosetti indirectly contributed {{to the history of}} Romanian cinema, as one of his novellas became the basis for Alfred Halm's The Gypsy Girl at the Alcove. A lost film adapted by Beldiman (who also appears in it as Taverner Ștrul), it is noted for starring both Elvira Popescu and Ion Finteșteanu, as well as for its depiction of sexual abuse by the boyars on their female slaves. Rosetti's final scholarly work was a 1923 piece on medieval Moldavia from Lațcu to Alexander I, followed in 1924 by a third edition of Cu paloșul.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{injuries}} and suffering, Litten strove {{to maintain his}} spirits. At one point, in 1934, his situation improved a little bit when he was moved to Lichtenburg. Initially, it was the same, with more beatings, but then {{he was allowed to}} work in the book <b>bindery</b> and the library. On occasion, he was able to listen to music on the radio on Sundays. He was well liked and respected by his fellow prisoners for his knowledge, inner strength and courage. One prisoner wrote about a party (allowed by the SS) at which a number of SS men were in attendance. Unafraid of their presence, Litten recited the lyrics of a song that had meant a lot to him in his youth, [...] "Thoughts are free" [...] (in German, Die Gedanken sind frei). The prisoner said that apparently the SS men did not grasp the significance of the words.|$|E
5|$|The British Library {{was created}} on 1 July 1973 {{as a result}} of the British Library Act 1972. Prior to this, the {{national}} library was part of the British Museum, which provided the bulk of the holdings of the new library, alongside smaller organisations which were folded in (such as the National Central Library, the National Lending Library for Science and Technology and the British National Bibliography). In 1974 functions previously exercised by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information were taken over; in 1982 the India Office Library and Records and the HMSO <b>Binderies</b> became British Library responsibilities. In 1983, the Library absorbed the National Sound Archive, which holds many sound and video recordings, with over a million discs and thousands of tapes.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{strengths}} of spiral coil binding is that the supplies are available {{in a variety of}} lengths. Most users purchase spiral coils in twelve inch lengths. This spine is inserted onto an eleven-inch document and the excess length of coil is cut and crimped {{at each end of the}} book. However, the forming process for creating spiral coil binding elements allows them to be created in virtually any length. Many <b>binderies</b> and print shops choose to purchase coils in 36-inch lengths in order to have the flexibility to bind custom document sizes and to reduce waste. For binding documents shorter than eleven inches it is also possible to purchase shorter lengths of spiral coil in order to save time and money.|$|R
