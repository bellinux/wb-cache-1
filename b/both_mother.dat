5|$|Each person {{belongs to}} both the mother's and the father's families, the only {{bilateral}} family line in Indonesia. Children, therefore, inherit household affiliation from <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and father, including land and even family debts. Children's names are given {{on the basis of}} kinship, and are usually chosen after dead relatives. Names of aunts, uncles and cousins are commonly referred to in the names of mothers, fathers and siblings.|$|E

5|$|In April 2003, a Japanese {{television}} advertisement {{revealed that}} <b>both</b> <b>Mother</b> 3 and a combined Mother 1+2 cartridge were in {{development for the}} handheld Game Boy Advance. Mother 3 abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D, but kept its plot. It became a bestseller upon its Japanese release in 2006, yet did not receive a North American release {{on the basis that}} it would not sell. Around Mother 3 2006 release, Itoi stated that he had no plans to make Mother 4, which he has reaffirmed repeatedly. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America, as Mother 1, Mother 1+2 and Mother 3 were not released outside Japan. Despite this, Ness's recurrence in the Super Smash Bros. series signaled favorable odds {{for the future of the}} Mother series.|$|E
5|$|The golden-crowned sifaka is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|In this period, it {{was common}} for {{aspiring}} Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there {{in conjunction with a}} trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906. But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if they could afford to get to Europe. Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to {{be a man}} one month and a woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed into a man who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the leading causes of death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E

40|$|Using the actor–partner {{interdependence}} model, {{we explore}} how various {{sources of stress}} and support experienced by fathers and mothers influence their own parenting styles and the parenting styles of the partner. Data from 227 couples were analyzed, with mothers and fathers rating their parenting stress and marital relationship and children rating the parenting styles of <b>both</b> <b>mothers</b> and fathers. Structural equation models revealed actor effects of parenting stress on demanding and responsive parenting styles, as well as partner effects between positive aspects of marital relationship and responsive parenting style. The results further indicate that the strength of these pathways is similar for <b>both</b> <b>mothers</b> and fathers and {{do not support the}} hypothesis that the parenting of fathers is more vulnerable than the parenting of mothers. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a self-report {{questionnaire}} to explore parental modelling of eating behaviours and then to use the newly developed measure to investigate associations between parental modelling with healthy and unhealthy food intake in <b>both</b> <b>mothers</b> and their children. Mothers (n[*]=[*] 484) with a child aged between 18 months and 8 years completed the Parental Modelling of Eating Behaviours Scale (PARM), a new, self-report measure of modelling, {{as well as a}} food frequency questionnaire. Principal components analysis of the PARM identified 15 items grouped into three subscales: verbal modelling (modelling through verbal communication); unintentional modelling (UM) (children adopting eating behaviours that parents had not actively modelled); and behavioural consequences (children's eating behaviours directly associated with parental modelling). The PARM subscales were found to be differentially related to food intake. Maternally perceived consequences of behavioural modelling were related to increased fruit and vegetable intake in <b>both</b> <b>mothers</b> and children. UM was related to higher levels of savoury snack intake in <b>both</b> <b>mothers</b> and their children. This study has highlighted three distinct aspects of parental modelling of eating behaviours. The findings suggest that mothers may intentionally model healthy food intake while unintentionally acting as role models for their children's less healthy, snack food intake. ...|$|R

25|$|Thackeray's father, Richmond Thackeray, {{was born}} at South Mimms and went to India in 1798 at age sixteen as a writer (civil servant) with the East India Company. Richmond fathered a daughter, Sarah Redfield, in 1804 with Charlotte Sophia Rudd, his {{possibly}} Eurasian mistress, and <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and daughter were named in his will.

25|$|Many methods, which differ {{according}} to different regions, exist {{to stop a}} woman from turning into a Churel. One way is to bury the body and fill the grave with thorns and pile heavy stones on top to stop the evil spirit from getting out. If a woman dies during pregnancy, her body is cut open to take the child out and <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and child are buried in the same grave.|$|E
25|$|Finally, doctors {{managed to}} save <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and child. The baby, however, {{suffered}} damage at the brachial plexus, and the nerves {{in his arm}} were injured. As he grew, it failed to develop normally, {{and by the time}} he was an adult, William's left arm was 15cm shorter than the right. There is also speculation that the difficult labour caused fetal distress, which deprived the future emperor of oxygen for eight to ten minutes and might have brought about other neurological problems.|$|E

25|$|Blavatsky {{was born}} as Helena Petrovna von Hahn in the Ukrainian town of Yekaterinoslav, then {{part of the}} Russian Empire. Her birth date was 12 August 1831, {{although}} according to the Julian calendar used in 19th-century Russia it was 31 July. Immediately after her birth, she was baptized into the Russian Orthodox Church.

25|$|Growth in yeast is {{synchronised}} {{with the}} growth of the bud, which reaches the size of the mature cell by the time it separates from the parent cell. In well nourished, rapidly growing yeast cultures, all the cells can be seen to have buds, since bud formation occupies the whole cell cycle. <b>Both</b> <b>mother</b> and daughter cells can initiate bud formation before cell separation has occurred. In yeast cultures growing more slowly, cells lacking buds can be seen, and bud formation only occupies a part of the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|In December 2001, the Countess {{was taken}} to the King Edward VII Hospital after feeling unwell.

Two years later, on 8 November 2003, she prematurely gave birth to her daughter, Louise, resulting from a sudden placental abruption that placed <b>both</b> <b>mother</b> and child at risk, and the Countess had to undergo an emergency caesarean section at Frimley Park Hospital, while the Earl of Wessex rushed back from Mauritius. The Countess returned to Frimley Park Hospital on 17 December 2007, to give birth, again by caesarean section, to her son, James, Viscount Severn.|$|E
25|$|A {{major concern}} with this {{approach}} is that NNRTI resistance mutations are commonly observed in <b>both</b> <b>mothers</b> and infants after single-dose nevirapine, and may compromise the response to future NNRTI-containing regimens.
