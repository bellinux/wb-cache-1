Twenty upright poor, selected in consultation with several social services, received till 1962 each quarter a <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>coupons</b> which they can exchange at the baker's for one loaf per person per week.

50|$|Today's tolls are {{not much}} higher than {{previously}} noted. Automobiles pay $1.00. Books of forty coupons can be purchased from the toll collector for $30.00 as of 4/20/2015. This effectively lowers the toll to 75 cents if the entire <b>book</b> <b>of</b> <b>coupons</b> is used. Bicyclists may cross for free, but pedestrians are not allowed due to the narrow lanes. An 11 ft height restriction coupled with a weight restriction of four tons precludes large RVs and trucks from crossing. Although the bridge is within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, government employees pay the toll, unless responding to an emergency with lights and sirens on. A breakdown of all current tolls {{can be found on}} the bridge's website. The bridge is one of only two bridges that charges a toll to enter New Jersey, along with the Delaware River-Turnpike Toll Bridge on the Pennsylvania and New Jersey Turnpikes.|$|E

40|$|In the {{experience}} of the authors, most firms do not have good procedures for estimating the net profitability <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> promotions. Instead, managers generally examine a number of subsidiary measures such as: redemption rates, market share and the direct costs <b>of</b> the <b>coupon</b> promotion. A user-oriented computer model is presented for simulating the effect <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> promotions on sales and calculating net profitability. The model includes the actions of the manufacturer, retailers, and consumers. It takes into account three key phenomena of consumer response: the acceleration of product category purchases, the brand loyalty <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> redeemers, and repeat purchase effects. The model also incorporates the effects of retailer promotions that often accompany a coupon program. Data from an actual application are used to illustrate use of the model. promotions, coupons, simulation, planning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Motivated by {{the study}} of {{peer-to-peer}} file swarming systems à la BitTorrent, we introduce a probabilistic model <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> replication systems. These systems consist of users, aiming to complete a collection <b>of</b> distinct <b>coupons.</b> Users are characterised by their current collection <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> and leave the system once they complete their coupon collection. The system evolution is then specified by describing how users of distinct types meet, and which coupons get replicated upon such encounters. For open systems, with exogenous user arrivals, we derive necessary and sufficient stability conditions in a layered scenario, where encounters are between users holding the same number <b>of</b> <b>coupons.</b> We also consider a system where encounters are between users chosen uniformly at random from the whole population. We show that performance, captured by sojourn time, is asymptotically optimal in both systems as the number <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> types becomes large. We also consider closed systems with no exogenous user arrivals. In a special scenario where users have only one missing coupon, we evaluate {{the size of the}} population ultimately remaining in the system, as the initial number of users, N, goes to infinity. We show that this decreases geometrically with the number <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> K. In particular, when the ratio K / log(N) is above a critical threshold, we prove that this number of leftovers is of order log(log(N)). These results suggest that performance of file swarming systems does not depend critically on either altruistic user behavior, or on load balancing strategies such as rarest first. I...|$|R

40|$|Coupons are {{collected}} {{one at a}} time from a population containing n distinct types <b>of</b> <b>coupon.</b> The process is repeated until all n coupon have been collected and the total number of draws, Y, from the population is recorded. It is assumed that the draws from the population are independent and identically distributed (draws with replacement) according to a probability distribution X with the probability that a type i coupon is drawn being P(X = i). The special case where each type <b>of</b> <b>coupon</b> is equally likely to be drawn from the population is the classic coupon collector problem. We consider the asymptotic distribution Y (appropriately normalized) as the number <b>of</b> <b>coupons</b> n → ∞ under general assumptions upon the asymptotic distribution of X. The results are proved by studying the total number <b>of</b> <b>coupons,</b> W(t), not collected in t draws from the population and noting that P(Y ≤ t) = P(W(t) = 0). Two normalizations of Y are considered, the choice of normalization depending upon whether or not a suitable Poisson limit exists for W(t).
