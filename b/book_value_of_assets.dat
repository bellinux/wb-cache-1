50|$|The main {{drawback}} of ROCE is that {{it measures}} return against the <b>book</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> in the business. As these are depreciated the ROCE will increase even though cash flow has remained the same. Thus, older businesses with depreciated assets will tend to have higher ROCE than newer, possibly better businesses. In addition, while cash flow is affected by inflation, the <b>book</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> is not. Consequently, revenues increase with inflation while capital employed generally does not (as the <b>book</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> is not affected by inflation).|$|E
