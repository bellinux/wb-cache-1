5000|$|The <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer</b> is a {{brand of}} {{internal}} batch mixer, named for inventor Fernley H. Banbury. The [...] "Banbury" [...] trademark is owned by Farrel Corporation. Internal batch mixers such as the <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer</b> are used for mixing or compounding rubber and plastics. The original design dates back to 1916. The mixer consists of two rotating spiral-shaped blades encased in segments of cylindrical housings. These intersect so as to leave a ridge between the blades. The blades may be cored for circulation of heating or cooling. Its invention resulted in major labor and capital savings in the tire industry, doing away with the initial step of roller-milling rubber. It is also used for reinforcing fillers in a resin system.|$|E

40|$|Firm numbers first rise, {{and then}} fall as the typical {{industry}} evolves. This nonmonotonicity {{in the number}} of producers is explained in this paper using a competitive model in which innovation opportunities induce firms to enter, but in which a firm's failure to implement new technology causes it to exit. The model is estimated with data from the U. S. Automobile Tire Industry, a particularly dramatic example of the nonmonotonicity in firm numbers: A big shakeout took place during the 1920 s. The number of automobiles sold in the U. S. does not appear to explain this shakeout. Instead, the data point to the invention of the <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer</b> in 1916 as the event that caused the big exit wave. There were, of course, other major inventions in the tire industry, but none seems to have raised the optimal scale of its adopters by enough to cause further shakeouts. ...|$|E
40|$|Waste leather {{granules}} {{were incorporated}} into poly(vinyl chloride) polymer plasticized with di-octyl phthalate. The blend was prepared by a melt mixing process using a <b>banbury</b> <b>mixer.</b> The rheological behaviour of the mixture was recorded and the filled samples were tested for their physicomechanical properties. It was found that density, wear resistance and Shore D hardness of the specimen increases, whereas the tensile properties are considerably deteriorated with the incorporation of leather particles. A concentration of 40 parts per hundred parts of resin was estimated as the upper level of leather content, satisfying {{the needs of the}} design of final products with potential applications to the footwear industry. In order to improve mechanical properties, some treatments of the leather granules were applied, such as sieving and coating with ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer solution. Both those treatments seem to improve tensile strength. An increase up to 30 % was observed when coated granules were used...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a {{mathematical}} model for the simulation of the flow of elastomeric materials inside a typical <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer.</b> The model combines the non-Newtonâ‚¬an behaviour of rubber compound with non-isothermal flow regime in a transient condition. The set of the governing equations are solved using the finite element method. The momentum equations are solved using continuous penalty method and the energy equation is solved employing the C 3 aierkin method. A streamline upwinding technique Is used in the solution scheme of the energy equation to provide convergent and stable results for high Peclet number flow. The solution of the transient equations is performed using implicit 8 time stepping method. The overall solution strategy is based on the de-coupling of the flow and energy equation and use of the Picard iterative scheme. The results of the simulation inciudothevelocity, pressure and temperature distributions and the variation of these parameters with time. Comparison of these results with the available experimental data confirms the general validity of the development model...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} and fire safety properties of bamboo fiber reinforced polylactide biocomposites fabricated by injection molding Wen-Bin Young and Yu-Chi Tsao Bamboo fiber {{was considered a}} good candidate for the reinforcement of green composites. The applications of bamboo fibers as reinforcements in fabric or structural forms to constitute composites have been widely investigated. This study conducted the process from the bamboo strips to the fibers that were compounded with the polylactide to form the composite pellets for the following injection molding process. Alkali treatment of bamboo fiber at 100 C for 12 h could properly delignify the bamboo fiber strips, resulting in required bamboo fibers. After compounded with polylactide in a <b>banbury</b> <b>mixer</b> to form composite pellets, the injection molding process was used to make composites with improved mechanical properties, including the tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus, and impact strength. The reinforced effect of the bamboo fiber on polylactide was quite apparent in our experiments. A simple rule of mixture was used to approximate the tensile strength and modulus of the bamboo fiber/polylactide composite. The fire safety improvement of the biocomposite was also investigated by adding fire retardant...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The purpose of this research project is to model the rheological behaviour of elastomers and elastomer compounds. Two elastomers (natural rubber, SMR 20 and chlorosulphonated polyethylene, Hypalon 40) and three different grades of carbon black at three different levels of loading were chosen for this study. Mixing was carried out with a Farrel Bridge BR <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer,</b> followed by subsequent milling on a two-roll mill. Rheological measurements were made with parallel plate, cone and plate and Negretti biconical rotor TMS rheometers.. The effect of temperature on viscosity was investigated by determining the activation energy of viscous flow in terms of concentration and surface area of carbon black. Computer programs were developed to evaluate various parameters in the models by non-linear optimisation technique. The steady state flow behaviour of gum elastomers was fitted by the Bird-Carreau model and a thixotropic model. The thixotropic model was modified to non- Newtonian flow but proved to be intractable for fitting the rheological properties of mixed rubber compounds. Two new models for the viscosity and stress relaxation of filled compounds were then developed, which give very promising results...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the feasibility of direct melt-blending (intercalation) montmorillonite nanoclay to polyhydroxybutyrate along with vinyl acetate, at different weight percentages, to enhance plasticization using typical plastic processing equipment and typical processing methodology. The purpose was to determine and compare the specific mechanical properties of tensile strength and flexural strength developed as a result from this processing. Single screw and twin screw extrusion, <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer</b> compounding, and compression molding were used to intercalate montmorillonite, and for sample preparation purposes, to test tensile and flexural strength of the resultant polymer clay nanocomposites (PCN). Results indicate Polyhydroxybutyrate and Ethylene vinyl acetate, and weight percentages of 70 %, 65 % and 60 % PHB, and 15 %, 20 %, and 25 % of EVA, respectively, influenced mechanical properties. The resultant materials remained in a mostly amorphous state. The nanoclay, at specific weight percentage of 10 %, acted as an antimicrobial and preservative for the materials produced during the research. The intention of the research was to promote knowledge and understanding concerning these materials and processes so technology transfer regarding the use, mechanical properties, manufacture, and process ability of these bio-friendly materials to academia, industry, and society can occur.

40|$|The use of filler in polymer {{products}} {{is as old}} as the polymer industry itself. Fillers such as ground whiting, clay or barytes are added to cheapen the production cost and improve the properties of the final vulcanized products. In this work, the effect of Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) (filler) in the production of middle layer of PVC carpet was considered and evaluated. The Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3) filler was characterized in terms of moisture content, size (mesh), density and pH value. Eight formulations were prepared: one formulation each for upper layer and back layer, and six formulations for middle layer. The six formulations consist five containing Calcium Carbonate (CaCO 3, 700 mesh) filler at loading ranging from 20 part per hundred (pphr) to 60 part per hundred (pphr), while the last formulation for the middle layer contained carbon black at 60 pphr as a control. Compounding was carried out using <b>banbury</b> <b>mixer,</b> mixer rollers and calendaring machine. The product was subjected to various tests including resistance to moisture, solvent, lubricating oil and palm oil. The results showed that CaC 03 used was alkaline, with pH value of 9; has density of 0. 12 g/cm 3 and a moisture content of 0. 0 %. The results also showed that CaCO 3 at 30 - 40 pphr, the resistance to solvent was better, but decreases as the loading increased from 50 - 60 pphr. When compared to unfilled product, the CaCO 3 filler proved to be a good semi reinforcement filler compared with carbon blac...|$|E
40|$|A {{process for}} {{producing}} tires for vehicles wheels comprises the following steps: (a) obtaining {{at least one}} crosslinkable elastomeric material; (b) making a raw tire by assembling a plurality of structural elements, {{at least one of}} which comprising the at least one crosslinkable elastomeric material; (c) molding and crosslinking the raw tire so as to obtain a finished tire. The step of obtaining the at least one crosslinkable elastomeric material includes: (i) mixing at least one layered clay, at least one further filler and at least one elastomer, so as to at least partially delaminate the at least one layered clay within the at least one elastomer; (ii) adding to the mixt. prepd. in step (i) at least one quaternary alkyl onium cation selected from quaternary alkyl ammonium or quaternary alkyl phosphonium or mixt. thereof. Thus, a crosslinkable elastomeric material with superior properties was prepd. by mixing in a first phase, isoprene rubber (100 phr), carbon black (50 phr), Dellite HPS nanosized layered clay (4. 8 phr) and Arquad HC (3. 5 phr) in a <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer,</b> followed by admixing Silane NXT (0. 8 phr) and phthalic anhydride (1. 0 phr), after which the masterbatch was discharged at approx. 145.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. As an aid to understanding the mechanics of mixing in an internal mixer laboratory scale trials {{have been carried out}} using a mixer having a transparent plastics chamber. The use of a transparent rubber and coloured 'markers' then permitted direct viewing of the characteristic flow patterns deriving from the use of three fill factors. These mixing trials have indicated the rheological properties which must be measured in order to predict the mixing behaviour of a rubber. Also considerable information is contained in the visualisations which will aid further work into control and instrumentation strategies and into fundamental design/mathematical modelling studies. A laboratory <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer</b> and Brabender Plastograph are used to prepare the rubber compounds which are then characterised for the dispersion of compounding ingredients. For carbon black dispersion studies several techniques are employed. Capillary rheometry is used to study their stress-strain rate relationships and to obtain die swell, shear and tensile properties. Creep and elongational tests are also carried out on uncured mixes. In addition measurements on Mooney viscometer, Monsanto rheometer and analysis of bound rubber are made. These tests for filler dispersion are supported by microscopic examination of microtomed sections. Work is also geared to examine properties that are not only sensitive to changes in levels of carbon black dispersion but also that which are readily measured and can be used in industry. Measurements of mechanical phase angle and electrical resistivity are considered. Dispersion of non-black compounding ingredients is studied by X-ray microradiographic technique and the analysis of vulcanisate properties. To relate the performance of the Plastograph and Banbury mix the concept of mixing energy per unit volume of material is used...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The fusion and rheologica 1 behaviour of PVC compounds play a dominant role in the processing operations and {{in the development of}} physical properties in the processed material. These phenomena are governed by the complex morphological structure of PVC resin, compound composition and processing-conditions which in turn affect the physical properties of the final product. The fusion process of flexible PVC compounds was investigated by a combination of several techniques. Samples with varying states of fusion were prepared using shear-and temperature as the processing variables in extrusion, Brabender Plastograph and compression moulding. The degree of fusion of processed compounds was characterized by rheology, thermal analysis, acetone test, optical microscopy, tensile strength and extrudate appearance. The formulation of a PVC compound has a strong influence on the rheological properties of the melt. Hence several plasticizers were chosen from a wide activity range and compounded at three plasticizer concentrations of 30, 50 and 70 phr. These compounds were processed at five different temperatures (150 - 20 QOC) in a <b>Banbury</b> <b>mixer.</b> They were further processed in an extruder or on a two-roll mill followed by compression moulding. In assessing the state of fusion a universal method was found which could define the fusion state adequately for a given PVC sample wbich had undergone any processing condition. Rheometer studies were found useful in assessing state of fusion of samples from specific formulation and processing conditions with processing temperature as the variable. Differential scanning calorimetry results showed that more understanding was needed to interpret the results. However, it proved to be a versatile method in determining the maximum temperature a sample would have reached, irrespective of its formulation or processing history. Higher speed mixing data proved to be useful commercially since increased plasticizer concentration gave decreased blending times. Davenport extrusion pressure, tensile properties, morphology and extrudate surface texture showed significant differences between' plasticizers. An identical trend for ease of smooth extrudate formation and its glossy texture was observed...|$|E
