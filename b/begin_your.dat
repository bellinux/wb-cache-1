500|$|General {{critical}} {{reception for}} Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge has been above average, a popular opinion {{being that the}} game retains the respectable run-and-gun gameplay of the earliest NES entries in the series. [...] "What makes this game especially attractive to adults," [...] proclaimed Entertainment Weeklys Bob Strauss, [...] "is that you can <b>begin</b> <b>your</b> quest on any one of four stages, thus avoiding that linear, start-over-again-from-scratch quality that only 12-year-olds find hypnotic." [...] The use of old stages and bosses has not been universally positive. GamePro was disappointed by the game's lack of originality but preferred its use of recycled content to poorly made new content. [...] In a 2007 retrospective of the Mega Man franchise, 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish found the use of rehashed details acceptable for its original release, but believed that Dr. Wily's Revenge [...] "hasn't really held up".|$|E
