5000|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> of {{the game}} {{consists}} of producing units in cities, based {{on the amount of}} resources currently available to the player, and then sending those units out to conquer other cities and/or explore ruins, while learning spells along the way. The amount of time it takes to produce a unit, move a unit to a place on the map, and learn a spell is determined by a specified number of turns. For example, a weak unit or a common spell may take one or two turns to produce or learn; while a powerful unit may take as much as four turns to produce and a rare or [...] "arcane" [...] spell may take as much as sixteen turns to learn. While the player is performing these steps, the opposing player(s) are as well. As many as eight players can play a game at a time. These can be any mixture of human or AI players.

Cities come in four levels and can be upgraded at the cost of gold. A higher-level city can produce more powerful units and is more-resistant to enemy sieges. The player can also explore different ruins which dot the map, which can yield great amounts of experience points, magical items which can be used by hero units (discussed below), additional resources, or additional combat units. Depending on the surrounding buildings a player's capital city has, quests may become available which consist of the player clearing out four random ruins on the map as steps towards a great reward.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is made of}} some features of perturbation superimposed in a plane Couette flow with unstable stratification. A set of linearized Boussinesq equations governing the perturba-tion is solved numerically employing a finite-difference technique. First, stability characteristics of the perturbations are shown. These characteristics are discussed for various Richardson numbers and wavenumbers and are compared with those obtained analytically by Kuo. It is confirmed that constant shear has a stabilizing effect on the perturbation and the effect is striking for perturbations of short wavelength and of transverse modes whose wavelengths in the direction perpendicular to the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> are longer {{than those in the}} direction parallel to the <b>basic</b> <b>flow.</b> Second, a dynamical structure of unstable perturbations and the associated energy conversions are discussed. Conversion between kinetic energy of the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> and that of the perturbation takes place as well as conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy. In particular, vertical transfer of horizontal momentum, which results in conversion between both the kinetic energies of the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> and of the perturbation, is crucially controlled by the three dimensionality of the perturbations. The vertical momentum transfer tends to intensify the shear of the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> when a perturbation is transverse, while it reverses for a longitudinal pertubation whose wavelength in the direction parallel to the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> is longer than that in the direction perpendicular to the <b>basic</b> <b>flow.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is {{to examine the effects of}} mass transfer on the thermal instability of a two dimensional boundary layer stagnation point flow. We furthermore restrict our attention to thermal and concentration buoyancy forces which are of opposite sign and equal in magnitude. The <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> has been obtained by solving the governing equations using similarity analysis which are solved numerically using the Runge–Kutta method with shooting technique. The stability of the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> is then investigated in the usual fashion by making use of the normal mode decomposition in the framework of Görtler–Hammerlin assumption. The equations of linear stability theory create an eigenvalue problem which is solved numerically by means of a pseudo spectral collocation method based upon Laguerre’s functions. The use of this procedure is warranted by the exponential damping of disturbances far from the boundary layer and the appropriate distribution of the roots of Laguerre’s polynomials to treat boundary layer problems. It is found through the calculation of neutral stability curves that concentration buoyancy parameters acts to increase the stability of the <b>basic</b> <b>flow,</b> but Lewis number (Le) acts to either increase or decrease it. Increasing Lewis number acts to increase the stability of the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> for Le 1. For Le = 1 the <b>basic</b> <b>flow</b> is always stable...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{problems}} of generation and maintenance of recirculations by Gulf Stream instabilities. Observations show that the horizontal structure of the jet and its recirculations suffer significant changes in time. Here, the role of internal dynamics of the jet is isolated {{as one of the}} possible sources of such variability, and the differences between barotropic and baroclinic instabilities are investigated. The problem of recirculation development is considered in a framework of a free spin down of the 2 -layer and the lI-layer, zonally symmetric, quasi-geostrophic jets. Linear stability analysis shows that in strongly baroclinic <b>basic</b> <b>flows,</b> eddies are capable of driving recirculations in the lower layer through the residual meridional circulation. In strongly barotropic jets, the linearly most unstable wave simply diffuses the jet. Nonlinear stability analysis indicates that recirculations are robust features of the 2 -layer model. The strength of recirculations {{is a function of the}} model's parameters. It increases with a decrease in the value of the nondimensional # due to potential vorticity homogenization constrained by enstrophy conservation. The recirculation strength is a non-monotonic function of the baroclinic velocity parameter; it is the strongest for strongly baroclinic <b>basic</b> <b>flows,</b> weakest for flows with intermediate baroclinic structure and of medium strength for strongly barotropic <b>basic</b> <b>flows.</b> Such non-monotonic behavior is the result of two different processes responsible for the recirculation development: linear eddy-mean flow interactions for strongly baroclinic <b>basic</b> <b>flows</b> and strongly nonlinear eddy-eddy and eddy-mean flow interaction for strongly barotropic flows. In the case of the reduced-gravity model, recirculations develop only for infinite deformation raduis. <b>Basic</b> <b>flows</b> with finite deformation radius are only weakly supercritical and therefore produced negligible recirculations after equilibration. The problem of maintenance of the recirculations is coupled to the questions of existence of low frequency variability and of multiple dynamical regimes of a system consisting of a quasi-geostrophic jet and its recirculations. The problem is studied in a framework of a 2 -layer or a reduced-gravity colliding jets model which has no windforcing. Instead, it is forced by inflows and outflows through the open boundaries. Only the western boundary of the domain is closed, and a free slip boundary condition is used there. The results of the numerical experiments show that when only the mechanism of barotropic instability is present, the model has two energy states for a wide range of interfacial friction coefficients. The high energy state is characterized by well-developed recirculations and displays strong variability associated with either large recirculating gyres and a weak eddy field or small recirculations and a strong eddy field. The low energy state is characterized by large meridional excursions in the separation point and large amplitude, westward propagating meanders that produce strong rings after interacting with the western wall. For physically relevant bottom friction values, the presence of baroclinic instability in the recirculation regions of the 2 -layer model allows for a unique dynamical regime characterized by well-developed recirculations in both layers. The low-frequency variability associated with the regime is weak and is related to meridional shifts in the position of the jet, to wrapping of the recirculations around each other, and to pulsations in their zonal extent. by Natalia Yurievna Beliakova.
