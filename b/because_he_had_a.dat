5|$|Number two, why {{was this}} person, {{this one of the}} six around to commit this hideous crime? He was out <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 31-count {{indictment}} for the rape of a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and never would have been on the street.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory was}} the first in Vickers' career. After the race, Jeff Burton {{maintained}} his Drivers' Championship points lead, although that lead decreased significantly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> flat tire during the final laps of the race. Chevrolet maintained its lead in the Manufacturers' Championship, 51 points ahead of Dodge and 52 ahead of Ford with six races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|According to CP+B {{employee}} Tom Zukoszki, {{the fictional}} background {{information for the}} band was that they signed with Burger King instead of a major record label. As part of the promotion, a four-song LP record was recorded, two music videos produced, and a national (US) tour planned. The tour had to be cancelled because the actor playing the lead singer, a Canadian citizen, was unable to enter the United States <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> criminal record in his home country.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had been asking {{a lot of questions about}} the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E
5|$|Dougan {{stood as}} an {{independent}} 'Former Captain NI Football Team' candidate for the East Belfast constituency in the 1997 UK general election, but got only 541 votes and finished seventh out of the nine candidates. In April 2000, he was cleared of aggravated burglary following a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court; the incident had been alleged {{to have taken place}} at the home of Patricia Thompson, a former lover. He was also cleared of assaulting a Vietnam War veteran with a pool cue, who had been at the home with Patricia Thompson {{at the time of the}} alleged burglary incident. In another court case, again in April 2000, Dougan failed to attend a hearing where he had been charged with driving carelessly and failing to comply with a red traffic signal; he said he had been unable to attend <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dental appointment.|$|E
5|$|Hope, Powell, and Monk were {{considered}} by their contemporaries to be influences {{on each other}} early in their careers, and all, therefore, helped affect the development of jazz piano. Powell was known for horn-like right-hand playing supported by simple left-hand chords, which was something he had worked on with Hope. Later pianists who have cited Hope as a major influence include Lafayette Gilchrist, Alexander Hawkins, Frank Hewitt, and Hasaan Ibn Ali. Hawkins said in 2013 that Hope was important <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> highly individual style but {{does not have the}} iconic status of pianists such as Monk. Modern jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel has mentioned Hope's rhythms, phrasing, and compositions as influences.|$|E

5|$|Heidfeld lost {{hydraulic}} {{pressure on the}} grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fuel leak in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin {{and became the first}} retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen made the best start, moving from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Häkkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar himself <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E

25|$|At {{the close}} of the Isolation tour in 1985, Fergie Frederiksen was let go. Lukather claimed that the band was not meshing well with Frederiksen <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{difficult}} time recording with them in the studio. The band held an audition and Joseph Williams, son of famous film composer John Williams and 1950s singer/actress Barbara Ruick, was chosen to take over lead vocals in early 1986.|$|E

The $2.3 million budget was low enough for him to get approved.|$|E

He was the second overall pick, behind 17-year-old catcher Steve Chilcott, who {{was taken by the}} New York Mets. According to Jackson, Winkles told him that the Mets did not select him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> white girlfriend. Winkles later denied the story, stating {{that he did not know}} the reason why Jackson was not drafted by the Mets. It was later confirmed by Joe McDonald that the Mets drafted Chilcott because of need, the person running the Mets at the time was George Weiss, so the true motive may never be known.|$|E

25|$|Before his disappearance, the Foreign Ministry had {{scheduled}} {{for him to}} serve as Malaysian Ambassador to Italy. However, after the incident, the Foreign Ministry arranged for him to work as Deputy Secretary (Special Duties) to the Ministry instead. Lim resigned from the Foreign Ministry in August 1968, {{putting an end to}} his political career in Malaysia. Shortly after, the Government abruptly revoked his title as Tun in late November of the same year, making his disappearance in Australia a bewildering mystery. According to his autobiography published after his death, he chose to go missing <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> broken relationship with his wife and he was emotionally overwhelmed.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 2011, he {{lost the}} WBO title to Orlando Salido via {{technical}} knockout, as the referee stopped the fight in the 8th round. The bout was held in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. The outcome of the fight was a huge upset. It was the first loss of López' career. On March 10, 2012, he lost again to Orlando Salido in a rematch by 10th-round technical knockout in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Lopez's excuse was that he could've continued to fight and that the referee only stopped the fight in that scenario <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> bet placed on Salido to win the fight.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, USSR {{newcomers}} Karpov and Kasparov {{strengthened the}} top half of the USSR side, an area of weakness in the previous match. The veterans Tal, Smyslov and Polugaevsky participated once more and again turned in respectable performances. Petrosian was absent through illness but the solid Yuri Razuvaev deputised admirably. The World's Miles and Torre restored some pride on the bottom boards, but the real damage was done on board 6, where rampant former world junior champion Beliavsky could not be contained by the combined efforts of Seirawan and Larsen. Some observers believed that Seirawan had foolishly been preferred to the higher rated Walter Browne <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more 'glamorous image'.|$|E
