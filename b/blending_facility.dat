The wash is then distilled into spirit using a five-step process. The water used in the vodka comes from a natural spring 150 metres (500 feet) below the <b>blending</b> <b>facility</b> in Cognac, which is lined with limestone, providing calcium-rich spring water. The vodka is also filtered through a copper filtration system in order to impart additional flavours. That water is then filtered to remove impurities. After the filtration the vodka is bottled in a plant dedicated solely to bottling Grey Goose. Grey Goose vodka is bottled with a replaceable cork rather than a screw-top cap.|$|E

Large scale biofuels plants are already operating on Teesside by Ensus and Harvest Energy, while Greenergy (note: Harvest and Greenergy are all {{now part of}} the Interterminals Group) operate a biofuel <b>blending</b> <b>facility.</b> CF Industries (formerly GrowHow) who manufacture fertilizer is capturing carbon dioxide from their ammonia based fertilizer business and this is being used to aid the growing of tomatoes in an industrial market garden on Teesside. This reduces emissions and eliminates road miles from former European imports. Sembcorp operate a 30 MW biomass power plant known as Wilton 10 using both waste wood and coppiced wood, which is integrated into the existing chemical processes on the Wilton Chemical Site. A number of other biomass and waste to energy plants are in development within the Cluster such as Wilton 11 and MGT Power are building their Teesport Renewable Energy Plant.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) metal to {{low enriched uranium}} (LEU) takes place at four Russian sites. HEU metal to oxide processing began in 1994 with shipments of HEU oxide from the Siberian Chemical Enterprise (SChE) to the Ural Electrochemical Integrated Plant (UEIP) fluorination and <b>blending</b> <b>facility.</b> U. S. transparency monitoring at these facilities began in February 1996. In 1996, fluorination and blending operations began at the Electrochemical Plant (ECP). In 1997, additional HEU metal to oxide was added at the Mayak Production Association (MPA), and additional fluorination and blending operations have been performed at SChE. U. S. transparency monitoring at these facilities is intended to provide confidence that HEU weapons components are received, that the HEU metal is converted to HEU oxide, and that the HEU is blended to LEU prior to shipment to the U.

S. nondestructive assay (NDA) equipment. The feeding of HEU metal shavings to the oxidation process and the subsequent packaging of the HEU oxide for shipment to the fluorination and blending facilities are then monitored.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an analysis on}} the most economical coal grade which ensures the lowest generation cost at Puttalam coal power plant phase II which is the biggest and only coal fired thermal power plant in Sri Lanka. The investigation has been conducted to study and estimate the relevant cost components such Coal FOB cost, transportation cost, handling cost & operational cost {{as well as the}} minimum suitable process modifications such feeding, crushing, pulverizing & firing needed for different coal grades ranging from lower calorific value to higher calorific value while keeping the existing steam generating boiler which have the combustion efficiency of 88. 5 % as a reference model. Then the investigation is extended to propose a target potential supplier of coal and the currently used firing technologies in the utility industry. The results show that the price of coal is increased in the world market when move towards the higher calorific value range coal. So it reflected an increase of coal cost to unit generation cost while lowering the operational and transportation cost components. The operational and coal storage costs are very minimal compared to the coal cost & transportation cost. There is an optimum total cost point identified as Rs. 6. 06 which gives best burning rate of 126 t/h and low calorific value of NCV 5500 kcal/kg. So it saves average Rs. 0. 26 to generate 1 kWh rather than the designed coal with calorific value of GCV 6300 kcal/kg or NCV of 6043 kcal/kg. When the process path is concerned the capacity of pulverizer (35 t/h) is the major barrier to move lower grade coal than NCV of 5000 kcal/kg. The boiler is the only major unit which needed to redesign for the above selected coal and remaining process path equipments as per the contract documents are capable enough to handle proposed coal. It can achieve 5 million US$ annual saving with the plant factor of 85 % for single 300 MW unit and the pay aback period is just 3 months for the additional expense for boiler modification it the additional cost is 10 % of the boiler.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the issues of coal supply and {{blending}} pertaining to an electric utility company in Taiwan. Since the fuel used by coal-fired power plants are mainly imported in bulk from overseas sources, the planning of coal shipping and blending is of great economic importance.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an integrated approach to coordinate short-term scheduling of multi-product <b>blending</b> <b>facilities</b> with nonlinear recipe optimization. The proposed strategy is based on a hierarchical concept consisting of three business levels: Long-range planning, short-term scheduling and process control. Long-range planning is accomplished by solving a large-scale nonlinear recipe optimization problem (multi-blend problem). Resulting blending recipes and production volumes are provided as goals for the scheduling level. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program derived from a resource-task network representation. The scheduling model permits recipe changeovers in order to utilize an additional degree of freedom for optimization. By interpreting the solution of the scheduling problem, new constraints can be imposed on the previous multi-blend problem. Thus bottlenecks arising during scheduling are considered already on the topmost long-range planning level. Based on the outlined approach a commercial software system has been designed to optimize the operation of in-line blending and batch blending processes. The application of the strategy and software is demonstrated by a detailed cas...|$|R
