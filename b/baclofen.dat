5|$|<b>Baclofen,</b> a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of <b>baclofen</b> for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism. There is tentative data supporting <b>baclofen</b> in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. <b>Baclofen</b> or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has been found to have superior tolerability compared to diazepam and <b>baclofen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spasticity: {{spasticity}} {{is characterized}} by increased stiffness and slowness in limb movement, the development of certain postures, an association with weakness of voluntary muscle power, and with involuntary and sometimes painful spasms of limbs. A physiotherapist can help to reduce spasticity and avoid the development of contractures with techniques such as passive stretching. Nabiximols is safe and effective for relieving spacticity. There is evidence, albeit limited, of the clinical effectiveness of <b>baclofen,</b> dantrolene, diazepam, and tizanidine. In the most complicated cases intrathecal injections of <b>baclofen</b> can be used. There are also palliative measures like castings, splints or customized seatings.|$|E
25|$|In 2014 the French drug agency ANSM {{issued a}} 3-year {{temporary}} recommendation allowing {{the use of}} <b>baclofen</b> in alcoholism.|$|E
25|$|GHB {{has also}} been {{associated}} with a withdrawal syndrome of insomnia, anxiety, and tremor that usually resolves within three to twenty-one days. The withdrawal syndrome can be severe producing acute delirium and may require hospitalization in an intensive care unit for management. Management of GHB dependence involves considering the person's age, comorbidity and the pharmacological pathways of GHB. The mainstay of treatment for severe withdrawal is supportive care and benzodiazepines for control of acute delirium, but larger doses are often required compared to acute delirium of other causes (e.g. > 100mg/d of diazepam). <b>Baclofen</b> has been suggested as an alternative or adjunct to benzodiazepines based on anecdotal evidence and some animal data. However, there is less experience {{with the use of}} <b>baclofen</b> for GHB withdrawal, and additional research in humans is needed. <b>Baclofen</b> was first suggested as an adjunct because benzodiazepines do not affect GABAB receptors and thus have no cross-tolerance with GHB while <b>baclofen,</b> which works via GABAB receptors, is cross-tolerant with GHB and may be more effective in alleviating withdrawal effects of GHB.|$|E
25|$|No {{medication}} {{is effective in}} controlling the extrapyramidal motor features of the disease. Spasticity, however, can be reduced by the administration of <b>baclofen</b> or benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|Clonidine {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with benzodiazepines to help some of the symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of <b>baclofen</b> for alcohol withdrawal syndrome.|$|E
25|$|<b>Baclofen</b> is {{considered}} to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity, and causes much less sedation. It acts as a GABA agonist at GABAB receptors in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor, most likely due to increased potassium ion conductance. <b>Baclofen</b> also inhibits neural function presynaptically, by reducing calcium ion influx, and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord. It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of substance P in the spinal cord, as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Baclofen</b> is {{primarily}} {{used for the}} treatment of spastic movement disorders, especially in instances of spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. Its use in people with stroke or Parkinson's disease is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine-class {{drugs are}} the most common treatment; they are used for symptom relief from stiffness. Other common {{treatments}} include <b>Baclofen,</b> intravenous immunoglobin and rituximab. There has been limited but encouraging success with stem-cell treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Baclofen</b> {{is being}} studied for the {{treatment}} of alcoholism. While evidence is promising that it may help with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, as of 2017 it is not strong enough to recommend its use for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Baclofen,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Lioresal among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat spasticity. It serves as a {{central nervous system depressant}} and skeletal muscle relaxant. It is also used in topical creams to help with pain.|$|E
25|$|GABAA agonists, usually {{diazepam}} {{but sometimes}} other benzodiazepines, {{are the primary}} treatment for SPS. Drugs that increase GABA activity alleviate muscle stiffness caused {{by a lack of}} GABAergic tone. They increase pathways that are dependent upon GABA and have muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects, often providing symptom relief. Because the condition worsens over time, patients generally require increased dosages, leading to more side effects. For this reason, gradual increase in dosage of benzodiazepines is indicated. <b>Baclofen,</b> a GABAB agonist, is generally used when individuals taking high doses of benzodiazepines have high side effects. In some cases it has shown improvements in electrophysiological and muscle stiffness when administered intravenously. Intrathecal <b>baclofen</b> administration may not have long-term benefits though, and there are potential serious side effects.|$|E
25|$|Sucralfate has {{a similar}} {{effectiveness}} to H2 receptor blockers; however, sucralfate {{needs to be taken}} multiple times a day, thus limiting its use. <b>Baclofen,</b> an agonist of the GABAB receptor, while effective, has similar issues of needing frequent dosing in addition to greater adverse effects compared to other medications.|$|E
25|$|Muscle relaxants (according to one study) {{were not}} advised for {{orthopedic}} conditions, but rather for neurological {{conditions such as}} spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas <b>baclofen</b> activity is strictly associated with the CNS.|$|E
25|$|Medications that {{impede the}} release of {{excitatory}} neurotransmitters {{have been used to}} control or prevent spasms. Treatment with intrathecal <b>baclofen,</b> a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, decreases muscle tone and has been shown to decrease the frequency of muscle spasms in ADCP patients. Tetrabenazine, a drug commonly used in the treatment of Huntington's disease, {{has been shown to be}} effective treating chorea.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam is {{used for}} the {{emergency}} treatment of eclampsia, when IV magnesium sulfate and blood-pressure control measures have failed. Benzodiazepines do not have any pain-relieving properties themselves, and are generally recommended to avoid in individuals with pain. However, benzodiazepines such as diazepam can be used for their muscle-relaxant properties to alleviate pain caused by muscle spasms and various dystonias, including blepharospasm. Tolerance often develops to the muscle relaxant effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam. <b>Baclofen</b> or tizanidine is sometimes used as an alternative to diazepam.|$|E
25|$|This GABAA {{receptor}} {{contains many}} binding sites that allow conformational changes {{and are the}} primary target for drug development. The most common of these binding sites, benzodiazepine, allows for both agonist and antagonist effects on the receptor. A common drug, diazepam, acts as an allosteric enhancer at this binding site. Another receptor for GABA, known as GABAB, can be enhanced by a molecule called <b>baclofen.</b> This molecule acts as an agonist, therefore activating the receptor, and is known to help control and decrease spastic movement.|$|E
25|$|Clonidine {{and other}} {{imidazoline}} compounds {{have also been}} shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at Î±2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity. Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents, such as diazepam and <b>baclofen,</b> with a different spectrum of adverse effects.|$|E
25|$|Activation of {{both the}} GHB {{receptor}} and GABA(B) {{is responsible for the}} addictive profile of GHB. GHB's effect on dopamine release is biphasic. Low concentrations stimulate dopamine release via the GHB receptor. Higher concentrations inhibit dopamine release via GABA(B) receptors as do other GABA(B) agonists such as <b>baclofen</b> and phenibut. After an initial phase of inhibition, dopamine release is then increased via the GHB receptor. Both the inhibition and increase of dopamine release by GHB are inhibited by opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone. Dynorphin {{may play a role in}} the inhibition of dopamine release via kappa opioid receptors.|$|E
25|$|CP {{is partly}} {{preventable}} through immunization {{of the mother}} and efforts to prevent head injuries in children such as through improved safety. There is no cure for CP; however, supportive treatments, medications, and surgery may help many individuals. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Medications such as diazepam, <b>baclofen,</b> and botulinum toxin may help relax stiff muscles. Surgery may include lengthening muscles and cutting overly active nerves. Often external braces and other assistive technology are helpful. Some affected children can achieve near normal adult lives with appropriate treatment. While alternative medicines are frequently used {{there is no evidence}} to support their use.|$|E
25|$|Treatments {{that target}} the {{autoimmune}} response are also used. Intravenous immunoglobin {{is the best}} second-line treatment for SPS. It often decreases stiffness and improves {{quality of life and}} startle reflex. It is generally safe, but there are possible serious side effects and it is expensive. The European Federation of Neurological Societies suggests it be used when disabled patients do not respond well to diazepam and <b>baclofen.</b> Steroids, rituximab, and plasma exchange have been used to suppress the immune system in SPS patients, but the efficacy of these treatments is unclear. Botulinum toxin has been used to treat SPS, but it {{does not appear to have}} long-term benefits and has potential serious side effects. In paraneoplastic cases, tumors must be managed for the condition to be contained. Opiates are sometimes used to treat severe pain, but in some cases they exacerbate symptoms.|$|E
25|$|As {{compared}} to other types of CP, and especially as {{compared to}} hypotonic or paralytic mobility disabilities, spastic CP is typically more easily manageable by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life. In any form of spastic CP, clonus of the affected limb(s) may sometimes result, as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain or stress of the tightness experienced. The spasticity can and usually does lead to a very early onset of muscle stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. Occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching, strengthening, functional tasks, or targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief ways to keep spastic CP well-managed. If the spasticity {{is too much for}} the person to handle, other remedies may be considered, such as antispasmodic medications, botulinum toxin, <b>baclofen,</b> or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (which eliminates the spasticity by reducing the excitatory neural response in the nerves causing it).|$|E
25|$|Treatment in {{the acute}} setting is mostly focused on {{symptomatic}} management. After initial {{treatment in the}} hospital, some patients will need short-term placement {{in a nursing home}} or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenbergâs Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with anti-emetics and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used anti-emetics include ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenbergâs Syndrome including <b>baclofen</b> and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>baclofen</b> pump {{has been}} used to treat {{patients}} of all ages exhibiting muscle spasticity along with dystonia. The pump delivers <b>baclofen</b> via a catheter to the thecal space surrounding the spinal cord. The pump itself is placed in the abdomen. It can be refilled periodically by access through the skin. [...] <b>Baclofen</b> can also be taken in tablet form ...|$|E
2500|$|When <b>baclofen</b> is {{administered}} intrathecally, it may cause CNS depression accompanied with cardiovascular collapse and respiratory failure.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{skeletal}} muscle relaxants {{of that type}} used around the world come {{from a number of}} drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, <b>baclofen,</b> [...] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax {{skeletal muscle}}s include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.|$|E
2500|$|Although many {{patients}} may reject medications as antithetical to substance-abuse recovery and side effects, {{they can be}} useful to reduce paranoia, anxiety, and craving. Medications that have proven effective include opioid replacement therapies, such as lifelong maintenance on methadone or buprenorphine, to minimize risk of relapse, fatality, and legal trouble amongst opioid addicts, as well as helping with cravings, <b>baclofen</b> for alcoholics, opioid addicts, cocaine addicts, and amphetamine addicts, to help eliminate drug cravings, and clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic, which appears to reduce illicit drug use amongst stimulant addicts. [...] Clozapine can cause respiratory arrest when combined with alcohol, benzodiazepines, or opioids, {{so it is not}} recommended to use in these groups.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{of primary}} {{dystonia}} {{is aimed at}} reducing symptoms such as involuntary movements, pain, contracture, embarrassment, and to restore normal posture and improve the patientâs function. [...] This treatment is therefore not neuroprotective. [...] According to the European Federation of Neurological Sciences and Movement Disorder Society, there is no evidence-based recommendation for treating primary dystonia with antidopaminergic or anticholinergic drugs although recommendations {{have been based on}} empirical evidence. [...] Anticholinergic drugs prove to be most effective in treating generalized and segmental dystonia, especially if dose starts out low and increases gradually. [...] Generalized dystonia has also been treated with such muscle relaxants as the benzodiazepines. [...] Another muscle relaxant, <b>baclofen,</b> can help reduce spasticity seen in cerebral palsy such as dystonia in the leg and trunk. [...] Treatment of secondary dystonia by administering levodopa in dopamine-responsive dystonia, copper chelation in Wilsonâs disease, or stopping the administration of drugs that may induce dystonia have been proven effective in a small number of cases. [...] Physical therapy has been used to improve posture and prevent contractures via braces and casting, although in some cases, immobilization of limbs can induce dystonia, which is by definition known as peripherally induced dystonia. [...] There are not many clinical trials that show significant efficacy for particular drugs, so medical of dystonia must be planned on a case-by-case basis. Botulinum toxin B, or Myobloc, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat cervical dystonia due to level A evidential support by the scientific community. Surgery known as GPi DBS (Globus Pallidus Pars Interna Deep Brain Stimulation) has come to be popular in treating phasic forms of dystonia, although cases involving posturing and tonic contractions have improved to a lesser extent with this surgery. [...] A follow-up study has found that movement score improvements observed one year after the surgery was maintained after three years in 58% of the cases. [...] It has also been proven effective in treating cervical and cranial-cervical dystonia.|$|E
50|$|Often {{reserved}} for spastic cerebral palsy, intrathecally-administered <b>baclofen</b> is done through an intrathecal pump implanted {{just below the}} skin of the stomach, (or behind the chest wall, depending on the surgeon implanting the device, and patient preferences), with a tube (called the 'catheter') connected directly {{to the base of the}} spine, where it bathes the spinal cord using a dose about one thousand times smaller than that required by orally-administered <b>baclofen.</b> Intrathecal <b>baclofen</b> also carries none of the side effects, such as sleepiness, that typically occur with oral <b>baclofen.</b> However, intrathecal <b>baclofen</b> pumps carry serious clinical risks, such as infection or a possibly fatal sudden malfunction, that oral <b>baclofen</b> does not.|$|E
50|$|Discontinuation of <b>baclofen</b> can be {{associated}} with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely if <b>baclofen</b> is used {{for long periods of time}} (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of <b>baclofen</b> withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing <b>baclofen</b> therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be stopped by recommencing <b>baclofen.</b>|$|E
50|$|Similarly to phenibut (Î²-phenyl-GABA), {{as well as}} {{pregabalin}} (Î²-isobutyl-GABA), {{which are}} close analogues of <b>baclofen,</b> <b>baclofen</b> (Î²-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) {{has been found to}} block Î±2Î´ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it is weaker relative to phenibut in this action (Ki = 23 and 39 Î¼M for R- and S-phenibut and 156 Î¼M for <b>baclofen).</b> Moreover, <b>baclofen</b> is in the range of 100-fold more potent by weight as an agonist of the GABAB receptor in comparison to phenibut, and in accordance, is used at far lower relative dosages. As such, the actions of <b>baclofen</b> on Î±2Î´ subunit-containing VDCCs are likely not clinically-relevant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Baclofen,</b> a GABAB {{receptor}} agonist, {{is under}} {{study for the}} treatment of alcoholism. A 2015 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of <b>baclofen</b> for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism. There is tentative data supporting <b>baclofen</b> in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.|$|E
5000|$|The {{insertion}} of a <b>baclofen</b> pump usually during the stages while {{a person is}} a young adult. This is usually placed in the left abdomen. It is a pump that {{is connected to the}} spinal cord, whereby it releases doses of <b>baclofen</b> to alleviate continuous muscle flexion. <b>Baclofen</b> is a muscle relaxant and is often given by mouth to people to help counter the effects of spasticity, although this has the side effect of sedating the individual. [...] The pump can be adjusted if muscle tone is worse at certain times of the day or night. The <b>baclofen</b> pump is most appropriate for individuals with chronic, severe stiffness or uncontrolled muscle movement throughout the body. [...] There is a small amount of evidence that <b>baclofen</b> pumps are effective in the short term.|$|E
50|$|<b>Baclofen,</b> at {{standard}} dosing, {{does not}} produce euphoria or other pleasant effects, does not possess addictive properties, {{and has not been}} associated with any degree of drug craving. There are very few cases of abuse of <b>baclofen</b> for reasons other than attempted suicide. In contrast to <b>baclofen,</b> another GABAB receptor agonist, Î³-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), has been associated with euphoria, abuse, and addiction. These effects are likely mediated not by activation of the GABAB receptor, but rather by activation of the GHB receptor. Although <b>baclofen</b> {{does not produce}} euphoria or other reinforcing effects, which is unlike alcohol and benzodiazepines (as well as GHB), it does similarly possess sedative and anxiolytic properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Baclofen</b> {{produces}} {{its effects}} by activating the GABAB receptor, {{similar to the}} drug phenibut which also activates this receptor and shares some of its effects. <b>Baclofen</b> is postulated to block mono-and-polysynaptic reflexes by acting as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, blocking the release of excitatory transmitters. However, <b>baclofen</b> does not have significant affinity for the GHB receptor, and has no known abuse potential. The modulation of the GABAB receptor is what produces baclofen's range of therapeutic properties.|$|E
