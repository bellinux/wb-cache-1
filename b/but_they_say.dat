5|$|Risk parity advocates {{assert that}} the unlevered risk parity {{portfolio}} is quite close to the tangency portfolio, as close as can be measured given uncertainties and noise in the data. Theoretical and empirical arguments are made {{in support of this}} contention. One specific set of assumptions that puts the risk parity portfolio on the efficient frontier is that the individual asset classes are uncorrelated and have identical Sharpe ratios. Risk parity critics rarely contest the claim that the risk parity portfolio is near the tangency portfolio <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> that the leveraged investment line is less steep and that the levered risk parity portfolio has slight or no advantage over 60% stocks / 40% bonds, and carries the disadvantage of greater explicit leverage.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2013 police across China {{announced}} the arrests {{of hundreds of}} people accused of spreading false rumors online. Chinese authorities have said the crackdown is directed at abuses such as fraud, fakery, and slander. But the accusations against many of the arrested microbloggers have a political edge {{with many of the}} rumors called outrageously false by the government dealing with the sins of officials: corruption, venality, and sexual escapades. The suspicion is that the crackdown is intended to break up online networks of like-minded people whose ideas could challenge the Communist Party. Some of China's most popular microbloggers have been arrested. In September 2013 China’s highest court and prosecution office issued guidelines that define and outline penalties for publishing online rumors and slander. The rules give some protection to citizens who accuse officials of corruption, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> that a slanderous message forwarded more than 500 times or read more than 5,000 times could result in up to three years in prison.|$|E
500|$|Creator Shonda Rhimes {{compared}} {{what she}} deemed the two [...] "most iconic {{moments of the}} season", describing how the season begins with Izzie lying in the prom dress on the bathroom, and ends with Cristina standing motionless in her wedding dress. Cast member Eric Dane described the impact his first scene in the season had on him, stating {{that it was a}} spectacular entrance: [...] "It was a brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. So every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." [...] Cast member Sara Ramirez noted {{that one of the most}} significant scene in the season was when Izzie and George [...] "have this beautiful moment when neither of them speaks, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> so much and it was just so rich", describing how their interaction during the scene determined everything that would be developed for their arc later. Betsy Beers, however, noted that the most [...] "powerful" [...] scene in the season saw Cristina Yang and Preston Burke in the on-call room, talking about the future of their relationship: [...] "It's fascinating to see how their entire relationship changes and almost disintegrates in this one exchange". Beers and Rhimes expressed their desire to introduce Patrick Dempsey's passion of car racing in the series, although this ultimately did not occur during the season. [...] "Patrick loved it. He's always driving something new, always trying something out", stated the series creator, regarding Dempsey's response to the storyline.|$|E

2500|$|Between the 1990 U.S. Census and the 2000 U.S. Census, as Spring Branch gained many Hispanic and Korean {{residents}}, {{many white}} residents left. Nestor Rodriguez, an immigration expert from the University of Houston, {{said that the}} white population of Spring Branch implied that many were leaving not because of racial differences but because the new residents were not middle class. Rodriguez said, [...] "They don't say they're not middle-class, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> well, look at them, they're {{out on the street}} corners looking for work; we're not used to that. But those are characteristics of working-class or lower working-class people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{opposition}} view in {{that time}} was presented by William Andrew Paton and Russell Alger Stevenson in their Principles of Accounting (1919). To these writers, interest charges, whether contractual or non-contractual, are distribution-of-income, not expense, items. <b>But,</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> if these charges are to be made at all, the logical procedure would be to distribute among the factory products the normal return on all the capital invested, not that on the fixed assets only. With this last contention, at least, the reviewer is inclined to agree. But Professors Paton and Stevenson appear {{to believe that the}} problem in hand is being solved on other than logical ground. For they say: [...] "The use of interest charges in cost accounts on anything like a rational basis is a procedure which faces almost insurmountable practical obstacles. It is probably this fact rather than the logic of the case that is causing cost accountants to begin to recover from the interest obsession" ...|$|E
2500|$|Habermas {{also argues}} three facts {{in support of}} Paul's belief in a {{physical}} resurrection body. (1) Paul is a Pharisee and therefore (unlike the Sadducees) believes in a physical resurrection. (2) In Philippians 3:11 Paul says [...] "That I may attain to the ek anastasis (out-resurrection)" [...] from the dead, which according to Habermas means that [...] "What goes down is what comes up". And (3) In Philippians 3:20–21 [...] "We look from heaven for Jesus who will change our vile soma (body) to be like unto his soma (body)". According to Habermas, if Paul meant that we would change into a spiritual body then Paul would have used the Greek pneuma instead of soma. [...] Although others argue that a [...] "body" [...] (or [...] "soma") can be a spirit [...] "body", not necessarily [...] "flesh", in order {{for it to be}} a body, according to Paul's own words to the Corinthians, regarding [...] "spiritual body". [...] <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> that it was a true resurrection nonetheless.|$|E
