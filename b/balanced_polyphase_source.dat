40|$|LNA-I/Q-mixer (Blixer) and a {{baseband}} (BB) hybrid filter in one cell is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS. Without any external components, wideband {{input matching}} and passive pre-gain are concurrently achieved via co-optimizing an integrated low-Q network with a balun-LNA. The latter also features active-gain boosting and partial-noise canceling {{to enhance the}} gain and noise figure (NF). Above the balun-LNA are I/Q double-balanced mixers driven by a 4 -phase 25 % LO for downconversion and gain-phase balancing. The generated BB currents are immediately filtered by an IF-noise-shaping current-mode Biquad and a complex-pole load, offering first-order image rejection and third-order channel selection directly atop the Blixer. Together with other BB and LO circuitries, the receiver measures 8. 5 dB NF, 57 dB gain and 6 -dBm IIP 3 at 1. 7 mW power and 0. 24 mm die size. The S-bandwidth (10 dB) covers 2. 25 to 3. 55 GHz being ro-bust to packaging variations. Most performance metrics compare favorably with the state-of-the-art.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytical technique {{for improving the}} performance prediction of single-phase induction motors, especially capacitor motors. The technique uses the split-phase motor electrical equivalent circuit analysis together with electrical and magnetic parameters whose variation is computed from the equivalent <b>balanced</b> <b>polyphase</b> motor, so that the same magnetic circuit analysis {{can be used for}} both. (The term split-phase is used to cover motors operating from a single-phase supply but with the phase windings split into two orthogonal windings, one of which may have a capacitor in series with it during running or starting.) The technique accounts for the elliptical envelope of the magnetizing field vector and results in improved precision, since the three-phase electromagnetic model is considered to be more precise than the normal split-phase motor analysis. An important result is the computation of vector polygons of flux density for each section of the magnetic circuit, providing a better basis for core loss prediction. The double-frequency torque ripple is also obtained from the stator magnetomotive force and flux-density polygons. Three different electrical equivalent circuit methods for the split-phase motor (based respectively on the cross-field theory, forward- and backward-revolving fields, and symmetrical components) are evaluated to determine the method best suited for incorporating the variation of the circuit parameters from the polyphase magnetic circuit analysis, and it is discussed how the core losses can be included in these circuits to obtain the best overall performance prediction...|$|R
50|$|Provided two voltage {{waveforms}} have {{at least}} some relative displacement on the time axis, other than a multiple of a half-cycle, any other polyphase set of voltages {{can be obtained by}} an array of passive transformers. Such arrays will evenly <b>balance</b> the <b>polyphase</b> load between the phases of the source system. For example, balanced two-phase power can be obtained from a three-phase network by using two specially constructed transformers, with taps at 50% and 86.6% of the primary voltage. This Scott T connection produces a true two-phase system with 90° time difference between the phases. Another example is the generation of higher-phase-order systems for large rectifier systems, to produce a smoother DC output and to reduce the harmonic currents in the supply.|$|R
40|$|A power-pulse-modulation {{control method}} {{is applied to}} a series-resonant {{converter}} system with multiple ports for generating synthesized waveforms with reversible power flow. The energy emanates from a <b>source</b> (single of <b>polyphase</b> voltage <b>source</b> generating unipolar of bipolar waveforms), and is transmitted to a network (load) in a specific form (unipolar or bipolar, single or polyphase voltage waveforms). A discussion of {{the stability of the}} energy transfer in relation to the excitation voltage leads to a clarifying description of the possibilities for the control of the resonant energy transfer for any conversion ratio. A control strategy is applied to adapt the characteristics of the resonant circuit to the rapidly varying voltages. The results of a simulation program, developed particularly for this class of conversion systems, confirm the processes...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{electromechanical}} {{instrument is}} the polarized-vane type. In this instrument a stationary field coil produces a rotating magnetic field, {{just like a}} polyphase motor. The field coils are connected either directly to <b>polyphase</b> voltage <b>sources</b> or to a phase-shifting reactor if a single-phase application. [...] A second stationary field coil, perpendicular to the voltage coils, carries a current proportional to current in one phase of the circuit. The moving system of the instrument consists of two vanes that are magnetized by the current coil. In operation the moving vanes take up a physical angle equivalent to the electrical angle between the voltage source and the current source. This type of instrument {{can be made to}} register for currents in both directions, giving a four-quadrant display of power factor or phase angle.|$|R

40|$|Control and {{analysis}} techniques in switched-mode inversion (dc-ac) and rectification (ac-dc) are {{examined in this}} thesis. Current programming and sliding mode control are used to provide regulation and obtain desired dynamic responses. The basic buck, boost, flyback, and buck-boost topologies are used to illustrate the different methods of control {{and analysis}}. For illustration, embodiments employ fast switching converters, but the techniques described {{can be applied to}} any general converter. Different possibilities for the current programming of dc-ac inverters and ac-dc rectifiers are explored and the more practical and advantageous methods noted. Current reference programming improves the dynamic response of the converter and simplifies the design of the main regulatory loop. It also protects the switches from excessive current stresses and enables the parallel operation of many converters to support a common load. Constant frequency current reference programmed converters are, however, subject to oscillations under certain operating conditions. Describing equations are used to obtain the low frequency characterization of current programmed converters. The system representation is first obtained in the stationary abc reference frame and then transformed to the rotating dq coordinate frame. In the dq coordinate system, the low frequency characterizations of all <b>balanced,</b> <b>polyphase</b> ac converter systems are represented by a set of continuous, time-invariant differential equations. The steady-state and linearized, small signal dynamic responses are then obtained in this rotating reference frame. Sliding mode control is applied to inverters and rectifiers to provide regulation and ensure the stability of the system in the presence of small and large signal disturbances. This is a natural method of control for variable structure systems and enables the design of a robust controller that can provide stability and performance in the face of plant uncertainities. However, it requires that all or many of the states of the system be accessible and results in a variable switching frequency in the converter. The equivalent control method is used to obtain the low frequency properties of the sliding mode system, and {{can also be used to}} obtain the low frequency models of duty ratio programmed converters. Different switching strategies can be used to provide sliding mode control, as well as to optimize responses, maximize efficiency, or minimize switching losses. Practical aspects such as hardware implementation, switch realization, and measurement techniques are also discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, the space–vector {{transformation}} used in machine {{vector control}} {{is applied to}} power system analysis. The proposed method is used to model electric machines, power electronic converters, transformers, and transmission lines and to analyze power sources and loads with different connections (delta and wye). This method can also be applied to analyze steady-state (or transient phenomena) and unbalanced sources, including harmonics. Models obtained with this method are as simple {{as those of the}} per-phase approach. With the space–vector transformation, instantaneous active and reactive power concepts can be generalized, and new power system control strategies can be developed when power electronic converters are used. Steady-state, transient behavior, and harmonic analyses examples and applications are presented to illustrate the performance and advantages of the proposed method. This method can be extended to unbalanced systems (e. g., unsymmetric faults) using instantaneous symmetrical components in <b>polyphase</b> <b>balanced</b> circuits.
