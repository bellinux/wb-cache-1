500|$|In August 1905, Norman Warne died, and {{his brother}} Harold became Potter's editor. She wrote to him {{indicating}} Norman had approved the frog project: [...] "We had thought of doing... "Mr. Jeremy Fisher" [...] {{to carry on the}} series of little [...] I know some people don't like frogs! <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had convinced Norman that I could make it a really pretty book with a good many flowers & water plants for backgrounds". Warne decided to put Jeremy Fisher into print.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} May 1905, Potter {{sent the}} {{illustrations}} to Warne for his review, writing, [...] "I think it promises to make a pretty book." [...] He criticised {{a picture of the}} cat and Potter wrote him, [...] "If you still feel doubtful about the little cat—will you post it back to me at once ... I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can get it right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed." ...|$|E
500|$|A fan of Fringe, Pearl Jam {{musician}} Mike McCready {{talked with}} series composer Chris Tilton about writing some music for [...] "Northwest Passage". McCready said he started [...] "throwing ideas back and forth. And I {{think they just}} wanted a northwest guy to do it, because they were shooting it in the northwest". He elaborated that [...] "My role was smaller than someone who wrote all the music for it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was none the less integral in there. I mean, it was fun. Chris sent me his cues, and I just kind of rearranged them into guitar ideas".|$|E

500|$|Perry's {{decision}} to write [...] "E.T." [...] came after its beat was accidentally played during a recording session {{she had with}} Dr. Luke, Max Martin, and Ammo. It was originally intended for American hip hop group Three 6 Mafia. However, after hearing it, Perry chose {{to work with the}} track. She told MTV News: [...] "I heard it and I always knew I wanted to write this futuristic, alienistic song, and they pulled it up and I was like, 'Wait, I can wrap my head around this. I know this seems like a long shot, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have the perfect material to put on top of this sound.' And I did, and it really worked out perfectly." ...|$|E
500|$|Critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar {{work as an}} {{integral}} element of Pink Floyd's sound. Rolling Stone ranked Gilmour number 14 in their [...] "100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" [...] list and di Perna described him {{as the most important}} guitarist of the 1970s, calling him [...] "the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen." [...] In 2006, Gilmour commented on his playing technique: [...] " [...] fingers make a distinctive sound... aren't very fast, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am instantly recognisable... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows". Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis.|$|E
500|$|Though Waters had differing {{ideas about}} which songs they should play, he [...] "agreed {{to roll over}} for one night only", Gilmour told the Associated Press, [...] "The rehearsals {{convinced}} me it wasn't something I wanted {{to be doing a}} lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.|$|E

500|$|While Oasis' {{first two}} singles, [...] "Supersonic" [...] and [...] "Shakermaker", were {{modestly}} received, it was [...] "Live Forever" [...] that [...] "got the world's attention". [...] "Live Forever" [...] became Oasis' first top ten hit, reaching number ten on the British singles charts in 1994. In 1995, the song became the band's first chart {{success in the}} United States, reaching number two and ten on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts, respectively. Noel Gallagher commented on the praise given to the song: [...] "People said to me after 'Live Forever', 'Where are you gonna go after that?' And I was like, I don't think it's that good. I think it's a fucking good song, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can do better." ...|$|E
500|$|Kate Flannery, {{who plays}} Meredith, called the episode {{one of her}} {{favorites}} to shoot because she [...] "was stuck in a van with Mindy Kaling, Jenna Fischer, Angela Kinsey, Rashida Jones, Phyllis Smith and Steve Carell for two days." [...] Fischer agreed, calling it a [...] "fun episode to shoot" [...] due to having three days of filming with Carell and The Office women. Believing Meredith's minivan was [...] "another character" [...] in the series, Flannery enjoyed being able to drive and act simultaneously. In {{a reflection of the}} character's personality, the production crew added props such as bottles of alcohol, chips, crushed soda cans, garbage, and 14 air fresheners to the vehicle. The cast however soon developed headaches, leading to the air fresheners' removal. Flannery was able to perform her own stunts for the episode, explaining that she [...] "was nervous at first, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> really could be a demolition-derby star." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth £136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting {{it ought to be}} for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: [...] "The [...] rehearsals convinced me [...] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable to work on my own." [...] Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the theme of racism and if her books have changed how people think, Rowling said, [...] "I do not think I am pessimistic <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am {{realistic}} about {{how much you can}} change deeply entrenched prejudice, so my feeling would be that if someone were a committed racist, possibly Harry Potter is not going to have an effect." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was Clemens who cast Diana Rigg {{to replace}} departing star Honor Blackman in The Avengers. He was later quoted as saying, [...] "I didn't do Diana {{a very good}} service.

2500|$|The Twelfth Doctor's general outfit {{consists}} of a signature dark blue short Crombie-style coat with a red lining, dark blue trousers, a long collared white shirt buttoned to the top with no tie, a navy cardigan or waistcoat, and brogue boots. His shirt varies from episode to episode, with a navy shirt, a dark purple shirt and a black shirt with white polka dots appearing, {{as well as a}} black holey jumper, all being worn under his coat in his first series. He also wears a hoodie over his jumper as of series nine, over his T-shirt all being worn under his coat.

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} reissued {{its debut}} studio album, Queens of the Stone Age (1998), in 2011, and embarked upon an extensive tour playing the album in full each night. Homme stated, [...] "Doing the rehearsals {{for the first}} record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What we were doing was kind of bluesy, and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are back!" [...] However, in 2013, Homme noted, [...] "I was hoping that playing the first record would really inspire me and make me {{fall in love with}} music again. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was just lost, looking for something in the dark.

You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, {{as soon as he}} learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I'd left him behind on an Aleutian island and had sent a {{destroyer}} back to find him—at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or twenty million dollars—his Scotch soul was furious.

2500|$|A {{contest for}} fans {{to create an}} album cover image for 20 Y.O. was {{announced}} on July 18, 2006, through Yahoo!. Fans were able to create and submit their own album-cover design, with four winners being chosen by Jackson herself. The first million copies of the album would be published with these fan-created covers. The concept of the contest was to create an image that best celebrated Jackson's past twenty years. The singer hand-picked dozens of images that span over twenty years of Jackson's career were made available for download for use in creating the design. [...] "They told me that I should pick maybe 20, 30 photos, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> went a little crazy. I picked way more than that. I gave them {{some of the new}} stuff I just shot for the album cover shoot. So they have some really recent photos as well as some stuff from 20 years ago", Jackson confessed. For the official artwork for the album, Jackson appears sporting big hair and a wrist full of bracelets.|$|E

Following the match, Storm cut an emotional promo, and later announced his belief that this would be his last match, saying [...] "I shared this match with people who share my love and respect for this business, and I am now home being Lance Evers with the family I will share {{the rest of my life}} with.
