40|$|Cables {{that are}} not {{longitudinally}} water blocked are vulnerable to water ingress over long lengths of hundreds of meters or more. In these events, electric utilities and/or cable producers may suffer high cable replacement costs or delays caused by long cable lead times or right-of-way problems. Conversely, properly water blocked cables limit water ingress to a distance of typically less than 1 meter. Recently, cable and water blocking material producers have witnessed and reacted to a clear industry trend towards complete longitudinal water blocking of power cables, including the conductor, rather than the traditional requirement for “screen only ” water blocking. To address these new challenges, new water blocking materials were developed by Geca Tapes for use under the strenuous conditions of CV extrusion and decades of service at conductor operating temperatures. The new materials included a thin water <b>blocking</b> <b>tape</b> for use in power conductors, a new high-capacity water blocking yarn designed for use in conductors and two new water blocking filler yarns designed {{for use in the}} interstitial areas between conductors in LV and MV multicore cables In addition, methods were developed to analyze power cable geometry and produce an estimated bill of materials for water blocking. This information proved useful to cables makers for verification trials of new water blocked cable designs...|$|E

The tape could be moved at 100 inches per second, giving a nominal transfer rate of 12,800 characters per second. Data were recorded in fixed size blocks of 60 words of 12 characters each.

40|$|BACKGROUND: All trauma {{patients}} with a cervical spinal column injury or with a mechanism of injury {{with the potential to}} cause cervical spinal injury should be immobilised until a spinal injury is excluded. Immobilisation of the entire patient with a rigid cervical collar, backboard, head <b>blocks</b> with <b>tape</b> or straps is recommended by the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines. However there is insufficient evidence to support these guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effects on the range of motion of the addition of a rigid collar to head blocks strapped on a backboard. METHOD: The active range of motion of the cervical spine was determined by computerised digital dual inclinometry, in 10 healthy volunteers with a rigid collar, head blocks strapped on a padded spine board and a combination of both. Maximal opening of the mouth with all types of immobiliser in place was also measured. RESULTS: The addition of a rigid collar to head blocks strapped on a spine board did not result in extra immobilisation of the cervical spine. Opening of the mouth was significantly reduced in {{patients with}} a rigid collar. CONCLUSION: Based on this proof of principle study and other previous evidence of adverse effects of rigid collars, the addition of a rigid collar to head blocks is considered unnecessary and potentially dangerous. Therefore the use of this combination of cervical spine immobilisers must be reconsidered...|$|R
