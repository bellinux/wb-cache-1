5|$|For the Muslims, {{the battle}} was a {{significant}} setback.

5|$|The spotted {{green pigeon}} {{is most likely}} extinct, and may already have <b>been</b> <b>close</b> to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area.

Allen's wife Mary died in June 1783 of consumption, to be followed several months later by their first-born daughter Loraine.

5|$|Jones {{spent seven}} years working at his {{business}} in Ruston after leaving the Browns. He worked briefly as a special instructor for the Houston Oilers and an occasional advisor to college programs in Louisiana, but otherwise was out of football. He returned to the Browns as an assistant coach, however, in March 1963 after Paul Brown was fired by team owner Art Modell. Blanton Collier, Brown's long-time deputy, became head coach and put Jones {{in charge of the}} receivers. Jones and Collier had <b>been</b> <b>close</b> during his playing days, and Collier considered him an astute student of the game.|$|E
5|$|Robert Dudley had <b>been</b> <b>close</b> to the Knollys {{family since}} the early 1550s; several of Lettice's {{brothers}} {{had been in his}} service and his marriage only enhanced his relations with her siblings. To his four stepchildren he was a concerned and generous stepfather. The Dudleys' domestic life is partly documented in the Earl's accounts; Lettice Dudley financed her personal expenses and servants out of her revenue as Dowager Countess of Essex, remaining largely excluded from society life.|$|E

Varney was replaced by Blake Clark. After Clark was cast to play Slinky Dog, the producers realized that Clark and Varney had coincidentally <b>been</b> <b>close</b> friends since they appeared in the 1989 film Fast Food, making the transition a lot easier.|$|E

5|$|This {{record of}} disputed {{succession}} {{was by no}} means unique to Northumbria, and the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex experienced similar troubles during the eighth and ninth centuries. In Wessex, from the death of Centwine in 685 to Egbert's seizure of power in 802, the relationships between successive kings are far from clear and few kings are known to have <b>been</b> <b>close</b> kinsmen of their predecessors or successors. The same may be true of Mercia from the death of Ceolred in 716 until the disappearance of the Mercian kingdom in the late ninth century.|$|E
5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke, as they had <b>been</b> <b>close</b> friends. His attendance {{in the next two years}} was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{was born}} in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no {{legitimate}} children. Her father, James, was thus heir presumptive to the throne. His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans. Three years after he succeeded Charles, James was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Anne's sister and Dutch Protestant brother-in-law and cousin William III of Orange became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had <b>been</b> <b>close,</b> disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of Part One, Ko Kitamura, son of the owner of Kitamura Sports, lives in the same {{neighborhood}} as the batting center run by the Tsukishima family. Due to their proximity and the relationship between their businesses, the Kitamura and Tsukishima families have <b>been</b> <b>close</b> for many years, and their children go {{back and forth between the}} two homes. Because Ko and Wakaba are the same age and always together, Aoba is jealous of all the time Ko spends with her older sister. Aoba is a natural pitcher with excellent form, and Ko secretly trains to become as good as she is, even while publicly showing little interest in baseball. Then Wakaba dies in a swimming accident at a summer camp during fifth grade.|$|E
5|$|Founding {{member and}} lead singer Peter Gabriel {{decided to leave}} Genesis in late 1974, midway through the tour for the album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. The other members hoped he would reconsider, as {{they were still in}} debt and felt his {{departure}} could destroy the band's future, but ultimately accepted that he would leave. The remaining members felt they still wanted to collaborate musically, and show journalists and critics they were primarily a song writing team that could still produce good music. Keyboardist Tony Banks had <b>been</b> <b>close</b> to Gabriel personally, and did not want the band to split up on top of seeing less of one of his best friends. He had written a number of songs for a possible solo project before deciding they should be used on the new Genesis album.|$|E
5|$|In August, Khánh {{gave himself}} more powers, {{provoking}} widespread riots and demonstrations across the nation, with Buddhist activists prominent in expressing opposition against Khánh. The anarchy forced Khánh {{to back down}} and make concessions, {{and he ended up}} in a weaker position than before. Among the concessions he made was to remove or demote some Catholic officials who had <b>been</b> <b>close</b> to Diệm's religiously discriminatory rule, angering the minority Catholic community. Among those demoted were Generals Phát and Đức, both Catholic. They launched a coup attempt backed mainly by Catholic elements against Khánh before dawn on 13 September. They took over the city without firing a shot, and used the national radio station to proclaim the deposing of Khánh's junta. There was little initial reaction from most of the military commanders, including Thi.|$|E

The bid included a plan for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side celebration locations that would have had high-definition LED screens for unticketed visitors. The bid noted {{that there was a}} very high concentration of event locations and training facilities close to each other and that the majority of event sites were clustered together.

Shanghai Sharks president and former NBA star Yao Ming also tried, unsuccessfully, to sign Lin for the upcoming CBA season; Lin explained that as someone still under contract with the Golden State Warriors, he could not play in the CBA as the league would only admit NBA free agents. A {{few days before the}} lockout was lifted on November 26, Lin had <b>been</b> <b>close</b> to signing with an undisclosed club in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the {{publication}} of The Woman's Bible; they felt it would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never accepted by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much {{to the dismay of}} suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had <b>been</b> <b>close</b> to her, publication of the book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E
