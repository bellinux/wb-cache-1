Its importance is illustrated by an observation of Palmieri and Palmieri, namely that modern replicas of Stein pianos commonly include a <b>back</b> <b>check</b> even though it is not historically authentic on these instruments.|$|E

5000|$|The centre (or {{center in}} the United States) in ice hockey is a forward {{position}} of a player whose primary zone of play is {{the middle of the}} ice, away from the side boards. Centres have more flexibility in their positioning and are expected to cover more ice surface than any other player. Centres are ideally stronger, faster skaters who can <b>back</b> <b>check</b> quickly from deep in the opposing zone. Generally, centres are expected to be gifted passers more so than goal scorers, although there are exceptions. They are also expected to have exceptional [...] "ice vision", intelligence, and creativity. They also generally are the most defensively oriented forwards on the ice. Centres usually play as part of a line of players that are substituted frequently to keep fresh and keep the game moving. First-liners are usually the top players, although some top players make the second line to allow for offensive scoring opportunities.|$|E

These feeling begin to grow as David spends more time with Dora. David and the family eventually move into a larger apartment up town, as was the trend to move up in society through the northern development of New York City. Not long after moving into the new apartment, David pronounces his love for Dora and they begin {{to engage in a}} highly passionate, yet secretive, affair of which Max is not aware of. During this time, David Levinsky begins to become successful after having received the <b>back</b> <b>check</b> from the Western company and is finally able to afford materials for his shop. Orders begin to increase and David does a lot of traveling in order to acquire new business. Upon returning from a trip, David bought a new bracelet for Dora, but she was mad at David because she believed him to be seeing another women. After having been reassured Dora accepts David's word as the truth, but Dora will not accept David's present for fear of being found out. Eventually Dora explains to David that she cannot continue as she is and does not deserve to be happy. As a result, Dora asks David to move out as he reluctantly does and continues to focus on his business.|$|E

40|$|The aim set by this {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} {{to survey the}} application of opioids in the emergency crews. To meet this objective, I posed two research questions. Research question Nr. 1 : Are patients informed about the application of opioids? Research question Nr. 2 : Do paramedics find out the effects of opioids administered to patients? Patients are entitled by law to information about administering any medicaments, according to Health Care of the Population Act. The <b>back</b> <b>check</b> of effects of medicaments administered {{is important for the}} check-up of the efficiency of the dose administered as well as the danger of undesired effects. Opioid substances are derived from morphine. Morphine, which is found in the juice of opium poppy, has been used throughout history to produce euphoric effects and especially as an analgesic. The reason for using analgesics is pain, and for that reason I explain here what pain is, how it is classified, measured and especially how it is soothed. Opioids are substances used for soothing severe pains for which non-opioid analgesics are insufficient. However, using these substances may result in addiction, and therefore manipulation with them is strictly controlled by law. To achieve the objective I conducted quantitative research, and data were collected by a secondary data analysis, the method of questioning and interview technique. Drawing on the research results that were obtained by observing paramedics and from interviews with their patients, it appears {{that it is necessary to}} inform patients that they are being administered an opioid substance. There are exceptional states when patients are not able to perceive such information and their consent to administering the medicine can be supposed. It was observed that paramedics make a back proof of the effects of the medicaments administered, and it was also found out that there are paramedics who, in the event that the dose of medicament is inefficient, do nothing more...|$|E
40|$|On {{behalf of}} Petroleum Technology Company AS (PTC), an {{experimental}} study regarding {{one of their}} safety valves has been conducted. The respective safety valve is called a Modular Surface Annulus Safety (MSAS) valve. This valve functions as a primary barrier against dangerous blow-outs from the annulus in an oil and gas-producing well. It is a <b>back</b> <b>check</b> valve, where a piston moves inside a valve housing. In the past {{there has been some}} issues regarding what torque values these valves are to be installed with. Too high torque values could lead to insufficient clearance between the moving piston and the valve housing. Insufficient clearance would lead to malfunctioning of the valve, and potential dangerous blow-outs from the well, due to a primary barrier not functioning properly. The goal of this thesis has been {{to come up with a}} method for determining the appropriate installation torque that is to be used during installation of such valves. In order to determine the appropriate installation torque there are three things that have to be accounted for. The first is achieving sufficient pre-tensioning of the valve so that the valve does not loosen due to vibrations. The second is to ensure that there is sufficient clearance between the valve housing and piston after installation. The third is to determine whether lubrications are necessary or not. In order to account for these things two different tests have been designed, Torque test 1 and Torque test 2 (TT 1 and TT 2). The previous tests totaled 118 measurements. In addition to these tests there have been performed finite element analysis (FEA) via SolidWorks Simulations. These tests and simulations are briefly described in the following. TT 1 was designed to measure the relationship between applied torque, corresponding axial force and the coefficient of friction between the valve and the VR-profile that it is inserted into. The relationship between the applied torque and corresponding axial force was measured via an electronic load cell. This was possible due to the design of the test setup. The coefficient of friction at different lubrication conditions was possible to calculate due to specially machined test parts, as well as engineering equations from threaded bolt theory. TT 2 was designed to measure the radial displacement that takes place in the valve housing when exposed to the installation torque, due to the angled contact surface in front of the valve. The purpose of the test was to calculate the torque that would lead to insufficient clearance between the valve housing and piston at given frictional conditions, calculated from the results from TT 1. This test was performed via strain gauges as well as manual measurements via a micrometer. Both of the previous tests were conducted in pit one, in PTC’s workshop. Two different valve housings were studied. A 2. 0 ” valve, and a 2. 5 ” valve, both with Xylan coating and 8 TPI Stub Acme threads...|$|E
