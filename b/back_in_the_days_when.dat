GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer labeled Mega Man 6 the [...] "cheesiest" [...] {{among the}} NES titles: [...] "If you're looking for mega-laughs, {{you might want}} to try this one out." [...] 1UP.com contributors likewise found that the game's [...] "inane" [...] storyline and villains both insult fans of the series and outweigh the game's good soundtrack and interesting power-ups. The four members of the Electronic Gaming Monthly review panel all voiced similar opinions regarding the game's familiar 8-bit presentation and its addition to the already repetitive nature of the series. One reviewer commented, [...] "OK, Mega Man was fun and original <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the letters 'N E S' meant something. Now the game is just getting redundant. Oh sure, Mega Man may learn a few new tricks here and there but this series has to end soon." ...|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I was slipping. I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E

The top panel is surmounted with a carved representation of the serpent-like animal {{with the head of}} a singa. At the bottom panel is four legs or hooves. Achim Sibeth commented that the animal is the representation of the Naga Padoha, a primordial water serpent that rules the underworld. A Batak creation myth told that <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> there was only sea, the serpent stirred up sand from the ocean bed to create the first islands which create the islands of Indonesia. Other expert thinks that the figure represents the singa. The word singa, borrowed from Sanskrit singa meaning [...] "lion", dates back to contact with Hindu traders in the southern Batak area. In Batak culture however, the singa itself is a complicated mythical creature related to the female serpent. An example of the representation of a singa {{can be found in a}} wooden animal head that was collected by Tassilo Adam, a German planter who is also an enthusiast in Batak Toba culture.|$|E

Almost everything to-day is the result of things that happened in those long-ago days. The great-great-ever-so-great grandfather of Spotty the Turtle lived then, and unlike Spotty, whom you know, he had no house. He was very quiet and bashful, was Mr. Turtle, and he never meddled with any one's business, because he believed that the best way of keeping out of trouble was to attend strictly to his own affairs.|$|E

The Great World was a new place, and they were new in it. No one knew exactly his place or {{what was expected of}} him, and Old Mother Nature was too busy to be bothered with questions. She expected each one to work out for himself a way in which to make himself useful, or at least to take care of himself, without bothering her. If he couldn't do that, she didn't want him around at all, and the sooner something happened to him the better. So the Great World began to be peopled with birds and animals.|$|E

Anyway, {{according}} to what has been handed down in the family, Grandfather Quack was very much such a looking fellow as I am now, except in the matter of his bill and feet. His bill was not broad like mine but more like the bills of other birds, and his feet were like the feet of Mr. Grouse and Bob White. They were made for scratching, and there was nothing between the toes. You see, Old Mother Nature was experimenting. She made everybody a little different from everybody else and then started them forth in the Great World to shift for themselves and to find out what they really needed that they hadn't got.|$|E
