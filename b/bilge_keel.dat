5|$|During early August 1940, {{while she}} was still being {{outfitted}} and was in a semi-complete state, Prince of Wales was attacked by German aircraft. One bomb fell between the ship and a wet basin wall, narrowly missing a 100-ton dockside crane, and exploded underwater below the <b>bilge</b> <b>keel.</b> The explosion took place about six feet from the ship's port side {{in the vicinity of the}} after group of 5.25-inch guns. Buckling of the shell plating took place over a distance of 20 to , rivets were sprung and considerable flooding took place in the port outboard compartments in the area of damage, causing a ten-degree port list. The flooding was severe, due to the fact that final compartment air tests had not yet been made and the ship did not have her pumping system in operation.|$|E
5|$|Kentuckian resumed cargo {{service with}} American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Though {{the company had}} {{abandoned}} its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time, Kentuckian continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal with a few incidents that interrupted what was a mostly uneventful twenty years. In September 1928, a day after sailing from San Francisco, Kentuckian was rammed by the General Petroleum tanker Los Alamos near Point Sur, California, in a thick fog. Kentuckian had a leak in her number two cargo hold and damage to her port <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> and returned to San Francisco for repairs. In early April 1933, a fire broke out in Kentuckians number two cargo hold, {{which resulted in the}} delay of the ship at Panama from 8 to 14 April. Kentuckian made her way to Los Angeles over the next ten days, where surveyors examined the ship and her general cargo.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bilge</b> <b>keels</b> {{are often}} fitted to smaller sailing yachts. <b>Bilge</b> <b>keels</b> {{minimise}} {{the draft of}} the vessel compared to a single fin keel thus enabling it to negotiate shallower water. <b>Bilge</b> <b>keels</b> on sailing yachts extend below the lowest point of the hull extending slightly outwards. Such an arrangement also enables the vessel to stand upright on firm sand or mud at drying moorings {{without the need for}} detachable legs, and is simpler than retractable fin keels while giving the hull greater protection. <b>Bilge</b> <b>keels</b> are not as effective as central fin keels in preventing leeway (sideways slippage) caused by crosswinds but are preferred by many small craft owners due to their other advantages.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the roll damping of a {{two-dimensional}} FPSO model produced by <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> using CFD method is presented in this paper. The tool to be utilized is the well-known code Star-CCM+, which uses the Volume of Fluid (VOF) approach to capture the free surface. The results are validated by comparison with experiments. Using the results {{from a number of}} simulations, the roll damping coefficient resulting from locating the <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> at different positions will be calculated. The analysis of the rolling damping coefficients for the different locations will provide a useful design tool for optimising the roll damping of vessels with <b>bilge</b> <b>keels...</b>|$|R

25|$|Steel cutting for {{the first}} ship, , {{commenced}} on 27 March 1992. Work on the first New Zealand ship, , began in February 1993. Anzac commissioned into the RAN in May 1996, and Te Kaha into the RNZN in July 1997. In early 2002, the first four ships found to have microscopic cracks in the <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> and hull plating. The ships' hulls were repaired and reinforced. Construction of the final vessel, , began in July 2003, with the vessel commissioning into the RAN in August 2006.|$|E
500|$|On 13 November, at 15:40, the sonar {{operator}} {{aboard the}} destroyer [...] detected an unidentified sound, but {{assumed it was}} the propellers of a nearby destroyer. One minute later, Ark Royal was struck amidships by a torpedo, between the fuel bunkers and bomb store, and directly below the bridge island. The explosion caused Ark Royal to shake, hurled loaded torpedo-bombers into the air, and killed Able Seaman Edward Mitchell. A [...] hole was created on the ship's bottom and on the starboard side below the water-line by the torpedo, which was judged to have run deep, striking the <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> where it detonated, inboard of the side protection system. The hit caused flooding of the starboard boiler room, main switchboard, oil tanks, and over [...] of the ship's starboard bilge. The starboard power train was knocked out, causing the rear half of the ship to lose power, while communications were severed shipwide.|$|E
2500|$|... "The highest part of {{the ship}} is her port bilge [...] keel and the {{starboard}} <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> is about 9 ft. off the bottom.

500|$|Medway was {{designed}} to support up to 18 [...] and s in peacetime and an additional three submarines during wartime.

Her <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> were subsequently increased in depth to [...]|$|R
5000|$|Another {{issue with}} Hood {{was that the}} {{stability}} of a ship {{is largely due to}} freeboard at high rolling angles, so she had to be given a larger metacentric height (the vertical distance between the metacenter and the centre of gravity below it) of around 4.1 ft instead of the 3.6 ft {{of the rest of the}} Royal Sovereigns to make her roll less in rough seas. This had the effect of making her roll period shorter by around 7% compared to her sisters, which in turn made her gunnery less accurate. White had purposely selected a high GM to minimise rolling and he did not think that <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> were needed. When [...] experienced heavy rolling during a heavy storm in December 1893, which earned the class the nickname Rolling Ressies, her sister ship, , was fitted with <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> while still fitting out and conclusively demonstrated their effectiveness during comparative trials. The rest of the ships were fitted with <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> in 1894-95.|$|R
50|$|It is {{produced}} {{with either a}} <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> or twin leeboards. The <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> produces an angle of vanishing stability of 121°. A single lifting fin keel system is being designed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> is {{constructed}} from flat plate {{so as to}} present a sharp obstruction to roll motion. The roll damping provided by a <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> is more {{than that of a}} barehull ship, but falls short of other roll damping devices. Nevertheless it is considered prudent naval architecture to install a <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> whenever possible as it is the only device effective in the severest of seas. Bilge keels can also be used in conjunction with other roll damping devices.|$|E
50|$|When {{designing}} a <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> {{there are important}} decisions to consider. To minimize hydrodynamic drag the <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> should be placed in way of a flowline where it does not oppose crossflow. For such a usage {{the ends of the}} <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> should be tapered and properly faired into the hull. Also, a <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> should not protrude from the hull so far that the device could be damaged when the vessel is alongside a pier, even with a few degrees of adverse heel. Bilge keels on commercial vessels should not protrude below the baseline either, where they could be damaged or fouled by grounding. Note that small bilge keels are often fitted to smaller fishing boats precisely to protect the hull on drying moorings and to help keep the vessel upright.|$|E
50|$|It has twin fixed <b>bilge</b> <b>keels,</b> and {{a simple}} sail plan of headsail and mainsail. The {{original}} design was for Gunter rig, {{but there are also}} many Bermuda rig examples.|$|R
50|$|Between 1986 and 1990 the 26 foot Pioneer and Pioneer Pilot (with wheelhouse) 6 berth family cruisers were built.Eighty Pioneers were {{completed}} most with <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> but also fin and centreboard.|$|R
5000|$|Medway was {{designed}} to support up to 18 [...] and s in peacetime and an additional three submarines during wartime. She carried three QF 4-inch Mk IV deck guns as spares together with 144 21 in torpedoes to resupply her submarines. The ship proved to be less top-heavy than anticipated and had the enormously high metacentric height of 13 ft at full load. Built with <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> only 12 in deep, Medway once rolled 42° each way with a period of nine seconds, losing her main topmast. Her <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> were subsequently increased in depth to 36 in.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> is used {{to reduce}} a ship's {{tendency}} to roll. Bilge keels are employed in pairs (one for {{each side of the}} ship). A ship may have more than one <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> per side, but this is rare. Bilge keels increase hydrodynamic resistance to rolling, making the ship roll less. Bilge keels are passive stability systems.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> {{is a long}} fin of metal, {{often in}} a [...] "V" [...] shape, welded {{along the length of}} the ship at the turn of the bilge. Bilge keels are {{employed}} in pairs (one for each side of the ship). A ship may have more than one <b>bilge</b> <b>keel</b> per side, but this is rare. Bilge keels increase the hydrodynamic resistance when a vessel rolls, thus limiting the amount of roll a vessel has to endure.|$|E
50|$|Built between 1974 and 1981, the Sadler 25 was {{normally}} rigged as a masthead sloop,and {{was offered}} with {{the option of}} deep or shallow fin <b>keels,</b> twin <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> or a centre plate.|$|R
50|$|There are {{methods for}} both passive and active motion {{stabilization}} {{used in some}} designs. They include static hull features such as skegs and <b>bilge</b> <b>keels,</b> or active mechanical devices like counterweights, antiroll tanks and stabilizers.|$|R
40|$|The flow {{around the}} DTMB 5415 surface {{combatant}} hull {{with and without}} <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> is studied numerically {{by the use of}} a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. The main purpose for <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> is to reduce roll motions when operating in ocean waves. The flow resistance should at the same time be affected as little as possible. The computations presented here are for straight course in calm water conditions and show only a small change {{in the wake of the}} hull and there by a minimal effect on the resistance. The computations are made as a preparatory step before investigating other conditions, such as yaw angle...|$|R

2500|$|The keel {{surface on}} the bottom of the hull gives the ship greater {{directional}} control and stability. In non-sailing hulls, the keel helps the hull to move forward, rather than slipping to the side. In traditional boat building, this is provided by the structural keel, which projects from the bottom of the hull along most or all of its length. In modern construction, the bar keel or flat-plate keel performs the same function. There are many types of fixed keels, including full keels, long keels, fin keels, winged keels, bulb <b>keels,</b> and <b>bilge</b> <b>keels</b> among other designs. Deep-draft ships will typically have a flat bottom and employ only <b>bilge</b> <b>keels,</b> both to aid directional control and to damp rolling motions ...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} first {{focuses on}} modelling the flow around cantilever plates in normal oscillation, providing key guidance for attaining sufficient accuracy for most engineering applications, {{in terms of}} turbulence modelling, mesh refinement and time step selection. The modelling approach is then applied to the hydrodynamics of a ship-like section fitted with vertical <b>bilge</b> <b>keels,</b> rolling at free surface. The results obtained from RANS are compared to available experimental data and predictions obtained from potential flow analysis.

Finally, empirical formulae commonly used to allow for the influence of viscous roll damping are compared to RANS predictions and experimental data...|$|R
