5|$|The Missing Link {{takes place}} during the events of Human Revolution: after staging an {{explosion}} in the docks of Hengsha, Adam Jensen smuggles himself on board a ship bound for a secret research base inside a cryosleep pod. Adam is discovered and captured aboard the ship. Two <b>Belltower</b> commanders, Pieter Burke and Netanya Keitner, torture him for information on his identity. After the EMP chair holding him captive mysteriously deactivates, Adam is able to retrieve his equipment {{with the help of an}} unknown hacker who contacts him via radio. The ship docks at Rifleman Bank Station, a seaborne regional <b>Belltower</b> supply hub. After escaping into the station, Adam discovers that it was Keitner who set him free. Disillusioned with the unethical nature of local <b>Belltower</b> operations, she wants Adam to find concrete proof of illegal research that she can use to deliver to Interpol. She also instructs Adam to obtain weaponry from Garvin Quinn, resident technician and black market weapons trader.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} entrance, on {{the south}} side of the <b>belltower,</b> leads to a small vestibule from which short flights of stairs rise to the sanctuary level and descend to the basement.|$|E
5|$|The Protestant Reformed Dutch Church of Rosendale was {{incorporated}} on November28, 1843. The church originally cost $2,500 to build, and {{was designed to}} seat 300 people. It burned down and was rebuilt in 1895. In 1985, it was renovated and converted into a glass studio called <b>Belltower</b> Lighting.|$|E

5|$|A DLC episode set {{during the}} main game, , {{released}} digitally on October 18 for Steam and Xbox Live, and October 19 for PlayStation Network (PSN). It likewise debuted in Japan for the console versions: it released on PSN on March 7, 2012, and March 20 for Xbox Live. Set during a transitional event in-game, the plot sees Adam captured and {{stripped of his}} augmentations, having to escape and navigate a cargo ship and then a base operated by <b>Belltower.</b>|$|E
5|$|As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton {{was one of}} its {{greatest}} builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted {{that he began to}} rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third <b>belltower</b> remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of his own money to new service books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.|$|E
5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} <b>belltower</b> to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there were not enough funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E
5000|$|Founded as a Roman Catholic French {{colony and}} nicknamed [...] "la ville aux cent clochers" [...] (the city {{of a hundred}} <b>belltowers),</b> Montreal is renowned for its churches.|$|R
50|$|Santuario di Santa Maria della Rotonda, {{inspired}} by the Pantheon and built over the ruins of Domitian's villa. The <b>belltowers</b> are also {{very similar to those}} of Rome's medieval churches.|$|R
50|$|The {{monument}} {{is located}} almost {{in the middle}} of the Sophia Square (formerly the main city's square) on the axis that unites both <b>belltowers</b> of the Sophia Cathedral and the St.Michael's Monastery.|$|R
5|$|The Office of Religious Life {{calls the}} chapel the third-largest {{university}} chapel in the world. According to Milliner, Princeton's is the second-tallest by {{height of the}} nave at the crossing; the tallest is King's College Chapel at the University of Cambridge. The <b>belltower</b> of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart at the University of Notre Dame, the tower of the Duke University Chapel, the tower of the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Chapel, and the campanile of Valparaiso University's Chapel of the Resurrection are all taller than Princeton's chapel, which {{does not have a}} tower or other appendages.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the <b>belltower</b> and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass fanlight depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E
5|$|With {{support of}} the Kiev city authorities, architect-restorer Y. Lositskiy and others {{restored}} {{the western part of}} the stone walls. The <b>belltower</b> was restored next and became an observation platform. Instead of the original chiming clock, a new electronic one with hands and a set of chimes (a total of 40) was installed from which today the melodies of famous Ukrainian composers can be heard. The Cathedral was reconstructed last and decorated with a set of wooden baroque icons, copies of former mosaics and frescoes, and new works of art by Ukrainian artists.|$|E
50|$|In 1731 on {{invitation}} of the Kiev Archbishop Rafail Zaborovsky, Schaedel moved to Kiev where {{he created the}} great <b>belltowers</b> of Kiev Pechersk Lavra and Sophia Cathedral, the Klov Palace and others creations.|$|R
50|$|Longo also practiced {{architectural}} design, {{and designed}} the <b>belltowers</b> {{of the churches}} of San Sebastiano in Cavalese and Sant’Eliseo in Tesero. He painted an altarpiece of the Rosary for the church of Cavalese.|$|R
50|$|The event's name {{refers to}} the tall hats worn by chefs (toques) and bell towers or {{steeples}} (clochers), since the money raised from the auctions is given to churches to restore their <b>belltowers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Chestnut Street is also largely residential. The 200 {{block of}} West Chestnut {{features}} old supports for the Big Four Bridge and the 100 block of West Chestnut holds the Grisamore House, which was separately {{placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1983. On East Chestnut, the 100 block contains many houses built around 1900 and the 200 block is filled with bungalows. St. Augustine Roman Catholic Church, a Spanish-flavored neo-Baroque structure with a Moorish-styled rectory, {{is located on the}} 300 block of East Chestnut. Another church is located on the 400 block including the Gothic Revival style First Presbyterian Church (with lancet windows and <b>belltower),</b> and a typical Works Progress Administration Art Modern school whose cruciform plan has a stuccoed facade and metal casement windows.|$|E
5|$|In 1973-1982 {{restoration}} of the Refectory Church of St. John the Theologian (the only building that survived the demolition of the 1930s) was held. Authors of the project - architect V. Shevchenko and architect I. Karakis (interiors and furniture). After Ukraine regained independence in 1991, the demolition of the monastery was deemed a crime and voices started to be heard calling for the monastery's full-scale reconstruction as {{an important part of}} the cultural heritage of the Ukrainian people. These plans were approved and carried out in 1997–1998, whereupon the cathedral and <b>belltower</b> were transferred to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kiev Patriarchate. Yuriy Ivakin, the chief archaeologist for the site, said that more than 260 valuable ancient artifacts were recovered during excavations of the site before reconstruction. In addition, a portion of the ancient cathedral, still intact, was uncovered; this today makes up a part of the current cathedral's crypt.|$|E
5|$|Together with pilot Faridah Malik, Adam {{travels to}} Hengsha and tracks down the hacker, Arie van Bruggen, {{who is being}} both hunted by private {{security}} company <b>Belltower</b> Associates and hidden by local triad leader Tong Si Hung. Van Bruggen directs Adam to find evidence inside Tai Yong Medical, the world's largest augmentation technology manufacturer and Sarif's main rival. Infiltrating Tai Yong, Adam finds footage of a call between Namir and Zhao Yun Ru, which confirms that Megan and the other missing scientists are alive and that Eliza Cassan is somehow involved. Confronting Zhao in her penthouse apartment, he learns that she is allied to a powerful organization that controls global interests before she triggers security and forces him to leave. Traveling to the Picus corporate building in Montreal, Jensen tracks down Eliza, revealed to be an artificial intelligence construct designed to influence the media. Despite her programming, she has begun to question her role and offers to help Adam. After he defeats Tyrant member Fedorova, Eliza gives him footage directing him to Doctor Isaias Sandoval, aide to William Taggart.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{prime example}} of the {{so-called}} 'Polish Cathedral style' of church in both its opulence and grand scale. St. Josaphat's two massive Romanesque <b>belltowers</b> are a hallmark view of the Lincoln Park skyline.|$|R
50|$|Several {{buildings}} were erected and destroyed on this site, until in 990 Bishop Heimon ordered {{the construction of}} a new cathedral on the Romano-Rhenish plan: a nave, two transepts, two opposing apses, each one flanked by two <b>belltowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{free-standing}} campanile (begun in 1063 {{and completed}} within several decades), standing at 48 m, {{is one of}} the finest surviving <b>belltowers</b> from the Romanesque period, together with the campanile of Abbey of San Mercuriale (75 m), in Forlì.|$|R
5|$|Back in Detroit, Sarif {{admits to}} Adam that the Illuminati {{are behind the}} attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his {{involvement}} in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by <b>Belltower.</b> The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod {{in the wake of a}} staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research; the genetic key to make all humans compatible with augmentations, which she found in Adam's DNA — and to help Darrow foil the Illuminati's plans.|$|E
25|$|The old {{detached}} belfry was demolished; its square basement was reused {{for a new}} <b>belltower.</b> The tall single tented roof of this <b>belltower,</b> {{built in}} the vernacular style {{of the reign of}} Alexis I, significantly changed the appearance of the cathedral, adding a strong asymmetrical counterweight to the church itself. The effect is most pronounced on the southern and eastern facades (as viewed from Zaryadye), although the <b>belltower</b> is large enough to be seen from the west.|$|E
25|$|The Great Lavra <b>Belltower</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Kiev skyline and among the main attractions of the Lavra. 96.5 meters in height, it was the tallest free-standing <b>belltower</b> at the time of its construction in 1731–1745, and was designed by the architect Johann Gottfried Schädel. It is a Classical style construction and consists of tiers, surmounted by a gilded dome.|$|E

50|$|In 2004 at {{the expense}} of the Board of {{trustees}} were established 8 bells on temple belfries. At the beginning of November, 2004 the ruling bishop consecrated five domes of the temple which were established on the central drum and four <b>belltowers</b> of the Troitsk temple.|$|R
5000|$|Baroque Church of St. Martin. Built between 1672-1691. Originally a Romanesque church {{built in}} the 12th century by Jindřich Zdík. It {{has one of the}} oldest <b>belltowers</b> still extant in Moravia and is an {{important}} stop on the pilgrimage route 'Via Sancti Martini' for Martin of Tours.|$|R
25|$|The Hockelstur or <b>belltower</b> (1603) {{on a rock}} {{close to}} the castle was {{originally}} part of the fortifications.|$|E
25|$|Very common two-step {{bracketing}} {{system used}} {{in a variety of}} structures. See in the gallery for example the photo of a <b>belltower</b> (shōrō).|$|E
25|$|The Christian {{tradition}} of the ringing of church bells from a <b>belltower</b> is analogous to Islamic {{tradition of}} the adhan from a minaret.|$|E
5000|$|In Christianity, some Anglican, Catholic, and Lutheran churches ring {{their church}} bells from <b>belltowers</b> {{three times a}} day, at 6:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., {{summoning}} the Christian faithful to recite the Lord’s Prayer, or the Angelus, a prayer recited in honour of the Incarnation of God.|$|R
5000|$|A {{church at}} the site was begun in 1639 {{after the end of}} a season of plague, and {{dedicated}} to an icon of the Madonna discovered while the town was afflicted. Construction restarted in 1640 after a collapse. Built in octagonal layout, it is flanked by two <b>belltowers</b> with lead cupolas.|$|R
50|$|A mighty reredos {{was added}} {{over the new}} altar {{depicting}} the mourning Marys and the crucifixion of Christ in the centre. Higher windows were added {{as well as the}} current pews. The characteristical bell tower was erected during the 1750s by Erik Olofsson i Rännberg. It belongs to a group of typical <b>belltowers</b> of the 18th century Jämtland with its onion-shaped cupola.|$|R
