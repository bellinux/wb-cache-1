40|$|The Greek Banking System, in {{its effort}} to prepare itself for the {{changeover}} to the EURO, will face some initial costs. Being the basic institution of money distribution, this changeover will impose a heavy burden on banks. In addition to the costs that banks will sustain, they will derive new benefits. The impact of the EURO on Greek Banks is explained through a cost-benefit analysis, by providing a perspective of the anticipated costs, <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>outcome.</b> The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} examine the costs that will arise from this changeover and the benefits that will be produced, as explained by the change in the bank profits. The study results consider the existence of two projects: one without the introduction to EURO and one with the introduction to EURO. We proceed through an incremental method to determine when profits will be produced. To further demonstrate this, we have calculated the NPV of the introduction to the EURO by considering the year 2002 as the basic year. The analysis shows that during the period 2002 - 2007 banks will face a loss in their bank profits. Further analysis indicates that profits will rapidly show increases in the long-term period. Therefore, the changeover to the EURO will probably be very lucrative for the banking system of Greece and the economy in general over the long-term. ...|$|E
40|$|This presentat ion {{will review}} briefly the current {{practice}} and {{state of the}} art in functional electrical stimulation (FES) as applied to s t roke, head injured or brain tumour opera ted patients. A similar application is used in paretic patients following t rauma or o ther aetiology. Over 20 years experience in the application of F E S, as practised in Ljubljana, will be highlighted and the devices currently in use will be described. The statistics show the results obtained on 2, 500 hemiplegic patients examined for FES application during the last 10 years. The statistics and results of the Slovenian populat ion indicate 0. 15 - 0. 20 % new cases annually or 1, 500 new cases per million inhabitants. U p to 6 3 % of annual cases are candidates for an FES based therapeutic locomotion rehabilitation programme. Experience indicates that 60 % of hemiplegic patients received single-channel stimulation to correct equinovarus or foot d rop, 30 % obtained dual or even three channel stimulation t rea tment and only 10 % of patients were involved in multichannel FES of four to six or even eight channels of stimulation. The <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> of rehabilitation will be presented and discussed in regard to current t rends in the field of F E S for hemiplegic and paretic patients.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{describe}} a business case framework that can guide clinical nurse specialists (CNS) in clinical intervention development. Background: Increased emphasis on cost-effective interventions in healthcare requires skills in analyzing the need to make the business case, especially for resource-intensive interventions. This framework assists the CNS to anticipate resource use and then consider if the intervention makes good business sense. Business Case Framework: We describe a business case framework that can assist the CNS to fully explore the problem and determine if developing an intervention is a good investment. We describe several analyses that facilitate making the business case to include the following: problem identification and alignment with strategic priorities, needs assessment, stakeholder analysis, market analysis, intervention implementation planning, financial analysis, and outcome evaluation. The findings from these analyses can be used to develop a formal proposal to present to hospital leaders in a position to make decisions. By aligning intervention planning with organizational priorities and engaging patients in the process, interventions will be more likely to be implemented in practice and produce robust outcomes. Conclusion: The business case framework can be used to justify to organization decision makers the need to invest resources in new interventions that will make a difference for quality outcomes as well as the financial bottom line. This framework can be used to plan interventions that align with organizational strategic priorities, plan for associated costs and <b>benefits,</b> <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> evaluation. Implications for CNS Practice: Clinical nurse specialists are well positioned to lead clinical intervention projects that will improve the quality of patient care and be cost-effective. To do so requires skill development in making the business case...|$|E
40|$|College {{choice is}} a {{socially}} constructed process that shapes individuals' educational and occupational mobility, {{resulting in a}} reproduction of the existing societal class structure. The complexity of the college choice process is especially apparent among the veteran population where most prospective college students belong to lower socioeconomic statuses, participate in military and working class socialization, and are impacted by organizational habitus. A considerable number of veterans transition from the military each year, eligible for significant educational benefits, yet an examination of their college choices is absent from the current literature on institutional choice. In an attempt to gain insight regarding veterans' college choices, this study aims {{to answer the following}} research questions: (1) Do veterans intend to utilize their G. I. Bill benefits when they separate from the military and what factors influence their intentions? (2) What type of institutions do veterans plan to attend and what are the major factors that influence their choices? (3) What types of messages do veterans receive about attending higher education? A total of 30 enlisted veterans transitioning from one U. S. Army installation and 12 educational counselors, education officials, Veteran's Administration representatives, and Army officials were interviewed. The vast majority of veterans interviewed in this study stated an intention to enroll in a community college rather than a four-year institution. Veterans acknowledged two salient reasons for selecting to attend a community college: the perception of financial resources and ability to bank extra financial resources. The research data also indicates that veterans are heavily socialized regarding the value of higher education and institutional selection by military supervisors and education officials who encourage the development of practical skill, focus on the collection of miscellaneous credit hours for the promotion point system rather than actual degree attainment, and encourage community college attendance. Based on the research data, the following recommendations are made: (1) Educate veterans and education officials about the structure of the higher education system including types of degrees, how to utilize educational <b>benefits,</b> <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> differences between community colleges and four-year institutions. (2) Refine the Army's current promotion system to emphasize and reward degree completion...|$|E
40|$|Background Literature {{shows that}} {{patients}} attending dental clinics in Tanzania have long-standing untreated carious lesions. Dental caries {{has been a}} major reason for attendance in dental clinics. The accumulation and persistence of dental caries suggest that the disease has either not received proper attention or has been going on un-addressed for long time. Various factors have been implicated to the accumulation and persistence of dental caries, hence the load of the untreated disease. Dental caries experience levels in Tanzania is low with mean DMFT of 1. 8 and 3. 8 for age groups 20 - 29 years and 50 - 59 years, respectively; and below 1 for permanent dentition among 12 year olds. Despite the low experience levels, the reported high accumulation of untreated caries is a cause for concern. Aim The study aims to determine the magnitude of untreated dental caries, caries treatment needs and demand for restorative dental care among patients aged 12 years and above attending public dental clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methodology A cross-section study was conducted among patients aged 12 years and above who attended public dental clinics in Dar es Salaam between August and September 2012. A sample of 310 participants randomly selected was interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Clinical examination was performed by a calibrated examiner in which caries experience; severity, distribution and treatment needs were assessed and recorded using the WHO Basic Oral health Survey Methods criteria (WHO 1997). Informations obtained were recorded in a specially designed form. Data cleaning and analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16 and statistical significance difference was assumed when p-value was less than 0. 05. Results A total of 310 dental patients aged 13 - 76 years (mean age of 31. 9 years) participated in the study with females being more than half (64. 2 %) of all participants. Almost all participants (99. 7 %) reported to have experienced tooth decay with mean DMFT score of 6. 6. The proportion of D component of DMFT (untreated dental caries) was found to be 62 %. Dental caries were more in posterior teeth (88. 8 %) than other teeth. Dentinal caries were common in 62. 7 % of the carious teeth with majority of them (85. 3 %) being in posterior teeth. About 75 % of the carious teeth needed restorative care (filling or endodontic care). Only 23. 9 % of participants demanded restorative dental care and demand varied significantly with education level (p< 0. 05). The most cited reasons for not demanding restorative care were high cost for the service (28. 6 %), fear that pain will persist (26. 5 %) and not being aware of the service (23. 1 %) Conclusion In this study the amount of untreated dental caries was high. Posterior teeth were the most affected teeth and majority of the lesions in all teeth were located in dentine which means they needed simple filling. Demand for restorative care was low. Recommendations 1. 	Community education on presence, importance, <b>benefits</b> <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> of dental restorative care is required. 2. 	Atraumatic Restorative Treatment technique should be adopted in caries management and the focus should be to the strategic dentition. 3. 	Another large study that will include representative sample for Tanzania population is required for better estimate of the amount of untreated dental caries and treatment need in Tanzania at large...|$|E

The relationships are probabilistic, and do not imply that all individuals will benefit in the same ways from any type of learning; and in most cases, the effects seem relatively small. However, given the well-known challenges of persuading adults to improve their health or well-being by other means, this evidence is important, and confirms' practitioners experiences of the transformations that learning can produce in people's lives...|$|R
