Based on the numbers of <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal</b> counted wintering in South Korea, the global population {{is estimated to be}} around 1.07 million individual adults around 2010, a major increase from the tens of thousands counted in the 1980s and few hundreds of thousands in the 2000s.|$|E
5000|$|The first formal {{description}} of the <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal</b> was by the German naturalist Johann Gottlieb Georgi in 1775 under the binomial name Anas formosa. A molecular phylogentic study published in 2009 found that the genus Anas as then defined was non-monophyletic. [...] Based on this analysis the genus was split into four proposed genera with the <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal</b> placed in the resurrected genus Sibirionetta that had been introduced by the German zoologist Hans von Boetticher in 1929. The name Sibirionetta {{is derived from the}} Latin sibiricus for Siberia and the Ancient Greek nētta for a duck. The specific epithet formosa is from the Latin formosus for [...] "beautiful".|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the genus}} Anas, as {{traditionally}} defined, is not monophyletic; several South American species {{belong to a}} distinct clade which would include the Tachyeres steamer-ducks. Other species, such as the <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal,</b> should also be considered distinct.|$|E
40|$|In January 2014, an {{outbreak}} of infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H 5 N 8) virus began on a duck farm in South Korea and spread to other poultry farms nearby. During this outbreak, many sick or dead wild birds were found around habitats frequented by migratory birds. To determine the causes of death, we examined 771 wild bird carcasses and identified HPAI A(H 5 N 8) virus in 167. Gross and histologic lesions were observed in pancreas, lung, brain, and kidney of <b>Baikal</b> <b>teals,</b> bean geese, and whooper swans but not mallard ducks. Such lesions are consistent with lethal HPAI A(H 5 N 8) virus infection. However, some HPAI-positive birds had died of gunshot wounds, peritonitis, or agrochemical poisoning rather than virus infection. These findings suggest that susceptibility to HPAI A(H 5 N 8) virus varies among species of migratory birds and that asymptomatic migratory birds could be carriers of this virus...|$|R

Totally throughout the period, specific antibodies to the viruses were detected by neutralization test in wild birds (7. 3 %, WN; 8. 0 %, Geta; 0. 7 % Batai; 2. 8 %, Alpine hare (Lepus timidus); by hemagglutination-inhibition test in cattle (11. 4 % WN; 5. 9 %, JE; j 3. 0 %, TBE; 11. 6 %, Geta), horses (6. 1, 6. 8, 0, and 25. 3 %, respectively), and pigs (5. 4, 1. 5, 0, and 5. 9 %, respectively) by enzyme immunoassay (IgG) in human beings (0. 8, 0. 5, 6. 8, and 3. 2 %, respectively. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to reveal RNA of the NP segment of influenza A virus in 57. 9 and 65 % of the cloacal swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; and the HA-segment of subtype HH was not detected in 2005. HA/H 5 RNA was recorded in 5. 5 and 6. 7 % of the swabs from wild and domestic birds, respectively; 6 % of the specimens from domestic birds were M-segment positive in 2006. RNA of influenza A virus NA/H 7 and RNA was not detected throughout the years. In 2004, the cloacal swabs 8 isolated influenza A strains: two H 3 N 8 and two H 4 N 8 strains from European teals (Anas crecca), two (H 3 N 8 and H 6 N 2) strains from <b>Baikal</b> <b>teals</b> (A. formosa), one (H 10 N 4) strain from shovelers (A. clypeata), and one (H 4 N 8) from garganeys (A. querquedula).

There are about 628 bird species in Bangladesh, of which 244 are Migratory. About 100 species of migratory birds regularly or occasionally visit the country. Considering the present threats to waterbird conservation in the country, 31 migratory waterbird species are of high priority for future action for conservation. 14 of these species are threatened.The wetlands are home to about 70 species of resident waterbirds including ducks, grebe, cormorants, bitterns, herons, egrets, storks, rails, jacanas, finfoot, waders, gulls, turns and skimmers. Eleven species of resident waterbirds are identified as threatened. The important threatened species are masked finfoot, Indian skimmer, black-headed ibis, greater adjutant, lesser adjutant, <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal,</b> Baer's pochard, ferruginous pochard, wood snipe, Nordmann's greenshank and spoon-billed sandpiper. [...] The wetlands of Bangladesh are being degraded rapidly due to population pressure, withdrawal of water for irrigation, destruction of swamp forest and many other anthropogenic and natural causes. Large scale habitat conversion, unsustainable harvesting policies and lack of ecological considerations have led to the destruction of valuable wetland habitat for water birds and other associated biodiversity. Immediate action is required for restoring these habitats and conserving the water birds in Bangladesh.

Key words: Coprophagy, ducks, faeces, Whooper Swans. Coprophagy is rare in birds in comparison with other animals such as mammals and insects. Gallant (2004) reported that White-winged Crossbills Loxia leucoptera foraged on River Otter Lontra canadensis faeces, perhaps consuming fish bones or undigested fish present in the droppings. Faeces {{can be used as a}} source of carotenoids by birds; for instance, the brightly coloured yellow on the head of the Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus is obtained by ingesting carotenoid pigments from the excrement of ungulates (Negro et al. 2002).

40|$|The surface-feeding, dabbling, or {{similarly}} described ducks are a {{group of}} about thirty-six species of mostly freshwater ducks that occur throughout the world. Many of them are temperate or arctic-breeding species that nest on dry land near freshwater ponds, marshes, rivers, or similar rather shallow bodies of water. Associated with this breeding habitat are their adaptations for foraging by 2 ̆ 2 tipping-up 2 ̆ 2 rather than by diving for food, an ability to land and take off abruptly from small water areas or land, and a moderately good walking ability but reduced perching capabilities as compared with perching ducks. Also unlike perching ducks, iridescent coloration on the wing is limited to the secondary feathers, or in rare cases is lacking altogether. The surface-feeding ducks are among the most abundant and familiar of all North American ducks and include such popular sporting species as mallards, pintails, wigeons, and various teals. They range in size from less than a pound to more than three pounds and are among the most agile of waterfowl in flight, relying on maneuverability rather than unusual speed to elude danger. The number of North American breeding species is somewhat uncertain, but is at least nine. Additionally, the European wigeon very probably nests occasionally in continental North America, the <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal</b> is possibly a very rare nester, and the Bahama pintail breeds in the West Indies. Further, the 2 ̆ 2 Mexican duck 2 ̆ 2 is often considered to be a separate species from the common mallard, as are the populations called the Florida duck and mottled duck, so these might also be added, bringing the possible total to fourteen. Beyond these, the falcated duck is recognized by the A. O. D. (1957) as belonging on the list of North American birds although there is no evidence for breeding, and in recent years there have been several sight records for the garganey, as well as an occurrence of the Chinese spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) on Adak Island (Byrd et al., 1974). Some of the records of falcated duck, <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal,</b> and garganey may well have been the result of escapes from captivity, but it seems likely that others of them represent wild birds, and thus these species are included in this book. In most respects, the surface-feeding ducks closely resemble the perching ducks in their anatomy and biology, but differ from them in that they are nearly all ground-nesting species that are ill-adapted for perching. Although considerable diversity in bill shape exists among the surface-feeding ducks, most biologists now agree that recognition of a single genus (Anas) is most representative of the close relationships that exist among these species, rather than maintenance of the traditional separate genera for the shovelerlike ducks, the wig ons, and other subgroups. Similarly, it is quite clear that recognition of separate species of Old World and New World green-winged teals and species recognition for the endemic Mexican, Florida, and Gulf coast populations of mallards are not in keeping with the modem species concept of potentially interbreeding natural populations. Although such changes force some modifications of traditional vernacular names of these populations, these disadvantages seem minor compared to the distortions of natural relationships forced by the retention of traditional nomenclature...|$|E

40|$|The {{perching}} {{ducks and}} related gooselike forms are a {{diverse array of}} some fourteen species that are largely subtropical to tropical in occurrence. Although they vary in size from as little as {{about a half a}} pound in the 2 ̆ 2 pygmy geese 2 ̆ 2 (Nettapus) to more than twenty pounds in the spur-winged geese (Plectropterus), all possess some common features. *These include a tendency toward hole-nesting, especially in trees; sharp claws; associated perching abilities; and long tails that presumably increase braking effectiveness when landing in trees. Nearly all species exhibit extensive iridescent coloration in the body, especially on the upper wing surface; this coloration is often exhibited by females as well as males. As a result, this tribe includes some of the most beautifully arrayed species of the entire family, of which the North American wood duck is an excellent example, as is the closely related Asian mandarin duck (Aix galericulata). The wood duck is the only perching duck that is native to the United States or Canada, but inasmuch as Mexico must be regarded as a part of North America, the inclusion of the muscovy duck as a North American species is fully justified. Perching ducks, together with all of the following groups of waterfowl included in this book, are representatives of the large anatid subfamily Anatinae. Unlike the whistling ducks, swans, or true geese, species of this subfamily have a tarsal scale pattern that has vertically aligned scutes (scutellate condition) above the base of the middle toe, and the sexes are usually quite different in voice, plumage, and sexual behavior. These sexual differences {{can be attributed to the}} weaker and less permanent pair bonds characteristics of true ducks, with a renewal of pair bonds typically occurring each year. As a result, pair-forming behavior tends to be more complex and elaborate in these species, as a dual reflection of the greater and more frequent competition for mates and the need for safeguards in reducing or avoiding mixed pairings between species during the rather hurried pair-forming period. In these species, the males typically assume the initiative in pair-forming activities, and thus they are usually more colorful, more aggressive, and have the more elaborate pair-forming behavior patterns. On the other hand, the females retain a subdued, often concealing plumage pattern, associated with their assumption of most or all incubation and brood-rearing responsibilities. As a result, humans usually find it easy to recognize the distinctively plumaged males of most species, while the females of related species are often so similar that even experienced observers may find it difficult to identify them with certainty. Following the initiation of incubation, the males in this subfamily typically abandon the females and begin their postnuptial molt, during which they become flightless for a time and usually also acquire a more female-like body plumage. Thus, unlike the species in the subfamily Anserinae, typical ducks have two plumages, and thus two body molts, per year. In males this double molt is most apparent, since the 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumage attained following the postnuptial molt is usually less colorful and often quite female-like. Although in all the species which have so far been studied the female also has a comparable summer molt and plumage, in most cases this plumage is so similar to the winter plumage that separate descriptions are not necessary. In most cases the 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumage of males is held for only a few months, presumably to allow the male to regain the more brilliant plumage associated with pair formation as early as possible. In some cases, however, this 2 ̆ 2 nuptial 2 ̆ 2 plumage is not regained until well into winter (e. g., ruddy duck, <b>Baikal</b> <b>teal,</b> blue-winged teal), so that 2 ̆ 2 summer 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 winter 2 ̆ 2 plumages may be more or less recognizable. The situation is further complicated in the oldsquaw, which has a third partial molt in the fall (affecting both sexes but most apparent in the male) and which is restricted to the scapular region. Except in such special cases, the two major plumages of the male are referred to in the species accounts as 2 ̆ 2 nuptial 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 eclipse 2 ̆ 2 plumages, while the 2 ̆ 2 adult 2 ̆ 2 plumage of females refers to both of the comparable breeding and nonbreeding plumages. The 115 species of waterfowl that belong to the subfamily Anatinae are grouped into a number of tribes, most of which include one or more native North American species. The only major tribe of Anatinae that is not represented in this continent is the shelduck tribe Tadornini, which has representatives in both South America and Eurasia. It is true that there are some old records of Atlantic coast occurrences for the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and the common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna), as well as a few more recent sight records (Audubon Field Notes, 16 : 73; American Birds, 26 : 842; 27 : 41), but these are quite possibly the result of escapes from captivity...|$|E
