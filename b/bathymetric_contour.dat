High CO 2 efflux values were always measured nearby visible gas bubbling emanations and located above the deepest areas of the lake, south and northeast basins of the lake, where hot springs are thought to issue. Figure 8 (a) shows water temperature contour map for Katanuma lake together with <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour</b> lines. Even {{when there is a}} homogeneous distribution of temperature at the surface of the lake, some slight increase in temperature was observed at the southern most part of the lake. To estimate the total output of diffuse CO 2 released from Katanuma lake, we considered the contribution of each cell obtained after SGS and the average of the 200 simulations to estimate the total output with one standard deviation as the uncertainty. The result was 17 ± 0.6 td− 1 for diffuse CO 2. This value is smaller than the emission rates reported for other volcanic lakes (Pérez et al., 2011). However, in order to compare individual CO 2 emission of various volcanic lakes, {{it is important to consider}} the lake-type and the area. Figure 8 (b) shows water pH contour map for Katanuma lake together with <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour</b> lines. Most of the surface water showed an almost homogeneous acidic pH (∼ 2.0) distribution. Katanuma, as an acid lake with an area of 1.26 × 105 m 2, would have a normalized CO 2 emission of 136 t d− 1 km− 2, a value close to that from other acid volcanic lakes in the world (Pérez et al., 2011).|$|E

40|$|In its {{standard}} mode of operation, the multibeam echosounder Sea Beam produces high resolution <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour</b> charts of the seafloor surveyed. However, {{additional information about}} the nature of the seafloor can be extracted from the structure of the echo signals received by the system. Such signals have been recorded digitally over a variety of seafloor environments for which independent observations from bottom photographs or sidescan sonars were available. An attempt is made to relate the statistical properties of the bottom‐backscattered sound field to the independently observed geologicalcharacteristics of the seafloor surveyed. Acoustic boundary mapping over flat areas is achieved by following trend changes in the acoustic data both along and across track. Such changes in the acoustics are found to correlate with changes in bottom type or roughness structure. The overall energy level of a partial angular‐dependence function of backscattering appears to depend strongly on bottom type, whereas the shape of the function does not. Clues to the roughness structure of the bottom are obtained by relating the shape of the probability density function of normal‐incidence echo envelopes to the degree of coherence in the backscattered acoustic field...|$|E
40|$|We present two {{time series}} of bottom current and {{temperature}} collected 8 m above the seabed {{on either side}} of a large sediment drift located on the continental rise of the Pacific margin of the Antarctic Peninsula. The mean current speed is comparable (6. 2 cm s− 1 and 6. 1 cm s− 1 respectively), but the mean direction differs by about 121 °. The direction of mean flow follows the <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour,</b> and the maximum speed never exceeds 20 cm s− 1 (below the typical benthic storm threshold). The potential temperature is remarkably stable (0. 11 ± 0. 01 °C and 0. 13 ± 0. 02 °C at the two sites). The cross-covariance indicates a significant peak at 20. 2 days lag, slightly longer than the travel time of 18. 7 days calculated between the two stations following the isobaths (98. 4 km) and thus providing evidence for the topographic control on bottom water flow. The observed bottom water flow is consistent with deposition of Holocene hemipelagic sediments of the ‘drift maintenance’ stage.

Many species have been investigated by means of habitat modeling techniques mainly to address effective management and protection policies and cetaceans {{play an important role in}} this context. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) has been investigated with habitat modeling techniques since 1997. The objectives of this work were to predict the distribution of bottlenose dolphin in a coastal area through the use of static morphological features and to compare the prediction performances of three different modeling techniques: Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Random Forest (RF). Four static variables were tested: depth, bottom slope, distance from 100 m <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour</b> and distance from coast.

40|$|One month OBS array {{observation}} {{was carried}} out in the Japan Trench region using seven pop-up OBS's. Preliminary determination of hypocenters was made. The hypocenter distribution shows strong seismic activities in the outer slope region. There was a linear trend of epicenter distribution, roughly along the 6, 000 m <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour.</b> The focal depths of these earthquakes were shallow, less than 10 km. The graben-like structure in this region might have a strong correlation with this seismic activity. Some earthquakes, which form a cluster, occurred near the trench axis. There was another broad distribution of epicenters in the north of 40 °N. In the inner slope region a swarm activity occurred which included four M=A events. The focal depths of them were shallow. Some distinct features on wave forms of OBS records are presented. One of the most significant features is the predominancy of low frequency component for some earthquakes, which occurred in the outer slope region and were recorded at the stations on the outer slope. There may be some similarities between the low frequency earthquakes and the "slow earthquakes", if the low frequency was generated by the source itself. Another new feature is the appearance of S-S multiple reflections which occurred within the sediment layer under the station. 7 台の浮上式海底地震計を用いて 1981 年 6 月 10 日から 7 月 13 日まで,日本海溝を横断する約 1 ヵ月のアレー観測を行った. 震源決定を行い以下のことがわかった. 海溝軸外側の太平洋側斜面下に活発な地震活動があった. これらのうちのある地震群は, 6, 000 mの等水深線にそってほぼ帯状に分布し,震源の深さは 10 km以浅と浅かった. この地域は地溝状の構造が有り,地震活動との強い相関が推定される. 他の,海溝軸外側の活動は,海溝軸付近の塊状分布, 40 °N以北の幅広い分布,が存在した. 海溝軸内側斜面上部には, 4 個のM≧ 4 の地震を含む浅い群発活動が起った. 海底地震計の記録波形に,いくつかの特徴が見られ,これらのうちいくつかは新しい結果であった. もっとも重要な新しい特徴は,海溝軸外側斜面に起った地震のうちいくつかは外側斜面上の観測点で低周波に富んだ波形を示した,ことである. この低周波地震は,もしそれが震源自身で生成したのであれば,"低速地震"とこの地震の間にある類似性が有るであろう.

We analyze logging-while-drilling resistivity images and infer that gas hydrate accumulated in situ in two modes: filling fractures and saturating permeable beds. High-angle hydrate-filled fractures are the most common mode for gas hydrate occurrence at this site, with most of these fractures dipping at angles of more than 40 ° and occurring between 220 and 300 m below seafloor. These fractures all strike approximately N–S, which agrees with the 165 °SE– 345 °NW maximum horizontal stress direction determined from borehole breakouts and which aligns with local <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contours.</b> In one interval of hydrate-filled fractures, porosity increases with increasing hydrate saturation. We suggest that high pore pressure may have dilated sediments during fracture formation, causing this increase in porosity. Furthermore, the formation of gas hydrate may have heaved fractures apart, also increasing the formation porosity in this interval...|$|R
40|$|Cross shelf-break {{exchange}} {{is limited by}} the tendency of geostrophic flow to follow <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contours,</b> not cross them. However, small scale topography, such as canyons, can reduce the local lengthscale of the flow and increase the local Rossby number. These higher Rossby numbers mean the flow is no longer purely geostrophic and significant cross-isobath flow can occur. This cross-isobath flow includes both upwelling and downwelling due to wind-driven shelf currents and the strong cascading flows of dense shelf-water into the ocean. Tidal currents usually run primarily parallel to the shelf-break topography. Canyons cut across these flows and thus are often regions of generation of strong baroclinic tides and internal waves. Canyons can also focus internal waves. Both processes lead to greatly elevated levels of mixing. Thus, through both advection and mixing processes, canyons can enhance Deep Ocean Shelf Exchange. Here we review the state of the science describing the dynamics of the flows and suggest further areas of research, particularly into quantifying fluxes of nutrients and carbon as well as heat and salt through canyons...|$|R
40|$|The deep-sea (200 - 1000 m) {{seafloor}} off {{the southeastern}} U.

The dominant structure-forming scleractinian corals are Lophelia pertusa and Enallopsammia profunda; other structure-forming taxa include stylasterid corals, gorgonians, black corals, and sponges. This biota is associated with hard-bottom seafloor of variable high-relief topography which can be remotely identified from bathymetric data. NOAA <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour</b> maps and digital elevation models were used to identify and delineate the areal extent of potential DSCE habitat in the region from northeastern Florida through the Straits of Florida. These were ground-truthed with 241 dives with submersibles and remotely operated vehicles which confirmed deep-sea coral habitat. We estimate a total of 39, 910 km 2 of DSCE habitat in this region. By comparison, the estimated areal extent of shallow-water coral habitat for all U. S. waters is 36, 813 km 2. Bottom trawling remains the greatest threat to DSCEs worldwide, and as a result NOAA has established five deep-water Coral Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (CHAPCs), encompassing 62, 714 km 2 from North Carolina to south Florida, which will protect much of the known deep-sea coral habitat in this region.

30|$|The {{study area}} lies within the Niger Delta; its geology is {{therefore}} {{typical of the}} Niger Delta Basin. The area forms part of a geological sequence of the Quaternary and Tertiary formations of the Niger Delta, consisting mainly of three main geologic formations: The Benin Formation, Agbada Formation, and Akata Formation (Sundararaman et al. 2002). It is situated in the Gulf of Guinea and extends throughout the Niger Delta Province, as defined by Klett et al. (1997). From the Eocene to the present, the delta has prograded southwestward, forming depobelts that represent the most active portion of the delta at each stage of its development (Doust and Omatsola 1990). These depobelts form {{one of the largest}} regressive deltas in the world with an area of some 300, 000  km 2 (Kulke 1995), a sediment volume of 500, 000  km 3 (Hospers 1965) and a sediment thickness of over 10  km in the basin depocenter (Kaplan et al. 1994). There are the 2 -km sediment thickness contours or 4000 -m <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour,</b> in areas where sediment thickness is > 2  km, to the south and southwest (Michele et al. 1999).

Amajor (1991) has shown that they are an admixture of fluvial/tidal channel, tidal flats, and mangrove swamp deposits.

Time-series observations of hydrographic variables and currents within {{the interior of the}} development (Palm Jumeirah Lagoon) during 30 d in April–May 2008 were utilized to examine current flow, tide variability, water budget, vertical mixing, and turnover time within this megastructure. Currents within Palm Jumeirah Lagoon varied between stations; however, similar water temperatures and salinities were apparent throughout all the stations. Palm Jumeirah Lagoon tides were mixed and mainly semidiurnal, with spring and neap tidal ranges measuring 116 and 56 cm, respectively, and no difference in amplitude or phase throughout Palm Jumeirah Lagoon. There were substantial differences in water discharge between the east and west entrances, with high discharge on average exiting the eastern entrance and low discharge exiting the western entrance. These results indicate that the eastern and western halves of Palm Jumeirah Lagoon are flushed unequally and show differences in residence times (1. 2 and 42 d, respectively), due to differences in tidal currents, wind influence, and variability of the <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contour.</b> Previous numerical modeling studies of water residence time within Palm Jumeirah Lagoon did not capture this difference, which could be associated with the exclusion of bathymetric variability in the previous modeling.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the qualitative circulation {{patterns of the}} ''upper'' and ''deeper'' layers in the Cretan Sea and its environs in late winter 1994. The qualitative aspects of the flow field were determined primarily by the distribution of salinity on appropriate neutral surfaces and were supported by dynamic inferences. Water circulation presented a complex pattern, characterized by various sub-basin and mesoscale cylonic and anticyclonic gyres and smaller-scale eddies. An interesting finding was {{the presence of an}} eastward current meandering north of Crete, in the South Aegean Sea. Another interesting finding was the spreading in the opposite direction - westward - of the high-salinity Cretan Deep Water. The latter appeared to follow broadly the bottom <b>bathymetric</b> <b>contours</b> in its westward spreading from the presumed area of its formation in the deepest part of the Cretan Sea, where it also attained maximum thickness. The water exchanges between the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean Sea were influenced by their bottom topography and were also affected by the existence of permanent and/or recurrent circulation features and their variability...|$|R
