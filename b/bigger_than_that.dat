Scotland performed better than the UK average in securing new Foreign Direct Investment in 2012–13 (measured by the number of projects), although not as well as Wales or Northern Ireland. GDP growth during 2013 was lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, although this was partly due to an industrial dispute at the Grangemouth Refinery.|$|E

A continuous circulating bi-cable aerial ropeway system, where the track cable acts as a rail {{in the sky and}} the haul cable pulls the cabins, allows long spans between towers. It is the first of its type to be installed in Hong Kong. Martin Leitner, chief sales officer of Leitner, explained that the cable car system used in Hong Kong is much heavier and <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> used in Austria.

Maisemore was sold by British Waterways some years ago, and they decided to dispose of Llanthony in 2007. The Canal Trust used a legacy to purchase the site, which includes two cottages, some land, and a small section of the River Severn as well as Llanthony lock. The lock is <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> at Maisemore, and access to the entrance lock at Over is easier because boats are travelling against the flow of the river as they approach it.|$|E

Its successors such as ExxonMobil or Chevron are still among the companies with the largest income worldwide. By 1882, his top aide was John Dustin Archbold. After 1896, Rockefeller disengaged from business to concentrate on his philanthropy, leaving Archbold in control. Other notable Standard Oil principals include Henry Flagler, developer of the Florida East Coast Railway and resort cities, and Henry H. Rogers, who built the Virginian Railway.|$|E

As with the Japanese release, the North American version was delayed {{so it would}} be a high-quality game in keeping with other Persona titles. In Europe and Australia, the game was published by Deep Silver. Initially planned for a Western release on February 14, 2017, the game was pushed back to April 4; the stated reason was that Atlus wanted the game to be at its highest possible quality. As with previous Persona titles, the localization is being handled by Atlus USA, supervised by series localization project leader Yu Namba. According to Namba, the team began with a [...] "blank slate" [...] when choosing the English voice cast, as it was a new setting to earlier Persona titles. Localizing Persona 5 was described by Namba as a massive project with the largest staff yet dedicated to the series. Namba, as project lead, made the final call on issues brought up by the team during the localization process. The localized script was estimated as being 50% <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of Persona 4 Golden. Both Persona 3 and Persona 4 had included the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker to aid in marketing, but for Persona 5 the moniker was not used. While the English voice track was included on the game disc, the Japanese voices were made available as permanently free DLC. The DLC for earlier Shin Megami Tensei titles, Catherine, Shin Megami Tensei IV, and the Raidou Kuzunoha games is also set for release.|$|E
