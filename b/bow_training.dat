60|$|There were, then, many exclamations of astonishment among them, when Ned and Tom {{issued from}} their hut {{in the morning}} to join the hunting party, {{carrying}} their new weapons. The bows were, of course, unstrung; and Ned handed his to the chief, who viewed it with great curiosity. It was passed from hand to hand, and then returned to the chief. One or two of the Indians said something, and the chief tried its strength. He shook his head. Ned signed to him to string it, but the chief tried in vain, as did several of the strongest of the Indians. Indeed, no man, however powerful, could string an old English <b>bow,</b> unless <b>trained</b> to its use.|$|R

The original station building stood on Baker Street and served the tube platforms with lifts, but these were supplemented with escalators in 1914, linking the Metropolitan line and the Bakerloo line platforms by a new concourse excavated under the Metropolitan line.|$|R
50|$|The {{pedagogy}} {{and training}} for the double bass varies widely by genre and country. Classical double bass {{has a history of}} pedagogy dating back several centuries, including teaching manuals, studies, and progressive exercises that help students to develop the endurance and accuracy of the left hand, and control for the <b>bowing</b> hand. Classical <b>training</b> methods vary by country: many of the major European countries are associated with specific methods (e.g., the Edouard Nanny method in France or the Franz Simandl method in Germany). In classical training, the majority of the instruction for the right hand focuses on the production of bowing tone; little time is spent studying the varieties of pizzicato tone.|$|R

5000|$|The tall {{shrub rose}} {{or a small}} climber grows upright and bushy, {{reaching}} 100 to 365 cm (39" [...] to 12) height and about 1.8 m width. It has very sturdy, dense, dark green foliage with large, semi-glossy leaves, and almost no prickles. It is winter hardy (USDA zone 5b through 9b), heat and rain tolerant, and very disease resistant, but needs a good nutrient supply and enough sun. In half shade the cultivar is less floriferous. It can be grown as solitary shrub or in groups, in containers or as standard rose to 90 cm (3 ft) high, and is very well suited for cut flowers. Due to its <b>bowing</b> flower heads, <b>training</b> the rose as a small climber along a fence or other supports is recommended.|$|R

40|$|Plants {{are one of}} one of most {{valuable}} natural resources. There would be no life on earth without plants. They unlike humans and animals manufacture their own food by photosynthesis. In every food chain, the plants occupy the first position and lead the chain as source of food. Environment and climate are largely interlinked with plants. Rainfall, humidity and temperature are influenced by presence of plants. Cutting down plants also imbalance the environment which will indirectly affect human life. Even the economic importance of plants is also quite large to mankind. Plants are great contributors of economy. Many countries rely on agriculture {{as one of the}} main source of revenue. Other benefits of plants are significant applications in different fields. Medical and agricultural applications are just some instances of plants application. Plant recognition can be done by using unique characteristic parts of plants. The used part is leaf. Shapes of leaves are useful to do plant recognition and find the species. Bag of words (BoW) and support vector machine (SVM) methods are applied to recognize and identify plants species. Visual contents of images are used and four steps are performed: (i) image preprocessing, (ii) <b>BoW,</b> (iii) <b>train,</b> (v) test. Three combined methods are used on Flavia dataset. The proposed approach is done by Speed-up robust features (SURF) method and two combined method, HARRIS-SURF and features from accelerated segment test-SURF (FAST-SURF). The accuracy of SURF method is higher than other applied methods. It is 92. 28395 %. In addition to visional comparison, some quantitative results are measured and compared...|$|R
