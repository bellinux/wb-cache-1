He tries to kill Quatermass with a gun, but the recoil sends him floating helplessly off into space. Quatermass returns to the rocket and jettisons the nuclear motor, then flies the rocket <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>earth</b> as the motor blows up the asteroid, killing the remaining ammonids and relinquishing control over Dillon and all the 'marked' humans, returning mankind to its former freedom.|$|E

As Enterprise undergoes repairs and refitting, Archer is reunited with a former girlfriend, Captain Erika Hernandez, who has been appointed to Starfleet's second Warp 5 starship, Columbia (NX-02). Archer is debriefed by Admiral Maxwell Forrest and Ambassador Soval. After reacting in anger when Soval asks pointed questions about , he is ordered by Forrest to take some relaxation leave.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, {{the four}} are {{once more the}} only beings on the ship. Rimmer is again a hologram, Holly is offline, and Lister is {{mourning}} Kochanski, lost to him out of an airlock some time previously. A chance to get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> through a dimension warp presents itself; {{although it is not}} quite what it appears to be, it gives Lister new hope when he learns that Kochanski is still alive after all.|$|E
5|$|The MSS was {{manufactured}} by Hughes Aircraft Company. The sensor {{was considered an}} experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists reviewed the data that was beamed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b> After the data was reviewed, the MSS was considered the primary sensor. The MSS was a four-channel scanner that obtained radiometric images of Earth.|$|E

5|$|The tenth series sees Lister still {{travelling}} with Rimmer, Kryten and Cat on Red Dwarf, {{in hopes}} of eventually locating Kochanski above getting <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b> Neither the tenth nor eleventh series have confirmed whether the Rimmer onboard ship {{is the one who}} originally left, the revived version, or a third incarnation entirely; however, episodes have alluded to him remembering events from both previous incarnations' lives.|$|E
5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E
5|$|MRO {{contains}} {{a host of}} scientific instruments such as cameras, spectrometers, and radar, which are {{used to analyze the}} landforms, stratigraphy, minerals, and ice of Mars. It paves the way for future spacecraft by monitoring Mars' daily weather and surface conditions, studying potential landing sites, and hosting a new telecommunications system. MRO's telecommunications system will transfer more data <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> than all previous interplanetary missions combined, and MRO will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions.|$|E

5|$|The Axioms {{passengers}} {{have become}} obese and feeble due to microgravity and reliance on an automated lifestyle, including the ship's current captain, McCrea, who leaves the ship {{under the control}} of the robotic autopilot, AUTO. EVE is taken to the bridge, with WALL-E tagging along. McCrea is unprepared for a positive probe response, but learns that placing EVE's plant in the ship's Holo-Detector for verification will trigger a hyperjump <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> so humanity can recolonize it. However, AUTO orders his robotic assistant GO-4 to steal the plant to prevent this from happening.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) {{program was}} {{initiated}} in 2010 {{with the purpose}} of creating American commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b> It is hoped that these vehicles could also transport non-NASA customers to private space stations such those planned by Bigelow Aerospace. Like COTS, CCDev is also a fixed price milestone-based developmental program that requires some private investment.|$|E
5|$|The G {{mission was}} {{achieved}} on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at the Sea of Tranquility at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969. They spent {{a total of}} 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2 hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft, walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated scientific instruments, while continuously sending black-and-white television <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b> The astronauts returned safely on July 24.|$|E

5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} {{to perform a}} successful lunar soft landing was Luna 9 and the first unstaffed vehicle to orbit the Moon was Luna 10, both in 1966. Rock and soil samples were brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> by three Luna sample return missions (Luna 16 in 1970, Luna 20 in 1972, and Luna 24 in 1976), which returned 0.3kg total.

5|$|ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a {{platform}} video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions {{and published by}} Sega in 1993 for the Sega Genesis. The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet.
