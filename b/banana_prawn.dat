40|$|During October to December 1997, we trawled estuarine {{habitats}} in the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf (JBG) {{to determine}} the distribution of juvenile red-legged <b>banana</b> <b>prawns,</b> Penaeus indicus (H. Milne Edwards, 1837) and white <b>banana</b> <b>prawns,</b> Penaeus merguiensis (de Man, 1888). We made 229 beam-trawls at 185 sites, mostly over a 100 -m path (3 -min duration). A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver was used to verify our location. During October to December 1998, we intensively resampled three of the rivers that were sampled in 1997 to confirm the gulf-wide distribution of P. indicus and P. merguiensis and to investigate the microhabitat use of P. indicus. We chose previously sampled and new sites in Forsyth Creek (eastern JBG), the Lyne River (Cambridge Gulf), and the Berkeley River (western JBG). We made 249 trawls at 21 sites, mostly over 100 m. Juvenile <b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> were abundant in eastern JBG, Cambridge Gulf and western JBG. They were not abundant in southern JBG, although fewer trawls were made there, due to its inaccessibility. In eastern JBG and Cambridge Gulf, over 96 % and 73 % (respectively) of juvenile <b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> were P. indicus and they were more abundant there than in the western JBG. Conversely, in the western JBG over 93 % of the juvenile <b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> were P. merguiensis and they were more abundant than in the eastern JBG and Cambridge Gulf. The Lyne River in the northwestern Cambridge Gulf {{seems to be the}} transition zone; both P. indicus and P. merguiensis are equally abundant. P. indicus are most abundant on the mangrove-lined muddy banks of waterways within mangrove forests, similar habitats to P. merguiensis. Within these habitats, they were most abundant in gutters and small creeks, rather than rivers and large creeks. Few P. indicus or P. merguiensis were caught in 100 m 2 trawls undertaken midriver (on the channel bottom and on emergent banks), although these habitats may be only 100 m from the mangrove-lined habitats. In all creek and river habitats, both species are most catchable at low tide (irrespective of daylight or darkness) when they move out of the mangrove forests and accumulate in the remnant water bodies. The offshore fishery for P. indicus is in northwestern JBG in waters 50 - 80 m deep, about 300 and 200 km, respectively, from where juveniles are abundant in their extensive inshore habitats in east JBG and in Cambridge Gulf, demonstrating a geographical separation of the juvenile and adult phases. Postlarval P. indicus, spawned offshore, must use tides and currents to travel south and east to reach nursery habitats. Emigrant subadults must migrate north and west, across relatively shallow inshore sand substrates (30 - 40 m deep) to reach their offshore habitats...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{mortality}} of marine invertebrates is often {{very high in}} the early life history stages and decreases in later stages. The possible size-dependent {{mortality of}} juvenile <b>banana</b> <b>prawns,</b> P. merguiensis (2 - 15 mm carapace length) in the Gulf of Carpentaria was investigated. The analysis {{was based on the}} data collected at 2 -weekly intervals by beam trawls at four sites over a period of six years (between September 1986 and March 1992). It was assumed that mortality was a parametric function of size, rather than a constant. Another complication in estimating mortality for juvenile <b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> is that a significant proportion of the population emigrates from the study area each year. This effect was accounted for by incorporating the size-frequency pattern of the emigrants in the analysis. Both the extra parameter in the model required to describe the size dependence of mortality, and that used to account for emigration were found to be significantly different from zero, and the instantaneous mortality rate declined from 0. 89 week(- 1) for 2 mm prawns to 0. 02 week(- 1) for 15 mm prawns...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess their}} utility for {{profitable}} wastewater bioremediation, <b>banana</b> <b>prawns,</b> Penaeus (Fenneropenaeus) merguiensis (de Man), were stocked at low densities (1 – 5 m- 2) and grown without supplemental feeding in five commercial-prawn-farm settlement ponds (0. 3 to 6. 0 ha). The prawns free-ranged in the variously designed ponds for 160 to 212 days after stocking as PL 15. Survival estimates ranged from 12 % to 60 % with production of 50 – 528 kg ha- 1. Over 1150 kg of marketable product {{was produced in}} the study. Exceptional growth was monitored at one farm where prawns reached an average size of 17 g in 80 days. Nutrients in water flowing into (8 - 40 ML d- 1) {{and out of the}} settlement pond at that farm were assessed twice weekly along with routine water quality measurements. Only small differences in water qualities were detected between waters running into and out of this settlement pond. Total nitrogen levels gradually increased from 1 - 1. 5 mg L- 1 early in the season to over 3 mg L- 1 {{towards the end of the}} season. Total phosphorus levels similarly rose from 0. 1 - 0. 2 mg L- 1 to 0. 3 - 0. 4 mg L- 1 in the middle of the season, but fell to 0. 2 – 0. 3 mg L- 1 towards the end when approximately 12, 000 prawns were harvested with a total weight of 175 kg. No significant differences (P > 0. 05) were detected in the overall acceptability of prawns harvested from each of the 5 settlement ponds in small-scale consumer sensory analyses. The prawns from settlement ponds were rated similarly to <b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> grown with commercial diets at two other establishments.

Histological examination revealed breakdown of gut and abdominal muscle tissue in some moribund specimens. We selectively isolated Vibrio spp., which are known prawn pathogens, from healthy and Chalky back specimens.

In all, 32 isolates were recovered and identified as Vibrio harveyi, V. owensii, V. sinaloensis-like, V. campbellii, V. shilonii, Vibrio sp. and Photobacterium damselae using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. All V. harveyi carried VGs coding for haemolysin, toxR and flagella; formed biofilm; and adhered to both cell lines. This was similar to the V. sinaloensis-like strains that were only isolated from Chalky back specimens. Our data suggest that Vibrio spp. {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of Chalky back.

Gel electrophoresis, with the enzyme malate dehydrogenase, clearly separated into species {{both large and small}} prawns. Four morphological characters were measured from juvenile prawns (identified using electrophoresis) : three of these provided reliable separation into species. The mean ratio of the distance from the anterior-most dorsal rostral tooth (first tooth) to the tip of the rostrum (L 1) : to the distance between this tooth and the second tooth (L 1, 2) was higher for P. indicus (3. 16) than P. merguiensis (1. 56). All juvenile P. indicus had the first tooth posterior to the antennular peduncle, while it was anterior for all P. merguiensis. More than 90 % of P. indicus had six rostral teeth behind the eye, while over 90 % of P. merguiensis had five teeth behind the eye. Damage to the rostrum prevented measurements of the position of the first tooth in 20 to 30 % of juvenile prawns.

5000|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted theory of why eye ablation reduces this inhibition {{is that a}} gonad inhibitory hormone (GIH) is produced in the neurosecretory complexes in the eyestalk. This hormone occurs in nature in the non-breeding season and is absent or present only in low concentrations during the breeding season. The reluctance of most shrimp to routinely develop mature ovaries in captivity {{is a function of}} elevated levels of GIH, and eyestalk ablation lowers the high haemolymph titer of GIH. The effect of eyestalk ablation is not on a single hormone such as GIH, but rather affects several physiological processes. Besides the GIH evidence, another hypothesis suggests that eyestalk ablation also reduces light intensity and thereby induces ovarian maturation. In the <b>banana</b> <b>prawn</b> (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, syn. Penaeus merguiensis), dim light favours ovarian maturation and spawning.

40|$|Prawn farming {{effluent}} nitrogen is {{a potential}} polluter of coastal waterways. Consequently, environmental regulators are placing increasingly stringent discharge limitations on farmers, fuelling research into the development of cost-effective effluent treatment options. One such treatment option involves the cultivation of secondary, often detritivorous, crops (fish, prawns) {{in the presence of}} vertically deployed artificial substrates. Secondary crops could valuably assimilate effluent nutrients while the artificial substrate should improve bacterial effluent remediation processes, such as denitrification and nitrogen assimilation. Artificial substrates may also improve water quality and detritivore growth in systems containing detritivores. Furthermore, detritivorous secondary crops may improve substrate associated nutrient removal processes. The combination of substrates and secondary crops therefore, may enhance nutrient removal relative to their singular effects. The investigations outlined in this thesis have provided new knowledge regarding the cultivation of secondary crops in prawn farm effluent treatment systems containing artificial substrates. Detritivorous mullet assimilated effluent nutrients, and, artificial substrates improved both water quality and fish growth. At optimised C:N ratios, <b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> were found to stimulate nitrogen assimilation and mullet enhanced substrate biofilm denitrification.

Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004.

40|$|The {{paradigm}} that mangroves {{are critical}} for sustaining production in coastal fisheries is widely accepted, but empirical evidence has been tenuous. This study showed that links between mangrove extent and coastal fisheries production could be detected for some species at a broad regional scale (1000 s of kilometres) {{on the east coast}} of Queensland, Australia. The relationships between catch-per-unit-effort for different commercially caught species in four fisheries (trawl, line, net and pot fisheries) and mangrove characteristics, estimated from Landsat images were examined using multiple regression analyses. The species were categorised into three groups based on information on their life history characteristics, namely mangrove-related species (<b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> Penaeus merguiensis, mud crabs Scylla serrata and barramundi Lates calcarifer), estuarine species (tiger prawns Penaeus esculentus and Penaeus semisulcatus, blue swimmer crabs Portunus pelagicus and blue threadfin Eleutheronema tetradactylum) and offshore species (coral trout Plectropomus spp.). For the mangrove-related species, mangrove characteristics such as area and perimeter accounted for most of the variation in the model; for the non-mangrove estuarine species, latitude was the dominant parameter but some mangrove characteristics (e. g. mangrove perimeter) also made significant contributions to the models. In contrast, for the offshore species, latitude was the dominant variable, with no contribution from mangrove characteristics. This study also identified that finer scale spatial data for the fisheries, to enable catch information to be attributed to a particular catchment, would help to improve our understanding of relationships between mangroves and fisheries production.

40|$|Recently {{fisheries}} management in Australia {{has shifted to}} emphasise management of resources within the principles of ecologically sustainable development. This has resulted in management to sustain fish stocks, maximise economic efficiency when harvesting those stocks, and a trend towards granting property rights to the fishers. To achieve the goal of management to sustain fish stocks, {{a major focus of}} fisheries agencies has been to preserve the critical habitats upon which the long-term productivity of the fisheries depends. For penaeid prawns this has meant that seagrass (tiger <b>prawns),</b> and mangroves (<b>banana</b> <b>prawns)</b> have achieved special status to fishers, fisheries biologists, managers and legislators. Is this justified? Is this the appropriate management strategy to preserve critical fisheries habitat? We examine these questions using two case studies: cyclones, seagrasses and tiger prawns in the Gulf of Carpentaria and king prawns in the Peel-Harvey estuarine system in Western Australia.

It is not enough to just map, monitor and maintain subsets of these systems based on coarse distribution and abundance studies of prawn populations. With increasing pressure on the coastal zone from competing interest groups, fisheries managers need a greater understanding of the factors which determine the carrying capacity of nursery habitats for juvenile penaeid prawns, and the factors which limit the distribution of key fisheries habitats within coastal ecosystems.

40|$|Offshore {{catches of}} <b>banana</b> <b>prawns,</b> Penaeus merguiensis, are {{correlated}} with the extent of mangrove forests. However, recent evaluation has questioned whether the apparent relationship between juvenile penaeids and mangroves reflects specific utilisation of mangroves or just the use of shallow, organically rich, muddy habitats. We investigated this by focussing on juvenile P. merguiensis within 30 mangrove estuaries spanning 650 km of the coast of north-eastern Australia. We investigated a range of hierarchically clustered spatial scales and within-estuary spatial resolutions, as well as variables representing a variety of estuary structural factors, anthropogenic impacts, and particular hypotheses {{about the ways in}} which mangroves could influence P. merguiensis catch per unit effort (CPUE). Estuary to estuary differences, rather than climatic zone or the proximity of other estuaries, was the major large scale spatial influence on CPUE. At the among-estuaries scale mangrove extent appeared to influence CPUE but was extensively confounded with the effects of two non-mangrove variables; intertidal extent and substrate type. The fact that 3 alternative measures of connectivity with mangrove forests were not influential, points to the importance of the non-mangrove variables rather than mangrove extent. At the within-estuary scale, P. merguiensis CPUE was {{correlated with the}} extent of shallow water but not with mangrove variables. The spatial and temporal extent of sampling support a strong conclusion that factors associated with mangroves alone do not drive abundances of juvenile prawns. Nevertheless, despite being the dominant habitat, mangroves are only one of a mosaic of interacting habitats occurring in the tropical estuaries inhabited by juvenile penaeids (Sheaves, 2009), so causal relationships are complex and difficult to define unambiguously.

40|$|Most {{systemic}} viral {{infections in}} penaeid prawns {{are associated with}} the formation of lymphoid organ spheroid (LOS) cells in the lymphoid organ (LO). The development of spheroids is suggested to be a major defence mechanism against viral infection in penaeids. Spheroids were observed in a broodstock population of <b>banana</b> <b>prawns</b> (Penaeus merguiensis), while these changes were not identified in the wild population. This opportunity was taken to see how well suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) would resolve a histological change with no known aetiology. A total of 316 sequenced clones were clustered into 141 contigs and 51. 6 % of the clones shared significant similarities to known peptide or nucleotide sequences in the NCBI GenBank database. These transcripts were assigned into 8 categories, including immune related genes (2. 5 %), synthesis, processing and regulation-related proteins (4. 4 %), ribosomal proteins (6. 3 %), proteases and inhibitors (7. 0 %), energy and metabolism factors (7. 3 %), structural and cytoskeletal related proteins (10. 1 %) and other sequences (13. 9 %). Many sequenced clones (48. 4 %) from the libraries had no significant similarity to amino acids/nucleotides in the public database revealing the ability of this method in disclosing new differentially expressed genes in the lymphoid organ of prawns. Despite the detection of differential gene expression in the SHH libraries, unfortunately there were no viral genomes identified which were associated with spheroid formation within the LO of penaeids. However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification with HPV 140 F and HPV 140 R primers suggested that the development of spheroid cells in the lymphoid organ of the broodstock population most likely due to Penaeus merguiensis hepandensovirus (PmeDV) which maybe the senior synonym of lymphoidal parvovirus (LPV) ...|$|R

Review {{the literature and}} data (i. e., economic, biological and logbook) relevant to the Moreton Bay trawl fishery. 2. 	Identify and prioritise management objectives for the Moreton Bay trawl fishery, as identified by the trawl fishers. 3. 	Undertake an economic analysis of Moreton Bay trawl fishery. 4. 	Quantify long-term changes to fishing power for the Moreton Bay trawl fishery. 5. 	Assess priority harvest strategies identified in 2 (above). Present results to, and discuss results with, Moreton Bay Seafood Industry Association (MBSIA), fishers and Fisheries Queensland. Note: Additional, specific objectives for 2 (above) were developed by fishers and the MBSIA after commencement of the project. These are presented in detail in section 5 (below). The project was an initiative of the MBSIA, primarily in response to falling profitability in the Moreton Bay prawn trawl fishery. The analyses were undertaken by a consortium of DAFF, CSIRO and University of Queensland researchers. This report adopted the Australian Standard Fish Names ([URL] Trends in catch and effort The Moreton Bay otter trawl fishery is a multispecies fishery, {{with the majority of}} the catch composed of Greasyback Prawns (Metapenaeus bennettae), Brown Tiger Prawns (Penaeus esculentus), Eastern King Prawns (Melicertus plebejus), squid (Uroteuthis spp., Sepioteuthis spp.), <b>Banana</b> <b>Prawns</b> (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis), Endeavour Prawns (Metapenaeus ensis, Metapenaeus endeavouri) and Moreton Bay bugs (Thenus parindicus). Other commercially important byproduct includes blue swimmer crabs (Portunus armatus), three-spot crabs (Portunus sanguinolentus), cuttlefish (Sepia spp.) and mantis shrimp (Oratosquilla spp.). Logbook catch and effort data show that total annual reported catch of prawns from the Moreton Bay otter trawl fishery has declined to 315 t in 2008 from a maximum of 901 t in 1990. The number of active licensed vessels participating in the fishery has also declined from 207 in 1991 to 57 in 2010. Similarly, fishing effort has fallen from a peak of 13, 312 boat-days in 1999 to 3817 boat-days in 2008 – a 71...|$|R
