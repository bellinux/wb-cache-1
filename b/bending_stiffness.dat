25|$|There {{are many}} {{advantages}} to using composite baseball bats. As has been chronicled in slow-pitch softball recently, composite bats have outperformed standard aluminum bats. There are five main advantages for using composite bats: swing weight, trampoline effect, <b>bending</b> <b>stiffness,</b> bending vibrations, and sound.|$|E
25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the flexural load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral <b>bending</b> <b>stiffness),</b> the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the <b>bending</b> <b>stiffness</b> is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E
25|$|Including {{the lower}} <b>bending</b> <b>stiffness,</b> {{composite}} baseball bats {{have a higher}} damping rate. The damping rate corresponds to how quickly the material lessens the vibrations it is experiencing. Russell also states that composite bats have a damping rate anywhere from 2 to 10 times more than standard aluminum bat. Many ball players therefore refer to composite bats as more forgiving because {{if they do not}} make contact with the ball on the sweet spot, they will not feel the vibrations (sting) from the missed hit.|$|E

The eccentricity of hair cross-sectional shape index is also calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index also differs by race. The hair eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively. This means that Africans with the highest hair eccentricity index value of 1.74 have the curliest hair and Mongoloids with the lowest hair eccentricity index value of 1.30 have the least curly hair.|$|E

The calculation is very simple and analytic; it explains the success of the naive worm-like chain model over the entire force range of DNA stretching experiments. Typeset using REVT E X...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedKnowledge of the elastic properties of composite materials {{can be an}} invaluable tool for both the quality assurance of manufacturing techniques and design verification. Recent advancements in ultrasonic velocity measurements have demonstrated the ability to recover elastic properties in anisotropic laminates. A simplified experimental setup was investigated to recover the elastic properties based on the flexural wave propagation in anisotropic laminates. The initial objective of this thesis was to verify flexural wave propagation in composite laminates through the comparison of experimental and theoretical phase velocities. In {{the second part of}} this thesis, the experimental phase velocities were used to calculate the elastic properties of the material by inverting the governing equations. The initial method used to recover elastic constants was successful in the recovery of a partial set of the <b>bending</b> and extensional <b>stiffnesses.</b> The inability to recover all <b>bending</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> dictated the investigation of a second method. This method used an iterative method based on a nonlinear Newton's method to recover the <b>bending</b> <b>stiffnesses.</b> This method did not converge due to ill conditioning of the solution matrix. Although this method did not converge, it is believed that other more robust methods suggested herein would converge to the proper solution. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|A system {{identification}} (SI) problem of high-rise buildings is investigated under restricted data environments. The shear and <b>bending</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of a shear-bending model (SB model) representing the high-rise buildings are identified via the smart {{combination of the}} subspace and inverse-mode methods. Since the shear and <b>bending</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of the SB model can be identified in the inverse-mode method by using the lowest mode of horizontal displacements and floor rotation angles, the lowest mode of the objective building is identified first by using the subspace method. Identification of the lowest mode is performed by using the amplitude of transfer functions derived in the subspace method. Considering the resolution in measuring the floor rotation angles in lower stories, floor rotation angles in most stories are predicted from the floor rotation angle at the top floor. An empirical equation of floor rotation angles is proposed by investigating those for various building models. From the viewpoint of application of the present SI method to practical situations, a non-simultaneous measurement system is also proposed. In order to investigate the reliability and accuracy of the proposed SI method, a 10 -story building frame subjected to micro-tremor is examined...|$|R

50|$|In the {{offshore}} industry the word catenary {{is used as}} an adjective or noun with a meaning wider than is its historical meaning in mathematics. Thus, an SCR that uses a rigid, steel pipe that has a considerable <b>bending</b> <b>stiffness</b> {{is described as a}} catenary. That is because in the scale of depth of the ocean, the <b>bending</b> <b>stiffness</b> of a rigid pipe has little effect on the shape of the suspended span of an SCR. The shape assumed by the SCR is controlled mainly by weight, buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces due to currents and waves. Thus, in spite of using conventional, rigid steel pipe, the shape of an SCR can be closely approximated with the use of ideal catenary equations, used historically to describe the shape of a chain suspended between points in space. A chain line has by definition a zero <b>bending</b> <b>stiffness</b> and those described with the ideal catenary equations use infinitesimally short links.|$|E

40|$|Single-molecule {{experiments}} on single- and double-stranded DNA have sparked {{a renewed interest}} in the force versus extension of polymers. The extensible freely jointed chain (FJC) model is frequently invoked to explain the observed behavior of single-stranded DNA, but this model does not satisfactorily describe recent high-force stretching data. We instead propose a model (the discrete persistent chain) that borrows features from both the FJC and the wormlike chain, and show that it resembles the data more closely. We find that most of the high-force behavior previously attributed to stretch elasticity is really a feature of the corrected entropic elasticity; the true stretch compliance of single-stranded DNA is several times smaller than that found by previous authors. Next we elaborate our model to allow coexistence of two conformational states of DNA, each with its own stretch and bend elastic constants. Our model is computationally simple and gives an excellent fit through the entire overstretching transition of nicked, double-stranded DNA. The fit gives the first value for the <b>bend</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the overstretched state. In particular, we find the effective <b>bend</b> <b>stiffness</b> for DNA in this state to be about 12 nmkBT, a value quite different from either the B-form or single-stranded DNA...|$|R

Comparison of published formulas for the four relevant equivalent <b>bending</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> D 11 eq, D 22 eq, D 66 eq, andD 12 eq revealed ambiguities: Three different formulas were found for D 22 eq, which describes the bending of the ridges and troughs; for D 66 eq two Ã¢competingÃ¢ formulas emerged. Expressions not converging to the flat-plate values {{in the limit of}} vanishing corrugation height were discarded. All discussed formulas are written in a uniform notation for general one-dimensionally periodic shapes. Formulas derived for isotropic panel materials were generalized to the orthotropic case. In order to resolve the ambiguities and assess the EPM with regard to its range of applicability, vibration modes of six rectangular corrugated panels were measured. While agreement with numerical results obtained with COMSOL was fair, the EPM predictions of natural frequencies were satisfactory only for low-order modes. Finally, equivalent <b>bending</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> were determined numerically from COMSOL results for a few low-order modes by inverse methods. Thus the ambiguities with regard to D 22 eq and D 66 eq could be resolved. However, the D 12 eq values determined numerically came out significantly larger than the EPM prediction, in particular for stronger corrugations. Even though this discrepancy had little effect on the natural frequencies tested in the present paper, it remains a theoretical challenge...|$|R
