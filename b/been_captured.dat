5|$|In Nebraska, a {{small number}} of pallid {{sturgeon}} have <b>been</b> <b>captured</b> along the lower reaches of the Platte River. Unlike most rivers in the Mississippi-Missouri River System, the Platte River has only a few dams and they are well upstream from its confluence with the Missouri River. The lower Platte River is shallow with numerous sand bars and small islands. Though pallid sturgeon prefer more turbulent and deeper rivers than the Platte, between 1979 and 2003, over a dozen pallid sturgeon, including some from hatcheries, have <b>been</b> <b>captured</b> from the Platte River. A number of these pallid sturgeon have been fitted with radio transmitters which track their return to the Platte River when water levels and turbidity conditions are favorable. Coinciding with the majority of the pallid sturgeon that have <b>been</b> <b>captured,</b> the period that is generally most favorable is during the spring and early summer. By midsummer, a reduction in water levels and turbidity on the Platte River encourages pallid sturgeon to return to the Missouri River.|$|E

5|$|The crusaders {{consolidated}} their conquests into crusader states.

Appeals from those states to the papacy led to further crusades, such as the Third Crusade, called to try to regain Jerusalem, which had <b>been</b> <b>captured</b> by Saladin (d. 1193) in 1187. In 1203, the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Holy Land to Constantinople, and captured the city in 1204, setting up a Latin Empire of Constantinople and greatly weakening the Byzantine Empire. The Byzantines recaptured the city in 1261, but never regained their former strength. By 1291 all the crusader states had <b>been</b> <b>captured</b> or forced from the mainland, although a titular Kingdom of Jerusalem survived {{on the island of}} Cyprus for several years afterwards.|$|E
