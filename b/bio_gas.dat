More structurally sophisticated than the water gauge, the contemporary sight glass — {{also called the}} sight window or sight port — {{can be found on}} the media vessel at chemical plants and in other industrial settings, including pharmaceutical, food, beverage and <b>bio</b> <b>gas</b> plants. Sight glasses enable operators to visually observe processes inside tanks, pipes, reactors and vessels. The modern industrial sight glass is a glass disk held between two metal frames, which are secured by bolts and gaskets, or the glass disc is fused to the metal frame during manufacture. The glass used for this purpose is either soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, and the metal, usually a type of stainless steel, is chosen for desired properties of strength. Borosilicate glass is superior to other formulations in terms of chemical corrosion resistance and temperature tolerance, as well as transparency. Fused sight glasses are also called mechanically prestressed glass, because the glass is strengthened by compression of the metal ring. Heat is applied to a glass disc and its surrounding steel ring, causing a fusion of the materials. As the steel cools, it contracts, compressing the glass and making it resistant to tension. Because glass typically breaks under tension, mechanically prestressed glass is unlikely to break and endanger workers. The strongest sight glasses are made with borosilicate glass, because of the greater difference in its coefficient of expansion.|$|E

The main result from the study visit to France was that new regulations mean that both new and existing pipelines have to be satisfactorily protected. For the physical part of these plastic protective plates play an important part, and there are commercially available building systems of plates for which the strength and durability have been verified by tests.

40|$|This report {{concerns}} part 2 of {{a project}} with the aim to propose protective measures for cables and pipelines for <b>bio</b> and natural <b>gas.</b> Part 1 was previously reported in SGC Rapport 2011 : 239. The wish {{is to be able}} to increase the pressure in the distribution networks from 4 to 10 bar without having to retain the safety distances valid for 80 bar pipelines. Polymer, concrete and steel protective plates, and deep digging are the physical measures considered. In part 1 a survey was made, in part by an enquiry, of the frequency, causes and consequences of incidents where pipelines were hit by excavators. Further, the rules and standards were investigated in countries where 7 – 10 bar pipelines are already in service. Here, in part 2 the perspective was widened to include, apart from gas pipelines, also all kinds of buried pipelines and cables. Now a visit to a supplier in France is reported, as well as an vestigation of costs and environmental impacts of the different protective measures, and an analysis of the strength of protective plates and of how they can best be positioned in the ground in relationship to the pipeline. The main result from the study visit to France was that new regulations mean that both new and existing pipelines have to be satisfactorily protected. For the physical point of view these plastic protective plates play an important part, and there are commercially available building systems of plates for which the strength and durability have been verified by tests. In the full scale experiments done in, e. g., France, it can be concluded that the plastic (HDPE) plates can wit stand high loads which are applied by use of a bucket with teeth mounted on an excavator. In some cases penetration of teeth occurs, but the plates will in that case either come up and alert the operator or stay in the ground and still protect the buried cable or pipeline. Concrete plate can also break, but the pieces are held together by the steel reinforcement. The analysis of costs and environmental impacts shows that plastic plates are preferred with regard to both aspects. In addition they have a very good signalling effect being produced in a bright yellow colour. Also deep digging can be effective taking into account costs and environmental aspects, but the risk reduction will according to literature be less than for the plates. Plastic plates are shown, in the literature surveyed, by full scale experiments to have at least as good, and sufficient, resistance to impact as concrete ones. This is verified by in-house numerical analyses. The finite element analyses show that the plastic plates deforms but do not break. The arching action of the backfill protects the buried pipe, and the stresses become only somewhat higher when using plastic plates instead of using stiff plates of steel or concrete. There may be unfavourable cases when the plastic plates cannot by themself stop forces and stresses passing down through soil layers acting on the buried pipe...|$|R
40|$|The world {{community}} {{is concerned with}} the depletion of fossil fuel and looking at alternative energy resources such as biomass, solar, hydro and wind. With the growth of palm oil production in Malaysia, the amount of biomass residues generated also shows a corresponding increase. Currently, there are several routes being studied to convert the biomass to liquid bio oil, <b>bio</b> char and <b>gases</b> depending on the pyrolysis condition. Catalytic pyrolysis is proposed to be a viable technology to convert this biomass by having a catalyst introduced during the pyrolysis process and in contact physically with the biomass, in the formation of higher quality bio oil. The first goal of this thesis is to analyse the possibility of shredded oil palm empty fruit bunches (SOPEFB) as a catalyst support/carrier by direct impregnation method using cobalt as the catalyst. The concentration of the cobalt aqueous solution were prepared for 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% and the SOPEFB samples were soaked in these solutions with the different soaking time. The functional groups that are involve in the reaction such as ion exchange and adsorption, leading to metal uptake by the SOPEFB. Results show that the sorption equilibrium is achieved approximately after 24 hours. The adsorption capacity was 8. 12, 9. 27, 11. 16 and 12. 06 mg/g of SOPEFB for the 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% of cobalt aqueous solutions respectively. The adsorption follows both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm, however, the correlation coefficient showed that Freundlich equilibrium data fitted well than Langmuir model indicated the surface heterogeneity of the SOPEFB. The second goal is to study the thermal decomposition and kinetic reaction of the pyrolysis of the impregnated SOPEFB with cobalt catalyst. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to elucidate chemical kinetics of the pyrolysis of the non impregnated SOPEFB and impregnated SOPEFB with cobalt catalyst. The kinetic parameters were calculated using least square with minimizing sum of error technique. The results show that the activation energy (Ea) of SOPEFB is in the range of 80 to 100 kJ/mol and the order of reaction (n) was discovered in the range of 2. 0 to 3. 0. The model used to predict the rate equations agree with the experimental data with the coefficient of determination (R²) in the range of 0. 70 to 0. 97. Fixed bed pyrolysis was performed to evaluate the pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis of SOPEFB in a simple batch system. The effects of pyrolysis temperature and the cobalt catalyst content on the yield of products were investigated. Results showed that the maximum oil yield is obtained at 500 °C of pyrolysis temperature. The use of cobalt catalyst has a positive impact on the yields of small molecular weight compounds. It is believed that the hydrocarbon vapour from the thermal decomposition of SOPEFB immediately came into contact with cobalt on the SOPEFB surface. The cracking of the hydrocarbon may involve reactions on the cobalt surface as well as subsequent reactions in the vapour phase. Overall, this study confirms the possibility of SOPEFB to become a cobalt catalyst support/carrier {{and at the same time}} the product of catalytic pyrolysis of the SOPEFB can be cracked to smaller molecular weight and subsequently upgraded the quality of the bio oil...|$|R
