5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. <b>Before</b> <b>dinner,</b> Vansant decided to take a quick swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served <b>before</b> <b>dinner.</b> It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
25|$|To {{solve these}} issues the founders created the {{communal}} children's houses, {{where the children}} would {{spend most of their}} time; learning, playing and sleeping. Parents spent 3 to 4 hours a day in the afternoon with their children after work and <b>before</b> <b>dinner.</b>|$|E

The Prince ponders his fondness for Concetta, which is based in her apparent submissiveness and placidity. However, he thinks that Tancredi's ambitions may require more money than Concetta will bring as her dowry. Keeping his thoughts to himself, the Prince decrees that Father Pirrone is to tell Concetta that the Prince will discuss it with her later.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirement}} that all cadets wishing to eat {{dinner in the}} mess hall must be present for a prayer {{was the basis for}} a lawsuit in 2002 when two cadets sued VMI over the prayer said <b>before</b> <b>dinner.</b> The non-denominational prayer had been a daily fixture since the 1950s. In 2002 the Fourth Circuit ruled the prayer, during an event with mandatory attendance, at a state-funded school, violated the U.S. Constitution. When the Supreme Court declined to review the school's appeal in April 2004, the prayer tradition was stopped.|$|E

25|$|Luciani had {{suffered}} a severe pain in his chest {{for about five minutes}} around 7:30pm while sitting reciting the vespers in the chapel with Magee <b>before</b> <b>dinner</b> and rejected all suggestions for calling Doctor Renato Buzzonetti. The latter, the book claimed, was informed of that episode after the pope's death. The book also revealed that, prior to the conclave that elected John Paul II, the cardinals had sent a series of written questions to the doctors who had embalmed Luciani either on 10 or 11 October to check if there had been any signs of traumatic injuries, so as to ascertain if he died naturally rather than suspiciously. Doctor Buzzonetti sent a detailed report to the Cardinal Secretary of State Agostino Casaroli on 9 October 1979 detailing the episode of pain Luciani suffered was in {{the upper part of the}} sternal region.|$|E
25|$|Both {{the motive}} for killing Alfred, and the method of his murder, were changed - Alfred had spotted Quimper {{planting}} a false clue {{on the grounds of}} the Hall, knowing that the body of his wife would be found eventually. When Alexander and James find it and show it to the family, Alfred suspected Quimper was up to something and decided to blackmail him, boasting to Lucy just <b>before</b> <b>dinner</b> that he was due to receive money. When the family fall ill at dinner by a small dose of arsenic, Alfred, weakened as a result, is later killed in his bed by a fatal injection from Quimper; as he is being killed, Alfred cried out his killer's name, which Quimper made certain was misconstrued as him calling for the doctor's help, shortly after appearing to have run back up the stairs to Alfred's bedroom when Emma rushed out to the commotion being created.|$|E
25|$|Over {{a period}} of several centuries, invading Muslim armies managed to occupy much of present-day Pakistan and {{northern}} India. In response to the spread of Muslim rule, the kingdoms of south India united in the 14th century to found the Vijayanagara Empire. Physical culture was given much attention by both royalty and commoners in the empire, with wrestling being particularly popular with both men and women. Gymnasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters of Vijayanagara, and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peace time. Royal palaces and market places had special arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling. One account describes an akhara in Chandragiri where noblemen practiced jumping exercises, boxing, fencing and wrestling almost everyday <b>before</b> <b>dinner</b> to maintain their health, and observed that “men as old as seventy years look only thirty”.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{engagement}} Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation picture a cabin portrait {{to celebrate his}} victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin <b>before</b> <b>dinner,</b> while listening to pipe and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and reading from a sheet of music propped against a wine glass. A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, and drops gravy {{down the back of}} the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, to be the most famous in British art.|$|E
500|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} was {{a response}} to Athenian involvement in the Ionian Revolt, when Athens and Eretria had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Athenians and Eretrians had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis, but they were then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, Darius swore to burn down Athens and Eretria. According to Herodotus, Darius had his bow brought to him and then shot an arrow [...] "upwards towards heaven", saying as he did so: [...] "Zeus, that it may be granted me to take vengeance upon the Athenians!". Herodotus further writes that Darius charged one of his servants to say [...] "Master, remember the Athenians" [...] three times <b>before</b> <b>dinner</b> each day.|$|E
500|$|The public baths served hygienic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} functions. Bathing {{was the focus of}} daily socializing in the late afternoon <b>before</b> <b>dinner.</b> Roman baths were distinguished by a series of rooms that offered communal bathing in three temperatures, with varying amenities that might include an exercise and weight-training room, sauna, exfoliation spa (where oils were massaged into the skin and scraped from the body with a strigil), ball court, or outdoor swimming pool. Baths had hypocaust heating: the floors were suspended over hot-air channels that circulated warmth. Mixed nude bathing was not unusual in the early Empire, though some baths may have offered separate facilities or hours for men and women. Public baths were a part of urban culture throughout the provinces, but in the late 4th century, individual tubs began to replace communal bathing. Christians were advised to go to the baths for health and cleanliness, not pleasure, but to avoid the games (ludi), which were part of religious festivals they considered [...] "pagan". Tertullian says that otherwise Christians not only availed themselves of the baths, but participated fully in commerce and society.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{began at}} Ascot Sound Studios, Lennon's newly built home studio at Tittenhurst Park, in May 1971, with final overdubs {{taking place at}} the Record Plant, in New York City, during July. Relaxed and patient, the {{sessions}} began during the late morning, running to just <b>before</b> <b>dinner</b> in the early evening. Lennon taught the musicians the chord progression and a working arrangement for [...] "Imagine", rehearsing the song until he deemed the musicians ready to record. In his attempt to recreate Lennon's desired sound, Spector had some early tapings feature Lennon and Nicky Hopkins playing in different octaves on one piano. He also initially attempted to record the piano part with Lennon playing the white baby grand in the couple's all-white room. However, after having deemed the room's acoustics unsuitable, Spector abandoned the idea in favour of the superior environment of Lennon's home studio. They completed the session in minutes, recording three takes and choosing the second one for release. The finished recording featured Lennon on piano and vocal, Klaus Voormann on bass guitar, Alan White on drums and the Flux Fiddlers on strings.|$|E
