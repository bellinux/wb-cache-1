40|$|A phenomenological model {{representing}} ion adsorption equilibrium is proposed. It is {{an extension}} of the model used to represent surface adsorption, and it is intended to interpret <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> data. The fundamental equations of the model were established for fluid and solid phases mass balance and for the spatial distribution of ions across the sample. The electric field distribution in the system, modeled on Poisson's equation, and the chemical potential behavior were determined as a function of fluid phase equilibrium concentration. The concentration of ions as a function of electric potential is given by Boltzmann distribution. The proposed model was successfully tested to represent equilibrium adsorption of metallic ions in zeolite, showing results similar to conventional isotherms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|To the {{question}} of the surface area, in the oXiris membrane, the microstructure and the chemical composition of the AN 69 polymer offer a unique context for <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> of middle molecular weight proteins, the high water content of the hydrogel making the polymer chains easily accessible [8]. This implies that the surface area accessible for adsorption is considerably increased, far above the surface area that is at the blood membrane interface (i.e., 1.5 [*]m 2 for oXiris). Sakai et al. have notably proposed a model to simulate hydrogel total surface accessible for adsorption [9]. In case of oXiris, the total theoretical surface area accessible for adsorption would basically consist of approx. 17, 000 [*]m 2. Of note, Nishida et al. have shown that the AN 69 hydrogel membrane does not reach saturation at supra pathological quantities of HMGB- 1 (seven successive pathological injection of 100 [*]μg) [10], further illustrating this point.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{we would}} like to discuss more about the {{influence}} of surface condition on the Q-factor. It is already well known that an oxide coating layer with high refractive index promotes an effective refractive index and light confinement which leads to low light loss and higher Q-factor[3, 16, 21]. For the tubular microcavity in our work, the most important loss terms are <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> (Qmat- 1) and loss introduced by surfaced contaminants (Qcont- 1): Q- 1 [*]=[*]Qmat- 1 [*]+[*]Qcont- 1 [5, 18]. The adsorption of water molecules on the surface will increase the roughness of the tube wall as one kind of contaminant which magnifies Qcont- 1 and consequently deteriorates the entire Q-factor. The desorption of water molecules, on the contrary, will enhance the Q-factor. Both the water molecule desorption and the increase of the tube wall thickness during ALD contribute to the enhancement of the Q-factor, as shown in Figure  2 b.|$|E

This study investigated the adsorption of eight hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) frequently detected in stormwater e including four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), two phthalates and two alkylphenols e onto activated carbon produced from domestic sewage sludge. Adsorption was studied using batch tests. Kinetic studies indicated that <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> of HOCs occurred within 10 min. Sludge-based activated carbon (SBAC) was as efficient as tested commercial carbons for adsorbing HOCs; adsorption capacities ranged from 70 to 2800 mg/g (Cinitial ¼ 10 e 300 mg/L; 15 mg SBAC in 150 mL solution; 24 h contact time) for each HOC. In the batch tests, the adsorption capacity was generally negatively correlated to the compounds' hydrophobicity (log Kow) and positively associated with decreasing molecule size, suggesting that molecular sieving limited adsorption. However, in repeated adsorption tests, where competition between HOCs was more likely to occur, adsorbed pollutant loads exhibited strong positive correlation with log Kow.

A mechanism is deduced in which the dye passes from bulk solution, through a porous surface layer within the cloth, before passing into the <b>bulk</b> cloth. <b>Adsorption</b> onto surface sites in this porous layer blocks the passage of further dye into the cloth.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{properties of}} egg white ovalbumin adsorbed at the air/water interface were studied using infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TRFA) techniques. Ovalbumin adsorbed at the air/ water interface adopts a characteristic partially unfolded conformation {{in which the}} content of the β-sheet is 10 % lower compared to that of the protein in <b>bulk</b> solution. <b>Adsorption</b> to the interface leads to considerable changes in the rotational dynamics of ovalbumin. The results indicate that the end-over-end mobility of the ellipsoidal protein becomes substantially restricted. This is likely to reflect a preferential orientation of the protein at the interface.

40|$|The {{interactive}} behaviour {{of particles}} and surfactant at an air–water interface has been investigated, with particular {{reference to the}} effect of the interactions on the stability of air–water foams. For a system combining octyl grafted silica particles and Triton X- 100, the effects of both individual particles and surfactants with the interface have been considered, along with particle–surfactant interactions. Because of the complexity of the system, the change in aqueous foam stability was inferred from a number of key parameters: namely, the <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> of surfactant onto the particles, the combined influence on system interfacial tension, the role of surfactant on particle aggregation and the role of interfacial elasticity. It was found that adsorption on the particles occurred in a two-stage process, with an initial Langmuir monolayer being augmented as interactions between surfactant aromatic moieties produced a perpendicular arrangement with head-groups facing into the solution, rendering the particles completely hydrophilic at high concentrations. At low-to-moderate concentrations of surfactant, the foam stability was increased by 20 % in comparison to pure particle systems. The reasons for the improved stability were two-fold. Firstly, in low concentrations, surfactant caused bridging flocculation of the particles at the interface, producing enlarged sterically strong interfacial barriers. Secondly, at moderate concentrations, the surface elasticity was increased by the presence of the surfactant. The maximum interfacial elasticity was higher in composite systems, in comparison to pure surfactant solutions, probably a result of reduction in available interfacial area for adsorption of free surfactant to the air–water interface...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of silane and methylsilane on the (1 1 0) and polycrystalline {{surfaces of}} gold is examined using vibrational electron energy loss spectroscopy (VEELS), angle-resolved {{ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy}} (ARUPS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Adsorption of silane onto the Au(1 1 0) surface at low temperatures is dissociative and yields an SiH 2 and possibly also SiH 3 surface species. Further dissociation occurs at room temperature to yield adsorbed SiH, which is tilted on the surface, with complete dissociation to Si occurring by 110 °C. The similarity in the UP spectra for silane adsorbed on the polycrystalline sample suggests that the same surface species are present over that temperature range. Above 200 °C, spectral changes suggest rearrangement of the Si atoms, which, by 350 °C, have diffused into the <b>bulk.</b> <b>Adsorption</b> of methylsilane onto the (1 1 0) surface at low temperatures initially produces adsorbed CH 3 SiH or CH 3 SiH 2, with undissociated methylsilane physisorbing at higher exposures. By room temperature, desorption and decomposition leaves (or direct adsorption yields) only adsorbed CH 3 Si. After further heating, the hydrogen-carbon bonds of the CH 3 group break to leave an adsorbed SiC species. On the polycrystalline surface, methylsilane adsorption is the same at low temperatures as on (1 1 0). In contrast to the latter, though, the UP spectra indicate that direct exposures at room temperature yield adsorbed Si or SiC initially, with CH 3 Si again adsorbing at higher exposures. Upon further heating to 330 °C, little if any methyl-groups remain {{on the surface and}} the Si has started to diffuse into the bulk...|$|E
40|$|In {{times of}} rapidly growing energy demands {{petroleum}} exploration focus has shifted {{more and more}} towards unconventional petroleum systems due to increasing difficulties in finding and profitably producing from conventional oil and gas fields but also due to recent increases in gas price and enhanced recovery techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic stimulation which allow production from these tight low-permeable reservoirs. Based on the successful exploration of and production from U. S. American shale gas/oil plays it was discussed whether similarly successful plays would also be available in Europe. In this context, sedimentary basins in NW-Germany and the Netherlands represent amongst others potential targets for shale gas exploration in Europe due {{to the presence of}} Cretaceous (Wealden) and Jurassic (Posidonia) marlstones/shales as well as various Carboniferous black shales. Unlike in conventional reservoirs in which gas is stored primarily as compressed (“free”) gas in the intragranular pore space and fractures, a significant proportion of gas in shales can be stored as “sorbed” gas. The sorption of hydrocarbon gas (mostly methane) in shales provides gas storage capacity in addition to the “free gas” capacity in the pore system. The methane sorption is considered to take place predominantly within the microporous organic matter (kerogen) and is controlled by the Total Organic Carbon (TOC), kerogen type, maturity, water saturation and to some extent by the inorganic constituents (clay minerals). Numerical petroleum system modeling provides the only means to combine results from different geological, geochemical and geophysical analysis methods within the frame of a 4 D thermo-tectonic reconstruction of the basin´s evolution. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} combine basin and petroleum system modeling approaches with petrophysical as well as petrographic methods in order to substantiate former assumptions on the geodynamic evolution of the study area providing a reasonable assessment of the regional shale gas prospectivity and thus reducing potential exploration risks prior to drilling. For this, 3 D high resolution petroleum system models of NW-Germany and the Netherlands have been compiled and used to reconstruct the source rock maturation based on calibrated burial and thermal histories. Different basal heat flow scenarios and accordingly different high-resolution scenarios of erosional amount distribution were constructed, representing all major uplift events that affected the study area. The models deliver an independent reappraisal of the tectonic and thermal history that controlled the differential geodynamic evolution and provide a high-resolution image of the maturity distribution and evolution throughout the study area and the different basins. Pressure, temperature and TOC-dependent gas storage capacity and gas contents of different potential source rocks were calculated based on experimentally derived Langmuir sorption parameters and newly compiled source rock thickness maps. With additional petrographic analysis methods assessing the lithological dependency of vitrinite reflectance as a maturity parameter in high rank sedimentary rocks as well as utilizing its anisotropic character (at maturity levels above 2 % VRr) as stress/strain indicator this study can also contribute to the understanding of burial and temperature history in the Lower Saxony Basin. RIS (Reflectance Indicating Surface) analysis shows a predominantly negative biaxial distribution of vitrinite reflectance indicating the absence of thermal overprinting by a possible magmatic intrusion (Bramsche Massif) during the Upper Cretaceous but, in addition to vertical stresses due to depositional loading, the presence of a secondary stress field not perpendicular to bedding and related to the inversion of the Lower Saxony Basin. This basin belongs to an en-echelon shaped basin sub-system of similar geodynamic evolution which can be tracked throughout the whole Central European Basin System (CEBS). One of the most distinctive aspects of its evolution is the dominant uplift and partial inversion during the Upper Cretaceous ultimately controlling source rock maturation, petroleum generation, migration and trapping. Especially in the Lower Saxony Basin deep subsidence was followed by strong uplift with maximum amounts of up to 6800 - 8900 m of eroded basin infill during the Subhercynian inversion depending on the modeled basal heat flow trend. Modeling results indicate maturity patterns of the most important petroleum source rocks and also prospective areas within the study area exhibiting shale gas potential at present-day. These areas are confined to the Lower Saxony Basin, southern Gifhorn Trough and West Netherlands Basin. For the Posidonia Shale in the Lower Saxony Basin low <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacities (note that <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> capacities are given for the total layer thickness within a grid cell size of 1 km 2) of about 0. 16 * 106 tons and gas contents of up to 82 scf/ton rock have been predicted.

40|$|This thesis reports an {{investigation}} into the NO_ 2 sensing properties of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) thin films at room temperature in air. The gas sensing proper-ties of the CuPc films were investigated using electrical conductivity and surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensing devices. Conductivity and SAW sensors were employed to detect changes of the film properties upon NO_ 2 exposure in electrical conductivity and mass loading respectively. Initially, the response of electrical conductivity and SAW sensors incorporating an untreated layer of CuPc was investigated. Laser illumination of the films during the sensing experiments was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the mass loading response but little effect on the change in electrical conductivity. From these experiments it was suggested that NO_ 2 adsorption on CuPc may be dominated by two different mechanisms, surface adsorption and bulk diffusion. It was also suggested that a reduction of one of these components would lead to a more controllable response. In order to minimise the effect of bulk diffusion, some of the CuPc films were doped with NO_ 2 after deposition so filling the strongly bound <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> sites. In other devices, cooling of the CuPc layer in liquid nitrogen was used after deposition to change the surface structure in order to facilitate bulk diffusion. It was shown that these post-deposition treatment significantly changed the response characteristics of the CuPc film. Response kinetics of the experiments were analysed using the Langmuir and Elovich adsorption models, a method was suggested to determine the concentration of NO_ 2 within the first few minutes of exposure using the value for the maximum rate of current change. A good correlation between this value and the concentration was found.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Surfactants from the 'Triton' range, manufactured by Rohm and Haas, Germany, were used to study the adsorptive behaviour of non-ionic surfactants (of the alkyl polyoxyethylene type) from aqueous solution onto mineral oxide surfaces. The oligomeric distributions of the surfactants were characterised using the HPLC technique. Two gradients were used: a normal phase gradient was used to study the surfactants from non-aqueous solution; an unusual gradient, {{which could not be}} definitively categorised as either normal or reversed phase and which was developed at Brunel, was used to analyse surfactants directly from aqueous solution. Quartz was used as a model mineral oxide surface. The quartz surface was characterised using a range of techniques: scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence -analysis, Fourier transform-infra red spectroscopy and BET analysis. It was found that washing the quartz with concentrated HCI removed any calcium ions present on the surface and also removed 02 - ions. Calcining the sample removed carbonaceous materials from the surface and also caused a decrease in the surface area. The quartz was shown to be non-porous by SEM and BET analysis. The adsorption experiments for this study were carried out using a simple tumbling method for which known ratios of surfactant in aqueous solution and quartz silica were mixed together for a known length of time. The amounts of surfactant present were measured using ultra-violet analysis and the HPLC techniques mentioned above. It was found that the smallest oligomers were adsorbed the most. An addition of salt to the system caused an overall increase in adsorption of the bulk surfactant, and increase in temperature caused an initial decrease in adsorbed amounts before the plateau of the isotherm and a final increase in <b>bulk</b> <b>adsorption</b> at the plateau of the isotherm. The oligomeric adsorption generally appeared to mirror the behaviour of the bulk surfactant. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), dynamic light and neutron scattering studies were used to analyse the character of the adsorbed surfactant layer. It was shown that the layer reached a finite thickness that corresponded to a bilayer of adsorbed surfactant. According to AFM data, this value of thickness was not consistent over the whole of the quartz surface. E...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{adsorption}} of {{the species}} at semiconductor surfaces is analyzed showing {{the existence of the}} two contributions to adsorption energy: bond creation and charge transfer. It is shown that the energy of quantum surface states is affected by the electric field at the surface, nevertheless the potential contribution of electron and nuclei cancels out. The charge transfer contribution is Fermi level independent for pinned surfaces. Thus for Fermi level pinned at the surface, the adsorption energy is independent on the Fermi energy i. e. the doping in the bulk. The DFT simulations of adsorption of hydrogen at clean GaN(0001) and silicon at SiC(0001) surfaces confirmed independence of adsorption energy on the doping in the bulk. For the Fermi level nonpinned surfaces the charge contribution depends on the position of Fermi level in the <b>bulk.</b> Thus <b>adsorption</b> energy is sensitive to change of the Fermi energy in the bulk, i. e. the doping.

Both water and methanol are good solvents for PNIPAM; however, in certain mixtures cononsolvency is induced by a lowering of the LCST. This led to a decrease in the extent of the PNIPAM layer away from the interface as measured using the colloidal probe technique in the poor solvent region. At low methanol concentrations but still in the good solvent region capillary bridging between the silica surfaces with adsorbed PNIPAM layers was observed due to the increased methanol concentration in this interfacial region over that of the <b>bulk.</b> Furthermore, <b>adsorption</b> measurements showed that PNIPAM adsorbed only weakly to the silica interface with a low surface excess on the order of 0. 23 mg/m 2, which allowed study of the behavior of the immobilized PNIPAM chains under highly dilute conditions using the quartz crystal microbalance.

For monodentate configurations, the strongest Eads = − 1. 06, − 1. 11 and − 0. 86 eV for anatase, rutile and (B) -TiO 2, respectively. Multiple monodentate and bidentate configurations are identified on a-TiO 2 with a distribution of adsorption energies and with the lowest energy configuration having stronger bonding than that of the crystalline counterparts, with Eads up to − 4. 92 eV for bidentate and − 1. 83 eV for monodentate adsorption. Amorphous TiO 2 can therefore be used to achieve strong anchoring of organic molecules, such as dyes, that bind via a -COOH group. While the presence of the surface leads to a contraction of the band gap vs. the <b>bulk,</b> molecular <b>adsorption</b> caused no appreciable effect on the band structure around the gap in any of the systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of interferometry and plasmonic structure, {{which consists of}} gold nanoparticle layer, sputter coated silicon oxide spacer layer, and aluminum mirror layer, was studied in transmission mode for biosensing and refractive index sensing applications. Because of the interferometric nature of the system, the information of the reflection amplitude and phase of the plasmonic layer can be deduced from one spectrum. The modulation amplitude in the transmission spectrum, caused by the interference between the plasmonic particle layer and the mirror layer, increases upon the refractive index increase around the plasmonic particles due to their coherent backscattering property. Our proposed evaluation method requires only two light sources with different wavelengths for a stable self-referenced signal, which can be easily and precisely tuned by a transparent spacer layer thickness. Unlike the standard localized surface plasmon sensors, where a sharp resonance peak is essential, a broad band plasmon resonance is accepted in this method. This leads to large fabrication tolerance of the plasmonic structures. We investigated <b>bulk</b> and <b>adsorption</b> layer sensitivities both experimentally and by simulation. The highest sensitivity wavelength corresponded to the resonance of the plasmonic particles, but useful signals are produced in a much broader spectral range. Analysis of a single transmission spectrum allowed us to access the wavelength-dependent complex reflection coefficient of the plasmonic particle layer, which confirmed the reflection amplitude increase in the plasmonic particle layer upon molecular adsorption...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to improve {{recycling}} rate of the waste glasses by investigating bloating mechanism. In this study, we use waste glass(W/G) and hard clay(H/C) as raw materials. The artificial lightweight aggregates were formed by plastic forming(φ= 10 mm) and sintered by fast firing method at different temperatures(between 700 and 1250 o C). The physical properties of the aggregates such as <b>bulk</b> specific gravity, <b>adsorption</b> and microstructure of surface and cross-section are investigated with the sintering temperature and rate of W/G-H/C contents. As the result of the bulk specific gravity graphs, we can found out the inflection point at content of W/G 60 wt%. From the microstructure images, we considered the artificial lightweight aggregates content of W/ G over 60 wt % are distributed numerous micro-pores by organic oxidation without Black Core and the artificial lightweight aggregate...|$|R
40|$|Nanopowder density, {{as well as}} compact density, is due {{to powder}} {{particle}} size, different in their values, compared to micron powders. Also, the technique used for density determination induces large mutual value discrepancies. Scanning electron micrographs of as received powder are presented as an illustration of the shape and size of powder particles and agglomerates. The density of the loose powder pretreated differently was determined using mercury porosimetry and He pycnometry. The methods used for determining the apparent density of the compacts were pycnometry with water as the wetting liquid, mercury porosimetry and also a new approach {{using a combination of}} mercury pycnometry along with nitrogen <b>adsorption.</b> <b>Bulk</b> densities of compacts were determined by dimension measurement and mercury pycnometry. Conclusions about nanopowder usage as a charge for dry compaction as well as the most appropriate way for the determination of compact and powder densities are shown...|$|R

Adsorption isotherms for single components in MFI were both measured and computed showing good agree-ment. In addition simulations in other all silica structures were performed {{for a wide}} range of pressures and tempera-tures and for single components as well as binary and ternary mixtures with varying <b>bulk</b> compositions. The <b>adsorption</b> selectivity was analyzed for mixtures with bulk composi-tion of 50 : 50 CO 2 /CH 4, 50 : 50 CO 2 /N 2, 10 : 90 CO 2 /N 2 and 5 : 90 : 5 CO 2 /N 2 /CH 4 in MFI, MOR, ISV, ITE, CHA and DDR showing high selectivity of adsorption of CO 2 over N 2 and CH 4 that varies with the type of crystal and with the mixture bulk composition...|$|R
50|$|The precise {{structure}} of the ligands {{on the surface of}} colloidal gold NPs impact the properties of the colloidal gold particles. Binding conformations and surface packing of the capping ligands at the surface of the colloidal gold NPs tend to differ greatly from <b>bulk</b> surface model <b>adsorption,</b> largely due to the high curvature observed at the nanoparticle surfaces. Thiolate-gold interfaces at the nanoscale have been well-studied and the thiolate ligands are observed to pull Au atoms off of the surface of the particles to for “staple” motifs that have significant Thiyl-Au(0) character. The citrate-gold surface, on the other hand, is relatively less-studied due to the vast number of binding conformations of the citrate to the curved gold surfaces. A study performed in 2014 identified that the most-preferred binding of the citrate involves two carboxylic acids and the hydroxyl group of the citrate binds three surface metal atoms.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We have {{investigated}} conformational properties of a linear semiflexible homopolymer chain in the <b>bulk</b> and <b>adsorption</b> desorption behaviour {{in the presence}} of an attractive impenetrable curved surface using lattice models. Since, it is understood that the essential physics associated with the conformational behavior of such polymer chains can be derived from a model of a self avoiding walk (SAW) or directed self avoiding walk (DSAW) on a suitable lattice. Therefore, DSAW model on a two dimensional hexagonal lattice has been solved analytically to study the phase transitions occurring in the semiflexible polymer chain. We have found that the persistent length of the polymer chain is independent of its bending energy and its value is found to be unity for directed walk models for hexagonal lattice. Results obtained in presence of an attractive impenetrable curved surface show that adsorption of stiffer polymer chains take place at a smaller value of monomer surface attraction than the flexible polymer chains in the case when adsorbed parts of the polymer chain do not contribute Boltzmann weight to partition function of the polymer chain due to bending of the polymer chain. However, when adsorbed parts of the semiflexible polymer chain contribute Boltzmann weight due to bending of the polymer chain, critical value of monomer surface attraction required for adsorption of the polymer chain on curved impenetrable surface is found to be independent of bending energy of the semiflexible polymer chain.
