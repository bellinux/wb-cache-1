During the last years, several <b>benchmarking</b> clusters have been established within the German-speaking countries. They support hospitals in comparing and positioning their information system’s and information management’s costs, performance and efficiency against other hospitals. In order to differentiate between these <b>benchmarking</b> clusters and to provide decision support in selecting an appropriate <b>benchmarking</b> cluster, a classification scheme is developed. The classification scheme observes both general conditions and examined contents of the <b>benchmarking</b> clusters.

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify usage of foodservice performance measures, important activities in foodservice <b>benchmarking,</b> and <b>benchmarking</b> attitudes, beliefs, and practices by foodservice directors. The design of this study included two parts: (1) eleven expert panelists involved in a Delphi technique to identify and rate importance of foodservice performance measures and rate the importance of <b>benchmarking</b> activities, and (2) a national mail survey of 247 randomly selected foodservice directors from college/university, correctional, health care, and school foodservice operations to identify attitudes, beliefs, and practices about <b>benchmarking</b> and usage of performance measures. Statistical analyses of the expert panel data included frequencies of importance rating of performance measures and <b>benchmarking</b> activities. The expert panel identified 89 performance measures, which were subsequently consolidated into 19 generic performance measures. Regarding the national survey, a χ² analysis was conducted on: usage of types of <b>benchmarking</b> compared with knowledge and importance of <b>benchmarking,</b> and experience with <b>benchmarking</b> outcomes; foodservice directors' category of foodservice operation compared with usage of performance measures, type of <b>benchmarking</b> and <b>benchmarking</b> partner(s); and foodservice directors' knowledge of <b>benchmarking</b> compared to importance of <b>benchmarking.</b> According to the national survey, the most commonly used performance measures were: food cost percentage, cost per unit or area of service, and meals per labor hour. Usage of internal, external, and functional/generic <b>benchmarking</b> was associated with foodservice directors' knowledge about <b>benchmarking,</b> importance of <b>benchmarking,</b> and general experience with <b>benchmarking</b> outcomes. Foodservice directors' category of foodservice operation was associated with usage of types of <b>benchmarking</b> partners, and with some performance measures and types of <b>benchmarking,</b> while not others. Foodservice directors' knowledge about <b>benchmarking</b> was related to perceived importance of <b>benchmarking.</b> Sixty-one percent of respondents reported needing knowledge and skills about <b>benchmarking.</b> This research provides insight into performance measures that are or could be used in foodservice <b>benchmarking.</b> It also suggests that <b>benchmarking</b> has at least some importance, particularly to those with knowledge about <b>benchmarking.</b> It could be a useful management tool to foodservice directors, regardless of category of foodservice operation.

On the other hand, because <b>benchmarking</b> systems also function as a public yardstick of energy-use performance in buildings, some regulators release <b>benchmarking</b> information to the media. This proves advantageous because it brings public pressure on owners/developers of poorly performing non-reference buildings. However, not all <b>benchmarking</b> systems can be used by public users (i. e., other non-reference building owners).

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to use survey data {{collected}} from 453 respondents, from over 40 countries, to determine the current levels of use of <b>benchmarking</b> as an improvement technique. It identifies where and how <b>benchmarking</b> is implemented within organisations and compares the popularity of <b>benchmarking</b> against other improvement tools. Finally, it provides an evidence based opinion on whether <b>benchmarking</b> is a fad or an established management technique. Design/methodology/approach – An on-line questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire was translated into five languages and promoted by the Global <b>Benchmarking</b> Network, a network of <b>benchmarking</b> competency centres, representing 21 countries. The data were then analysed using SPSS statistical software. Findings – The analysis suggests that <b>benchmarking</b> (informal and formal) is used by a majority of organisations although best practice <b>benchmarking</b> is only used by a core minority. <b>Benchmarking</b> effectiveness compares favourably with effectiveness of other improvement tools and a majority of respondents intend to continue using <b>benchmarking</b> in the future. Research limitations/implications – The responses from some of the countries that participated were small in number. This study also relied on a single respondent from each organisation.
