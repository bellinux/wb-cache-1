40|$|Energy {{storage is}} very limited in AUV's. To assist with energy management, data {{gathering}} missions have been proposed where the vehicle should sit on the <b>bottom</b> and <b>gather</b> acoustic/video/chemical data over extended periods of time. In this grounding scenario while thrusters may be used, they are less desirable because of their high energy consumption and restricted use close to the ocean floor. The purpose of this work is to study a low cost, simple soft grounding capability for a submersible vehicle using controllable ballast. The ballast system based on the NPS Phoenix AUV is designed to control weight addition into or out of two ballast tanks. The developed control law adjusts the pump flow rate keeping the pitch angle and depth rate within the limits. Results for a soft grounding operation have been obtained using simulation.

50|$|Trapped on the <b>bottom,</b> the {{survivors}} <b>gather</b> {{in the control}} room; Sempter and Sturm square off, asserting command, while Diana exposes Sturm's madness. Sempter takes control and organizes the crew's escape. In a detailed and substantially accurate technical sequence, Diana and the crew exit through the sub's escape trunk using Momsen lungs, and are rescued at the surface. Refusing to leave the ship, Sturm stays behind and lapses into raving insanity; he opens a watertight door to let in the sea, laughing maniacally as the water rises.|$|R
40|$|Twisted bilayer {{graphene}} is a chiral {{system which}} has been recently shown to present circular dichroism. In this work we show that {{the origin of this}} optical activity is the rotation of the Dirac fermions' helicities in the top and bottom layer. Starting from the Kubo formula, we obtain a compact expression for the Hall conductivity that takes into account the dephasing of the electromagnetic field between the top and <b>bottom</b> layers and <b>gathers</b> all the symmetries of the system. Our results are based in both a continuum and a tight-binding model, and they can be generalized to any two-dimensional Dirac material with a chiral stacking between layers...|$|R
6000|$|... [28] In {{his lecture}} on Geographical Evolution (which was {{published}} after {{the greater part}} of this chapter had been written) Sir Archibald Geikie expresses views in complete accordance with those here advocated. He says:--"The next long era, the Cretaceous, was more remarkable for slow accumulation of rock under the sea than for the formation of new land. During that time the Atlantic sent its waters across the whole of Europe and into Asia. But they were probably nowhere more than a few hundred feet deep over the site of our continent, even at their deepest part. Upon their <b>bottom</b> there <b>gathered</b> a vast mass of calcareous mud, composed in great part of foraminifera, corals, echinoderms, and molluscs. Our English chalk, which ranges across the north of France, Belgium, Denmark, and the north of Germany, represents a portion of the deposits of that sea-floor." [...] The weighty authority of the Director-General of the Geological Survey may perhaps cause some geologists to modify their views as to the deep-sea origin of chalk, who would have treated any arguments advanced by myself as not worthy of consideration.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{represents}} {{one of a series}} describing the regional Octocorallian fauna along the coasts of Japan and deals only with the material collected chiefly from deep waters of Tosa Bay and its environs, Sikoku, southern Japan. The material dealt with comes from several sources. The majority was obtained from <b>bottom</b> samples <b>gathered</b> in 1953 by bull trawlers for offshore bottom-fishes, and kindly submitted to me for examination by Prof. T. KAMOHARA of Kochi University to whom I wish to express my indebtedness. The details of localities, etc. are thus not clearly available. A part (Melithaea ocracea) was collected by Mr. M. HoRI of the Osaka Municipal Museum of. Natural History and is lodged in that Museum. In addition, I have had an opportunity of examining the late Dr. Kumao KINOSHITA's collection of gorgonaceans from Tosa Bay which is now contained in the collections of the Zoological Institute, Tokyo University. My thanks are due to Dr. Itiro TOMIYAMA of Misaki Marine Biological Station of Tokyo University for enabling me to examine specimens among KINOSHITA's collection and certain other specimens for comparison. My thanks are also due to Mr. Frederick M. BAYER, associate curator of the U. S. National Museum, Washington, for help and useful informations concerning the identification of Japanese telestids. A list of the species collected from Tosa Bay is given below...|$|R
40|$|Due to its complex {{history of}} deformation, which {{includes}} subduction, rifting, and transtensional motions, the California Continental Borderland provides an interesting geological setting for studying how {{the structure of}} oceanic and continental plates responds to deformation. We calculate Ps and Sp receiver functions at permanent stations of the Southern California Seismic Network as well as ocean <b>bottom</b> seismometer data <b>gathered</b> {{as part of the}} ALBACORE seismic experiment in 2010 - 2011. Our results indicate that the Outer Borderland has been translated with little to no internal deformation, while the Inner Borderland underwent significant crustal thinning to compensate for the 90 degree clockwise rotation of the western Transverse Range block. We detect an oceanic seismic lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary at 58 km depth west of the Patton Escarpment. Sp common conversion point stacks confirm wholesale lithospheric thinning of the Inner Borderland and suggest the presence of a slab fragment beneath the Outer Borderland...|$|R
