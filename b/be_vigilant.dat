5|$|The adult robin is preyed upon by hawks, cats, and snakes, {{but when}} feeding in flocks, it can <b>be</b> <b>vigilant</b> and watch other birds for {{reactions}} to predators. Brown-headed cowbirds lay eggs in robin nests (see brood parasite), but robins usually reject the cowbird eggs.|$|E
5|$|In larger lek groups {{there is}} less risk of predation. In a group there are more {{individuals}} to alert the group about an approaching predator. All the birds in the groups will <b>be</b> <b>vigilant</b> in looking for a predator because there is an advantage to seeing the predator first. There is also the risk that in a bigger group there will more false alarm signals. The common signal is vocalization, after which the birds will fly up into the trees. It was found the birds did not however give this signal {{when there was a}} snake.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} issuing a {{convective}} watch {{begins with a}} conference call from SPC to local NWS offices. If after collaboration a watch is deemed necessary, the Storm Prediction Center will issue a watch approximation product which {{is followed by the}} local NWS office issuing a specific county-based watch product. The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone(s) of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message informing the public of the meaning behind the watch and to <b>be</b> <b>vigilant</b> of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.|$|E

5|$|Heinlein {{draws an}} analogy between the human {{society in the}} novel, which is well-to-do but needs to <b>be</b> <b>vigilant</b> against the imperialist threat of the Arachnids, and U.S. society of the 1950s. Reviewers have {{suggested}} that the Arachnids are Heinlein's analogue for communists. Traits used to support this include the communal nature of the Arachnids, which makes them capable of a much higher degree of coordination than the humans. Bug society is once explicitly described as communist, and is moreover depicted as communist by nature; this has been read as implying that those with a different political ideology are analogous to alien beings. The related motifs of alien invasion, of being patriotic to one's people, and personal sacrifice during war, are present, as are other aspects of U.S. popular culture of the 1950s. Commentators have argued that Heinlein's portrayal of aliens, as well as being a reference to people in communist countries, invokes the trope of a return to the frontier. The concept of the frontier includes a social-Darwinist argument of constantly fighting for survival, even at the expense of indigenous people or, in the case of Starship Troopers, of aliens. Heinlein suggests that without territorial expansion involving violent conquest of other races, humans would be destroyed. Scholar Jamie King has stated that Heinlein does not address the question of what the military government and Federal Service would do in peacetime, and argues that Heinlein has set up a society designed to be continuously at war, and to keep expanding its territory.|$|E

25|$|In December 1964 Chaerul Saleh of the Murba Party (formed {{by former}} PKI leader Tan Malaka) claimed that PKI was {{preparing}} a coup. The PKI demanded {{a ban on}} the Murba Party, which was enforced by Sukarno in early 1965. In the context of Konfrontasi with Malaysia, the PKI called for 'arming the people'. Large sectors of the army were opposed to this. Sukarno remained officially non-committal. In July around 2000 PKI members started military training near Halim Air Force Base. Notably the concept of 'arming the people' had won support among the Air Force and the Navy. On 8 September PKI demonstrators initiated a two-day siege of the US Consulate in Surabaya. On 14 September Aidit addressed a PKI rally, urging members to <b>be</b> <b>vigilant</b> of things to come.

500|$|Most notably, he {{performed}} {{the first ever}} kidney transplant in the UK, at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Woodruff {{had been waiting for}} the right patient for some time, hoping to find a patient with an identical twin to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960. [...] Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease. Woodruff thought that he had to <b>be</b> <b>vigilant</b> with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation. From then until his retirement in 1976, {{he performed}} 127 kidney transplants. Also in 1960, Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs, a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote. He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'.|$|E
500|$|With {{relation}} to writing, Periyar stated that using the Tamil script about the arts, which are {{useful to the}} people in their life and foster knowledge, talent and courage, and propagating them among the masses, will enlighten the people. Further, he explained that it will enrich the language, and thus it can be regarded as a zeal for Tamil. Periyar also stated that if words of North Indian origin (Sanskrit) are removed from Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, only Tamil will be left. On the Brahmin usage of Tamil, he stated how the Tamil spoken by the Andhras and the Malayalee peoples was far better than the Tamil spoken by the Brahmins. Periyar believed that Tamil language will make the Dravidian people unite under the banner of Tamil culture, and that it will make the Kannadigas, Andhras and the Malayalees <b>be</b> <b>vigilant.</b> With regards to a Dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language, Periyar stated that [...] "a time will come for unity. This will go on until there is an end to the North Indian domination. We shall reclaim an independent sovereign state for us".|$|E

40|$|International audienceCollective {{detection}} of predators {{is one of}} the main advantages of living in groups in prey species. However, the mechanisms linking individual and collective vigilance remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated individual and collective vigilance in a natural population of greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), a gregarious ruminant living under high predation risk. Controlling for environmental, individual and group factors, we show that the proportion of time during which at least one individual <b>was</b> <b>vigilant</b> increased with group size, whereas individual investment in vigilance decreased. We also show that individuals tended to synchronize both vigilance and feeding activities. More generally, and whatever the considered group size, we demonstrate how the independent scanning assumption underestimated both the proportion of time during which no individual <b>was</b> <b>vigilant</b> and the proportion of time during which all individuals <b>were</b> simultaneously <b>vigilant,</b> but overestimated the proportion of time during which one <b>vigilant</b> individual only <b>was</b> present. Our results thus contrast with the point of view that the alternative to independent vigilance is coordinated vigilance and plead for a better description of the processes whereby reciprocal influences between individuals shape collective patterns of vigilance...|$|R
