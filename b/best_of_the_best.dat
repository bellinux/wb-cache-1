At the inaugural <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Best</b> event, a show somewhat atypical of CZW in that it is a tournament spotlighting athletic junior heavyweight wrestling as opposed to violent hardcore matches, the two advanced past the first round in a three-way match with Nick Mondo where the stipulation was whoever took the fall would be eliminated. They were then matched against each other in the second round, with Jay winning and advancing further. This match was seen by fans as the best of the tournament, and seen in retrospect as having been responsible in large part for helping launch the brothers' careers, as they were new to the independent circuit and very young at the time.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2001 {{and into}} 2002, CZW's {{territory}} (that is, the area at which they held {{the majority of their}} events) was shifting from Sewell, New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to hold events regularly at the old ECW arena, beginning with December 15's Cage of Death 3. At this event, they faced Nick Gage and Nate Hatred, but wore masks and were identified as The Midnight Outlaws. This was likely to get around the fact that Jay was only 17 and Mark only 16 at the time; this meant, as they were under 18 years of age, that they could not legally work in a sport wrestling exhibition in the state of Pennsylvania. As CZW regularly began holding shows in the Philadelphia area, the Midnight Outlaws made appearances at the next four CZW events. At A Higher Level of Pain on April 13, 2002, Jay appeared across the ring from the Midnight Outlaws, tagging with Ruckus against Mark and someone else. By this time, he had turned 18. Jay and Ruckus were won the match, and this was the last time either Jay or Mark appeared for CZW until April 12, 2003, where Jay and Mark both returned for <b>Best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Best</b> 3. Jay was a surprise entrant after being taunted by A.J. Styles, and Mark filling in for the injured Ruckus. Jay advanced to the semi finals, where he lost to B-Boy, and Mark lost his fill-in match to Sonjay Dutt. The two faced off with the Backseat Boyz for the CZW World Tag Team Championship at Truth or Consequences on June 14, but failed to win the belts.|$|E

Normally, a student who wants to attend the Medical School (Faculdade de Medicina) at one of the Portuguese public universities which exclusively offer this graduation course, has to get very high grades in the entrance exams (it may include exams in fields like chemistry, biology, and mathematics) and to have done an almost-brilliant secondary school course. Admission marks of the applicants admitted in medicine, are never less than 180 out of 200. Architecture, economics, a number of engineerings, dentistry, law, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine at most public universities, are, in general, another examples of courses which are traditionally the most selective or popular. In contrast with these, like in any other educational system in the world, there are many courses offered by private universities, polytechnic institutes, and public universities, where the entrance requirements are sharply below the average. There are also some courses with low or even no demand and condemned to be extinguished.|$|E

Also in August, ESPN reported that McGary had narrowed his list of schools to six: University of Florida, University of Maryland, University of North Carolina, University of Michigan, Duke University and University of Kentucky. Because McGary does not like to be the bearer of bad news, when he narrowed his list, he had his father contact the coaches of the teams no longer in contention for his services.

McGary completed his official campus visits to University of Michigan, University of North Carolina, and Duke University, in that order, by October 4.

500|$|In 2014, Major League Baseball {{introduced}} the Trevor Hoffman National League Reliever of the Year Award, which is awarded annually {{to the top}} reliever in the NL. [...] Hoffman became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame starting in 2016. In his debut, he fell short of the 75 percent of votes required for entry, but the 67.3 percent he received {{in his first year}} was promising for possible induction in the future. [...] No career reliever has reached Cooperstown on the first ballot, and only six relievers have been inducted. In 2017, Hoffman received 74 percent of the vote, falling five votes short of induction. Lee Smith, the all-time saves leader for 12 years before he was surpassed by Hoffman, was not inducted in 2017 in his 15th and final year on the ballot. Buster Olney of ESPN says any discussion of Hoffman's deficiencies in the postseason and All-Star Games are small samples compared to his incredible body of work over 18 years. [...] Zimniuch wrote that Hoffman and Rivera are [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> of the one-inning closers". Less than 10 percent of Hoffman's saves were over one inning. Closers as a whole have been criticized for pitching almost exclusively in the ninth inning with no runners on base, while star relievers previously were called firemen, entering games in the middle of innings with runners on base and capable of pitching multiple innings. Saves arguably became overrated as firemen gave way to closers. However, Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2007 proposed that 500 saves (let alone 600) would be enough for him to validate Hoffman's induction if Sutter was invited with his 300 career saves. Moreover, Hoffman might have accumulated much more than 601 saves had he played for more successful teams. During his tenure in San Diego, the Padres won at least 90 games only twice and had nine losing seasons, including five with no more than 70 wins. Hall of Fame voter Dan Graziano of the Newark Star-Ledger said, [...] "I don't think much of the save as a stat, but I'm looking at a guy who's been a lockdown closer for more than a decade. Closers are a real and important part of the game, and either he or Rivera has been the best one for the past decade." [...] Some opponents of Hoffman's induction, including Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports and Keith Law of ESPN.com, maintain that his limited innings mitigate his impact compared to starting pitchers who have not been inducted, while Joe Posnanski of NBC Sports and writer Joe Sheehan posit that those starters could have excelled as closers, but Hoffman would not have succeeded as a starter. Hoffman pitched [...] innings in his career, which tops only Sutter (1,042) among pitchers already inducted in the Hall of Fame.|$|E
