5000|$|Each record {{within the}} {{database}} defines a patent family, the grouping of patent documentation recorded {{at the various}} patent offices as protection of an invention is sought around the world.

On this basis, the database has some 20 million [...] "inventions", corresponding to tens of millions of patents, with almost a million new inventions added each year. From 2008, the number format of the <b>Basic</b> <b>patent</b> identifier (the Accession number) changed, to allow up to 3.6 million records per year to be added, as the previous format only allowed a maximum of 1 million new records a year.

50|$|However, in a {{legal action}} {{involving}} Bower and Dill, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals determined that Kerwin, Klein and Sarace were the true inventors of the self-aligned silicon gate transistor. On that basis, they were awarded the <b>basic</b> <b>patent</b> US 3,475,234 (the US patent system awards the <b>basic</b> <b>patent</b> to the party that first makes the invention, not the party that first files a patent application, per rules at that time). Bower's work described the self-aligned-gate MOSFET, made with both aluminum and polysilicon gates. It used both ion implantation and diffusion to form the source and drain using the gate electrode as the mask to define the source and drain regions. The Bell Labs team attended this meeting of the IEDM in 1966, and they discussed this work with Bower after his presentation in 1966. Bower believed he had first made the self-aligned gate using aluminum as the gate and, before presentation in 1966, made the device using polysilicon as the gate. However, {{he was not able}} to prove it to the appellate court, who sided with the Bell Labs team.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{benchmarks}} {{the patent}} activities {{of a sample}} of OECD countries against the world frontier and explores {{the sources of the}} cross-country differences in patenting (regarded as a proxy for innovation). A patent production frontier is estimated for a panel of 21 OECD countries over the 1990 - 2002 period using Stochastic Frontier Analysis. Patenting performance for each country is decomposed into <b>basic</b> <b>patenting</b> capacity and patenting efficiency. The gap between Europe and the world leaders in terms of <b>basic</b> <b>patenting</b> capacity remains substantial with little sign of convergence over the sample period. In terms of patenting efficiency, Japan, Germany and Italy have improved their relative position in recent years. The gap in patenting performance between the UK and the world frontier is due to relative underperformance in both patenting capacity and efficiency in patent production. Institutional factors are found to be significantly associated with the patenting efficiency of an economy.

5000|$|Other patent holders {{are in the}} {{business}} of inventing new [...] "computer implemented inventions" [...] and then commercializing the inventions by licensing the patents to other companies that manufacture the inventions.
