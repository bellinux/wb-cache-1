The studies related to onset of chaos in one- dimensional discrete systems modeled by nonlinear maps, have been quite intense and exhaustive during the last two decades.

We have also studied the influence of doping, boundary condition and length of the superlattice on the self-sustained oscillations. Our study shows that there are <b>bistability</b> <b>regions</b> where either self-sustained current oscillations or steady states are reached depending on the initial condition.

Serially and parallel-coupled identical chains (System 1 and System 2), with the self-attractive on-site cubic nonlinearity, are considered in one dimension. In these two systems, which can be readily implemented as arrays of nonlinear optical waveguides, symmetric, antisymmetric and asymmetric solitons are investigated {{by means of the}} variational approximation (VA) and numerical methods. The VA demonstrates that the antisymmetric solitons exist in the entire parameter space, while the symmetric and asymmetric modes can be found below some critical value of the coupling parameter. Numerical results confirm these predictions for the symmetric and asymmetric fundamental modes. The existence region of numerically found antisymmetric solitons is also limited by a certain value of the coupling parameter. The symmetric solitons are destabilized via a supercritical symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation, which gives rise to stable asymmetric solitons, in both systems.

Above a critical rotation speed, from an axisymmetric turbulent base state a non-axisymmetric fluctuating gravity-wave state develops, with anm= 1 azimuthal wave number. The bifurcation is discontinuous and presents hysteresis. In contrast to previously reported work (MujicaNand LathropD 2006 J. Fluid Mech. 51 49 – 62), here we compare our experimental results with a universal model based on a quintic subcritical amplitude equation with additive noise. In general, the model describes correctly the mean free-surface oscillation amplitude and its fluctuations, although differences exist in the <b>bistability</b> <b>region</b> width and the free-surface fluctuations in the gravity wave state. These differences are due to the finite time measurements and non-linear effects, respectively. Indeed, we show that longer measurement times allow the system to transit in either direction (from or to the base state), which results in the shrinking of the <b>bistability</b> <b>region.</b> For very long measurement times, and in a very narrow range of rotation rates, the system presents a series of random reversals between both states.

40|$|To fully {{exploit the}} promise of {{molecular}} materials for advanced applications {{a thorough understanding of}} supramolecular structure-properties relationships is needed, a non-trivial problem because non-additive, collective behavior appears as a result of intermolecular interactions. We present a model for interacting polar and polarizable molecules that applies to clusters (films, crystals, aggregates [...] .) of D-π-A molecules for molecular electronics and/or NLO applications. The model is based on a two-state description of the isolated molecules, validated by an extensive spectroscopic study of solvated molecules. Classical electrostatic interactions in molecular clusters are then accounted for in a bottom-up theoretical approach that parallels the synthetic strategy. We demonstrate that the molecular polarity, and hence all molecular properties are largely affected by supramolecular interactions: the same molecule behaves in qualitatively different ways in different environments. Even more important, brand new phenomena appear in molecular materials with no counterpart at the molecular level. These phenomena largely extend the scope of potential application of molecular materials. In particular, in lattices with attractive interactions, large <b>bistability</b> <b>regions</b> appear where the material can be switched between two different regimes by slight variations of external conditions.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{generalization}} of investigation materials {{performed by the}} authors {{in recent years and}} analysis of obtained results. The subject of the paper is accounting of many-particle interactions in molecular J-aggregates at their resonance excitation by laser radiation. In this case, not only twin interactions are taken into considerations, but also the interactions of a given particle with three and more particles simultaneously. Three basic directions can be denoted among carried out investigations. The first direction is connected with derivation (from the first principles) of motion equations for molecular of J-aggregates in view of many-particle interactions, and also twin correlations between particles. The derivation of equations from the first principles leads in general to the system of coupled equations for the means of products of n operators relating to n different molecules. Since n increases in every following equation, the problems arise, connected with uncoupling of this system and also factorization of the means with the highest n. The most difficult and complicated problem in this process is correct calculation of relaxed terms, arising due to exciton-exciton annihilation. The first direction is connected concretely with solution of all above mentioned problems. Within the second direction the study of bistability has been carried out on the basis of obtained equations, in view of three-particle interactions. Meanwhile primary attention has been concentrated on analysis of homogeneous regimes in J-aggregates. It has been shown, in particular, that accounting of many-particle contributions leads to the shift of <b>bistability</b> boundary into <b>region</b> of smaller constants of exciton-exciton annihilation.

There are three stages {{during the whole}} course of the reaction: transitional period, the IP, and the post-IP. Two bifurcations are observed in this unique system: It starts with monostability (orange reduced steady-state) during the transitional period, switches to bistability (both blue oxidized and orange reduced steady-states) during the IP, and then eventually bifurcates to monostability (orange reduced steady-state) during {{the end of the}} IP. The stable orange steady-state is always excitable during the whole course of the reaction. The stable blue steady-state is not excitable during the blue IP: pulses cannot propagate and pacemakers cannot survive during this interval. As the medium ages, waves decrease their propagation speed except for the reduction step that speeds up during the end of the IP. We also investigate the change of ferroin and ferriin concentrations and photosensitivity during the IP. We find no analog to the situation suggested in the bromate-MA-ruthenium system, in that the oxidized state is experimentally excluded as the photosensitive species in this bromate-CHD-ferroin system.

40|$|The {{boiling water}} {{reactors}} (BWRs) are inherently nonlinear physical system, {{as any other}} physical system. The reactivity feedback, which is caused by both moderator density and temperature, allows several effects reflecting the nonlinear behavior of the system. Stability analyses of BWR is done with a simplified, reduced order model, which couples point reactor kinetics with thermal hydraulics of the reactor core. The linear stability analysis of the BWR for steady states shows that at a critical value of bifurcation parameter (i. e. feedback gain), Hopf bifurcation occurs. These stable and unstable domains of parametric spaces cannot be predicted by linear stability analysis because the stability of system does not include only stability of the steady states. The stability of other dynamics of the system such as limit cycles must be included in study of stability. The nonlinear stability analysis (i. e. bifurcation analysis) becomes an indispensable component of stability analysis in this scenario. Hopf bifurcation, which occur with one free parameter, is studied here and it formulates birth of limit cycles. The excitation of these limit cycles makes the system bistable {{in the case of}} subcritical bifurcation whereas stable limit cycles continues in an unstable region for supercritical bifurcation. The distinction between subcritical and supercritical Hopf is done by two parameter analysis (i. e. codimension- 2 bifurcation). In this scenario, Generalized Hopf bifurcation (GH) takes place, which separates sub and supercritical Hopf bifurcation. The various types of bifurcation such as limit point bifurcation of limit cycle (LPC), period doubling bifurcation of limit cycles (PD) and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation of limit cycles (NS) have been identified with the Floquet multipliers.
