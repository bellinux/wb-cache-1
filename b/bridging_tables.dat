Many {{practitioners}} and researchers advocate that the de-signs {{of the data}} models of the data warehouses should incorporate the source data {{as much as possible}} to answer the finest levels of queries. On the other hand, the source data are very likely to come from systems de-signed with ER Diagrams. Therefore, many researches have been devoted to design methodologies to build multidimensional model based on cor-responding source ER diagrams. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no algorithm has been proposed to systematically translates an entire ER Diagram into a multidimensional model with hierarchical snowflake structures. The algorithm proposed in the paper promised to do so with two characteristics, namely, grain preservation and minimal dis-tance from each table to the fact table. Grain preservation characteristic guarantees that translated multidimensional model has cohesive granu-larity among entities. The minimal distance characteristics guarantees that if an entity can be connected to the fact table in the derived model with more than one paths, the one with the shortest hops will always be chosen. The first characteristic is achieved by translating problematic relationships between entities with weight factor attributes in <b>bridging</b> <b>tables</b> and enhancing fact tables with unique primary keys. The second characteristic is achieved by including a revised shortest path algorithm in the translating algorithm with the distance being calculated as the number of relationships required between entities. ...|$|E

5000|$|Around 14,000 {{tables were}} made and a few {{thousand}} sold. The sales were so brisk during the Christmas season of 1932 that the Marshall Field's department store in Chicago had taxicabs waiting at the factory to pick up lots {{of four or five}} tables and deliver them immediately to the store for their pre-Christmas sales. In the month of December the profits from the electric <b>bridge</b> <b>tables</b> were $75,000 which saved the Hammond Clock Company temporarily. The price was $25. The deluxe model sold for $40. This was expensive for the time, as the income in the United States had fallen due to the depression. [...] The electric <b>bridge</b> <b>table</b> was presented at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, but sales declined after that and within a couple of years production was discontinued altogether.|$|R

By 1932, over one hundred clock {{companies}} {{had gone out of}} business due to the Great Depression but Hammond was determined to remain solvent and created new products for the company to sell. One such product was an automatic card dealer. Hammond was a bridge player and a mechanical engineer and he put the two together and invented the Hammond Electric <b>Bridge</b> <b>Table.</b> This was an automatic playing card dealing apparatus that was specifically designed for use in contract bridge. The electric bridge mechanism was patented on November 29, 1932 and the patent for the card table that contained it was filed the day before. It was the first <b>bridge</b> <b>table</b> to automatically shuffle and deal cards using electricity.|$|R
