5|$|As a {{consequence}} of {{his role in the}} death of the god Baldr, Loki (described as father of Fenrir) is bound on top of three stones with the internal organs of his son Narfi (which are turned into iron) in three places. There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the jötunn Skaði. Loki's wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, <b>but</b> <b>whenever</b> she leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki's face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of Ragnarök.|$|E

Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, <b>but</b> <b>whenever</b> she had to empty the bowl the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.|$|E

25|$|In 1889, {{coming to}} the aid of his good friend C.E. Green, Lucas began to play for Essex, in which he had been {{residing}} since 1883, and captaining the side until 1894. However, he played only two first-class matches from 1890 to 1893 and when Essex joined the County Championship in 1895, his profession restricted Lucas to a few games in 1895 and 1896. He then played fairly regularly for Essex until 1901, and if not quite the outstanding batsman of twenty years beforehand, Lucas still was a model of soundness and style. His work as a banker again began to severely restrict his cricket from 1902, <b>but</b> <b>whenever</b> he could play Lucas remained valuable up to his last match at the age of fifty.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24, 1910. It states: [...] "Life in a country town is often tedious and tiresome, and {{were it not for}} the little dinners and teas the townsfolk are constantly given, existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed. So the time honored get-togethers of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay. The Gales thought well of this established feature. They made it a joyous occasion for themselves as well as their guests. They were hardly an overly wealthy family, and their table was never notable for an oversupply of the good things of life, <b>but</b> <b>whenever</b> they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time." ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison acted quite {{independently}} {{in selecting}} his cabinet, {{much to the}} dismay of the Republican bosses. He began by delaying the presumed nomination of James G. Blaine as Secretary of State so as to preclude Blaine's involvement {{in the formation of the}} administration, as had occurred in President Garfield's term. In fact, other than Blaine, the only Republican boss initially nominated was Redfield Proctor, as Secretary of War. Senator Shelby Cullom's comment symbolizes Harrison's steadfast aversion to use federal positions for patronage: [...] "I suppose Harrison treated me as well as he did any other Senator; <b>but</b> <b>whenever</b> he did anything for me, it was done so ungraciously that the concession tended to anger rather than please." [...] Harrison's selections shared particular alliances – such as their service in the Civil War, Indiana citizenship and membership in the Presbyterian Church. Nevertheless, Harrison with these choices had alienated pivotal Republican operatives from New York to Pennsylvania to Iowa and prematurely compromised his political power and future. Harrison's normal schedule provided for two full cabinet meetings per week, as well as separate weekly one-on-one meetings with each cabinet member.|$|E

Michael Paoletta of Billboard considered it as one of Charmbracelets stand-out tracks, while Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani said [...] "Boy (I Need You)", along with [...] "You Got Me", [...] "provide further evidence that Carey should keep her rappers on the remix." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted that Carey did not [...] "completely abandon hip-hop, <b>but</b> <b>whenever</b> it rears its head on Charmbracelet, it's utterly jarring" [...] citing the song as an example, while describing the sampled vocal hook as [...] "annoying". Erlewine, however, selected it as a Track Pick from the album review. The single failed to make much impact on the charts around the world; it reached number 68 on the US Billboard Hip-Hop/R Songs chart and number 57 on the US Hot Singles Sales chart. Elsewhere, the song reached number 17 in the United Kingdom, while peaking within the top 40 in Australia, the Netherlands, Ireland and New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Peel (presumably one of {{the liberal}} proprietors with {{excellent}} regulations who assured his support) introduced his Bill in 1802.

[...] Having other pursuits, it was not often in my power to visit the factories, <b>but</b> <b>whenever</b> such visits were made, I was struck with the uniform appearance of bad health, and, in many cases, stinted growth of the children; the hours of labour were regulated by the interest of the overseer, whose remuneration depending on the quantity of the work done, he was often induced to make the poor children work excessive hours, and to stop their complaints by trifling bribes ...|$|E

[...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E
