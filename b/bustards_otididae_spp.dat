5000|$|There {{are only}} two suprafamilial clades (natural groups) among the birds {{traditionally}} classified as Gruiformes. Rails (Rallidae), flufftails (Sarothruridae), finfoots and sungrebe (Heliornithidae), adzebills (Aptornithidae), trumpeters (Psophiidae), limpkin (Aramidae), and cranes (Gruidae) compose the suborder Grues and are termed [...] "core-Gruiformes" [...] (Fain et al. 2007). These are the only true Gruiformes. The suborder Eurypygae includes the kagu (Rhynochetidae) and sunbittern (Eurypygidae). These are not even remotely related to Grues. The families of mesites or roatelos (Mesitornithidae), button-quails (Turnicidae), Australian plains-wanderer (Pedionomidae), seriemas (Cariamidae), and <b>bustards</b> (<b>Otididae)</b> each represent distinct and unrelated lineages. Many families known only from fossils have been assigned to the Gruiformes, e.g., Ergilornithidae, Phorusrhacidae, Messelornithidae, Eogruidae, Idiornithidae, Bathornithidae, {{to name just a}} few (see below). Though some of these are superficially 'crane-like' and the possibility that some may even be related to extant families traditionally included in the Gruiformes, there are no completely extinct families that can be confidently assigned to core-Gruiformes.|$|R
50|$|The karoo korhaan (Eupodotis vigorsii), {{also known}} as karoo bustard, is a species of bird in the <b>bustard</b> family <b>Otididae</b> from Southern Africa. The species is {{sometimes}} placed in the genus Heterotetrax. It is the sister-species to Rüppell's korhaan, and the two species are sometimes considered conspecific (the same species). There are two subspecies, the nominate race, from south-eastern South Africa, and E. v. namaqua (Roberts, 1932), from north-eastern South Africa and southern Namibia.|$|R
50|$|Burhinus {{was first}} {{described}} by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger in 1811. Determining the correct placement {{of this family}} can be difficult as they are very ancient species. Burhinus are best placed in Charadriiformes. They resemble <b>bustards</b> (family: <b>Otididae)</b> and have been previously classified with them in Gruiformes. Their placement in Gruiformes is considered convergent evolution, as both orders have the same lifestyle and biotopes. Comparisons made of skeleton, biochemistry and parasites plus down on young, confirm Burhinus as a charadriiform.|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{relationships}} among birds in Neoaves, the clade comprising {{the vast majority}} of avian diversity, have vexed systematists due to the ancient, rapid radiation of numerous lineages. We applied a new phylogenomic approach to resolve relationships in Neoaves using target enrichment (sequence capture) and high-throughput sequencing of ultraconserved elements (UCEs) in avian genomes. We collected sequence data from UCE loci for 32 members of Neoaves and one outgroup (chicken) and analyzed data sets that differed in their amount of missing data. An alignment of 1, 541 loci that allowed missing data was 87 % complete and resulted in a highly resolved phylogeny with broad agreement between the Bayesian and maximum-likelihood (ML) trees. Although results from the 100 % complete matrix of 416 UCE loci were similar, the Bayesian and ML trees differed to a greater extent in this analysis, suggesting that increasing from 416 to 1, 541 loci led to increased stability and resolution of the tree. Novel results of our study include surprisingly close relationships between phenotypically divergent bird families, such as tropicbirds (Phaethontidae) and the sunbittern (Eurypygidae) as well as between <b>bustards</b> (<b>Otididae)</b> and turacos (Musophagidae). This phylogeny bolsters support for monophyletic waterbird and landbird clades and also strongly supports controversial results from previous studies, including the sister relationship between passerines and parrots and the non-monophyly of raptorial birds in the hawk and falcon families. Although significant challenges remain to fully resolving some of the deep relationships in Neoaves, especially among lineage...|$|R
40|$|The Bengal Florican is a 'Critically Endangered' <b>bustard</b> (<b>Otididae)</b> {{restricted}} to India, Nepal and southern Indochina. Fewer than 500 birds {{are estimated to}} remain in the Indian subcontinent, whilst the Indochinese breeding population is primarily {{restricted to}} grasslands surrounding the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. We conducted the first comprehensive breeding season survey of Bengal Florican within the Tonle Sap region (19, 500 km 2). During 2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07 we systematically sampled 1 -km squares for territorial males. Bengal Florican were detected within 90 1 -km squares at a mean density of 0. 34 males km- 2 which, accounting for unequal survey effort across grassland blocks, provides a mean estimate of 0. 2 males km- 2. Based on 2005 habitat extent, the estimated Tonle Sap population is 416 adult males (333 - 502 ± 95 % CI), {{more than half of them}} in Kompong Thom province. Tonle Sap grasslands are rapidly being lost due to intensification of rice cultivation and, based on satellite images, we document declines of 28 % grassland cover within 10 grassland blocks between January 2005 and March 2007. Based on mean 2005 population densities the remaining grassland may support as few as 294 adult male florican, a decline of 30 % since 2005. In response to these habitat declines almost 350 km 2 of grassland have been designated as protected areas, set aside for biodiversity and local livelihoods. Conservation activities in these areas include participatory land-use zoning, patrols reporting new developments to government officials, awareness-raising and incentive-led nest protection schemes...|$|R
40|$|Summary in English. Bibliography: p. 221 - 242. The cranes (Gruidae) and <b>bustards</b> (<b>Otididae)</b> {{are highly}} {{threatened}} taxa. Many species {{are on the}} brink of extinction due to anthropogenic factors. On the positive side, several species show a remarkable ability to adapt to man-modified environments. If the cranes and bustards are to survive through the coming century, research on the aspects of their biology directly relevant to understanding their conservation requirements is a high priority. Without a reliable and relevant base of knowledge, no successful conservation management plan can be devised for each threatened species. This thesis presents information on three threatened members of these taxa in southern Africa, the Blue Crane Anthropoides paradiseus, and Ludwig's Neolis ludWigii and Stanley's N. denhami stanleyi Bustards. This information furthers our understanding of their conservation status. The thesis begins with a detailed review of the phylogeny, general biology and conservation status of cranes. This is necessitated by the absence of any thorough and recent review being available. The review provides a point of reference for the research results on the Blue Crane presented in the following seven chapters. Research on the Blue Crane largely focuses on the southwestern Cape and Karoo regions. The past and present distribution of the species in southern Africa is outlined and related to various vegetation types and the effect of various anthropogenic influences. Its colonization of the southwestern Cape is a particularly interesting finding. The abundance of the species in various parts of South Africa is discussed, largely based on road counts and bird atlas data. The total population size in South Africa is estimated and the previously unrecognised importance to the species of the southern Cape coastal plain between Botrivier and Mossel Bay is highlighted. The scarcity of Blue Cranes {{in the western part of}} the southwestern Cape, compared with the southern part, is quantified. The reasons for this anomolous dichotomy in abundance betweep these two superficially similar areas are unclear and worthy of further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Populations of Houbara Bustards have {{dramatically}} declined in recent years. Captive breeding and reintroduction programs have had limited success in reviving population numbers and thus new technological solutions involving molecular methods {{are essential for}} the long term survival of this species. In this study, we sequenced the 694 bp segment of COI gene of the four specimens of Asian Houbara Bustard (Chlamydotis undulata macqueenii). We also compared these sequences with earlier published barcodes of 11 individuals comprising different families of the orders Gruiformes, Ciconiiformes, Podicipediformes and Crocodylia (out group). The pair-wise sequence comparison showed a total of 254 variable sites across all the 15 sequences from different taxa. Three of the four specimens of Houbara Bustard had an identical sequence of COI gene and one individual showed a single nucleotide difference (G > A transition at position 83). Within the <b>bustard</b> family (<b>Otididae),</b> comparison among the three species (Asian Houbara Bustard, Great Bustard (Otis tarda) and the Little Bustard (Tetrax tetrax)), representing three different genera, showed 116 variable sites. For another family (Rallidae), the intra-family variable sites among the individuals of four different genera were found to be 146. The COI genetic distances among the 15 individuals varied from 0. 000 to 0. 431. Phylogenetic analysis using 619 bp nucleotide segment of COI clearly discriminated all the species representing different genera, families and orders. All the four specimens of Houbara Bustard formed a single clade and are clearly separated from other two individuals of the same family (Otis tarda and Tetrax tetrax). The nucleotide sequence of partial segment of COI gene effectively discriminated the closely related species. This is the first study reporting the barcodes of Houbara Bustard and would be helpful in future molecular studies, particularly for the conservation of this threatened bird in Saudi Arabia...|$|R
