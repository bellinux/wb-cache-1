5|$|Lead {{can form}} {{multiply}} bonded chains, a property it shares with its lighter homolog, carbon. Its {{capacity to do}} so is much less because the Pb–Pb <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> is over three and a half times lower than that of the C–C bond. With itself lead can build metal–metal bonds of an order up to three. With carbon, lead forms organolead compounds similar to, but generally less stable than, typical organic compounds (due to the Pb–C bond being rather weak). This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide-ranging than that of tin. It predominantly forms organolead(IV) compounds, even when starting with inorganic lead(II) reactants; very few organolead(II) compounds are known. The most well-characterized exceptions are Pb2 and Pb(η5-C5H5)2.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At {{the bottom of}} the periodic table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known alkali metal displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh alkali metal, is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.|$|E
25|$|The carbon–fluorine bond {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} in organic {{chemistry}} (an average <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> around 480 kJ/mol). This is significantly stronger than the bonds of carbon with other halogens (an average <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> of e.g. C-Cl bond is around 320 kJ/mol) and {{is one of the}} reasons why fluoroorganic compounds have high thermal and chemical stability.|$|E

25|$|The boron atom of a boronic ester or acid is sp2 hybridized {{possessing}} a vacant p orbital, enabling these groups {{to act as}} Lewis acids. The C–B bond of boronic acids and esters are slightly longer than typical C–C single bonds {{with a range of}} 1.55-1.59 Å. The lengthened C–B bond relative to the C–C bond results in a <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> that is also slightly less than that of C–C bonds (323 kJ/mol for C–B vs 358 kJ/mol for C–C). The carbon–hydrogen bond has a bond length of about 1.09 Å, and a <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> of about 413 kJ/mol. The C–B bond is therefore a useful intermediate as a bond that replaces a typically unreactive C–H bond.|$|E

25|$|The energy {{needed to}} break a {{specific}} bond (generally covalent) between two atoms known as <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> {{is a result of}} all the relative attractions and repulsions between the atoms of the molecule, however the most relevant are the bond's atoms and the immediate neighbors. As an approximation the most important parameters that influence the bonding between two atoms in a molecule are the mutual energy match and overlap of covalent orbitals and the repulsion between nonbonding orbitals. Likewise, radicals requiring more energy to form are less stable than those requiring less energy. An additional barrier can be the selection rule. Propagation, however, is very exothermic.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} properties of deuterium compounds can exhibit significant kinetic isotope effects and other {{physical and chemical}} property differences from the hydrogen analogs. D2O, for example, is more viscous than H2O. Chemically, {{there are differences in}} <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> and length for compounds of heavy hydrogen isotopes compared to normal hydrogen, which are larger than the isotopic differences in any other element. Bonds involving deuterium and tritium are somewhat stronger than the corresponding bonds in hydrogen, and these differences are enough to cause significant changes in biological reactions. Pharmaceutical firms are interested in the fact that deuterium is harder to remove from carbon than hydrogen.|$|E
500|$|The <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> of difluorine is {{much lower}} than that of either [...] or [...] and similar to the easily cleaved {{peroxide}} bond; this, along with high electronegativity, accounts for fluorine's easy dissociation, high reactivity, and strong bonds to non-fluorine atoms. Conversely, bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine's high electronegativity. Unreactive substances like powdered steel, glass fragments, and asbestos fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas; wood and water spontaneously combust under a fluorine jet.|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} propertie_ ~ of clays {{are discussed}} under four rules which arise from considerations of file <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> of ions associated with charged surfaces. The mean free <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> of a cation {{associated with a}} negatively charged surface is determined by calculation from conventional potentiometric measurements with membrane lectrodes. The first three rules are concerned with ttle effects of valency upon ionization. They arise directly from the melhod of calculating cationic mean free <b>bonding</b> <b>energies,</b> applicable to monofunctional surfaces as regards Rule 3, and to polyfuncfional surfaces also as regards Rules 1 and 2. The fourth rule (Jarusov's rule) deals ~-i~tl mixtures of cations on polyfunelional surfaces. It may be expressed verbally by stating that the cation wilh the higher mean free <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> preempts those positions on the surface which manifest greater mean free <b>bonding</b> <b>energy.</b> The incidence of each rule is examined, using data from studies of cationic activities in clay systems. The factors which cause deviations from these idealized rules are discussed.

500|$|There {{are some}} {{theoretical}} indications that other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible. If {{they could be}} synthesised, they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, {{that could be used}} as powerful propellants or explosives. This is because they should all decompose to dinitrogen, whose N≡N triple bond (<b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> 946kJ⋅mol−1) is much stronger than those of the N=N double bond (418kJ⋅mol−1) or the N–N single bond (160kJ⋅mol−1): indeed, the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond. (The opposite is true for the heavier pnictogens, which prefer polyatomic allotropes.) A great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition, and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown tetrahedrane. This stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens azide (...) , pentazenium (...) , and pentazolide (cyclic aromatic [...] ). Under extremely high pressures (1.1millionatm) and high temperatures (2000K), as produced in a diamond anvil cell, nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded cubic gauche crystal structure. This structure {{is similar to that of}} diamond, and both have extremely strong covalent bonds, resulting in its nickname [...] "nitrogen diamond".|$|E

The interlayer <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> {{can be obtained by}} Giese's method, if the energy of separation of the layers over a distance A is plotted againts 1 /[d(001) + A]. Thus, for a polar chlorite the interlayer <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> is 69. 8 kJ/unit cell. Using the Madelung method, the interlayer <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> of slices of kaolinite having a thickness of d(001) is 84 k J/mole. Similarly the interlayer <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> of slices having a thickness d(020) is 2520 kJ/mole. To avoid the instability of the outer slices of the crystal caused by the cooperating dipole moments of all slices, the hypothesis was made that the atoms have in reality reduced charges and that the charge reduction is such that the dipole moment becomes zero. The adopted charges lower the interlayer <b>bonding</b> <b>energy</b> to as little as 14 kJ/mole. The interlayer interaction of slices of fluorkaolinite with thickness d(001) is repulsive. Crystals of a polar chlorite must be bounded either bY incomplete hydroxide layers or bY layers onto which charge-compensating a ions are adsorbed. Polarity makes cleavage in chlorite more difficult.

The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the dihydrogen cation, [...] One-electron bonds often have about half the <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called [...] "half bonds". However, there are exceptions: in the case of dilithium, the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron [...] than for the 2-electron Li2.

2500|$|The {{geometric}} mean is approximately {{equal to the}} arithmetic mean - which is applied in the first formula above - when the energies are of the similar value, e.g., except for the highly electropositive elements, {{where there is a}} larger difference of two dissociation energies; the {{geometric mean}} is more accurate and almost always gives a positive excess energy, due to ionic bonding. [...] The square root of this excess energy, Pauling notes, is approximately additive, and hence one can introduce the electronegativity. Thus, it is this semi-empirical formula for <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> that underlies Pauling electronegativity concept.|$|E
2500|$|Tetrahedral {{coordination}} {{is a major}} structural motif in silicon chemistry {{just as it is}} {{for carbon}} chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise as well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon, and thus octahedral coordination is also significant. For example, the electronegativity of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency towards catenation (formation of Si–Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon due to the concomitant weakening of the Si–Si bond compared to the C–C bond: the average Si–Si <b>bond</b> <b>energy</b> is approximately 226kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356kJ/mol for the C–C bond. This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the double bond rule. On the other hand, the presence of 3d orbitals in the valence shell of silicon suggests the possibility of hypervalence, as seen in five- and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as [...] and [...] Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behaviour, particularly in the behaviour of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a metalloid rather than a nonmetal. However, metallicity does not become clear until germanium and dominant until tin, with the growing importance of the lower +2 oxidation state.|$|E
