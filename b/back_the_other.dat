5|$|Before December was over, David {{marched into}} {{northern}} England, {{and by the}} end of January he had occupied the castles of Carlisle, Wark, Alnwick, Norham and Newcastle. By February David was at Durham, but an army led by King Stephen met him there. Rather than fight a pitched battle, a treaty was agreed whereby David would retain Carlisle, while David's son Henry was re-granted the title and half the lands of the earldom of Huntingdon, territory which had been confiscated during David's revolt. On Stephen's side he received <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> castles; and while David would do no homage, Stephen was to receive the homage of Henry for both Carlisle and the other English territories. Stephen also gave the rather worthless but for David face-saving promise that if he ever chose to resurrect the defunct earldom of Northumberland, Henry would be given first consideration. Importantly, the issue of Matilda was not mentioned. However, the first Durham treaty quickly broke down after David took insult at the treatment of his son Henry at Stephen's court.|$|E
5|$|Populous: The Beginning {{takes place}} before {{the first two games}} in the series. The player {{controls}} the Blue tribe, pitted against the three enemy tribes which control most of the solar system. The player's destiny as Shaman is to become a deity; only by defeating all the enemies in the system can the player's shaman become omnipotent. The player begins on the planet furthest from the sun, and attacks each planet in sequence. Along the way, the Shaman can learn new skills and magic to defeat her (usually) much more powerful enemies. Victory requires the player to either destroy the opposition, or on occasion perform special actions. The player loses if his or her Shaman is killed and there are no remaining followers, if the Shaman is killed and there is no circle of reincarnation, or the player runs out of time on timed levels. Upon beating <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> tribes, the Shaman ascends to godhood, and further helps her people conquer the Matak, Chumara and Dakini in one final conflict.|$|E
25|$|As {{three more}} {{companies}} of American infantry landed accompanied by General Pike, the grenadier {{company of the}} 8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot charged them with the bayonet. The grenadiers were already outnumbered and were repulsed with heavy loss. Pike ordered an advance by platoons, supported by two 6-pounder field guns, which steadily drove <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two companies of Sheaffe's redcoats (another company of the 8th regiment, and one from the Royal Newfoundland).|$|E

25|$|We {{have seen}} that forcing can be done using Boolean-valued models, by {{constructing}} a Boolean algebra with ultrafilter from a poset with a generic subset. It is also possible to go <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way: given a Boolean algebra B, we can form a poset P of all the nonzero elements of B, and a generic ultrafilter on B restricts to a generic set on P. So the techniques of forcing and Boolean-valued models are essentially equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Naucratis {{soon became}} a {{profound}} source of inspiration to the Greeks by re-exposing them to the wonders of Egyptian architecture and sculpture lost to them since the Bronze Age. Egyptian artifacts soon began their flow along the Greek trade routes finding {{their way into the}} homes and workshops of the Ionian Greek world and, via Aegina, the city-states of mainland Greece. Although Greek art and ideas in turn came <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way their absorption into a largely xenophobic Egyptian culture was strictly minimal.|$|E
25|$|Post-World War II {{construction}} projects included an entrance to Dallas from the north, and relocation {{of the main}} line across northern Arizona, between Seligman and Williams. In 1960, AT bought the Toledo, Peoria & Western Railroad (TP), then sold a half interest to the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). TP cut straight east across Illinois from near Fort Madison, Iowa, to a connection with PRR at Effner, Indiana, forming a bypass around Chicago for traffic moving between the two lines. The TP route did not mesh with the traffic pattern PRR successor Conrail developed after 1976, so AT bought <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> half, merged with TP in 1983, then sold it back into independence in 1989.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Championnet marched from Grenoble around 8 August 1799 with 25,000 troops {{split into}} four groups. The northernmost column crossed the Little St Bernard Pass to {{threaten}} Aosta and Ivrea while the next column south traversed the Mont Cenis Pass to Susa {{in order to}} menace Turin. Championnet accompanied a column of 8,000–9,000 men that crossed the Col de Montgenèvre and moved southeast to Fossano via Pinerolo. The southernmost column marched over the Maddalena Pass (Col de l'Argentière) into the Valle Stura di Demonte {{in the direction of}} Cuneo. On 16 September Paul Grenier with 8,000 defeated 5,000 Austrians under Friedrich Heinrich von Gottesheim at Fossano, inflicting 1,000 casualties for the loss of 200 men. Two days later at Savigliano, 20,000 Austrians led by Michael von Melas fell on Grenier's column and beat him, inflicting 2,000 casualties on the French while losing only 400. The French lost both Fossano and Savigliano and fell <b>back,</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> columns retreating as well. The northern column under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme withdrew after being blocked by Fort Bard.|$|E
25|$|Henry I had {{arranged}} his inheritance to pass {{to his daughter}} Matilda, but the latter's support amongst the English and Norman magnates and barons was compromised by her marriage to Geoffrey V, count of Anjou, as the Angevins were the traditional rivals of the Normans. Instead Stephen, younger brother of Theobald, count of Blois, seized the throne. David however {{had been the first}} lay person to take the oath to uphold the succession of Matilda in 1127, and when Stephen was crowned on 22 December, David decided to make war. Before December was over, David marched into northern England, {{and by the end of}} January he had occupied the castles of Carlisle, Wark, Alnwick, Norham and Newcastle. By February David was at Durham, but was met there by an army assembled and led by King Stephen. However, rather than fight a pitched battle, a treaty was agreed whereby David would retain Carlisle while David's son Henry was re-granted the title and half the lands of the earldom of Huntingdon, which had been confiscated during David's revolt, as well as the lordship of Doncaster. On Stephen's side he received <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> castles; and while David himself would do no homage, Stephen was to receive the homage of Henry for both Carlisle and the other English territories.

500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was very depressed that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E

2500|$|In using circulars to knit flat {{pieces of}} fabric the two ends are used just as two {{separate}} needles would be. [...] The knitter holds one tip {{in each hand}} and knits straight across {{the width of the}} fabric, turns the work, and knits or purls <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> way. [...] Using circular needles has some advantages, for example, the weight of the fabric is more evenly distributed, therefore less taxing, on the arms and wrists of the knitter and, the length of the cable may be longer than would be practical with rigid needles since the cable and fabric rest in the lap of the knitter rather than extending straight out past the arms.|$|E
2500|$|Raven {{travelled}} {{for many}} years {{along the coast of}} the Tlingit territory, first travelling south, having started in the north until he had gone so far south, beyond Tlingit territory until he reached the Mink people at which point he turned around and continued <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> direction. [...] He did this north south, south north journey for several years. [...] Not until his work along the coast was done, did he head inland along the Stikine river all the way to its source. [...] He also traveled along the Nass, Skeena, and Taku Rivers and all of their many streams never staying in one place for very long and never traveling far off from the water ways. [...] Through his inland journeys he met the Kaska, the Haida, and other nations to the east.|$|E

2500|$|The cup {{involves}} three players, {{arranged in}} a semi-circular cup-shaped formation, one {{in the middle and}} <b>back,</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two on the sides and forward. One of the side players marks the handler with a force, while the other two guard the open side. Therefore, the handler will normally have to throw into the cup, allowing the defenders to more easily make blocks. With a cup, usually the center cup blocks the up-field lane to cutters, while the side cup blocks the cross-field swing pass to other handlers. The center cup usually also has the responsibility to call out which of the two sides should mark the thrower, usually the defender closest to the sideline of the field. The idea of the cup is to force the offense into making many short passes behind and around the cup. The cup (except the marker) must also remember to stay 3 meters or more away from the offensive player with the disc. [...] The only time a player in the cups can come within 3 meters of the player with the disc is when another offensive player comes within 3 meters of the person with the disc, also known as [...] "crashing the cup".|$|E
2500|$|The {{men of the}} First and Third Brigades {{faced the}} same {{challenge}} faced by Second Brigade earlier in the day. [...] The vines in this area hung like ropes between the trees, {{and some of them}} boasted thorns three inches (76mm) [...] long. [...] Additionally, though Fourteen Mile Creek was just inches deep, the nearly vertical banks rose over [...] above the creek bed in places. [...] To compound the command problems created by the terrain, McPherson's men were operating under drum and bugle silence and orders had to be delivered by courier, causing the line to lurch forward unevenly. [...] The men of the 23rd Indiana Infantry Regiment experienced what must have seemed like a stroke of luck at the time—because of a turn in the creek, their right flank rested very near the creek. [...] With a little effort, the unit was across the creek and standing in formation. [...] In order to close the gap created by the march, the unit quick-stepped <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> direction looking {{for the rest of the}} brigade, and stumbled sideways into the jaws of the Confederate trap. The only thing that saved the 23rd Indiana Infantry from wholesale slaughter was the fact that the Confederates had never been issued bayonets.|$|E
