40|$|Researching {{into the}} {{condition}} of dispersion of blood-platelets in blood-vessels, the following results were obtained. 1) In {{the case of a}} normal rabbit, an injection of adrenalin caused a remarkable increase of blood-platelets as well as of white <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles,</b> but after. splenectomy, this increase did not occur. 2) When atropin was injected, the number of blood-platelets decreased proportion-ately with the decrease of the white <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> 3) An increase of blood-platelets was also demonstrable after administration of milk, presenting a condition which bore a resemblance to leucocytosis by digestion. But after splenectomy, administration of milk did not induce the increase of white <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> In this case the number of blood-platelets also tended to decrease. 4) After the operation of cutting the vagus nerves at the cervix, white blood corpus-cles as well as blood-platelets decreased in the peripheral blood-vessels, and in the spleen, the blood-platelets of the veins showed a greater increase than those of the arteries; this indicated that there was some difference from normal conditions. In this case, no increase of white <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> and of blood-platelets by digestion was observed in the peripheral vessels. The quantitative relation of these <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> in the splenic vessels remains constant (Namely, there are more <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> in the veins than in the arteries,) not only in the normal condition but also after cutting vagus nerves. 5) After cutting the cervical cord, a remarkable decrease of white <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> and of blood-platelets in the peripheral vessels was observed, and the splenic arteries and veins showed some difference from their normal condition, namely, there were more blood-platelets and red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> in the splenic veins than in the splenic arteries. In this case the changes by digestion, which were so remarkable in normal conditions, did not occur in any blood vessels.

40|$|Blood trauma {{caused by}} medical devices {{is a major}} concern. Complications {{following}} the implantation/application of devices such as prosthetic heart valves, cannulae, blood pumps, tubing, and throttles lead to sublethal and lethal damage to platelets and erythrocytes. This damage {{is provided by the}} alterations in fluid dynamics, providing a mechanical load on the blood corpuscle's membrane by means of the shear stress. An appropriate quantification of the shear-induced hemolysis of artificial organs is thought to be useful in the design and development of such devices in order to minimize device-induced blood trauma. To date, a power-law mathematical relationship using the time of exposure of a <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> to a certain mechanical load and the shear stress itself (derived under the peculiar condition of uniform shear stress) has served as a basic model for the estimation of the damage to blood, investigated by means of numerical and/or experimental fluid dynamical techniques. The aim of the present article is to highlight the effect of a time-varying mechanical loading acting on blood cells based on the usual power-law model; furthermore, the effect of the loading history of a blood particle is discussed, showing how the past history of the shear acting on a <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> is not taken into account, as researchers have done until now. The need for a reassessment of the power-law model for potential blood trauma assessment is discussed by using a mathematical formulation based on the hypotheses of the existence of damage accumulation for blood with respect to time and with respect to shear stress, to be applied in complex flow fields such as the ones established in the presence of artificial organs...|$|E
40|$|The peculiality {{of blood}} typing is a {{constant}} physical phenomena to every person, so I {{think there is any}} relation between various kinds of eye diseases and his blood typing. Therefore I have reserched this relation. The. items I have studied are as follows. 1) That I have examined the blood typing of 1. 200 cases of eye diseases, and also the state of the distribution of blood typing together with its effects on the erros of reflection and the diseases of eyes of 300 boys and girls. 2) To have examined the relation of the iso- and hetero-haemagglutination about normal persons and rabbits. 3) To have measured the iso haemagglutination value of 75 persons including 24 chief eye diseases, and examined if there is any difference of its value. The results I have got can be summed up as follows. 1) The distribution of blood typing in the case of trachoma increases a little in A typing, and most in AB typing. In the latter the rate of infection is highest, but it seems we do not suffer great injury. In B or O typing the rate of infection decreases a little, but in O typing we suffer serious complications of trachoma, and it seems we have general tendency of decline the resistance of trachoma. 2) In myope, A. B. O. each typing decreases a little, but AB typing increases. High degree of its refection has a tendency to increases in O typing, mean degree in B typing, and low degree in AB typing. The distribution of blood typing in hyperope {{is similar to that of}} the case of myope. In astigmatic person A and AB typing increases a little, and O typing decreases slightly. 3) The other various diseases of eyes have some exceptions, but on the whole A typing decreases a little and AB typing increases. 4) The cases of trachoma in the primary school have a general tendency increasing A typing, and myope increasing A typing and decreasing O typing. 5) The value of iso-haemagglutinin of normal persons is generally the same degree, and almost between 256 and 512. 6) The normal rabbits lack the iso-haemagglutinin. 7) The value of heterohaemagglutinin of serum of normal person to the <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> of normal rabbits is rather in high degree, and a little higher than the value of the isoagglutinin of normal persons. 8) The value of heterohaemagglutinin of serum of normal rabbits to the <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> of normal persons is almost from 2 to 64, and the state of agglutination to human <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> of O typing differs from the other 3 typing. 9) The value of haemagglutinin of various cases of eye diseases generally decreases rather than the healthy one, but in some cases we find so high degrees of its value that we cannot find in the case of normal person.

40|$|Blood {{cells of}} schizophrenics differ in many points {{from those of}} normal subjects. First of all the shape of them is flat and thin. This {{tendency}} is more marked in old group than in new group; the volume is small; flat corpuscles are more numerous in them in the normal; and the blood resistance against diluted saline solution is stronger {{than that of the}} normal. It has long since been known that the rate of corpuscle sedimentation is being accelerated in schizophrenics. A simple physical cause that <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> are flat and numerous can explain this phenomenon. It is said that there is an antisphering substance among the factors controlling the thickness and roundness of <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Yet it has not been determined whether this substance {{on the surface of the}} blood of schizophrenics is large or small. <b>Blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> are said to lose their peculiar disc-shape and to be completely destroyed at the pH of 9. 2 when the antisphering substance is removed from the surface of <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> The lower the pH is the better is the absorption of this substance on the surface of blood corpuscles; and it seems that the more this substance attaches itself to <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> the greater is the degree of flatness and in this connection it is interesting to note that the pH of schizophrenic blood is low in low in general. On the other hand, however, sphericity is increased at the time when the acidity of blood is increased due to a sudden movement of acidic substances immediately after ECT. Again in the case of coma of insulin treatment, blood tends to be alkaline and even then an increase in the sphericity of corpuscles is indicated. Consequently it seems tnat the roundness of <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> is not solely dependent upon antisphering substance and pH. </p...|$|R

Two hours after termination of exposure to hyperoxia, all subjects exhibited increased reticulocyte counts which were sustained for longer than two weeks.

Circulatory blood volume per kg body weight obtained by LAWSON'S method was 62. 0 ml, by GREGERSEN'S 72. 2 ml, by GIBSON & EVANS' 76. 0 ml. Circulatory plasma volume by LAWSON'S was 40. 0 ml, by GREGERSEN'S 46. 4 ml, by GIBSON & EVANS' method 49. 0 ml. 2) When circulatory blood volume and circulatory plasma volume changes corresponding to dye volume changes within a range of 0. 202 ∿ 0. 586 mg were studied, within the range 0. 202 ∿ 0. 250 no significant changes were seen. However when the volume of infused dye was increased, the values of circulatory blood volume and plasma volume increased with the increase of volume of infused dye. 3) Dye was infused through jugular vein and blood samples were taken at regular intervals from the opposite jugular vein and right forefoot median vein; the differences by sampling site were studied. It was found in regard to the time course of extinction and the circulatory blood volume and plasma volume obtained from the time course of extinction, that no significant differences were seen by sampling site. 4) From the correlation between circulatory blood volume and circulatory plasma volume and body weight obtained from infused dye volume within a range of 0. 202 ∿ 0. 289 mg per kg body weight by least square method, circulatory blood volume and circulatory plasma volume per kg body weight calculated. 5) One minute values of extinction were calculated by LAWSON's method, by extrapolation to the vertical axis. When extrapolated to the horizontal axis the time of disappearance was obtained. Since an experimental formula can be expressed by least square method when the time of disappearance is calculated by this formula, the time required at its shortest was 7 days and the same at its longest was 260 days. However, in actuality when long term observations were made on plasma dye concentration {{it was found that the}} time of disappearance was 5 ∿ 6 days. 6) When circulatory blood volume was measured, samples were taken at regular intervals; Ht values were measured from part of the samples and their changes were studied. It was noted that besides experimental error, considerable physiological changes occurred. 7) In the measurement of circulatory blood volume by P especially in <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> method the total blood volume value was 73. 56 ml per kg body weight while by use of total blood method the obtained value was 46. 95 ml; thus the <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> method showed higher values than total blood method. When the P method and the dye method were compared, it was noted that the values by GREGERSEN'S method were closely approximate to those obtained by the P method.

40|$|Purpose. To analyze {{data from}} {{scientific}} {{sources of information}} regarding the species-specific features of the hematopoietic and histo-morphological characteristics of hematopoietic tissues and organs of sturgeons (Acipenseridae). Consider the general aspects of their structure {{at different stages of}} ontogeny. To present the general features of differentiation and proliferation of blood elements. Findings. A review of scientific papers and literature has revealed that hematopoiesis in sturgeon species of fish differs significantly from that of mammals (Mammalia), but also from other fish from cartilaginous (Chondrichthyes) and bony (Osteichthyes) classes. Moreover, sturgeon fishes are characterized by a species-specificity in the development of hemopoiesis organs on each stage of ontogenesis. The age-related changes of the developing blood cells, ranging from blast elements (erythroblasts, lymphoblasts, monoblasts, myeloblasts) to the appearance of mature (definitive) forms, are marked. The specific heterochrony is revealed in the development of sturgeon blood cells. The organs of hemopoiesis are: hemopoietic cranial or lymphoid organ, gills, spleen, heart, thymus, gastrointestinal tract (anterior part of the digestive canal, pyloric gland, middle intestine, spiral valve and liver) and kidneys (pronephros and mesonephros). Hepatic hematosis begins to be realized during the larval period of development from a massive spread near the vascular connective tissue. A little bit later in the age of 15 days of active feeding, a similar spread covers practically all area of the body. At this time in liver hepatocytes and reticular cells with developing <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> are precisely allocated. In this period, proliferation of all cellular lines: erythropoietic, lymphocytopoietic, myelocytopoietic, and also thrombocytopoiesis take place in liver. The plasmocyte differentiation occurs in cranial haematogenic organ of sturgeon. In reticular tissue of lymphoid organ, thrombocyte precursors — megakariocytes were found. Mesonephros is a hemopoietic organ, which first starts to perform the hemopoietic function, and executes it {{until the end of the}} life cycle of fish. Cell development of erythropoietic and lymphocytopoiesis series is over in the prolarvaperiod of the development in the hematopoietic tissue of the kidney, and the formation of the granular series occurs in the larval period, and eosinophilic myelocytes are marked much earlier than in other hematopoietic organs (the 43 stage of the development), and a bit later — neutrophil myelocytes. Practical value. Systematized data on the specifics of hematopoiesis processes and patterns of development of hemopoietic organs in sturgeon species will be useful both for researchers and fish farmers. This is due to the fact that the course of hemopoiesis most fully reflects each specific stage of the development of sturgeon species, being an instant reaction of a number of body tissues to any changes in the internal and external environment...|$|E
40|$|In my {{method for}} the {{separation}} and purification of the colibacteriophage, I employed the chromatograph; but I examined the bacteriosolving {{phenomenon of the}} phage by using host bacteriofiltrate and rabitt antiserum for host bacterium, as well as, nucleus and nuclear substance of the <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscle</b> of cock and tortoise. In the former I {{did not get a}} good result, but I found that the phage growth was accelerated in a high degree in the latter, and consequently this report was written. First, I defibrinierted the 2 cc. blood of cook and tortoise, and made the bloodsuspension by ordinary method and then centrifuged it; added distilled water to the blood-corpuscle after the centrifugation, oscillated, mixed well, and demolished the protoplasm by distilled water. As soon as the white nucleus is suspended uniformly, physiological salt, water is added to it in a large quantity; dissolving the pure dregs which were obtained after severaltimes of centrifugation in 5 cc. salt water, I presented the same substance that was completely solved for experiment. Then I dyed and microscoped it, and noticed thickly dyeing nucleus as well as a large number of fine granular substance dottes arround it. The strength of colibacteriophage as contrast was 10 (- 3), but it rose to 10 (- 27) when the nucleus and nuclear substance of cock was added to it so that it might he diluted same as the first. Moreover, the strength of phage rose to 10 (- 20) in the filtrate of this nucleus and nuclear substance. In regard to nucleus and nuclear substance of tortoise, the strength of phage was not so strong as cock, but it rose to 10 (- 14) When I heated the nucleus and nuclear substance of cock bloodcorpuscle in the water bath, the degree of growth facility decreased together with the heat, and it seemed that the effect of growth facility is lostt almost at 100 - 120 °C. "The Feulgen Reaktion" of nucleus and nuclear substance of the blood was all positive, and it increased the degree of transparence together with the heat. It was discovered that. DNA is contained in the nucleus of blood together with a little of RNA, {{and it is difficult to}} separate the pure nucleus from the blood, so it is considered apparently that the protoplasm has lost its way within it. In a word, both the nucleus and the nuclear substance of the blood are considered that they play an important part in the growth of coli bacteriophage...|$|E
40|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{infected}} with virulent tubercle bacilli develops much more anti-sheep amboceptor than do controls when given like amounts of sheep red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> The curve of antibody {{production in the}} guinea pig when treated with sheep red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> shows a departure from curves previously determined in other animals. These facts were ascertained {{as part of an}} effort to learn mbre of the functional nature of the inheritable factors controlling natural resistance to disease. The nature of some of the problems involved is outlined, and the limited bearing of the experiments on these is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{cytotoxicity}} of various volumes of 5. 25 % of sodium hypochlorite, 2 % of chlorhexidine gluconate and mixture of a tetracycline isomer, an acid and a detergent (MTAD) by checking for hemolysis of human red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> Materials and Methods: A total volume of 100 μl of diluted red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> obtained through centrifugation was added to three irrigating solutions (5. 25 % of sodium hypochlorite, 2 % of chlorhexidine and MTAD) of six test tubes each. Individual irrigants per group were added in increasing volume starting from the second test tube keeping the first one as the control. After incubation for 3 min hemoglobin content was measured using an automated hemoanalyzer data was analyzed using one sample t-test. Results: Sodium hypochlorite is the most cytotoxic solution followed by MTAD and chlorhexidine. Conclusions: This study suggests that the three irrigating solutions do cause detrimental effects on the diluted red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles.</b> A great deal of care should therefore be exercised when using 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite during endodontic irrigation...|$|R
40|$|The author studied on the {{haemolytic}} {{action of}} the electric current upon the red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> of rabbits, suspended in the 0. 9 % NaCl solution. He confirmed the following facts. 1) Red <b>blood</b> <b>corpuscles</b> were haemolysed only by the constant current, but never by the alternating current, if the alternation is sufficiently frequent. 2) In regard {{to the relationship between}} the strength of the electric current and its duration holds good the Weiss-Hoorweg's formula for the excitation of muscle and nerve. 3) It is highly probable that the alkalinity, which has been produced in the neighbourhood of the negative Pole, plays the important rôle on the electrical haemolysis...|$|R
