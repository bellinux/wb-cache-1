40|$|Most neurons in the neostriatum are GABAergic spiny {{projection}} neurons {{with extensive}} local axon collaterals innervating principally other spiny projection neurons. The other source of GABAergic inputs to spiny neurons derives {{from a small}} number of interneurons, of which the best characterized are the parvalbumin-containing, fast-spiking interneurons. Spiny neuron collateral inhibition was not demonstrated until recently, because the IPSPs recorded at the soma are surprisingly small. In contrast, interneuronal inhibition was readily detected, comprising much larger IPSPs. Here, we report the application of quantal analysis and compartmental modeling to compare and contrast IPSCs in spiny neurons originating from axon collaterals and interneurons. The results indicate that individual release sites at spiny and interneuron synapses have similar quantal sizes and <b>baseline</b> <b>release</b> probabilities. Interneuronal unitary IPSCs are several times larger because of their proximal location on the neuron and because they have a larger number of transmitter release sites. Despite the small amount of current they can deliver to the soma, spiny cell collateral synapses had moderately high <b>baseline</b> <b>release</b> probabilities (0. 5 – 0. 9), suggesting that they are not weak because of some form of depression or modulation. The size of unitary collateral synaptic currents increased monotonically during development. These results argue against models of competitive inhibition in neostriatum, including those in which competitive inhibition is transiently effective during development and learning, and suggest a different role for the spiny cell axon collaterals.

40|$|Unitary {{inhibitory}} postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) {{were recorded}} in synaptically coupled pairs of CA 1 hippocampal interneurons and pyramidal neurons in rat brain slices by using dual patch-clamp techniques. Paired-pulse modulation of uIPSCs at individual GABAergic synapses was tested. GABAergic synapses could {{be divided into two}} subgroups, high and low failure, depending on their failure rate. The external Ca 2 + levels modulate the failure rate of uIPSCs. In 0 · 51 mM Ca 2 +, low-failure pairs had a high-failure characteristic, whereas high-failure pairs had a low-failure characteristic in 8 mM Ca 2 +. The results suggest that uIPSC failures result from the Ca 2 +-dependent release mechanism rather than axon propagation failures. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) occurred in high-failure pairs when the interspike interval was 20 ms. Paired-pulse depression (PPD) was not predominant in high-failure pairs. Potency of uIPSCs, the average amplitude of non-failure events, was enhanced by PPF, suggesting that multiple synapses connect each pair. Differing numbers of activated synapses contributed to the variable amplitude of uIPSCs from a given pair. PPD occurred in low-failure pairs at the tested range of interspike intervals (20 – 200 ms). The uIPSC 2 after a large uIPSC 1 was smaller than the uIPSC 2 after a small uIPSC 1, suggesting that PPD is use dependent and due to a decrease in the quantal content (m) after the first release. In 8 mM Ca 2 +, PPD occurred in high-failure pairs and was larger in low-failure pairs, suggesting that the occurrence of PPF or PPD depends on the <b>baseline</b> <b>release</b> probability.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effects of}} {{removing}} external calcium and inhibiting entry of calcium {{into the cell}} by treatment with D- 600 on renin release from renal cortical slices of male Sprague-Dawley rats were examined. <b>Baseline</b> renin <b>release,</b> angiotensin II (All) -induced inhibition, and isoproterenol-induced stimulation of renin release were studied. Removal of external calcium by chelation with 5 mM EGTA inhibited basal renin release while treatment with 1 mM EGTA stimulated basal renin release slightly. Incubation of slices with zero calcium medium containing 1 mM EGTA {{had no effect on}} isoproterenol-induced stimulation of renin release. In contrast, similar treatment reduced the inhibitory effect of AH from 58. 7 % of baseline to 85. 3 % (p < 0. 001). Similarly, blockage of calcium entry into cells with D- 600 had no effect on isoproterenol-induced stimulation of renin release but abolished All-induced inhibition. Replacement of sodium in the bathing medium with choline had no effect on <b>baseline</b> renin <b>release</b> or on All-induced inhibition of renin release, ruling out the possibility that D- 600 altered renin release via an effect on sodium influx. Taken together, the data strongly suggest that All-induced inhibition of renin release is partially dependent on the presence of external calcium but that isopro-terenol-induced stimulation of renin release is not.

30|$|When {{comparing}} the performance shown in Tables 10 and 11, {{it can be}} seen that with higher handover margins, overall performance degrades in both baseline and CoMP cases. For the SU-MIMO baseline, the point that is selected within the handover margin remains the serving point. Conversely, for DPS, the performance is partly recovered as the change of the transmission point is possible, thereby boosting CoMP performance relative to the baseline. These results show that there are substantial performance increases in CoMP gains for both JT and DPS CoMP. In the case of JT COMP, the 5 th percentile throughput gain is roughly doubled, and in the case of DPS CoMP, the coverage gain of Configuration 4 b increases from 9 to 26 %. These simulation results indicate that CoMP is providing the highest gains over the <b>baseline</b> <b>Release</b> 10 system when handover cannot be performed in an optimal way. Thus, CoMP and especially DPS can be seen as a scheme to aid the mobility issues in real networks. This is an interesting and important practical finding of this study.|$|E

We report here {{on the relationship between}} these two aspects of DA release in drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and matched healthy control subjects (HC). METHODS: Six drug-naïve SCZ and eight HC underwent single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans after bolus followed by constant infusion of (S) -(-) - 3 -[123 I]iodo- 2 -hydroxy- 6 -methoxy-N-[(1 -ethyl- 2 -pyrrolidinyl) methyl]benzamide ([123 I]IBZM) under three conditions to determine the equilibrium specific to non-displaceable binding potential (BP(ND)) for striatal D 2 at baseline, after amphetamine administration and after DA depletion. RESULTS: Amphetamine induced decrease in BP(ND) was positively correlated with BP(ND) increase after DA depletion in SCZ (p =. 02) but not in HC (p =. 44). Additionally, both were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: In drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia but not in control subjects, stimulated and <b>baseline</b> DA <b>release</b> are both increased and positively correlated.

Here, we show that presynaptic cortico–LA LTP can be entirely accounted for by a persistent increase in the vesicular release probability. At the molecular level, we found that signaling via the cAMP/PKA pathway is necessary and sufficient for LTP induction. Moreover, by using mice lacking the active-zone protein and PKA target RIM 1 α (RIM 1 α−/−), we demonstrate that RIM 1 α is required for both chemically and synaptically induced presynaptic LTP. Further analysis of cortico–LA synaptic transmission in RIM 1 α−/− mice revealed a deficit in Ca 2 +-release coupling leading to a lower <b>baseline</b> <b>release</b> probability. Our results reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of presynaptic LTP at cortico–LA synapses and indicate that RIM 1 α-dependent LTP may involve changes in Ca 2 +-release coupling...|$|E
30|$|In this article, we have {{addressed}} {{the problem of the}} feedback design and studied the associated link-level performance and the realistic system-level performance of CoMP in LTE-Advanced. We have studied practical finite-rate CSI feedback and CoMP feedback design, namely PMI and CQI feedback, for different CoMP modes, and also evaluated the associated performance with both link-level and system-level simulations. The realistic system-level evaluations of LTE-Advanced CoMP were performed for different CoMP modes and for different practical deployment scenarios. These simulation results indicate that CoMP can provide considerable cell-edge gains over the <b>baseline</b> <b>Release</b> 10 system with realistic UE feedback. The results that are obtained and reported in this study also indicate that the nature of the deployment scenario has a clear impact on the relative performance of JT and DPS type CoMP schemes. Relatively simple DPS schemes can outperform JT schemes in heterogeneous networks when the user distribution is not uniform but concentrated around the coverage area of the RRHs. When studying the CoMP schemes under biased handover conditions, it was observed that the DPS CoMP scheme can clearly aid in the mobility management of real networks. This is a very important practical benefit, in addition to improved cell edge performance, in cellular mobile radio systems.|$|E

We hypothesized that if a functional interaction between these receptors exists, then mice expressing an M 2 point mutation (Leu 92 ̆ 7 Ala) rendering alpha 4 nAChRs hypersensitive to ACh may exhibit altered sensitivity to a D(2) -receptor agonist. When challenged with the D(2) R agonist, quinpirole (0. 5 - 10 mg/kg), Leu 92 ̆ 7 Ala mice, but not wild-type (WT) littermates, developed severe, reversible motor impairment characterized by rigidity, catalepsy, akinesia, and tremor.

The current study is the first to demonstrate that both induction and reversal of homeostatic upregulation of synaptic vesicle release can occur within seconds of blocking or unblocking acetylcholine receptors at the mouse neuromuscular junction. Our data suggest that the homeostatic upregulation of release is due to Ca 2 +-dependent increase {{in the size of the}} readily releasable pool (RRP). Blocking vesicle refilling prevented upregulation of quantal content (QC), while leaving <b>baseline</b> <b>release</b> relatively unaffected. This suggested that the upregulation of QC was due to mobilization of a distinct pool of vesicles that were rapidly recycled and thus were dependent on continued vesicle refilling. We term this pool the “homeostatic reserve pool. ” A detailed analysis of the time course of vesicle release triggered by a presynaptic action potential suggests that the homeostatic reserve pool of vesicles is normally released more slowly than other vesicles, but the rate of their release becomes similar to that of the major pool during homeostatic upregulation of QC. Remarkably, instead of finding a generalized increase in the recruitment of vesicles into RRP, we identified a distinct homeostatic reserve pool of vesicles that appear to only participate in synchronized release following homeostatic upregulation of QC. Once this small pool of vesicles is depleted by the block of vesicle refilling, homeostatic upregulation of QC is no longer observed. This is the first identification of the population of vesicles responsible for the blockade-induced upregulation of release previously described...|$|E

Extracellular fluid release of monoamines and their metabolites was measured in the frontal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens using HPLC with electrochemical detection. The first ECS produced selective regional responses, shown by increased concentrations of noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) in frontal cortex, by unchanged DA content in striatum, and by a small rise in NA and a fall in DA concentrations in nucleus accumbens. Concentrations of metabolites increased after ECS in all regions studied, and for homovanillic acid and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, the temporal pattern of these changes did not resemble that of DA. Comparison of neurotransmitter responses as per cent of <b>baseline</b> <b>release</b> after the first and eighth ECS treatments showed they were identical. Basal release of monoamines and metabolites before the first ECS or sham treatment was similar in all regions studied. Prior to the eighth treatment, basal release of NA in the frontal cortex and DA in the striatum was elevated in the ECS-treated animals, while basal release of NA in the nucleus accumbens was reduced in both ECS-and sham-treated animals. These data suggest that acute and chronic ECS have different and region-specific effects on neurotransmitter release, although the overall pattern of these responses is not changed by chronic treatment. The catecholamine-releasing actions of ECS, and the changes in basal release of neurotransmitters seen after chronic treatment may contribute to its therapeutic effects. © 1990 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To study {{neutrophil}} {{circulation time}} and trafficking in vivo requires labeling the cells {{so that their}} movement can be followed temporally and spatially. Labeling procedures used to date, however, have relied on ex vivo separation and labeling methods, an undesired consequence {{of which may be}} neutrophil activation. Moreover, the labeled cells preferentially stick in the pulmonary circulation for several hours upon reinjection into the host. Therefore, we devised an alternate labeling procedure that relied on intra-arterial infusion of the fluorescent phagocytic cell linker PKH 26. We infused PKH 26 (5. 5 x 1 O- M for 1 h) into six awake sheep and measured systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics and lung lymph dynamics continuously for 3 - 4 h after the infusion. We collected simultaneous arterial and venous blood samples hourly for 4 h, and again 24 h after the infusion ended, for white blood cell and neutrophil differential counts and to identify labeled cells in fresh smears by fluorescence and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Infusion of PKH 26 had minimal and transient physiologic effects on systemic and pulmonary artery pressure, lung lymph flow, and leukocyte counts. Labeled cells were present in venous blood after the infusion for at least 24 h. DIC microscopy observation of the blood smears indicated that the fluorescently labeled cells were exclusively neutrophils. Unstimulated superoxide anion release from neutrophils isolated 2 and 24 h after PKH 26 infusion was not different from <b>baseline</b> <b>release.</b> Phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated release was not affected either.

30|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the problem of {{feedback}} design and study the associated realistic system-level performance of CoMP in LTE. The higher-level starting point {{in this study is}} that different CoMP schemes require different CSI feedback. The minimum feedback needed for interference coordination is the precoder that causes the worst interference if used at the interfering point. If that precoder is known, interference may be reduced by avoiding that spatial direction. For DPS, a metric for selecting the transmission point is needed. If a UE provides feedback per point, the selection may be made in accordance with the CQI. For JT, there exist several options from per point feedback to aggregated feedback. Aggregated feedback means that the UE assumes JT transmission from N points and calculates the RI, PMI, and CQI for the aggregated channel. The main contributions of this article, addressing the above fundamental challenges in practical deployment of CoMP in cellular mobile radio, are as follows: We present unified signal and system modeling to support a general hybrid CoMP scenario with varying numbers of transmission points in the JT. In an LTE compliant model, we study and propose a practical CoMP feedback design for different CoMP modes. We evaluate the tradeoff between feedback load and complexity {{on the one hand and}} the achieved performance improvements on the other hand. Realistic system-level performance of LTE-Advanced network is evaluated for different CoMP modes, and covers various practical deployment scenarios, including an intra-site coordination where multiple co-located sectors of an eNB are cooperating, as well as cooperation within a sector, where RRHs are operating within the coverage area of a high-power macro cell. These simulation results with realistic UE feedback indicate that CoMP is providing considerable cell-edge gains over the <b>baseline</b> <b>Release</b> 10 system. Further, when studying the CoMP schemes under biased handover conditions, it is seen that CoMP and especially DPS is a scheme that can aid in the mobility issues in real networks. This, in addition to improved cell-edge user performance, is seen as an important practical finding in this study.|$|E
30|$|Loads with {{thermal storage}} {{capability}} include {{different types of}} TCAs such as hot water heaters, air conditioners (a/c), and refrigerators. Each TCA is a thermal cell that converts electricity into thermal energy controlled by an operating temperature range, similar to {{the high and low}} water levels in a reservoir. A centralized controller controls the timing (when and for how long) of each thermal cell’s electrical energy consumption. Note that unlike battery energy storage with bi-directional energy conversion devices, the thermal energy stored in the PEESS cannot be converted back to electricity. Instead, the PEESS varies its electricity consumption against a <b>baseline</b> to <b>release</b> power to or absorb power from the grid. Thus, when the aggregated consumption is higher than the baseline, the PESSS is charging; when the consumption is lower than the baseline, the PEESS is discharging. As a result, the overall performance of the PEESS is equivalent to that of a battery energy storage device.|$|R
40|$|SummaryDistinct {{pools of}} the bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) Glass bottom boat (Gbb) control structure and function of the Drosophila neuromuscular junction. Specifically, motoneuron-derived Gbb regulates <b>baseline</b> neurotransmitter <b>release,</b> whereas muscle-derived Gbb regulates neuromuscular junction growth. Yet how cells differentiate between these ligand pools is not known. Here we present evidence that the neuronal Gbb-binding protein Crimpy (Cmpy) permits discrimination of pre- and postsynaptic ligand by serving sequential functions in Gbb signaling. Cmpy first delivers Gbb to dense core vesicles (DCVs) for activity-dependent release from presynaptic terminals. In the absence of Cmpy, Gbb is no longer associated with DCVs and is not released by activity. Electrophysiological analyses demonstrate that Cmpy promotes Gbb’s proneurotransmission function. Surprisingly, the Cmpy ectodomain is itself released upon DCV exocytosis, arguing that Cmpy serves a second function in BMP signaling. In addition to trafficking Gbb to DCVs, we propose that Gbb/Cmpy corelease from presynaptic terminals defines a neuronal protransmission signal...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{increasing}} model depth improves the quality of neural machine translation. However, different architectural variants to increase model depth have been proposed, and so far, there has been no thorough comparative study. In this work, we describe and evaluate several existing approaches to introduce depth in neural machine translation. Additionally, we explore novel architectural variants, including deep transition RNNs, and we vary how attention is used in the deep decoder. We introduce a novel "BiDeep" RNN architecture that combines deep transition RNNs and stacked RNNs. Our evaluation is carried out on the English to German WMT news translation dataset, using a single-GPU machine for both training and inference. We find that several of our proposed architectures improve upon existing approaches in terms of speed and translation quality. We obtain best improvements with a BiDeep RNN of combined depth 8, obtaining an average improvement of 1. 5 BLEU over a strong shallow <b>baseline.</b> We <b>release</b> our code for ease of adoption.
