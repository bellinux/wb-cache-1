In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E

The church filed suits against those who posted the documents, claiming copyright violations.

5|$|Radio City Music Hall's {{management}} {{refused to}} screen Citizen Kane for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that The American Weekly would run a defamatory {{story on the}} grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller.

5|$|The Defective Premises Act 1972 (c. 35) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} landlords' and builders' {{liability}} for poorly constructed and poorly maintained buildings, {{along with any}} injuries that may result. During the 19th century, the common law principle that a landlord could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained house was established, while a long-running principle was that, in practice, builders could not be sued for constructing defective buildings. The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the landlord was still largely free from <b>being</b> <b>sued.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid <b>being</b> <b>sued</b> for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open victimisation in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E
