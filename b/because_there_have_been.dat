The description of the echidna differs from the common description of the waitoreke. The platypus is more like {{the description of the}} waitoreke but still different. A new type of monotreme is also possible.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the course}} of her {{appearances}} in Angel, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so many chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny [...] I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did. Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to [...] "selfish, superficial Los Angeles", {{which turned out to be}} her [...] "trial by fire".|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{ubiquitous}} x86 processors of today use little-endian storage {{for all types}} of data (integer, floating point, BCD), {{there are a number of}} hardware architectures where floating-point numbers are represented in big-endian form while integers are represented in little-endian form. There are ARM processors that have half little-endian, half big-endian floating-point representation for double-precision numbers: both 32-bit words are stored in little-endian like integer registers, but the most significant one first. <b>Because</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> many floating-point formats with no [...] "network" [...] standard representation for them, the XDR standard uses big-endian IEEE 754 as its representation. It may therefore appear strange that the widespread IEEE 754 floating-point standard does not specify endianness. Theoretically, this means that even standard IEEE floating-point data written by one machine might not be readable by another. However, on modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may in practice safely assume that the endianness is the same for floating-point numbers as for integers, making the conversion straightforward regardless of data type. (Small embedded systems using special floating-point formats may be another matter however.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Harry Potter {{series of}} fantasy novels by J. K. Rowling have become {{some of the}} most widely read works of children's {{literature}} in history, with readers of all ages and in many countries. In April 2011 worldwide sales of Harry Potter books were estimated to be about 450 million copies,. Oddly enough, it has been difficult to accurately determine with any degree of certainty exactly how many languages Harry Potter has been translated into. As best as can be determined (as of 2017), The Philosopher's Stone has been officially translated from the original English into 73 other languages. A 74th language, Scots, was announced on 2017-06-28 and it is expected to be available in October, 2017. Both Bloomsbury's and J.K. Rowling's sites have recently stated that the books have been translated into 79 languages (80 with the 2017-06-28 announcement of Scots); however, {{it has been argued that}} number actually represents the number of authorized translations (of The Philosopher's Stone) plus the original English. The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> multiple authorized translations into the same language. Specifically, there have been two separate translations into each of: Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish (5 languages). English is often included in the list of translations even though technically it should not be (indeed, it is why our list here counts up to 74). Thus: 79 [...] English [...] 5 double-translations = 73. It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books are have been translated into these 73 languages.|$|E

6000|$|Do {{not think}} it. Great {{men do not}} play stage tricks with the doctrines of life and death: only little men do that. Milton means what he says; and means it with his might too--is {{going to put the}} whole {{strength}} of his spirit presently into the saying of it. For though not a lover of false bishops, he WAS a lover of true ones; and the Lake-pilot is here, in his thoughts, the type and head of true episcopal power. For Milton reads that text, [...] "I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven," [...] quite honestly. Puritan though he be, he would not blot it out of the book <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> bad bishops; nay, in order to understand HIM, we must understand that verse first; it will not do to eye it askance, or whisper it under our breath, {{as if it were a}} weapon of an adverse sect. It is a solemn, universal assertion, deeply to be kept in mind by all sects. But perhaps we shall be better able to reason on it if we go on a little farther, and come back to it. For clearly this marked insistence on the power of the true episcopate is to make us feel more weightily what is to be charged against the false claimants of episcopate; or generally, against false claimants of power and rank in the body of the clergy; they who, [...] "for their bellies' sake, creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold." ...|$|E

But perchance, thou seest with the eye of Faith, gazing on that brightness, that is to be, through the painted-glass of thy imagination. Strange are {{the pictures of the}} future that mankind can thus draw with this brush of faith and this many-coloured pigment of imagination! Strange, too, that no one of them doth agree with another! I could tell thee--but there, what is the use? why rob a fool of his bauble? Let it pass, and I pray, oh Holly, that when thou dost feel old age creeping slowly toward thyself, and the confusion of senility making havoc in thy brain, thou mayest not bitterly regret that thou didst cast away the imperial boon I would have given to thee. But so it hath ever been; man can never be content with that which his hand can pluck. If a lamp be in his reach to light him through the darkness, he must needs cast it down because it is no star. Happiness danceth ever apace before him, like the marsh-fires in the swamps, and he must catch the fire, and he must hold the star! Beauty is naught to him, because there are lips more honey-sweet; and wealth is naught, because others can weigh him down with heavier shekels; and fame is naught, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> greater men than he. Thyself thou saidst it, and I turn thy words against thee. Well, thou dreamest that thou shalt pluck the star. I believe it not, and I think thee a fool, my Holly, to throw away the lamp." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus miscarried {{this popular}} Bill for {{appointing}} commissioners to examine into royal grants; but whether those chiefly concerned did rightly consult their own interest, hath been made a question, which perhaps time will resolve. It was {{agreed that the}} Queen, by her own authority, might have issued out a commission for such an enquiry, and every body believed, that {{the intention of the}} Parliament was only to tax the grants with about three years' purchase, {{and at the same time}} establish the proprietors in possession of the remainder for ever; so that, upon the whole, the grantees would have been great gainers by such an Act, since the titles of those lands, as they stood then, were hardly of half value with others either for sale or settlement. Besides, the examples of the Irish forfeitures might have taught these precarious owners, that when the House of Commons hath once engaged in a pursuit, which they think is right, although it be stopped or suspended for a while, they will be sure to renew it upon every opportunity that offers, and seldom fail of success: for instance, if the resumption should happen to be made part of a supply, which can be easily done without the objection of a tack, the grantees might possibly then have much harder conditions given them; and I do not see how they could prevent it. Whether the resuming of royal grants be consistent with good policy or justice, would be too long a disquisition: besides, the profusion of kings is not like to be a grievance for the future, <b>because</b> <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> laws since made to provide against that evil, or, indeed, rather because the crown has nothing left to give away. But the objection made against the date of the intended enquiry was invidious and trifling; for King James II. made very few grants: he was a better manager, and squandering was none of his faults; whereas the late king, who came over here a perfect stranger to our laws, and to our people, regardless of posterity, wherein he was not likely to survive, thought he could no way better strengthen a new title, than by purchasing friends at the expense of every thing which was in his power to part with.|$|E
