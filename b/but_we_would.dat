We British have a thousand year history of self-government. We have been free and democratic longer than any other nation. The European Union is too diverse, too bureaucratic, too corporatist and too centralist to be a functioning democracy. We are happy to trade with our European friends and the rest of the world – <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> prefer to govern ourselves.|$|E

500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

"Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was first}} {{performed}} at Jay-Z's [...] "Answer the Call" [...] benefit concert in Madison Square Garden on September 11, 2009, {{where it was}} the opening song. All ticket proceeds from the show went to the New York Police and Fire Widows and Children's Fund. The song was then performed live at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards (MTV VMA) on September 13, 2009, where it closed the awards show. The VMA performance {{was the first time}} Jay-Z and Keys performed the song together. Shaheem Redi of MTV News commented on the performance that, [...] "Their set was elegant and 'hood at the same time, and it was such a powerful moment". Ryan Brockington of the New York Post wrote [...] "Alicia's buttery voice and Jay-Z's impeccable stage presence made for an audio adrenaline overload" [...] and placed the performance third on his list of the [...] "top six performances" [...] from the MTV VMAs. For the performance Jay-Z wore his signature Yankees cap and Keys wore all black while playing the piano. During the MTV VMA performance images of locations in New York, such as the Empire State Building and the Apollo Theatre, were shown on an overhead screen behind Jay-Z and Keys. Towards the end of the performance rapper Lil' Mama got up onto the stage uninvited and posed with Jay-Z and Keys while they were finishing the final verse of the track. Lil' Mama said she did not mean to disrespect either performer but the song had her [...] "emotions running high", adding that [...] "in that moment I came up onstage to celebrate my two icons singing about NY." [...] Keys responded to the incident saying [...] "We can appreciate her being overwhelmed and inspired, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have appreciated it if she would have done it from her seat", and Jay-Z added, [...] "It was a lot of planning that went into that performance. To disrupt that was outta line." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said that the duo [...] "brought some genuine street heat to the tongue-twisting torrents" [...] of [...] "Empire State of Mind".

2500|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{can be both}} {{a blessing}} and a curse. [...] For example, we have just noted that some physicists hold that more sophisticated theories of gravitation will not admit any notion of an isolated point particle.

[...] If these physicists are correct, we would gain a kind of self-abnegating intellectual honesty or realism, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> pay a hefty price, since few idealizations have proven as fruitful in physics as the notion of a point particle (however troublesome it has been even in simpler theories).|$|E

It said two interceptors are usually fired at each rocket. In April 2011, for example, the system succeeded in intercepting eight of 10rockets. Following the October violence, the IDF conducted an inquiry into the Iron Dome's performance and discovered that a radar failure caused some of the interceptors to miss their targets, a problem since corrected.

McKenzie envisioned Fisk as a center for teacher training. [...] "We should not only set standards for advanced training for teachers in this state, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> {{meet the needs of}} those capable of meeting our standards throughout a large number of the Southern states." [...] In early 1917, The General Education Board expressed interest in funding the program.

[...] It was not until 1920-21, five years after McKenzie first proposed the idea, that Fisk established a summer school program for teachers.|$|E

[...] Ehrlich went on to say: [...] "It's too fresh in everyone's memory to do more at this time, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be remiss if we didn't recognize Whitney's remarkable contribution to music fans in general, and in particular her close ties with the Grammy telecast and her Grammy wins and nominations over the years." [...] At the start of the awards ceremony, footage of Houston performing [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] from the 1994 Grammys was shown following a prayer read by host LL Cool J. Later in the program, following a montage of photos of musicians who died in 2011 with Houston singing [...] "Saving All My Love for You" [...] at the 1986 Grammys, Hudson paid tribute to Houston and the other artists by performing [...] "I Will Always Love You". The tribute was partially credited for the Grammys telecast getting its second highest ratings in history.|$|E
2500|$|William Morris {{advocated}} {{production by}} traditional craft methods but was inconsistent {{in his view}} of what place machinery should play. At one point he said that production by machinery was [...] "altogether an evil", but {{he was willing to}} use manufacturers able to work to his standards with the aid of machinery; and he said that, in a [...] "true society", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour. Fiona MacCarthy says that [...] "unlike later zealots like Gandhi, William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery per se so long as the machines produced the quality he needed." [...] Morris's followers also had subtly differing views or changed their minds over time. C.R.Ashbee, for example, a central figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, shared Morris's ambivalence. At the time of his Guild of Handicraft, initiated in 1888, he said, [...] "We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> desire to see it mastered." [...] After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that [...] "Modern civilization rests on machinery", but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called [...] "mechanism", saying that [...] "the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares." ...|$|E

(31 July)Johnny's rosy cheeks, which he never lost, excited great admiration; he passed {{most of his time}} in the square next to us with the Sikhs, who were very fond of him, and used to give him chappatties (native bread), though they could not have had much to eat themselves, poor men! (28 August) [...] Mrs. Case and Johnny were walking in the square next to ours to-day, when a Sikh officer passed them, and directly afterwards he was hit in the arm by a bullet. No place was really safe, and I never liked having the children out of my sight. (18 October) During the siege, we had picked up a little white hen, which used to run about and pick up what it could. Just before Colonel Campbell became so very ill, we had decided to kill and eat it, when one morning Johnny ran in and said, 'Oh, mamma, the white hen has laid an egg!' We took it at once to Colonel Campbell, it being a great luxury in those days.
