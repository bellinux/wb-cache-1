5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness.

Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 <b>bar</b> (<b>pressure</b> ratio 2.3 to 1) also showed no signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E

25|$|In Denmark {{district}} heating covers more than 60% of space heating and water heating. In 2007, 80.5% of this heat {{was produced by}} {{combined heat and power}} plants. Heat recovered from waste incineration accounted for 20.4% of the total Danish district heat production. In 2013, Denmark imported 158,000 ton waste for incineration. Most major cities in Denmark have big {{district heating}} networks, including transmission networks operating with up to 125°C and 25 <b>bar</b> <b>pressure</b> and distribution networks operating with up to 95°C and between 6 and 10 <b>bar</b> <b>pressure.</b> The largest district heating system in Denmark is in the Copenhagen area operated by CTR I/S and VEKS I/S. In central Copenhagen, the CTR network serves 275,000 households (90-95% of the area's population) through a network of 54km double district heating distribution pipes providing a peak capacity of 663MW. The consumer price of heat from CTR is approximately €49 perMWh plus taxes (2009).|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} varying the {{characteristics}} of the dielectric can be used for sensing purposes. Capacitors with an exposed and porous dielectric can be used to measure humidity in air. Capacitors are used to accurately measure the fuel level in airplanes; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates, the circuit capacitance increases. Squeezing the dielectric can change a capacitor at a few tens of <b>bar</b> <b>pressure</b> sufficiently that it {{can be used as a}} pressure sensor. A selected, but otherwise standard, polymer dielectric capacitor, when immersed in a compatible gas or liquid, can work usefully as a very low cost pressure sensor up to many hundreds of bar.|$|E
40|$|The system MgO-CO_ 2 -H_ 2 O {{has been}} studied up to 1, 400 ° C and 4, 000 <b>bars</b> <b>pressure</b> using the sealed-capsule {{quenching}} technique. No melting was observed. At 1, 000 <b>bars</b> <b>pressure</b> magnesite dissociates at 780 ° C, and brucite at 635 ° C, to periclase and vapor. The univariant reaction MgCO_ 3 ÷Mg(OH) _ 2 ⇌ MgO + V proceeds at 630 ° C, at 1, 000 bars and at 700 ° C, at 4, 000 bars. Solubility measurements show that, at 1, 000 bars and temperatures up to 1, 000 ° C, less than 1. 5 weight per cent MgO is dissolved in the vapor phase. Brucite is unstable {{in the presence of}} vapors containing more than a small amount of CO_ 2. The maximum percentage of CO_ 2 in a vapor that can coexist with brucite increases with decreasing pressure and with increasing temperature: 6 weight per cent CO_ 2 is the maximum at 630 ° C, 1, 000 bars, and 4 weight per cent at 700 ° C, 4, 000 bars. The phase relations in the isobaric TX prism for 1, 000 <b>bars</b> <b>pressure</b> are described. The results illustrate two dissociation reactions, decarbonation and dehydration, occurring {{in the presence of a}} vapor phase containing two volatile components, H_ 2 O and CO_ 2.

Formic acid has been considered {{as a means of}} hydrogen storage. The co-product of this decomposition, carbon dioxide, can be rehydrogenated back to formic acid in a second step. Formic acid contains 53 g L−1 hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, which is three and a half times as much as compressed hydrogen gas can attain at 350 <b>bar</b> <b>pressure</b> (14.7 g L−1).

25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for heating water or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 <b>bar</b> <b>pressure</b> in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (377MW), Solar Energy Generating Systems installation (354MW), and Crescent Dunes (110MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, Solnova Solar Power Station (150MW), the Andasol solar power station (150MW), and Extresol Solar Power Station (100MW).|$|E
