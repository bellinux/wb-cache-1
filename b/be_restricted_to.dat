5|$|Greece, Australia, France, and United Kingdom are {{the only}} {{countries}} to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896. While countries sometimes miss an Olympics {{due to a lack}} of qualified athletes, some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons. The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games, because the IOC insisted its team needed to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys populations from Texas to Nicaragua form {{a single}} Cytb clade, {{within which the}} average {{sequence}} divergence is 1.28%, and Hanson and colleagues proposed that the name Oryzomys couesi <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> this clade. These populations correspond to two subspecies recognized by Goldman (O.c.aquaticus and O.c.couesi) and an island form he retained as a species (O.cozumelae). Two other subspecies Goldman recognized, O.c.richmondi and O.c.peragrus, and a third, O.c.pinicola, that was described after Goldman's paper occur in the same region, but have not been studied genetically.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice between}} scuba and surface {{supplied}} diving equipment {{is based on}} both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly commercial diving, may <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.|$|E

50|$|A sectoral {{currency}} {{is a form}} of complementary currency that <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a specific sector. Examples of sectoral currency are the Saber, which <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the educational sector and thus can only be used to buy education, and the Fureai kippu, which <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the health care sector.|$|R
50|$|Sicyopus is a genus {{of small}} gobies.

5|$|The {{fossil record}} {{for this group}} appears to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a foot bone of an early Miocene bird from Bavaria which has been {{identified}} as an extinct representative of the climbing Certhioidea, a clade comprising the treecreepers, wallcreeper and nuthatches. It has been described as Certhiops rummeli. Two fossil species have been described in the Sitta genus: S. cuvieri Gervais, 1852 and S. senogalliensis Portis, 1888, but probably not belong to nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|Type {{safety is}} {{variable}} in COBOL. Numeric data is converted between different representations and sizes silently and alphanumeric {{data can be}} placed in any data item that can be stored as a string, including numeric and group data. In contrast, object references and pointers may only be assigned from items of the same type and their values may <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a certain type.|$|E
5|$|While devotional {{paintings}} – especially altarpieces – remained {{dominant in}} Early Netherlandish art, secular portraiture became increasingly common in both {{northern and southern}} Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of humanism.|$|E

5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is longer than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> shallow, inshore waters in northwestern Borneo. Of the five earlier specimens, four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China, hinting at a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be substantiated {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E
5|$|As regards proportionality, the law {{states that}} a self-defense {{may not be}} manifestly disproportionate. It is evident, that for a self-defense to be successful, {{it has to be}} {{performed}} on a level exceeding the attack. Unlike in case of necessity, the consequence of necessary self-defense may be more serious than consequence of the attack. The defense may not <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a passive one, it can also be active. It is not the outcome of the incident but the sequence of actions at its beginning which determines who is to be deemed the attacker, and who is the party attacked.|$|E
40|$|I {{describe}} several computational complexity {{results for}} planning, {{some of which}} identify tractable planning problems. The model of planning, called &quot;propositional planning, &quot; is simple—conditions within operators are literals with no variables allowed. The different planning problems are defined by different restrictions on the preconditions and postconditions of operators. The main results are: Propositional planning is PSPACE-complete, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> two positive (nonnegated) preconditions and two postconditions, or if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> one postcondition (with any number of preconditions). It is NP-complete if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> positive postconditions, even if operators <b>are</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> one precondition and one positive postcondition. It is tractable in a few restricted cases, {{one of which is}} if each operator <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> positive preconditions and one postcondition. The blocks-world problem, slightly modified, is a subproblem of this restricted planning problem. ...|$|R

5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may occur on the wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Electoral success overtook {{the party}} and Janmaat began to make {{controversial}} statements in the media. Based on his conviction that high office should <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> third-generation Dutch nationals, he suggested that several cabinet ministers, including Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch-Ballin who was of Jewish descent, and Agriculture State Secretary Dzsingisz Gabor who was of Hungarian descent, should {{be removed from the}} Dutch leadership. This marked the start of prosecutions of Centre Democrats party members on charges of racism, as well as the decision by the other parties in Parliament and government to place a cordon sanitaire around the party.|$|E
5|$|Historically the King of the Welsh {{people would}} travel, with his court, in a circuit, {{demanding}} tribute {{in the form}} of food from communities they visited as they went. The tribute was codified in the Laws of Hywel Dda, showing that people lived on beer, bread, meat and dairy products, with few vegetables beyond cabbages and leeks. The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activities}} have had {{positive effects on}} some species of cockatoo and negative effects on others. Many species of open country have benefited greatly from anthropogenic changes to the landscape, with the great increase in reliable seed food sources, available water and have also adapted well to a diet including foreign foodstuffs. This benefit appears to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Australian species, as cockatoos favouring open country outside Australia have not become more abundant. Predominantly forest-dwelling species have suffered greatly from habitat destruction; in the main, {{they appear to have}} a more specialised diet and {{have not been able to}} incorporate exotic food into their diet. A notable exception is the yellow-tailed black cockatoo in eastern Australia.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the residential colleges, housing {{is available at the}} Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing and transfer students (in 2016-17, this will <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> only continuing students); the Redwood Grove Apartments, which is available to continuing student applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, located downtown, that serves both continuing and transfer students. The Transfer Community is located in sections of both the A and B Buildings at Porter College and over 500 residents live within this theme housing. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.|$|E
5|$|Plant species {{found at}} this {{elevation}} include Styphelia tameiameiae, Taraxacum officinale, Tetramolopium humile, Agrostis sandwicensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Trisetum glomeratum, Poa annua, Sonchus oleraceus, and Coprosma ernodiodes. One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage {{reduced to a}} population of just 50 plants, Mauna Kea silversword was thought to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the alpine zone, but in fact has been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, <b>restricted</b> distributions; this <b>is</b> most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove <b>is</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|R

5|$|Scully cuts {{her hand}} on the thorn of a twig left in her car. When she drives off, a veve is seen on the ground under her car. Mulder has a meeting with X, who tells him that he and Scully will soon be called back to Washington and that the camp will <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> {{military}} personnel only. Mulder believes Wharton is persecuting the refugees after the suicide of some of his men during a previous trip to Haiti. Scully finds Dunham dead in a bathtub, and Mulder catches McAlpin with a knife nearby. Although he has no recollection of the event, McAlpin confesses to the murder under the influence of Wharton, who tells the agents that Bauvais committed suicide and that their investigation is over.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow nests either {{alone or}} in a small, loosely {{connected}} colony of three to five nests. It is monogamous and may form a lifelong pair bond. The bushcrow occasionally has a third bird, or in rare cases two to four more, help the breeding couple both build the nest {{and care for the}} young. The helpers may also not <b>be</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>to</b> helping one nest at a time, as they have been seen at nests across the loose colonies. Allofeeding and allopreening, where the birds feed or preen each other, takes place both between the pair and with the other bushcrows in the colony. The bushcrow lays its eggs shortly after the first rains, which normally occur in late February and early March, leading to its eggs being laid in late March and early April.|$|E
