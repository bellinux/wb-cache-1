The U.S. Public Land Survey System has used the Gunter's chain as a <b>basic</b> <b>measurement.</b> [...] In Canada, however, where the land survey is based on the same units of measure as the U.S. land survey, the metric system was adopted without issue.|$|E

50|$|The hop count {{refers to}} the number of {{intermediate}} devices (like routers) through which data must pass between source and destination, rather than flowing directly over a single wire. Each router along the data path constitutes a hop, as the data is moved from one Layer 3 network to another. Hop count is therefore a <b>basic</b> <b>measurement</b> of distance in a network.|$|E

50|$|A sonic tool is {{typically}} run on wireline by a service company that detects the bond of the cement to the casing and formation via a principle based on resonance. Casing {{that is not}} bound has a higher resonant vibration than that which is bound, causing the imparted energy from the sonic signal {{to be transferred to}} the formation. In this sense, the amplitude of the waveform received is the <b>basic</b> <b>measurement</b> that is evaluated.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{variable}} is the rheology of the drilling fluid. Rheology is sometimes {{thought of as}} viscosity to the uninitiated, though improperly. Viscosity (sometimes thought of as its thickness) is a very <b>basic</b> <b>measurement</b> of the fluids resistance to change in movement or flow. The viscosity of a fluid can be measured with a Marsh Funnel. Rheology {{is the study of}} viscosity and requires more precise and complicated procedures and equipment for its determination. For drilling fluid applications a rheometer is used.|$|E

50|$|CFM25 {{is defined}} as the air flow (in cubic feet per minute) needed to create a 25 Pascal {{pressure}} change in the ductwork. CFM25 {{is one of the most}} <b>basic</b> <b>measurements</b> of ductwork airtightness.A pressure of 25 Pa is equal to 0.1 inches (0.25 cm) of water column.|$|R
50|$|Bistatic range {{refers to}} the <b>basic</b> <b>measurement</b> of range made by a radar or sonar system with {{separated}} transmitter and receiver. The receiver measures the time difference of arrival of the signal from the transmitter directly, and via reflection from the target. This defines an ellipse of constant bistatic range, called an iso-range contour, on which the target lies, with foci centred on the transmitter and receiver. If the target is at range Rrx from the receiver and range Rtx from the transmitter, and the receiver and transmitter are a distance L apart, then the bistatic range is Rrx+Rtx-L. Motion of the target causes a rate of change of bistatic range, which results in bistatic Doppler shift.|$|E
5000|$|Weagle's design {{currently}} holds multiple patents, including US7128329, {{which is}} the world's first and remains {{to be the only}} published account on the method of mathematically and geometrically characterizing linkage chain/ belt-driven, and shaft-driven motorcycle and bicycle suspensions. The 7128329 introduced several new concepts and measurements to the suspension world, specifically the concept of characterizing anti-squat as a curve or area when graphed as a function of anti-squat versus compressive travel. The portfolio also proposed the same <b>basic</b> <b>measurement</b> for braking squat versus compressive travel distance. These measurements are now accepted as [...] "anti-squat curves" [...] and [...] "braking squat curves" [...] by some professionals in the field of vehicle suspension dynamics.|$|E
50|$|A {{reading of}} 8,000 m, with {{trailing}} zeroes and no decimal point, is ambiguous; the trailing zeroes {{may or may}} not be intended as significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, the number could be represented in scientific notation: 8.0 &times; 103 m indicates that the first zero is significant (hence a margin of 50 m) while 8.000 &times; 103 m indicates that all three zeroes are significant, giving a margin of 0.5 m. Similarly, it is possible to use a multiple of the <b>basic</b> <b>measurement</b> unit: 8.0 km is equivalent to 8.0 &times; 103 m. In fact, it indicates a margin of 0.05 km (50 m). However, reliance on this convention can lead to false precision errors when accepting data from sources that do not obey it.|$|E

50|$|In {{pure water}} systems, {{electrolytic}} conductivity or resistivity measurement {{is the most}} common indicator of ionic contamination. The same <b>basic</b> <b>measurement</b> is read out in either conductivity units of microsiemens per centimeter (µS/cm), typical of the pharmaceutical and power industries or in resistivity units of megohm-centimeters (Mohm•cm) used in the microelectronics industries. These units are reciprocals of each other. Absolutely pure water has a conductivity of 0.05501 µS/cm and a resistivity of 18.18 Mohm•cm at 25 °C, the most common reference temperature to which these measurements are compensated. An example of the sensitivity to contamination of these measurements is that 0.1 ppb of sodium chloride raises the conductivity of pure water to 0.05523 µS/cm and lowers the resistivity to 18.11 Mohm•cm.|$|E
