25|$|After {{learning}} this information, the House Judiciary Committee requested {{an interview}} with Buchanan in June 2006. Committee staff members privately questioned Buchanan. She had served {{as director of the}} Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys in 2004 and 2005 when discussions were held within the Justice Department concerning which of the country's 93 top federal prosecutors should be dismissed. <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> denied any involvement in the firings. <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> also denied that the prosecutions of key Democratic politicians in the Western PA area was driven by political factors.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 July 2011, Buchanan {{approached}} the current line-up of Sugababes at the Barclaycard Wireless festival in London, where {{the girls were}} reported to have a [...] "tear-eyed" [...] reunion and put the past behind them.

Tom is an {{imposing}} man of muscular build with a [...] "husky tenor" [...] voice and arrogant demeanor. He is a former football star at Yale. <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> parallels with William Mitchell, the Chicagoan who married Ginevra King. Buchanan and Mitchell were both Chicagoans {{with an interest in}} polo. Like Ginevra's father, whom Fitzgerald resented, Buchanan attended Yale and is a white supremacist.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there is}} a possibility, as Alice <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> argued, that the colour green is erroneously {{attributed}} to the Green Knight due to the poet's mistranslation or misunderstanding of the Irish word glas, which could either mean grey or green. In the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from Bricriu's Feast), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called [...] "the man of the grey mantle". Though the words usually used for grey in the Death of Curoi are lachtna or odar, roughly meaning milk-coloured and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word glas is used {{and may have been}} the basis of misunderstanding.|$|E
500|$|The group's {{members were}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the release of}} [...] "Soul Sound" [...] as a single, because they wanted to venture into an R sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction. Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals. Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, [...] "New Year", [...] "Run for Cover" [...] and [...] "Soul Sound", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: [...] "Everything happens for a reason and it looks like it has all worked out". [...] "Soul Sound" [...] was featured in the 2001 film Summer Catch, which stars such actors as Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jessica Biel.|$|E

500|$|Paleoconservative {{activist and}} former presidential {{candidate}} Pat <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> appeared twice as of 2011. In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation [...] "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave {{and a couple of}} paragraphs in it where he said that... the Jewish community is beating the drums for warbut frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue." [...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, {{thank you so much for}} coming back on our program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico... I think that's the beginning of the end of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{trial has}} been seen as a test case of the {{acceptable}} limits of pornography. Mary Beth Buchanan was the federal prosecutor in the case. In an interview on 60 Minutes she said, [...] "We have just had a proliferation of this type of material that has been getting increasingly worse and worse. And that's why it's important to enforce the law, and to show the producers that there are limits. There are limits to what they can sell and distribute throughout the country" [...] Ms. <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> also stated that [...] "The lack of enforcement of federal obscenity laws during the 1990s has led to a proliferation of obscenity throughout the United States, such as the violent and degrading material charged in this case." [...] <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> said that Zicari's comments on the Frontline program [...] "helped us to determine {{that this was not a}} producer who was trying to comply with the law" ...|$|E

Republicans often saw the Catholic working class as lacking the qualities of self-discipline, temperance, and sobriety essential for their vision of ordered liberty. Republicans insisted that there was a high correlation between education, religion, and hard work—the values of the [...] "Protestant work ethic"—and Republican votes. [...] "Where free schools are regarded as a nuisance, where religion is least honored and lazy unthrift is the rule", read an editorial of the pro-Republican Chicago Democratic Press after James Buchanan's defeat of John C. Fremont in the 1856 presidential election, [...] "there <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> received his strongest support".|$|E

2500|$|John Lesley, {{who knew}} of Alexander's {{pretension}} to be king in 1482, has Gloucester take Berwick {{on his return}} to England after vigorous defence by Sir Patrick Hepburn of Dunsyre, Lord Hailes, and significant English casualties. [...] An addition to the English Croyland Chronicle also records that Berwick Castle was taken by Gloucester on his return after [...] "vast slaughter and bloodshed," [...] a phrase {{similar to that used}} by Edward IV in his letter to the Pope. George <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> Albany at Lennoxlove camped with the English army in August and reconciled by the negotiation of Colin Campbell, Earl of Argyll, the Chancellor Andrew Stewart, and the Bishops of St Andrews and Dunblane. On 26 August, according to Buchanan, Berwick Castle, still held by Scotland separately from the town, was surrendered by negotiation in Edinburgh to England.|$|E
2500|$|The Anti-Defamation League {{has called}} Buchanan an [...] "unrepentant bigot" [...] who [...] "repeatedly demonizes Jews and {{minorities}} and openly affiliates with white supremacists." [...] "There's no doubt," [...] said Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer, [...] "he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice." [...] Buchanan denies {{that he is}} antisemitic, {{and a number of}} his journalistic colleagues, including Murray Rothbard, Justin Raimondo, [...] Jack Germond, Al Hunt and Mark Shields, have defended him against the charge. As a member of the Reagan White House, he is accused of having suppressed the Reagan Justice Department's investigation into Nazi scientists brought to America by the OSS's Operation Paperclip. In the context of the Gulf War, on September 15, 1990, Buchanan appeared on The McLaughlin Group and said that [...] "there are only two groups that are beating the drums for war in the Middle East – the Israeli defense ministry and its 'amen corner' in the United States." [...] He also said: [...] "The Israelis want this war desperately because they want the United States to destroy the Iraqi war machine. They want us to finish them off. They don't care about our relations with the Arab world." [...] Furthermore, on The McLaughlin Group <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> also made such comments as “‘Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory’ and ‘If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population. That is where real power is at…’” ...|$|E

[...] Keyes's entry into the Republican race after <b>Buchanan</b> <b>had</b> secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party, since <b>Buchanan</b> <b>had</b> been a well-known ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and [...] "cultural war" [...] {{to the center of}} the public policy debate. [...] Later during the primaries, Keyes was briefly detained by Atlanta police when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited, and then uninvited. [...] He was never formally arrested and was eventually picked up 20 minutes later by Atlanta's mayor at the time, Bill Campbell.|$|R

6000|$|There is {{one other}} thing I will mention before I leave this branch of the discussion,--although I do not {{consider}} it much of my business, anyway. I refer {{to that part of}} the Judge's remarks where he undertakes to involve Mr. Buchanan in an inconsistency. He reads something from Mr. Buchanan, from which he undertakes to involve him in an inconsistency; and he gets something of a cheer for having done so. I would only remind the Judge that while he is very valiantly fighting for the Nebraska Bill and the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, it has been but a little while since he was the valiant advocate of the Missouri Compromise. I want to know if <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> not as much right to be inconsistent as Douglas has? Has Douglas the exclusive right, in this country, of being on all sides of all questions? Is nobody allowed that high privilege but himself? Is he to have an entire monopoly on that subject? ...|$|E

60|$|His {{executive}} power is almost unbounded. He {{is much more}} powerful than any minister can be with us, and is subject to a much lighter responsibility. He may be impeached by the House of Representatives before the Senate, but that impeachment only goes to the removal from office and permanent disqualification for office. But in these days, as we all practically understand, responsibility {{does not mean the}} fear of any great punishment, but the necessity of accounting from day to day for public actions. A leading statesman has but slight dread of the axe, but is in hourly fear of his opponent's questions. The President of the United States is subject to no such questionings, and as he does not even require a majority in either House for the maintenance of his authority, his responsibility sets upon him very slightly. Seeing that Mr. <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> escaped any punishment for maladministration, no President need fear the anger of the people.|$|E
6000|$|That Ben Jonson {{was painted}} by Honthorst and others, while Shakespeare, {{as far as}} we know, was not, {{has nothing to do with}} the authorship of the plays. Ben was a scholar, the darling of both Universities; {{constantly}} employed about the Court in arranging Masques; his learning and his Scottish blood may have led James I to notice him. Ben, in his later years, was much in society; fashionable and literary. He was the father of the literary [...] "tribe of Ben." [...] Thus he naturally sat for his portrait. In the same way George <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has,</b> and had, nothing like the fame of Knox. But as a scholar he was of European reputation; haunted the Court as tutor of his King, and was the [...] "good pen" [...] of the anti-Marian nobles, Murray, Morton, and the rest. Therefore Buchanan's portrait was painted, while of Knox we have only a woodcut, done, apparently, after his death, from descriptions, for Beza's Icones. The Folio engraving may have no better source. Without much minute research it is hard to find authentic portraits of Mary Stuart, and, just as in Shakespeare's case, {190a} the market, in her own day and in the eighteenth century, was flooded with [...] "mock-originals," [...] not even derived (in any case known to me) from genuine and authentic contemporary works.|$|E
60|$|But {{will the}} {{election}} of Mr. Lincoln endanger the Union? It is not a little remarkable that, as the prospect of his success increases, the menaces of secession grow fainter and less frequent. Mr. W. L. Yancey, to be sure, threatens to secede; but the country can get along without him, and we wish him a prosperous career in foreign parts. But Governor Wise no longer proposes to seize the Treasury at Washington,--perhaps because Mr. <b>Buchanan</b> <b>has</b> left so little in it. The old Mumbo-Jumbo is occasionally paraded at the North, but, however many old women may be frightened, {{the pulse of the}} stock-market remains provokingly calm. General Cushing, infringing the patent-right of the late Mr. James, the novelist, has seen a solitary horseman {{on the edge of the}} horizon. The exegesis of the vision has been various, some thinking that it means a Military Despot,--though in that case the force of cavalry would seem to be inadequate,--and others the Pony Express. If it had been one rider on two horses, the application would have been more general and less obscure. In fact, the old cry of Disunion has lost its terrors, if it ever had any, at the North. The South itself seems to have become alarmed at its own scarecrow, and speakers there are beginning to assure their hearers that {{the election of}} Mr. Lincoln will do them no harm. We entirely agree with them, for it will save them from themselves.|$|E
