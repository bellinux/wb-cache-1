25|$|In 2003, Hertzfeldt created The Animation Show with Beavis and Butt-head creator Mike Judge. It was a {{biennial}} North American touring festival {{that brought}} independent animated short films to more movie theaters than any distributor in history. The programs were personally curated by Hertzfeldt and Judge. A second Animation Show edition toured throughout 2005, featuring Hertzfeldt's short film The Meaning of Life and new films by animators like Peter Cornwell and Georges Schwizgebel. The third season of The Animation Show began its nationwide release in January 2007, featuring new work by animators Joanna Quinn and Bill Plympton, {{as well as}} Hertzfeldt's own Everything Will <b>Be</b> <b>OK.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hertzfeldt's work {{commonly}} features hand-drawn stick figures, {{in stories}} of black humor, surrealism, and tragicomedy. Some films contain existential and philosophical themes {{while others are}} more straightforwardly slapstick and absurdist. His animation is created traditionally with pen and paper, often with minimal digital aid. Hertzfeldt uses antique 16mm or 35mm–film cameras to photograph his drawings and often employs old-fashioned special effect techniques such as multiple exposures, in-camera mattes, and experimental photography. While some of these techniques are as established as an occasional stop-motion animation sequence or a universe of moving stars created by back-lit pin holes, other effects are new innovations on classical methods, as seen with the in-camera compositing of multiple, split-screen windows of action in the Everything Will <b>Be</b> <b>OK</b> films.|$|E

500|$|The Narrator finds {{redemption}} {{at the end}} of {{the film}} by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution. Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption in The Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self. Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him: [...] "I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> with his vanquishing." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll walk away from it, but I could go and go and go. I've had to learn to <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> with it." ...|$|E
500|$|At 08:24:38, Atta {{tried to}} make an {{announcement}} to the passengers, but pressed the wrong button and sent the message to Boston ARTCC.

[...] At 08:24:56, he announced [...] "Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If {{you try to make}} any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." [...] As before, Atta thought he was speaking to only the passengers, but his voice was picked up and recorded by air traffic controllers. After the transmissions by Atta and the inability to contact the airliner, air traffic controllers at Boston ARTCC realized the flight had been hijacked. At 08:26, the plane turned south. At 08:32, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, notified FAA headquarters.|$|E
500|$|... "A Toast to Men" [...] was {{produced}} by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. The track features vocals by American rapper Lady May. Ford spent roughly two years working on material following the release of her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). The concept for the song was developed from her experiences at a sorority party. While discussing {{the inspiration for the}} single, Ford said that she heard girls at a sorority party doing a chant, and felt like writing a song using it. She was uncertain if her record label would release the song given its provocative content. When talking about her intentions behind the lyrics, she confessed: [...] "I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. I wanted it to be sexy and fierce and <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> to say the word 'fuck.' I just needed some time {{to get out of it}} and figure out what the fuck was going on." ...|$|E

500|$|American {{pop singer}} Nick Jonas sang an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? Would that <b>be</b> <b>OK?</b> The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should <b>be</b> <b>OK,</b> that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night where things can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K.

You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to <b>be</b> <b>OK?</b> It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
