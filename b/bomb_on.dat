5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear <b>bomb</b> <b>on</b> an undamaged city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E

Following the Soviet Union's first test detonation of an atomic <b>bomb</b> <b>on</b> August 29, 1949, President Harry Truman announced a crash development program for a hydrogen bomb.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{polonium}} {{was produced}} {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project's Dayton Project during World War II. It was a critical part of the implosion-type nuclear weapon design used in the Fat Man <b>bomb</b> <b>on</b> Nagasaki in 1945. Polonium and beryllium were the key ingredients of the 'urchin' detonator {{at the center of the}} bomb's spherical plutonium pit. The urchin ignited the nuclear chain reaction at the moment of prompt-criticality to ensure the bomb did not fizzle.|$|E

5|$|The {{first test}} would {{probably}} be a ground burst, but consideration was also given to an explosion in a ship to measure the effect of a ship-borne atomic <b>bomb</b> <b>on</b> a major port. Such data would complement that obtained about an underwater explosion by the American Operation Crossroads nuclear test in 1946, and would therefore be of value to the Americans. Seven Canadian sites were assessed, the most promising being Churchill, Manitoba, but the waters were too shallow to allow ships to approach close to shore.|$|E
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed.

In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, which was much {{more powerful than the}} Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E
