50|$|The quadruple {{bond between}} the two {{chromium}} atoms arises from the overlap of four d-orbitals on each metal with the same orbitals on the other metal: the dz2 orbitals overlap to give a sigma <b>bonding</b> <b>component,</b> the dxz and dyz orbitals overlap to give two pi bonding components, and the dxy orbitals give a delta bond. This quadruple bond is also confirmed by the low magnetic moment and short intermolecular distance between the two atoms of 236.2 ± 0.1 pm. The Cr-Cr distances are even shorter, 184 pm being the record, when the axial ligand is absent or the carboxylate is replaced with isoelectronic nitrogenous ligands.|$|E

Traditional approaches to <b>bonding</b> <b>components</b> to {{printed circuit boards}} results in heat being applied across the whole board assembly.

In terms of energy considerations the use of VFM technology is much more cost effective compared to convection/radiation heating.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown {{a wide range of}} pulpal {{reactions}} to dentin bonding systems and a poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo toxicity of dentin bonding agents. Because dentin bonding agents are composed of multiple components which may diffuse through dentin, we hypothesized that these components may cause cytotoxicity through interactive (synergistic) effects. We investigated the cytotoxicities of four dentin bonding components-HEMA, Bis-GMA, TEGDMA, and UDMA-and interactive effects for three binary combinations of the dentin bonding components-HEMA and Bis-GMA, Bis-GMA and TEGDMA, and TEGDMA and UDMA. Cytotoxicities to Balb/c 3 T 3 mouse fibroblasts were measured by the MTT assay. Concentrations which caused 50 % toxicity compared with controls (TC 50 values) were compared, and the interactive effects were determined by evaluation of the differences between observed and expected MTT activities of the cells. The ranks of toxicity of the dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>components</b> in terms of TC 50 values were as follows: Bis-GMA > UDMA > TEGDMA >>> HEMA (least toxic) after 24 - and 72 -hour exposures. As binary combinations, the three combinations of dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>components</b> interacted in three ways—synergism, additivism, and antagonism-which were influenced by the concentrations of both components. The longer period of exposure resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} cytotoxicity of the dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>components</b> and combinations. The findings indicate that both exposure time and the interactions between the dentin <b>bonding</b> <b>components</b> may be important parameters in determining the cytotoxicity of dentin bonding agents in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Zirconium carbide {{is one of}} the {{candidate}} materials to be used for some fuel components of the high temperature nuclear reactors planned in the frame of the Gen-IV project. Few data exist regarding its behaviour under irradiation. We have irradiated ZrC samples at room temperature with slow heavy ions (4 MeV Au, fluence from 10 (11) to 5 x 10 (15) cm(- 2)) in order to simulate neutron irradiations. Grazing incidence X-Ray diffraction (GIXRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis have been performed in order to study the microstructural evolution of the material versus ion fluence. A high sensitivity to oxidation is observed with the formation of zirconia precipitates during the ion irradiations. Three damage stages are observed. At low fluence (10 (14) cm(- 2)), the micro-strains saturate and the loops coalesce to form a dense dislocation network. No other structural modification is observed. The material shows a moderate cell parameter increase, corresponding to a 0. 6 vol. % swelling, which saturates around 10 (14) ions/cm(2), i. e., a few Zr dpa. As a result, in spite of a strong covalent <b>bonding</b> <b>component,</b> ZrC seems to have a behaviour under irradiation close to cubic metals. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{pervaporation}} {{mechanism of}} pure components through a commercial microporous silica membrane was studied by performing experiments using water, methanol, ethanol, 2 -propanol, and n-propanol in the 40 - 80 degrees C temperature range. Experimental fluxes were correlated to feed temperature and viscosity. It {{was found that}} the permeation mechanism obeys the adsorption-diffusion description, covering both the microscopic models based on configurational (micropore) diffusion and on activated surface diffusion. The contribution of convection was negligible. Size parameters for the permeating molecules such as molecular weight, kinetic diameter, and effective diameter, which are expected to have an influence on diffusion, did not correlate with the flux, thus strongly emphasizing the importance of sorption as the rate-determining step for transport in the pervaporation process. This was confirmed by correlating parameters reflecting polarity with flux: an exponential relation between the Hansen polarity (especially the hydrogen <b>bonding</b> <b>component)</b> and the flux was observed. A similar correlation was found between the dielectric constant and the flux. Furthermore, the flux increases {{in the same direction as}} the hydrophilicity of the pure components (log P).

The c-BN films were deposited on a compositionally graded interlayer, {{which consisted of}} B, C and N. A thin B 4 C layer (~ 200 nm) had been initially deposited onto Si substrate in a pure Ar gas discharge. The following formation of the graded interlayer was conducted by step-like or smoothly replacing Ar with N 2 gas. Depending on the method implemented, the secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) depth profile showed relatively smooth or step-like changes in the elemental concentration of B, C and N. The primary analysis on the chemical bond of the graded interlayer was conducted by measuring the chemical shift of B 1 s, C 1 s and N 1 s spectra by X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS). It is shown that the B-C bond, which was a major <b>bonding</b> <b>component</b> in the B 4 C layer, was gradually replaced by a mixture of B-N and C-C bond as the N 2 fraction was increased.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the multicenter, long bond in ditetracyanoethylene dianion complex [TCNE] 22 – is elucidated using high level ab initio Valence Bond (VB) theory coupled with Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. This dimer is the {{prototype}} of the general family of pancake-bonded dimers with large interplanar separations. Quantitative results obtained with a compact wave function in terms of only six VB structures match the reference CCSD(T) bonding energies. Analysis of the VB wave function shows that the weights of the VB structures are not compatible with a covalent bond between the π* orbitals of the fragments. On the other hand, these weights are consistent with a simple picture in terms of two resonating bonding schemes, one displaying a pair of interfragment three-electron σ bonds and the other displaying intrafragment three-electron π bonds. This simple picture explains at once (1) the long interfragment bond length, which is independent of the countercations but typical of three-electron (3 -e) CC σ bonds, (2) the interfragment orbital overlaps which {{are very close to}} the theoretical optimal overlap of 1 / 6 for a 3 -e σ bond, and (3) the unusual importance of dynamic correlation, which is precisely the main <b>bonding</b> <b>component</b> of 3 -e bonds. Moreover, it is shown that the [TCNE] 22 – system is topologically equivalent to the square C 4 H 42 – dianion, a well-established aromatic system. To better understand the role of the cyano substituents, the unsubstituted diethylenic Na+ 2 [C 2 H 4] 22 – complex is studied and shown to be only metastable and topologically equivalent to a rectangular C 4 H 42 – dianion, devoid of aromaticity...|$|E
40|$|Density {{functional}} theory (DFT) {{using the}} finite cluster approach is utilized to compute binding energies, bond geometries, and vibrational properties {{of carbon monoxide}} adsorbed on Pt(111) {{as a function of}} the external interfacial field, focusing attention on the metal–CO bond itself. Comparison with electrode potential-dependent frequencies for the metal–CO (¿M–CO) as well as the much-studied intramolecular C [...] -O (¿CO) vibration, as measured by in-situ Raman and infrared spectroscopy, facilitate their interpretation in terms of metal-chemisorbate bonding for this archetypal electrochemical system. Decomposing the calculated metal–CO binding energy and vibrational frequencies into individual orbital and steric repulsion components enables the role of such quantum-chemical interactions to the field- (and hence potential-) dependent bonding to be assessed. No simple relationship between the field(F) -dependent binding energies and the ¿M–CO frequencies is evident. While the DFT ¿M–CO–F slopes are negative at positive and small–moderate negative fields, reflecting the prevailing influence of back-donation, a ¿M–CO–F maximum is obtained at larger negative fields for atop CO, and a plateau for hollow-site CO. This Stark-tuning behavior reflects largely offsetting field-dependent contributions from p and s surface bonding, and can also be rationalized on the basis of changes in the electrostatic component of ¿M–CO from increasing M–CO charge polarization. A rough correlation between the field-dependent ¿M–CO frequencies and the corresponding bond distances, rM–CO, is observed for hollow and atop CO in that rM–CO shortens towards less positive fields, but becomes near-constant at moderate–large negative fields. A more quantitative correlation between the field-dependent C [...] -O frequencies and bond lengths is also evident. In harmony with earlier findings (and unlike the ¿M–CO–F behavior), the ¿CO–F dependence is due chiefly to changes in the back-donation <b>bonding</b> <b>component.</b> The overall vibrational frequency-field behavior predicted by DFT is also in semi-quantitative concordance with experimental potential-dependent spectra...|$|E

Comparisons were made using One Up Bond F (OB) self-etching adhesive system, Single Bond (SB) one-bottle adhesive system and Scotchbond Multi Purpose Plus (SMP) <b>bonding</b> <b>component.</b> Thirty bovine incisors were extracted and decoronated at the cementoenamel junction. The labial surfaces were ground so that superficial dentin and deep dentin were exposed. The specimens were randomized to three groups (n= 10) : G 1 - OB; G 2 - OB + SMP; G 3 - SB. In G 2, a layer of the SMP bonding was applied over the OB adhesive system. Indirect composite restorations were bonded using dual-cure cement under 500 g load for 5 min. The specimens were serially sectioned with a bonding area of ± 1. 0 mm² in 3 regions: enamel (E), superficial dentin (SD) and deep dentin (DD). The sticks were fixed with cyanoacrylate adhesive and submitted to µTBS test at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min in a mechanical testing machine (EMIC DL 2000). The fractured specimens were examined under scanning electron microscopy to determine the failure mode. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). µTBS means (in MPa) were: G 1 /E: 15. 5 ± 3. 5 b; G 1 /SD: 22. 7 ± 7. 6 a; G 1 /DD: 19. 4 ± 9. 4 a; G 2 /E: 15. 9 ± 5. 8 b; G 2 /SD: 19. 9 ± 6. 9 a; G 2 /DD: 15. 3 ± 4. 9 a; G 3 /E: 23. 2 ± 7. 3 a; G 3 /SD: 20. 4 ± 8. 2 a; G 3 /DD: 19. 1 ± 8. 7 a.
