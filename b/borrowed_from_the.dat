40|$|When {{a central}} bank {{implements}} the LOLR policy in a financial crisis, bank creditors often infer a bank's quality from {{whether or not it}} <b>borrows</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central bank. We establish a formal model to study the optimal LOLR policy in the presence of this signaling effect, assuming that the central bank aims to encourage central bank borrowing to avoid inefficiencies caused by contagion. In our model, {{there are two types of}} banks: a high quality type with high expected asset returns and a low quality type with lower returns. Both types of banks need to roll over their short-term debts. A central bank offers to lend to both types of banks. After private creditors observe whether banks <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central bank, banks try to <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> private market. We find that there may exist a separating equilibrium where only low quality banks <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central bank; and two pooling equilibria where both types of banks do and do not <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central bank. Our major results are as follows: (1) Considering the signaling effect, the central bank should set its lending rate lower than the prevailing market rate to induce both types of banks to <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central bank. (2) Hiding the identity of banks <b>borrowing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central bank will encourage banks to <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> central bank. (3) The central bank may serve as a coordinator for the realization of its favored equilibrium...|$|R

It has also been noted that the amendments do not compel the application of Lee Mau Seng, a High Court decision. If Lee Mau Seng is wrong, the Court of Appeal can still overrule it now.|$|E

The Pan-African colors are <b>borrowed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ethiopian flag, one of the oldest independent African countries. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings.

Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators.

Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350million.|$|E
5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, {{even those who are}} acclimatized. In serious cases, it can lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule <b>borrowed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|Beebe had {{a troubled}} {{relationship}} {{with some of}} his superiors at the zoo, particularly Hornaday, who was resentful of Beebe's constant demands for more funding and staff, as well as the fact that as Beebe's career progressed he gradually devoted less and less time to caring for the zoo itself. One particular point of disagreement was Beebe's forgetfulness about returning books which he had <b>borrowed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Zoological Society's Library, which would occasionally go missing for years as a result. However, Hornaday never publicly expressed his disagreements with Beebe, and did not hesitate to defend Beebe's work when others criticized it.|$|E

5000|$|Low {{levels of}} {{national}} savings {{also contribute to}} high current account deficits. This is because excessive expenditure will force a lot of businesses to seek funds overseas. At the same time, when governments run constant budget deficits, they meet their monetary requirements by <b>borrowing</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> domestic sector. Economists refer to the ‘crowding out effect’ to explain this economic situation. When governments <b>borrow</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> domestic sector, they force {{the private sector to}} ‘crowd out’.|$|R

5|$|Cross-linguistically, the-ma suffix may {{be related}} to a coverbial suffix in Jaminjung, a {{language}} in which coverb roots occur without any aspect markers, but are then suffixed with -mayan, which marks continuous aspect. This coverb suffix bears a striking resemblance to the sum of the Wagiman -ma suffix and the continuous aspect suffix -yan, which always occur in tandem on coverbs. Together, -ma and -yan perform the same semantic function as Jaminjung -mayan. Precisely what the relationship holds between these suffixes; whether one language <b>borrowed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other, or whether each language inherited them from earlier languages, is not at all clear.|$|E

Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also <b>borrowed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the Renaissance.|$|E
