5|$|When {{the heated}} and air {{conditioned}} McDonald's Cycle Center opened, <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> facilities with amenities, which had {{first appeared in}} the U.S. on the West Coast, did not exist in the Midwest. When it opened in 2006 the bike station was one of the country's largest and most modern. The Cycle Center's <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> facilities use high-capacity, two-tiered DoubleParker racks that accommodate {{more than twice as many}} bicycles per square foot as traditional bike racks. These racks were manufactured by Josta, a German manufacturer of <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> systems and stands. The interior design was a joint collaboration between the city of Chicago, Josta, and Cycle-Safe, Inc. of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which also produces lockers and racks for bicycles. The Chicago Park District runs the station, which has a full-time staff.|$|E

5|$|Ashton Bus Station {{is being}} {{converted}} into a state-of-the-art transport interchange. A covered concourse will replace the five island platforms, and the site will {{be linked to the}} Metrolink terminus. It will have new waiting areas, <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking,</b> and better access to travel information and tickets. Improved pedestrian routes will take people into the town centre. Construction is expected to take two years and the interchange should be open by the end of 2018.|$|E
5|$|London has 330km (205mi) {{of cycling}} paths {{throughout}} the city, 91km (59mi) {{of which have}} been added since 2005. In June 2016, London unveiled its first bike corrals, which replace parking for one vehicle with fourteen <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spaces, and fix-it stations, which provide cyclists with simple tools and a bicycle pump, throughout the city. In September 2016, city council approved a new 15 year cycling master plan that will see the construction of an additional 470km (292mi) of cycling paths added to the existing network.|$|E
5|$|Othello station {{consists}} of two at-grade side platforms in the median of Martin Luther King Jr. Way South between Othello and Myrtle streets. The station is accessible from crosswalks at both streets, with the platforms running the entire length between the two. At both of the station's entrances are ticket vending machines and an ORCA card reader; beyond that lies the partially covered platform and waiting area, which includes seating and public art. The station also includes two public plazas at the northeast corners of both cross-streets, as well as eight public <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> spots. Othello station, like others in the Rainier Valley, was designed by architecture firm Arai/Jackson.|$|E

5|$|The Cycle Center {{includes}} parking {{for up to}} 300bikes, lockers, an Internet station, a cafe, bike rentals, bike {{repair and}} private stall showers. During business hours, the facility has 100spaces set aside for first-come, first-served usage, but after hours the facility is limited to dues-paying members. In addition to the riders, the Chicago Police Lakefront Bicycle Patrol Unit is stationed at the Cycle Center. As the city's high-profile <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> facility, it {{has served as a}} demonstration location for efforts to lobby for further bicycle accommodations for the Active Transportation Alliance, League of Illinois Bicyclists, and Illinois Lieutenant Governor Pat Quinn.|$|E
5|$|The station also {{includes}} a 600-stall park and ride lot next to the bus station and an auxiliary lot located across Southcenter Boulevard. The park and ride, initially the only facility on Central Link, would regularly fill before 9:00a.m. by 2013, leading to complaints and commuters parking on nearby residential streets. An additional 62 parking spaces were added in November 2013, through a lease from a private garage owned by the City of SeaTac. The opening of the University Link in 2016 worsened the parking issue, leaving the lot filled by 6:40a.m. Sound Transit began a permit parking trial in September 2016 that reserves spaces for registered carpool vehicles for a monthly fee of $5, {{in an effort to}} alleviate the parking problems at the station. A second park and ride opened at Angle Lake station in September 2016, which was expected to relieve the Tukwila lot, but demand remained the same while Angle Lake's lot filled with new commuters. Sound Transit also offers a <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> station with eight secured spots, as well as racks for temporary use.|$|E
25|$|Parking lots {{specifically}} for bicycles {{are becoming more}} prevalent in many countries.

As of 1987, Japanese provisions included 516 multi-story garages for <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{secure and}} {{convenient}} <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> {{is a key}} factor in influencing a person's decision to cycle, decent parking infrastructure must be provided to encourage the uptake of cycling. Decent <b>bicycle</b> <b>parking</b> involves weather-proof infrastructure such as lockers, stands, manned or unmanned bicycle parks, as well as bike parking facilities within workplaces to facilitate bicycle commuting. It also will help if certain legal arrangements are put into place to enable legitimate ad hoc parking, for example to allow people to lock their bicycles to railings, signs and other street furniture when individual proper bike stands are unavailable.|$|E
