In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%–30% among Southern whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70–30 lead among the 29% of the voters who were <b>black</b> <b>or</b> <b>Hispanic.</b> One-third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they voted for Bush by 80–20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that, in the United States, several {{minority}} groups, including black men and women, Hispanic men and women, and white women, suffer from decreased wage earning for the same job with the same performance levels and responsibilities as white males.

2500|$|The {{likelihood}} that a family will use a payday loan increases if they are unbanked, or lack access to a traditional deposit bank account. [...] In an American context the families who will use a payday loan are disproportionately either of <b>black</b> <b>or</b> <b>Hispanic</b> descent, recent immigrants, and/or under-educated. These individuals are least able to secure normal, lower-interest-rate forms of credit. Since payday lending operations charge higher interest-rates than traditional banks, they {{have the effect of}} depleting the assets of low-income communities. [...] The Insight Center, a consumer advocacy group, reported in 2013 that payday lending cost U.S communities $774 million a year.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. {{population}} is fast evolving into {{a patchwork of}} health behaviors, incomes, and ethnic backgrounds. Simple cultural labeling will not do. A growing number of Americans, now numbering about 10 million, cannot or will not describe their race {{in any one of}} the Census Bureau's standard categories [...] white, black, American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, Asian Pacific, <b>or</b> <b>Hispanic.</b> They group themselves as a multicultural population rather than a single racial or ethnic category. To guide health interventions, the private sector now relies more on statistical clusters based on geography, lifestyle, behavior, financial status, and attitudes instead of on race. In marketing, the challenge is to reach diverse markets without stereotyping the product as one designed for only a certain ethnic group. The emphasis on athletics instead of on race is one example of how some marketers solve this problem of reaching minorities without giving the impression that specific products are only for <b>blacks,</b> <b>or</b> <b>Hispanics,</b> <b>or</b> Asians. Surveillance professionals can expand the way data are collected and publicized. Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans should not be categorized simply by race; other variables of health, such as income and age, should be given careful attention...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. Since 1981, {{per capita}} {{consumption}} of alcohol (based on sales figures) has decreased in the United States. This study describes drinking patterns in the 1990 national alcohol survey by demographic correlates and assesses changes in drinking patterns from the 1984 survey. METHODS. Data were obtained from a national household probability sample within the 48 contiguous states; face-to-face {{interviews were conducted with}} 2058 adults. The instrument contained questions pertaining to the respondent's background, attitudes toward alcohol, and use of alcohol. RESULTS. The proportions of current drinkers; current drinkers of wine, beer, and liquor; weekly drinkers; and drinkers who reported having five or more drinks per occasion {{at least once a week}} were significantly lower in 1990 than in 1984. These changes remained significant when demographic characteristics were controlled by logistic regression. The findings held for Whites only; there were no significant trends for <b>Blacks</b> <b>or</b> <b>Hispanics.</b> CONCLUSIONS. While there has been a downward turn in alcohol use in the United States, the correlates of alcohol use have not changed. How these shifts affect alcohol-related problems is an important area for future research...|$|R
