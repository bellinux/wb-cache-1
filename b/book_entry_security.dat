40|$|This paper {{describes}} how {{the two most important}} clearing and settlement systems in Denmark, VP and the Sumclearing, work in practice. Further it analyses, how the legal framework in the Securities Trading Act, STA, based on directive 98 / 26 /EC on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems works in relation to the functionality of VP and the Sumclearing. The functionality for both systems encompasses net settlement (multilateral netting). The description of the two systems explains not only the multiple batches processing in the systems, but also the systems terms and conditions and the cash settlement in Danmarks Nationalbank. The conclusion is that both systems have entered into fully valid and binding agreements of multilateral netting with its participants according to the requirements in STA. Further the moments, when transfer orders become binding and irrevocable, are identified. In a separate section the important link established between VP Securities Services and Euroclear in Belgium is described, including an elaboration of the cross-system settlement of trades between participants of VP Securities Services and Euroclear, whereby Danish <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> <b>securities</b> electronically are moved to Belgium or back again. Finally the paper analyses what happens in case a participant of VP or the Sumclearing is declared bankrupt. The conclusion is that both VP and the Sumclearing are structured in a way, so the legal and practical consequences of a participant's bankruptcy are predictable in all standard cases. For the other participants this is crucial for the possibility to adapt to the situation. The bibliography contains a list of relevant homepages, and a glossary {{of some of the most}} important terms in the paper has been compiled...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes two {{significant}} modifications of Japan’s Act on Transfer of Bonds, Shares, etc. (BETA). First, it suggests the control agreement method of transferring {{an interest in}} securities that is effective against third parties. Under the BETA, {{the creation of an}} effective interest in book-entry <b>securities</b> requires <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> in the <b>securities</b> accounts of the transferor and the transferee. Under the control agreement approach, the transferor, transferee, and the transferor’s securities intermediary would agree that (i) the intermediary would act on the instructions of the transferee with respect to securities credited to the transferor’s securities account or (ii) the intermediary would not act on the instructions of the transferor or (iii) both (i) and (ii). No <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> would be necessary. Second, it proposes to permit the creation of an effective transfer of an interest in a securities account—i. e., in any securities that from time to time are credited to a <b>securities</b> account—again, without <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> with respect to specific securities. The paper explains the historical origins of the control agreement and securities account concepts as they evolved in the revisions of UCC Articles 8 and 9 and as subsequently adopted by the GSC, providing inspiration for our proposals. It describes the transfer of securities under the BETA and it explains how the BETA could be revised to adopt the proposals. It also identifies some troublesome aspects of the BETA’s treatment of title transfer security interests (jōto tanpo) {{in the context of a}} transferee’s insolvency proceeding. The core of the paper is a policy analysis of the proposals. We conclude that the revisions would fit well with the underlying policies and the basic structure of the BETA and that on balance the revisions would be beneficial, such as by providing flexibility in financing and potentially lowering transactions costs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Book</b> <b>entries</b> are {{vehicles}} used {{in accounting}} to accommodate non-cash transactions, timing differences and provisions. The use of <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> {{is a normal}} activity in accounting and may {{have their origin in}} accrual accounting. The management of a company may apply creative accounting techniques in the form of earnings management, in particular, adopting the practices of income smoothing and taking the so-called ‘big bath’. These practices may result in the financial manager or accountant misusing <b>book</b> <b>entries.</b> This could then lead to information of a different integrity to that which would have resulted had these creative accounting practices not been performed in the company. The question addressed in this dissertation and for which an answer is sought, is whether there is any notable difference in the integrity issues of information supplied through the accounting process and created by real transactions (real events) as opposed to information created by <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> (artificial events). The hypothesis underlying this dissertation is: The integrity of information created by <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> is based on subjective opinions because it is based on future events therefore it {{is not the same as}} integrity of information created by real transactions that is based on historical events. The new science is concerned with new guidelines, amongst other things, regarding reality, observation, objectivity, predictions and relationships among events. These new guidelines could be seen as explaining certain aspects which is relevant to the field of accounting. The attributes of a <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> are not based on reality, but are based on subjective predictions of future transactions etc. Another similarity is that a <b>book</b> <b>entry</b> is often not objective but is based on subjective observation. Notable differences were observed in the integrity of the information emerging from a real, historical event and a future event. These differences were established through the application of two research methods, namely, the use of a questionnaire and the analysis of the financial statements of 30 companies listed on The JSE Securities Exchange South Africa (JSE). The influence of <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> on certain ratios was considered, and the ratios influenced by two major <b>book</b> <b>entries,</b> namely, depreciation provision and deferred taxation, differ substantially in interpretation when the two <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> are reclassified. The results of the questionnaire also indicate that a large proportion of the financial managers in practice believe that <b>book</b> <b>entries</b> substantially influence the integrity of information.
