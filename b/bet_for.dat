25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Boeing {{suffered}} from the simultaneous decline in Vietnam War military spending, the slowing {{of the space program}} as Project Apollo neared completion, the recession of 1969–70, and the company's $2billion debt as it built the new 747 airliner. Boeing did not receive any orders for more than a year. Its <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> the future, the 747, was delayed in production by three months because of problems with its Pratt & Whitney engines. Another problem was that, in 1971, the U.S. Congress decided to stop funding {{for the development of the}} supersonic 2707, Boeing's answer to the British-French Concorde, forcing the company to discontinue the project.|$|E
25|$|After {{surrendering}} their titles {{the following}} year, Cork {{had to wait}} until 1969 for further success. A 3–12 to 1–14 defeat of Wexford in the decider gave McCarthy his first National Hurling League medal. The subsequent provincial decider pitted Cork against reigning champions Tipperary. A 4–6 to 0–9 victory gave Cork a first defeat of Tipp since 1957 while it also gave McCarthy a second Munster medal. Once again this victory paved the way for an All-Ireland showdown with Kilkenny, however, the team suffered a setback before the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy broke his leg in a motorcycle accident. In spite of this Cork led at the interval and looked a good <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> the victory, particularly after Kilkenny forward Pat Delaney left the field on a stretcher. The Rebels were still to the good coming into the last quarter, however, Kilkenny scored five unanswered points in the last seven minutes to win by 2–15 to 2–9.|$|E

500|$|According to Range, the {{packaging}} of Tempt, Tease and Touch {{is designed to}} appeal to a larger audience as opposed to the release of a single product. The bottles for each of the perfumes are composed of two round parts: the body of the bottle and the ball cap. Tempt, Tease and Touch are packaged in black, pink, and grey bottles respectively. A writer for Cosmeticsbusiness.com attributed the Sugababes' decision to release three separate perfumes with Aspects Beauty Company founder Jill Hill's belief that an increasing investment in [...] "collections of scents instead of one major product" [...] would offer more value and be [...] "a relatively safe <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> brands".|$|E
500|$|Streisand's {{version of}} [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] divided music critics. A writer for Billboard was {{enthusiastic}} of the release, writing, [...] "Barbra takes the great Bob Marley reggae cut and commercializes it somewhat, though the flavor is still there. Good soulful backup and reggae type organ help make this an almost certain <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> heavy top 40 play". Author Derek Winnert referred to Streisand's version as a [...] "success" [...] in his 1996 book Barbra Streisand. However, an editor for Boating disliked Streisand's version and urged {{the public to}} [...] "ignore" [...] it, joking that it [...] "does not belong in [...] our stateroom". A reviewer from Broadcasting disliked everything about her version, stating, [...] "The Streisand voice and name alone might be {{enough to make a}} hit out of any of her single releases, but with the first single from her best-selling ButterFly album, the singer is taking no chances." ...|$|E
500|$|In Cobb's view, the {{transfer}} of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau's report {{on the state of}} the rigging and ropes that the ship's main halliard may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return on board when the danger had passed. If, however, the line had subsequently parted, Mary Celeste would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink, while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, [...] "If the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> survival than the ship's boat." [...] If this is what happened, says Hastings, Briggs [...] "...behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one." ...|$|E
30|$|As in the {{prediction}} period 2000 – 2010 reported in Table  4, our 1 -month-ahead trading strategies did not outperform the hedging strategies, except for ECM(1) with two common trends, VAR(1) changes in <b>betting</b> <b>for</b> slope and ECM(1) with one common trend in <b>betting</b> <b>for</b> level. Nevertheless, the <b>bets</b> <b>for</b> level {{based on the}} models ECM(1) with one and two common trends did outperform the level benchmark, which is the immunization strategy at the 1 -year investment horizon. Moreover, all the slope and curvature strategies were capable of outperforming the benchmarks provided by hedging strategies at the 1 -year investment horizon. Of all the strategies the NN model obtained the highest Sharpe ratios, on average, in the current crisis period for a 1 month horizon and QAR(1) for a 1 -year horizon.|$|R

500|$|The Dreamcast {{version was}} heavily criticized. Ryan Davis of GameSpot stated that [...] "the best <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> all {{involved}} {{would be to}} take your chips elsewhere". Similarly, IGN editor Jeremy Dunham noted that [...] "the blandness of the game's presentation would probably disappoint {{the most basic of}} cavemen. Even the graphics are disappointing. True, those card tables can look very realistic, but what else is there to marvel at? Nothing! Without any type of exploration feature, or other characters there isn't anything to render". Allgame's Bryan Hightower criticized that [...] "there are not enough games, there are annoying wait times, and the help mode is terrible". He also complained that [...] "the dealer deals painfully slow and has to say what cards you have twice. You can already read your hand right on the screen, so you don't need the dealer to waste your time". Hightower also cited that [...] "when you win at slots, the camera always goes {{to the bottom of the}} machine to show you the payout scale" [...] which [...] "becomes frustrating after a few credits because it is so slow. The act of leaving the table or machine is even slower". He also said that the advice the game gives you is [...] "Perhaps the most irritating 'feature' of this game" [...] because [...] "Each time you do something the computer wouldn't have done, a pop-up screen will appear that adds more time to the lengthy procedure of completing a bet". Hightower commented that [...] "The above-par graphics are quickly negated by the rock-bottom enjoyment factor" [...] and that [...] "this game doesn't have any of the character the real casino has".|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, it was {{announced}} that instead of using the original title of the novel, The <b>Bet,</b> <b>for</b> its film adaptation, it was renamed as Just The Way You Are.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1958 season, The Sporting News listed Demeter as the [...] "kid with {{greatest}} potential", and [...] "best <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> batting title", titles for the newly relocated Los Angeles Dodgers. After serving a six-month term with the Army in San Antonio, Texas, Demeter was discharged on April 17, 1958 and left to immediately join the Dodgers in Los Angeles. Playing time was initially scarce for him, only playing in 6 games before being optioned back to the AAA St. Paul Saints on May 9. In 80 games with St. Paul, Demeter hit [...]283 with 14 home runs and 48 RBI.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 May, Pope {{ran in the}} Derby Stakes against {{nine other}} horses. At the start, the Duke of Rutland's colt Salvator [...] "took the lead" [...] and was the frontrunner until Tattenham Corner when Mr. Wilson's {{chestnut}} colt Wizard took the lead. Wizard held his position until [...] "within a few strides of the winning-post" [...] when Pope's jockey Tom Goodisson [...] "made one serve for all" [...] and took the win from Wizard [...] "by a neck." [...] One commenter for Sporting Magazine thought that Goodisson [...] "rode his horse with great skill and judgement" [...] and [...] "gave great satisfaction to all present." [...] Wizard finished second and Salvator was third. Charles Bunbury's colt Fair Star (a full-brother to Eleanor) finished fourth. Goodisson reportedly only made one <b>bet</b> <b>for</b> the race, for his mount Pope to win against 8 to 1 odds. An engraving of the finish (right) was commissioned by Sporting Magazine from a painting by sporting artist John Nott Sartorius.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King in 2006, BET {{broadcast}} its regularly scheduled music video programming, rather than covering King's funeral live as CNN, Fox News Channel, MSNBC, and BET competitors TV One and Black Family Channel did. The BET website streamed the funeral live, while the channel periodically broadcast taped, 60-second reports from the funeral by senior news correspondent Andre Showell. Michael Lewellen, BET's {{senior vice president for}} corporate communications, defended the decision: [...] "We weighed a number of different options. In the end, we chose to offer a different kind of experience for BET viewers." [...] Lewellen also said that BET received around [...] "two dozen" [...] phone calls and [...] "a handful" [...] of emails criticizing <b>BET</b> <b>for</b> not showing the King funeral live. On the evening of the funeral, February 7, 2006, BET broadcast the tribute special Coretta Scott King: Married to the Mission, and BET repeated this the following Sunday, February 12. Showell hosted a program featuring highlights of the funeral, Coretta Scott King: Celebrating Her Spirit, that broadcast that same day. In its 2007 convention, the National Association of Black Journalists gave BET its Thumbs Down Award for not broadcasting King's funeral live.|$|E
