40|$|Unexploded {{ordnance}} (UXO) -contaminated sites {{often include}} ordnance filled with inert substances {{that were used}} in dummy rounds. During UXO surveys, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether ordnance is filled with explosives or inert material (e. g., concrete, plaster-of-paris, wax, etc.) or is empty. Without verification of the filler material, handling procedures often necessitate that the object be <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> which has potential impacts to the environment, personnel, communities and survey costs. The Department of Defense (DoD) needs a reliable, timely, non-intrusive and cost-effective way to identify filler material before a removal action. A new technology that serves this purpose would minimize environmental impacts, personnel safety risks and removal costs; and, thus, would be especially beneficial to remediation activities...|$|E

50|$|This {{city had}} four {{settlements}} due to {{ignorance of the}} physical environment of the region. The first one was in 1552 nearby Bur√≠a River, but moved in 1556 due to frequent floods suffered by inhabitants. The second one was in {{the valley of the}} Turbio River where the city stayed until Lope de Aguirre burned it down in 1561. Its rebuilding was made 102 km, but in 1562 they asked for permission to move to another site due to strong winds <b>blowing</b> <b>in</b> the <b>place.</b> Finally, Barquisimeto was located on the north plateau of the Turbio River in 1563.|$|R
50|$|The {{limestone}} of {{the area}} was formed from coral and marine creatures 200 million years ago and again 20 million {{years ago when the}} land was below sea level. Ground water since then has dissolved and eroded some of the limestone, creating the caves. The caves, such as the Victoria Fossil Cave and Blanche Cave, are often not far below ground, and holes open up creating traps for the unwary. This {{is the source of the}} remarkable collection of fossils. Mammals and other land creatures have fallen into open caves and been unable to escape. The fossil record has been preserved in strata formed from eroded topsoil washed and <b>blown</b> <b>in.</b> <b>In</b> some <b>places,</b> the fossil-bearing silt is up to 20 metres thick. Some of these areas are being preserved for future research when better methods of dating and reconstructing fossil records may have been found. These fossil traps are especially significant for tracing Australian megafauna.|$|R

5000|$|The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his Meteorology (c. 340 BCE), {{introduced}} a ten-to-twelve wind system. One reading of his {{system is that}} there are eight principal winds: Aparctias (N), Caecias (NE), Apeliotes (E), Eurus (SE), Notos (S), Lips (SW), Zephyrus (W) and Argestes (NW). Aristotle then goes on to add two half-winds, Thrascias (NNW) and Meses (NNE), noting that they [...] "have no contraries". Later, however, Aristotle suggests the Phoenicias wind for the SSE (<b>blows</b> locally <b>in</b> some <b>places),</b> but suggests nothing for SSW. So, seen this way, Aristotle really has an asymmetric windrose of ten winds, as two winds are effectively missing or only local.|$|R

Lying perdu, and shunning the garish sun {{through the}} day, one species rises {{at night with}} the stars; {{bursting}} forth in dazzling constellations of blossoms, which close at dawn. Others, slumbering through the darkness, are up and abroad with their petals, by peep of morn; and after inhaling its breath, again drop their lids in repose. While a third species, more capricious, refuse to expand at all, unless in the most brilliant sunshine, and upon the very tops of the loftiest trees.

They rose blurred before him as the creations of an evil dream, the wild descent of a rapid, the desperate effort of the portage, the long hours of toil at the paddle, and endless unrolling of whitened pines that crawled by them through the snow. Now at least, when he could do no more, that stupendous toil was finished. Turning, he glanced at Alton, who had with apparent difficulty swallowed a little of the tea. He lay amidst the blankets with eyes closed, breathing unevenly.|$|R
50|$|Deer Trail {{was founded}} when the Kansas Pacific Railway built a station {{in what is}} now Deer Trail in 1870.

6000|$|It was a {{magnificent}} blow, straight, clean, crisp, {{with the force}} of the loins and the back behind it. And it landed where he had meant it to-- upon the exact point of that blue-grained chin. Flesh and blood could not stand such a <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> such a <b>place.</b> Neither valour nor hardihood can save the man to whom it comes. The Master fell backwards, flat, prostrate, striking the ground with so simultaneous a clap that it was like a shutter falling from a wall. A yell, which no referee could control, broke from the crowded benches as the giant went down. He lay upon his back, his knees a little drawn up, his huge chest panting. He twitched and shook, but could not move. His feet pawed convulsively once or twice. It was no use. He was done. [...] "Eight--nine--ten!" [...] said the time-keeper, and the roar of a thousand voices, with a deafening clap like the broad-side of a ship, told that the Master of Croxley was the Master no more.|$|R

60|$|Again, the tempers both {{of parents}} and {{children}} are much less liable to be ruffled under this system than under the ordinary system. When instead of letting children experience the painful results which naturally follow from wrong conduct, parents themselves inflict certain other painful results, they produce double mischief. Making, as they do, multiplied family laws; and identifying their own supremacy and dignity with the maintenance of these laws; every transgression is regarded as an offence against themselves, and a cause of anger on their part. And then come the further vexations which result from taking upon themselves, {{in the shape of}} extra labour or cost, those evil consequences which should have been allowed to fall on the wrong-doers. Similarly with the children. Penalties which the necessary reaction of things brings round upon them--penalties which are inflicted by impersonal agency, produce an irritation that is comparatively slight and transient; whereas, penalties voluntarily inflicted by a parent, and afterwards thought of as caused by him or her, produce an irritation both greater and more continued. Just consider how disastrous would be the result if this empirical method were pursued from the beginning. Suppose it were possible for parents to take upon themselves the physical sufferings entailed on their children by ignorance and awkwardness; and that while bearing these evil consequences they visited on their children certain other evil consequences, with the view of teaching them the impropriety of their conduct. Suppose that when a child, who had been forbidden to meddle with the kettle, spilt boiling water on its foot, the mother vicariously assumed the scald and gave a <b>blow</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> of it; and similarly in all other cases. Would not the daily mishaps be sources of far more anger than now? Would there not be chronic ill-temper on both sides? Yet an exactly parallel policy is pursued in after-years. A father who beats his boy for carelessly or wilfully breaking a sister's toy, and then himself pays for a new toy, does substantially this same thing--inflicts an artificial penalty on the transgressor, and takes the natural penalty on himself: his own feelings and those of the transgressor being alike needlessly irritated. Did he simply require restitution to be made, he would produce far less heart-burning. If he told the boy that a new toy must be bought at his, the boy's, cost; and that his supply of pocket-money must be withheld to the needful extent; there would be much less disturbance of temper on either side: while in the deprivation afterwards felt, the boy would experience the equitable and salutary consequence. In brief, the system of discipline by natural reactions is less injurious to temper, both because it is perceived to be nothing more than pure justice, and because it in great part substitutes the impersonal agency of Nature for the personal agency of parents.|$|R
40|$|Vague terrain {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in Nottingham‚Äôs Lace Market Gallery during 2014, in Seconds a two-person show with Debra Swann, who had also developed work from the Spode site. This fourth outing of the Pam Flett Press emerges from a long time fascination {{with the sort of}} ambiguous derelict site to which architects and planners often given the name ‚Äòterrain vague‚Äô. It draws upon my encounters with such spaces as abandoned quarries and lead-mines across the North Pennines, Sheffield‚Äôs post-industrial topography and the hinterlands of the Staffordshire Potteries. It began as a piece of writing developed for a journal article, which then lay fallow in my computer for several years, an intellectual ruin awaiting redevelopment; it was ultimately colonized by creative and critical flora thanks to a research residency occasioning repeated visits to the former Spode ceramics factory in Stoke. Mirroring the scatter of heterogenous materials dumped or <b>blown</b> <b>in</b> to such <b>places</b> and the shifting process of use, reuse and abandonment, this publication involves a conceptual conglomeration of different aspects - a series of printed booklets, a collection of photographs - and a process of re-presentation in diverse forms and locations: each exhibition iteration will differ from the last as new ideas take root. </p...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY A {{preliminary}} {{qualitative study}} {{has been made in}} a smoke tunnel of the flow around a stationary circular cylinder, having rear jet <b>blowing,</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a uniform stream. Motographs have been taken which show many interesting flow phenomena. A knowledge of these it is hoped will aid future quantitative studies, It is found that when the jet is deflected downwards at an angle to the mainstream direction boundary layer separation is delayed around the cylinder and the cylinder develops a lift force in addition to its drag. The delay in boundary layer separation is suggested to be mainly the result of the 'sink effect' of the jet mixing. The lift, on :the other hand, appears to be primarily the result of partial attainment of stagnation pressure {{on both sides of the}} jet at exit, and is therefore of similar origin to the ‚ÄòThwaites‚Äô flap. A smaller, but no less significant, contribution to the lift arises from the direct and in 91 rect effects of the jet blowing...|$|R
