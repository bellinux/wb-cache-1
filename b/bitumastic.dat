50|$|<b>Bitumastic</b> Football Club, {{or short}} <b>Bitumastic,</b> is a Ugandan {{football}} club from Kampala. They {{play in the}} Second division of Ugandan football, the Ugandan Big League.|$|E
50|$|Otti is {{best remembered}} {{as one of}} the most {{successful}} coaches in Ugandan football and led all giant clubs in Ugandan Football that include Express, SC Villa and KCC FC to multiple titles, and was successful both with attacking and defensive tactics. His career began in the 1960s, playing for <b>Bitumastic</b> and the Uganda Cranes (the national team of Uganda), including the 1968 African Cup of Nations. He began his coaching career in 1973.|$|E
50|$|Once {{again the}} {{logistics}} {{involved in the}} construction were impressive. Before planting and building could start a thick <b>bitumastic</b> base was laid on the roof, followed by a layer of loose brick and rubble that was arranged in a fan-like pattern to aid drainage. On top of this was a 36-inch layer of topsoil into which the planting was made. Water came from Derry and Toms own artesian wells. On opening day the gardens contained over 500 different varieties of trees and shrubs.|$|E
5000|$|Submarine {{pipelines}} generally vary {{in diameter}} from 3 in for gas lines, to 72 in for high capacity lines. Wall thicknesses typically range from 10 mm to 75 mm. The pipe {{can be designed}} for fluids at high temperature and pressure. The walls are made from high-yield strength steel, 350-500 MPa (50,000-70,000 psi), weldability {{being one of the}} main selection criteria. The structure is often shielded against external corrosion by coatings such as <b>bitumastic</b> or epoxy, supplemented by cathodic protection with sacrificial anodes. [...] Concrete or fiberglass wrapping provides further protection against abrasion. The addition of a concrete coating is also useful to compensate for the pipeline's negative buoyancy when it carries lower density substances.|$|E
5000|$|Finlock gutters, a {{proprietary}} name for concrete gutters, {{can be employed}} on a large range of buildings. There were used on domestic properties in the 1950s and 1960s, {{as a replacement for}} cast iron gutters when there was a shortage of steel and surplus of concrete. [...] They were discredited after differential movement was found to open joints and allow damp to penetrate, but can be fitted with an aluminium and <b>bitumastic</b> liner. [...] Finlock concrete gutter units are made up of two troughs - one is the visible gutter and the other sits across the cavity wall. The blocks which can range from 8 to 12 in can be joined using reinforcing rods and concrete, to form lintels for doors and windows.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{coated metal}} roofing tiles {{to be made}} in New Zealand were {{produced}} by Martile Roofing Ltd in Howick in 1956 and were pressed from an aluminium manganese alloy. They were then coated with High Bake Enamel. By 1957, L.J. Fisher had bought the rights to use the Martile profile from A.L.W. Martinsen and Son Ltd and was producing his own tile. Part of the condition of the rights purchase was that Fisherâ€™s four-pan tile with its <b>bitumastic</b> emulsion coating was to be made from galvanised steel, thereby ensuring a different product.He formed LJ Fisher & Co. Ltd. (LJF) in 1957. In 1969, LJF merged with Alex Harvey & Sons and the New Zealand activities of Australian Consolidated Industries, forming Alex Harvey Industries (AHI), with AHI Roofing Pty Ltd being its subsidiary.|$|E
50|$|The main {{league in}} Uganda {{spanning}} {{at least three}} decades was the Kampala and District Football League (KDFL). By 1966 the league had three tiers with a First Division, Second Division and a Third Division which was divided into two sections comprising a North Zone and a South Zone. Kampala City Council FC competed in the Third Division South and gained promotion {{to the next level}} for the 1967 season. Other teams that are known to have played in the KDFL include Aggrey Memorial, Army FC, <b>Bitumastic,</b> Coffee Kakira, Express FC, Kampala Police FC, KDS (Kampala District Bus Services), Kitegombwa, Luo Union, Mengo Old Boys, Mulago Hospital, Old Agrarians, Prisons FC Kampala, Railways, Nsambya, Sudanese FC, UEB, United Budonians and Young Salumbey. Little is known about champion clubs in the KDFL other than United Budonians winning the league in 1949 and Police taking the title in 1953 and the Railway African Club football team winning the second division in the same season. Express FC clinched the Division One title in the 1964 season.|$|E
40|$|Homeowners {{in areas}} not served by {{municipal}} sewage treatment systems face {{a problem of}} providing safe and effective wastewater treatment systems for their homes. There are several methods currently available for proper treatment of home sewage, including septic tank absorption fields, mounds, lagoons, aerobic treatment units and others. These systems and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in this NebGuide. Treatment and disposal of domestic sewage is of concern because {{of the variety of}} pathogenic organisms contained in sewage. These include bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that come from the digestive tract, respiratory tract, and skin of man. Some of the illnesses caused by these include dysentery, infectious hepatitis and typhoid. It is important to keep these disease-causing organisms from entering underground water supplies or surface waters through improperly designed or installed sewage treatment systems. Septic Tank-Absorption Field System Conventionally, the septic tank-absorption field system has proven satisfactory for many areas when properly designed, installed, and maintained. However, conditions do exist where this system is not suitable. Areas of seasonal high groundwater tables, bedrock in close proximity to the soil surface, or soils having very fast or very slow percolation rates are not suited for the septic tank-absorption field system. Other limitations for this system include topography, small lot size and proximity to water supplies used for drinking or recreation. The typical septic tank-absorption field home sewage treatment system consists of two major components- the septic tank and the absorption field (Figure 1). In the septic tank, solids are separated from the liquid, undergo anaerobic digestion and are stored as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} tank. The liquid (septic tank effluent) flows to the absorption field where it percolates into the soil. The soil acts as a final treatment by removing bacteria, pathogens, fine particles, and some chemicals. Figure 1. Typical septic tank-absorption field home sewage treatment system. The minimum septic tank liquid capacity for any location is I, 000 gallons (3, 800 1). For houses having more than three bedrooms, an additional 250 gallons (950 I) of tank capacity is added per bedroom. Septic tanks must be water tight and constructed from durable materials that resist excessive corrosion, frost damage and cracking or buckling due to settlement or backfilling. Common construction materials include concrete, fiberglass and <b>bitumastic</b> coated steel. Location of the septic tank is usually determined by the placement of the home plumbing and the topography of the land. Septic tanks should be located at least 15 feet (4. 5 m) from foundation walls and at least 50 feet (15 m) from private water supplies or surface waters. The location should be accessible for cleaning but should not be located beneath sidewalks, patios or driveways. Also, consider possible expansion of the house when selecting a site for septic tank placement...|$|E
