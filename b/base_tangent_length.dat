This thesis documents an evaluation of the relationships between accident rates at horizontal curves and preceding <b>tangent</b> <b>length</b> and sight distance. Data collection and statistical methods used to evaluate this relationship are presented. A base relationship between accident rates at horizontal curves and degree of curvature was established, and the effects of various variables on this relationship were examined. These variables included lane width, total pavement width, state in which the data was collected, <b>tangent</b> <b>length</b> and sight distance. Analysis was performed to determine whether these variables should be included in an operating-speed or workload based consistency model. The analysis of lane width, total pavement width, and state demonstrated no practical significance for explaining the variability in the relationship between accident rate at horizontal curves and degree of curvature. Therefore, none of these variables were included in the final model. This thesis included two hypothesis: (11) <b>tangent</b> <b>length</b> is a significant factor that should be included in an operating- speed or workload based consistency model, and (2) preceding sight distance is a significant factor that should be included in an operating-speed or workload based consistency model. Regression analysis on this database suggested that neither <b>tangent</b> <b>length</b> nor preceding sight distance are significant variables in explaining the variability in accidents on horizontal curves for a given degree of curvature category.

40|$|Problem: Accident {{statistics}} {{demonstrate that}} there should be a greater focus on nighttime driving to improve our knowledge of driver behavior under poor lighting conditions. However, the current geometric design criteria do not take into account driving at night. Moreover, studies that propose predictive models of operating speed only consider daytime driving conditions. Method: This study compares driver speed behavior during daytime and nighttime driving and models operating speeds and speed differentials, identifying significant factors that influence speed behavior under different lighting conditions. The research was carried out using a driving simulator for a section of an existing two-lane rural road composed of 39 tangent-curve configurations. Speed profiles were recorded for 40 drivers under simulated daytime and nighttime driving conditions. Results: New predictive speed models, differentiated for daytime and nighttime driving, are proposed that highlight the effects of different geometric predictors under different visibility conditions. Specifically, predictive models for operating speed on curves identified the inverse of the radius and the deflection angle of the curve as predictors under both driving conditions. For speed differentials based on the 85 th percentile for maximum speed reduction (85 MSR), we found that the inverse of the approaching <b>tangent</b> <b>length</b> and of the curve radius significantly explained the dependent variable in both cases, with a higher dependence of nighttime 85 MSR on the curve geometry than on the <b>tangent</b> <b>length.</b> <b>Tangent</b> <b>length</b> had a significant effect on operating speed for independent tangents only for the daytime model, whereas the inverse of the previous radius was confirmed as a predictor for both visibility conditions.

40|$|Pose {{estimation}} of two-pose 3 D models using the <b>base</b> <b>tangent</b> plane and stability constraints A pose estimation technique {{is presented to}} determine coarse registration parameters between two 3 D models of an object. The models are reconstructed by merging multi-view range images of two different poses of the object, which is arbitrarily placed on a turntable. The result of pose estimation will facilitate registration refinement and integration of two 3 D models. Registration refinement of two 3 D models usually requires a rough estimate of pose between them. However, obtaining such estimate is a difficult problem and computationally expensive. We introduce a simple pose estimation technique <b>based</b> on matching <b>tangent</b> planes of a 3 D model with the <b>base</b> <b>tangent</b> plane (BTP) which is invariant for a vision system. In order to reduce computation time, we employ geometric constraints to find consistent and stable tangent planes (STP). A STP is a plane on which the object can rest in a stable state on a turntable. By matching the <b>base</b> <b>tangent</b> plane of one 3 D model to a stable tangent plane of the other model, we derive a pose transformation matrix and register the models to a common coordinate system. We find the best-matching pose transformation matrix which minimizes a pose error beween two models. Experimental results on several real objects are presented to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} method. ...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{alignment}} {{in which}} a short section of roadway is hidden from the driver's view should be avoided in design because hidden-dip profiles contribute to passing maneuver accidents. These profiles can be examined only graphically because no analytical method is available. In this paper, an analytical method for evaluating hidden-dip profiles is developed. The locations on the traveled path where the sight-hidden dip starts and ends {{are related to the}} roadway and vehicle parameters. The roadway parameters are the algebraic difference in grades and lengths of the crest and sag arcs, the common <b>tangent</b> <b>length,</b> and the second <b>tangent</b> <b>length.</b> The vehicle parameters are the driver's eye height and the height of the roof of the opposing vehicle. Exact relationships and graphical aids for finding the locations of the start and end of the sight-hidden dip for existing profiles and the combinations of parameters that avoid these dips in design are developed. The adequacy of the minimum rates of vertical curvature of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials is examined. In practice, the locations of the start and end of sight-hidden dips can be delineated on the highway using appropriate signing to achieve safer operations. ...|$|R

Examples of ACI applications {{can be found}} in highway management however, compared to transportation planning, research of ACI methods applied to infrastructure management has been relatively limited.

In particular the objective of the research study is to compare the predicted operating speed on tangents and circular curves for low-volume roads by using two different statistical approaches. The starting point was to predict the operating speed on investigated tangents and circular curves elements by using four regression equations developed using a traditional ordinary–least-squares method (OLS) as shown in a previous work of the authors. Then, the same database was used to calibrate new operating speed models by using ANN procedure.

40|$|AbstractThe {{geometric}} design, {{especially the}} {{horizontal and vertical}} alignments, of rural two-lane highway facilities {{is considered one of}} the most important factors affecting the quality of traffic service and safety. A consistent highway geometric design is defined to be one that conforms to the driver's expectations. In order to calculate the main measures of design consistency, an accurate operating speed profile model for road alignment is needed. Studies have shown that operating speed models are country dependent due to varying demographics, driver attitudes, habits, etc. This paper develops a speed profile model for two-lane rural roads in Egypt. This includes the development of operating speed models for horizontal curves and tangents, as well as the study of the characteristics and relationships between acceleration and deceleration rates before and after horizontal curves. The study uses a desert rural two-lane, two-way road sections that connect the city of Sohag with the city of Hurghada, in Upper Egypt. All geometric characteristics were obtained from highway authority. Speed data regarding individual drivers traveling on selected two-lane rural road sections were sampled using an on-board GPS system. The study confirms the finding in previous research that curvature is the most important factor in determining the speed on horizontal curves. Moreover, <b>tangent</b> <b>length</b> is the most important factor in determining operating speeds at tangents. The acceleration and deceleration characteristics were derived to gain an understanding of the behavior of individual vehicles traveling through curves of varying radii and lengths as well as preceding <b>tangent</b> <b>length.</b> Several operating speed models were developed for tangents and curves as well as for acceleration and deceleration rates. Incredibly effective, these models can be used for design consistency evaluations...|$|R

The results of multiple linear regression analysis allowed to propose new predictive speed models, differentiated for daytime and nighttime driving, highlighting the effects of different geometric predictors under different visibility conditions.
