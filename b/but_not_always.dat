Petrarchan sonnets typically discussed the love and beauty of a beloved, often an unattainable love, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>always.</b> It also contains a volta, or shift in the poem's subject matter, beginning with the third quatrain.|$|E
5|$|Stephen's rule {{consolidated}} {{the usage}} of the coat of arms of Moldavia, featuring the aurochs head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as a helmet atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under Alexander the Good, which also featured a rose, crescent, sun and star (often, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>always,</b> five-pointed); its tinctures remain unknown. This arrangement was not familiar to heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, they represented Moldavia with attributed arms featuring Maures; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen's victories over the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} nests in colonies, which are often, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>always,</b> found around bodies of water. The colonies are usually found in {{woodlands}} near lakes or rivers, in swamps, or on small inland or coastal islands, and are sometimes shared with other wetland birds, such as herons, egrets, ibises and cormorants. The breeding season varies within South Asia. Nesting in northern India {{begins with the}} onset of monsoons in May. The breeding season in Australia is November to early January, with one brood laid per season. The North American breeding season lasts from April to October. In the Seychelles, the breeding season of the subspecies B.i. seychellarum is April to October.|$|E

5|$|The {{green algae}} {{are a large}} group of {{photosynthetic}} eukaryotes that include many microscopic organisms. Although some green algae are classified as protists, others such as charophyta are classified with embryophyte plants, which are the most familiar group of land plants. Algae can grow as single cells, or in long chains of cells. The green algae include unicellular and colonial flagellates, usually <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> with two flagella per cell, as well as various colonial, coccoid, and filamentous forms. In the Charales, which are the algae most closely related to higher plants, cells differentiate into several distinct tissues within the organism. There are about 6000 species of green algae.|$|E

County delegations often chose divines from their own county, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>always.</b> Commons chose the members in this {{way to ensure that}} their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Netherlandish {{painting}} ends in {{the narrowest}} sense {{with the death of}} Gerard David in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>always</b> associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists. In the early 16th century, artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions. The painting of the early 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century, continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of Renaissance humanism, turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes. A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of Northern Mannerism around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.|$|E
