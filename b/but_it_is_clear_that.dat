5|$|However, Peloponnesians {{may have}} been party to Themistocles's stratagem, so serenely did they accept that they would now have to fight at Salamis. The Allied navy was thus able to prepare {{properly}} for battle the forthcoming day, whilst the Persians spent the night fruitlessly at sea, searching for the alleged Greek evacuation. The next morning, the Persians rowed into the straits to attack the Greek fleet; {{it is not clear}} when, why or how this decision was made, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they did take the battle to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Later in Monk's Café, Jerry {{goes back}} on the deal and decides {{not to take the}} place because George wants it. The two {{continue}} to argue about who should own it, and decided that neither of them should take it. A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves. They overhear two people having a conversation about someone else moving out of their apartment, to which all three ask what the apartment's rent is.|$|E

5|$|On May 30, 1968, after {{a wrestling}} show in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Vázquez, and fellow wrestler Popeye Franco, {{were killed by}} a Cantena owner during a fight. Records are unclear if Eusebio Vázquez had any children, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the wrestler who later worked as Espanto Jr. and {{claimed to be the}} son of Eusebio Vázquez was not related at all. That Espanto Jr., Jesús Andrade Salas, was allowed to use the name by Espanto II. Later on other Espantos would follow in the {{footsteps}} of the character that Eusebio Vázquez created, including his nephews Espanto IV and V, Los Hijos del Espanto, Espantito, and a new Espanto Jr., son of the original Espanto.|$|E
5|$|Bryennios had camped at {{the plain}} of Kedoktos (a name {{deriving}} from the Latin aquaeductus) {{on the road}} to Constantinople. His army comprised 12,000 mostly seasoned men from the regiments (tagmata) of Thessaly, Macedonia and Thrace, as well as Frankish mercenaries and the elite tagma of the Hetaireia. Alexios's forces included 2,000 Turkish horse-archers, 2,000 Chomatenoi from Asia Minor, a few hundred Frankish knights from Italy, and the newly raised regiment of the Immortals, which had been created by Michael VII's chief minister Nikephoritzes and was intended to form the nucleus of a new army. Estimates of Alexios's total force vary from 5,500–6,500 (Haldon) to some 8,000–10,000 (Birkenmeier), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he was at a considerable disadvantage against Bryennios; not only was his force considerably smaller, but also far less experienced than Bryennios's veterans.|$|E
5|$|No chronicler {{for this}} period is entirely {{trustworthy}} or unbiased, often because their accounts were written {{to support a}} particular cause, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> most contemporary chroniclers were highly critical of Edward. The Polychronicon, Vita Edwardi Secundi, Vita et Mors Edwardi Secundi and the Gesta Edwardi de Carnarvon for example all condemned the King's personality, habits and choice of companions. Other records from his reign show criticism of Edward by his contemporaries, including the Church and {{members of his own}} household. Political songs were written about him, complaining about his failure in war and his oppressive government. Later in the 14th century, some chroniclers, such as Geoffrey le Baker and Thomas Ringstead, rehabilitated Edward, presenting him as a martyr and a potential saint, although this tradition died out in later years.|$|E

5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{had made}} no {{official}} provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough and had acquired experience in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account in al-Tabari, on his deathbed, al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as Caliph on 9 August, {{with the name of}} al-Mu'tasim. It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas's absence elsewhere, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his position was far from secure: {{a large part of the}} army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas himself refused, whether out of weakness or out of a desire to avoid a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce to al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim immediately called off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project and returned with his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20 September.|$|E

25|$|The {{timeline}} of Celtic {{settlement in}} the British Isles is unclear and the object of much speculation, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> by the 1st century BC, most of Great Britain and Ireland was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples {{now known as the}} Insular Celts, divided into two large groups, Brythonic or P-Celtic, and Goidelic or Q-Celtic.|$|E

If the alpha particle were to pass through a gold foil some 400 atoms thick and experience maximal deflection in the same direction (unlikely), it would still be a small deflection.|$|E
25|$|These data {{confirm that}} the {{enthalpy}} changes are approximately equal for the two reactions and that {{the main reason for}} the greater stability of the chelate complex is the entropy term, which is much less unfavorable. In general it is difficult to account precisely for thermodynamic values in terms of changes in solution at the molecular level, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the chelate effect is predominantly an effect of entropy.|$|E

However, CO2 levels can affect different EcM associations quite differently, and many studies with negligible effects have also been performed.|$|E

Howard and Gladys had a baby girl, Dorothea, on October 28, 1911; and a second daughter, Gladys Sprague Knox, in January 1913. In 1914, Howard and Gladys Knox divorced.|$|E
25|$|Prior to European {{settlement}} of Australia in 1788, Europeans {{had been to}} the land merely as explorers.

The basis of the claim is not clear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the indigenous peoples were not consulted and no treaty was entered into.

In 1953, Hynek was an associate member of the Robertson Panel, which concluded that there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and that a public relations campaign should be undertaken to debunk the subject and reduce public interest. Hynek would later lament that the Robertson Panel had helped make UFOs a disreputable field of study.|$|E

Ashinas built a palace which contained a mosque; after his death, this building was given to al-Fath ibn Khaqan.

Howard replied, claimed that Marion refused to live with him unless his mother left the house. The War Department was satisfied with this response and determined that no action would be taken, however, it has been suggested that this event may have colored Howard’s reputation with the army.|$|E
