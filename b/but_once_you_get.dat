500|$|Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a two and {{half out of}} four stars saying, [...] "Who knew that the franchise's creators would {{eventually}} find a plot twist that made sense? Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value? Given our cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> past that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E

He explains, [...] "if you're on the defensive, try to look completely dejected and uninterested, in the hope that your opponent will <b>get</b> careless; <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> start <b>getting</b> your pieces into action and complicating the position, look as confident as possible in an effort to frighten him."

2500|$|Due to the Game Pak's space limitations, {{full motion}} video {{is not usually}} {{feasible}} for use in cutscenes. A notable exception is Resident Evil 2, which contains the equivalent material of the two CD-ROM discs of the original PlayStation version, plus some expanded content, plus higher quality audio samples and unique surround sound technology, making it what IGN calls [...] "the best version of the game". Some games contain significant cinematic scenes whose graphics are generated by the system in real-time, as with [...] Nintendo downplayed the importance of studio-prerendered videos, with software engineering manager Jim Merrick saying, [...] "Full-motion video demos really well on a CD-ROM, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into the software, as a gamer, you're thinking 'let's {{get on with the}} game.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and {{trying to find a way}} to get a win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E

500|$|The episode shared themes with {{previous}} episodes {{from the first}} season such as [...] "Ice" [...] and [...] "Darkness Falls", which both featured the agents finding new lifeforms in remote locations. James Wong was somewhat negative concerning the episode's similarities to [...] "Ice", saying, [...] "If the show starts to cannibalize itself, there's going to be trouble". Gordon stated, however, [...] "I know there are some similarities with 'Ice', <b>but</b> I think <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> beyond the similarities {{of a group of}} people in a confined space going up against a creature, there are enough differences to separate the two".|$|R
50|$|Wainwright {{said of the}} project: I guess a {{fair number}} of people know the sonnets, but the plays are the {{centerpiece}} of Shakespeare's legend. But I've found in working with the sonnets they even transcend the plays, though to even fathom that is inconceivable since the plays are so amazing. <b>But</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> start to <b>get</b> into the sonnets it takes on this timeless, ageless, almost futuristic quality. So much of the language and so much of the sentiment is contemporary -- gender and sexuality and love and hate are just so plainly exhibited that it's really searing.|$|R
40|$|A robust {{relationship}} between subjective well-being and mortality {{has been established}} in the literature. While this relationship has been confirmed for many measures and data sets, few studies address how it is affected by concrete diseases. In this paper we assess for the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) data set from 1991 - 2008 how life satisfaction interacts with twelve concrete health impairments. Specifically, we analyze whether subjective well-being predicts longer survival in the panel for individuals having the respective impairments. We find that cancer, chest pains and diabetes consistently decrease survival in our sample, even controlling for the severity of health problems. But our results cast doubt on strong claims for the benefits of well-being on mortality: while life satisfaction generally predicts longer survival in the data set, this finding is not robust to controlling for the endogeneity of subjective well-being, and we do not find significant interactions between substantive health impairments and life satisfaction. Higher subjective well-being may keep <b>you</b> healthy, <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> have <b>gotten</b> sick, it does not predict your survival...|$|R
60|$|DEAR SPEED:--Yours of the 1st instant came to hand {{three or}} four days ago. When this shall reach you, you will have been Fanny's husband several days. You know my desire to befriend you is everlasting; that I will never cease while I know how to do anything. But you will always {{hereafter}} be on ground that I have never occupied, and consequently, if advice were needed, I might advise wrong. I do fondly hope, however, that you will never again need any comfort from abroad. But should I be mistaken in this, should excessive pleasure still be accompanied with a painful counterpart at times, still let me urge you, as I have ever done, to remember, in the depth and even agony of despondency, that very shortly you are to feel well again. I am now fully convinced that you love her as ardently as you are capable of loving. Your ever being happy in her presence, and your intense anxiety about her health, if there were nothing else, would place this beyond all dispute in my mind. I incline to think it probable that your nerves will fail you occasionally for a while; <b>but</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> them firmly guarded now that trouble is over forever. I think, if I were you, in case my mind were not exactly right, I would avoid being idle. I would immediately engage in some business, or go to making preparations for it, which would be the same thing. If you went through the ceremony calmly, or even with sufficient composure not to excite alarm in any present, you are safe beyond question, and in two or three months, to say the most, will be the happiest of men.|$|E

5000|$|Author Steven A. Schwartz called Lolo a {{strategic}} game, and that {{players who have}} successfully done logic problems in magazines would {{have an easier time}} with this game. Similarly, Dennis Lynch of the Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "challenge of logic, not brute force", as well as [...] "addictive". He also noted that Lolo was a game that would appeal to both genders. Author Andy Slaven called its puzzles creative. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish called it a great puzzle game, calling it [...] "highly recommended" [...] due to its combination of its complexity and simplicity. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas felt that it would be intriguing to fans of puzzle-action games, calling it [...] "simple on the surface, <b>but</b> deceptively complex <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> going". GameSpy's Benjamin Turner commented that it was [...] "hard as hell", and would [...] "put any Mensa member to the test". Fellow GameSpy writer Christian Nutt bemoaned HAL for abandoning Lolo for Kirby. Nintendo Life's Darren Calvert called its level designs [...] "ingenious", commenting that they will [...] "tax the old grey matter". Nintendo World Report's Michael Cole commented that its gameplay remained fresh in its Wii release, as well as [...] "approachable".|$|R
5000|$|... "Everybody’s {{experienced}} it - when you like somebody, {{it makes you}} a different person. It changes you and it changes you in a minute. But that song {{is not just about}} Lindsey. It’s about a movie I saw about Arturo Sandoval, the trumpet player. I loved this movie, and I just loved the way that through all the pain and separation, they managed to do music and stay happy and keep love alive, and dancing and rhythm and music, how healing it was. That was really my inspiration for that song. The chorus was written first, then I went back to write the verses. It was initially inspired by that movie. <b>But</b> then <b>once</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> part of the poem down, you can’t always write all of it about what inspired it initially. You have to go back. You have this great chorus that basically says, [...] "If you dance with me, you won’t be mad at me anymore. We can be in a huge argument, but if we put on some music and start to dance, everything will be great." [...] Then I had to think about what to make the verses about. So I went back over all my relationships with people and think of different ways that I have felt when I wanted basically to burst into song and sing that chorus (laughs). Give me one more chance. That’s what came out of it. It’s funny because, we just did an interview the day before yesterday, and I don’t think any of the band knows that that was the reason I wrote the song.". In other interviews Nicks has referred to Christine McVie as the inspiration to the song.|$|R
