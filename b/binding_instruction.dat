40|$|In the old Polish {{political}} culture a deputy was regarded {{not as a}} representative of the whole nation (genUy) but as a mandataIy of a local diet obliged to follow the <b>binding</b> <b>instruction</b> he received from the diet (imperative mandate). At the end of the 18 th century it was necessary to change this situation. This problem was to be solved by the Great Seym (1788 - 1792), which in this article is associated with the notion of a mild revolution. The Polish mild revolution was a great social movement dominated by the enlightened landed gentry, who strongly believed in the fundamentallegislative role of the Seym convened in Warsaw in 1788. This Seym became confederated Seym (taking decisions on all questions by a simple majority vote) and permanent governing Seym (combining legislative and executive powers and permanently in session). The great role of the permanent Seymwas that it elevated the middle genUy to the position of the real sovereign of the Commonwealth. Owingto this the enlightened provincial gentry was able to identify with the deputies debating in Warsaw as far as political reforms were concerned. The enlightened landed gentry greatly appreciated the legislative activity of the Seym, thanks to which the prestige of the deputies as real representatives of the interests of the provincial gentry was increasing. At the same time the landed gentry became more and more disappointed in the <b>binding</b> <b>instruction.</b> During the local diets in February and November 1790 the landed gentry realized that the local diets were dominated by political forces which made it impossible for the enlightened provincial genUy to fully politically identify with the Seym debating in Warsaw. Hence the provincial genUy started to distrust the <b>binding</b> <b>instruction</b> and began to accept the idea of a deputy {{as a representative of}} the whole gentry. The new concepts of the gentry concerning the relations between the Seym and local diets were shaped not on the theoretical grounds but in the course of political events dominated by the mild revolution. These changes in the consciousness of the provincial gentry made it easier for the king, who was the opponent of the <b>binding</b> <b>instruction,</b> to introduce to the Third of MayConstitution the decision that a deputy is a representative of the nation. The new relations between the Seym and the local diets were shown by the fact that local diets played the role of a specifically understood referendum expressing moral and political opinions and not taking binding decisions. Mter the Third of May Constitution local diets were reduced to the role of constituencies...|$|E

40|$|Jury {{practice}} {{in the state and}} federal courts evolved dramatically in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Around the time of the ratification of the Bill of Rights in 1791, important legal thinkers praised the civil jury as a bulwark against judicial tyranny. By the advent of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 1938, many commentators regarded the civil jury as an antiquated nuisance. Diminishment of the jury and open exercise of judicial power, encouraged in the Federal Rules by procedures such as summary judgment, {{would not have been possible}} without earlier changes in jury practice. Two major changes were the rise of directed verdict procedure and the related judgment notwithstanding the verdict. These mechanisms allowed a judge to give a <b>binding</b> <b>instruction</b> to a jury, or to enter a judgment contrary to the jury’s decision. This Study reveals that railroads revolutionized the law of jury control. Changes in directed verdict were part of a larger program of jury reform beginning in the mid-nineteenth century in England, the states, and the federal government. Because of growing numbers of complicated personal injury suits against railroads, and because of perceived jury bias in those cases, many judges sought to control juries more efficiently. Directed verdicts began to replace new trials. Opposition arose, but the overall trend was toward greater judicial control of juries. The striking changes in jury practice described in this Article suggest difficulties in maintaining a consistent jury trial right by constitutional requirement...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} older adults may have specific declines in prefrontal cortex (PFC) -mediated processes supported source memory retrieval, such as strategic retrieval and post-retrieval monitoring.

Behavioral research suggests that explicitly integrating a target context, or source, with a stimulus during encoding will improve subsequent source memory performance for both younger and older adults. Explicit item-feature <b>binding</b> <b>instructions</b> during encoding may alleviate source memory impairments, in part, by reducing the need for strategic processing during episodic retrieval. The present ERP study investigated whether explicit direction of attention toward item-feature integration may reduce age-related deficits in source memory by alleviating the necessity of frontally-mediated strategic processing at retrieval. Results demonstrated that explicit direction of attention improved source memory accuracy for both young and older adults, but older adults benefited less than the young, indicating additional age-related deficits. ERPs revealed that explicit encoding support attenuated post-retrieval monitoring effects in the young. In the old, explicit encoding instruction resulted in earlier onset of early frontal effects, possibly related to familiarity.

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent and reduce water {{nuisance}} and flooding, {{it should be possible}} to modify water systems and to prevent activities that increase the risk of water nuisance and flooding. The management of water systems needs a set of public law instruments which also enable the actual performance of that management. These public law instruments are provided by the Water Act (Waterwet), the Water Boards Act (Waterschapswet) and the relevant rules and regulations based on these two Acts. This book focuses on the question as to what extent water system managers are able to perform their water assignment using the public law instruments provided by this legislation, and how they can use these instruments in an effective manner. In addition, an analysis is made of possible problems in using these instruments and how they might be solved. The main conclusion of this study is that the water system managers have sufficient and adequate public law instruments at their disposal to carry out their management assignment. For the active management assignment, the Water Act provides for an effective project procedure regarding construction or modification of certain water management structures, which even allows the Provincial Executive to take decisions if municipal bodies refuse to cooperate. If the construction, modification or management of water management structures requires the cooperation of any third parties, the the water system managers have the authority to enforce this cooperation imposing or invoking an obligation to tolerate. When the third party does not want to cooperate they can use the instrument of expropriation. In order to carry out their consolidating management assignment, the water system managers are authorised to regulate the use of water systems in {{order to prevent}} nuisance and flooding. They can therefore adopt a system of exemptions and permits or general rules that apply to activities that may cause the standards to be exceeded. Although the existing public law instruments are generally adequate, this book also includes some recommendations on the subject of legal certainty, efficiency and transparency to improve these instruments to carry out the water management assignment. Carrying out the water management assignment does not just require public law instruments to be adequate, but also that these instruments are actually used. Therefore, it is significant that the division of tasks and powers between the various government authorities that are involved in the water management assignment is clear and that these authorities bring their relevant policies into line. The main recommendations of this study focus on the recognition of the water system manager’s own responsibility to carry out his management assignment and on giving them the necessary public law instruments to actually exercise that responsibility. Other recommendations include: Recognition of the provincial authorities’ crucial role when bringing municipalities’ and Water Boards’ policies in line with their use of public law instruments, and introduction of a strict division between the water system managers’ power to establish generally <b>binding</b> <b>instructions</b> and the municipalities’ power to give generally <b>binding</b> <b>instructions</b> pursuant to the Spatial Planning Act...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} ratification debates {{for the federal}} constitution in 1787 - 88. The goal of this project has been to examine {{the use of the}} rhetorical strategies of prudence and decorum as they are employed within the debates in Massachusetts, Virginia and New York. In Massachusetts, classical notions of representation are challenged by the use of <b>binding</b> <b>instructions</b> given to delegates sent to the ratification debates. In addition, Massachusetts federalists had to overcome objections to the proposed constitution based on the system of representation, as well as the absence of a Bill of Rights. Federalists Challenged these views, and established a method of ratification that garnered the goodwill of the Massachusetts electorate, as well as creating a method for ratification in many other states that desired more clearly enumerated rights. In Virginia, Federalist were faced with prospect of debating {{one of the most popular}} and respected revolutionaries in the newly independent country, Patrick Henry. While the federalists had the advantage of a constitutional architect, James Madison, to speak for them, as a rhetor, Madison was powerfully overmatched by Henry 2 ̆ 7 s rhetorical acumen. In order to overcome this disadvantage, Federalists positioned themselves in the position of the rational problem solvers, leaving Henry 2 ̆ 7 s fiery protests largely unanswered, while focusing on the immediate problems fo the struggling nation. In this way, while Henry was engaging, and memorable, Madison was by far the more decorous of the disputants. Finally, in New York, the federalist found themselves outnumbered and, in many ways, powerfully outmatched by the overwhelming opposition of the upstate Antifederalists. To their advantage, federalists had the support of New York City, the most important New York constituency, and the overall ratification clock. In this debate, the federalist managed the necessity of preventing an adjournment, which might have doomed the entire project, while at the same time moving the discussion forward without creating undue enmity from the upstate opposition. Throughout the debates federalists patiently explained, defined and redefined the contested terms of the constitution, thus creating through discourse, and energeting and effective form of government...|$|R

40|$|General-purpose {{computing}} devices {{allow us}} to (1) customize computation after fabrication and (2) conserve area by reusing expensive active circuitry for different functions in time. We define RP-space, a restricted domain of the general-purpose architectural space focussed on reconfigurable computing architectures. Two dominant features differentiate reconfigurable from special-purpose architectures and account {{for most of the}} area overhead associated with RP devices: (1) instructions which tell the device how to behave, and (2) flexible interconnect which supports task dependent dataflow between operations. We can characterize RP-space by the allocation and structure of these resources and compare the efficiencies of architectural points across broad application characteristics. Conventional FPGAs fall at one extreme end of this space and their efficiency ranges over two orders of magnitude across the space of application characteristics. Understanding RP-space and its consequences allows us to pick the best architecture for a task and to search for more robust design points in the space. Our DPGA, a fine- grained computing device which adds small, on-chip instruction memories to FPGAs is one such design point. For typical logic applications and finite- state machines, a DPGA can implement tasks in one-third the area of a traditional FPGA. TSFPGA, a variant of the DPGA which focuses on heavily time-switched interconnect, achieves circuit densities close to the DPGA, while reducing typical physical mapping times from hours to seconds. Rigid, fabrication-time organization of instruction resources significantly narrows the range of efficiency for conventional architectures. To avoid this performance brittleness, we developed MATRIX, the first architecture to defer the <b>binding</b> of <b>instruction</b> resources until run-time, allowing the application to organize resources according to its needs. Our focus MATRIX design point is based on an array of 8 -bit ALU and register-file building blocks interconnected via a byte-wide network. With today's silicon, a single chip MATRIX array can deliver over 10 Gop/s (8 -bit ops). On sample image processing tasks, we show that MATRIX yields 10 - 20 x the computational density of conventional processors. Understanding the cost structure of RP-space helps us identify these intermediate architectural points and may provide useful insight more broadly in guiding our continual search for robust and efficient general-purpose computing structures...|$|R

We examined injury patterns in recreational snowboarders, comparing these patterns with those found in alpine skiers. Snowboarding and skiing injury patterns differed significantly (P <. 05) for the following categories: 49 % of injured snowboarders were beginners versus 18 % of skiers. Snowboarders {{were more likely to}} suffer wrist (19 % versus 2 %) and ankle (16 % versus 6 %) injuries, but less likely to sustain knee (17 % versus 39 %) or thumb (2 % versus 4 %) injuries than skiers. For snowboarders, wrist injuries were most common in beginners (30 %), knee injuries in low intermediates (28 %), ankle injuries in intermediates (17 %), and shoulder or clavicle injuries in advanced snowboarders (14 %).

40|$|Clustered {{architecture}} processors are preferred for {{embedded systems}} because centralized register file architectures scale poorly {{in terms of}} clock rate, chip area, and power consumption. Scheduling for clustered architectures involves spatial concerns (where to schedule) as well as temporal concerns (when to schedule). Various clustered VLIW configurations, connectivity types, and inter-cluster communication models present different performance trade-offs to a scheduler. The scheduler is responsible for resolving the conflicting requirements of exploiting the parallelism offered by the hardware and limiting the communication among clusters to achieve better performance. Earlier proposals for cluster scheduling fall into two main categories, viz., phase-decoupled scheduling and phase-coupled scheduling and they focus on clustered architectures which provide inter-cluster communication by an explicit inter-cluster copy operation. However, modern commercial clustered architectures provide snooping capabilities (apart from the support for inter-cluster communication using an explicit MV operation) by allowing some of the functional units to read operands from the register file {{of some of the}} other clusters without any extra delay. The phase-decoupled approach of scheduling suffers from the well known phase-ordering problem which becomes severe for such a machine model (with snooping) because communication and resource constraints are tightly coupled and thus are exposed only during scheduling. Tight integration of communication and resource constraints further requires taking into account the resource and communication requirements of other instructions ready to be scheduled in the current cycle while <b>binding</b> an <b>instruction,</b> in order to carry out effective binding. However, earlier proposals on integrated scheduling consider instructions and clusters for binding using a fixed order and thus they show different widely varying performance characteristics in terms of execution time and code size. Other shortcomings of earlier integrated algorithms (that lead to suboptimal cluster scheduling decisions) are due to non-consideration of future communication (that may arise due to a binding) and functional unit binding. In this thesis, we propose a pragmatic scheme and also a generic graph matching based framework for cluster scheduling based on a generic and realistic clustered machine model. The proposed scheme effectively utilizes the exact knowledge of available communication slots, functional units, and load on different clusters as well as future resource and communication requirements known only at schedule time to attain significant performance improvement without code size penalty over earlier algorithms. The proposed graph matching based framework for cluster scheduling resolves the phase-ordering and fixed-ordering problem associated with scheduling on clustered VLIW architectures. The framework provides a mechanism to exploit the slack of instructions by dynamically varying the freedom available in scheduling an instruction and hence the cost of scheduling an instruction using different alternatives to reduce the inter-cluster communication. An experimental evaluation of the proposed framework and some of the earlier proposals is presented {{in the context of a}} state-of-art commercial clustered architecture...|$|R

Previous research has extensively studied how the match between study and test context affect subsequent memory performance; however, little work has attempted to examine how visual context information provided at study affects later recollection when that context information is not re-presented at retrieval. In particular, the quality of the memory retrieved may be enhanced when highly meaningful visual context information is provided at study. In each of seven experiments in the current thesis, participants studied words presented with context information high or low in meaningful content, and on a later recognition memory test made a Remember, Know, or New response to the words presented alone. Experiment 1 showed that participants had better overall memory, specifically recollection, for words studied with pictures of intact as opposed to scrambled faces. In Experiment 2, these results were replicated and recollection was shown to be higher for words studied with versus without pictures of faces. Experiment 3 showed that participants had higher memory performance, and recollection in particular, for words studied with upright compared to inverted faces. In Experiment 4, participants showed equivalent memory for words studied with novel or familiar faces. These results suggest that recollection benefits when visual context information high in meaningful content accompanies study words, and that this benefit is not related to the novelty of the context. To further test the claim that participants engage in elaborative processes at study to bind item and context information, improving subsequent recollection, the subsequent set of experiments examined how normal, healthy aging affects participants’ ability to use context information provided at study to benefit subsequent recollection. Older adults have been shown to experience deficits both in memory for context and in recollection, suggesting that they might fail to use context effectively to increase recollection, in contrast to younger adults. Experiment 5 found that younger, but not older, adults showed higher recollection for words studied with faces as compared to rectangles. To determine the type of cognitive processing required to obtain recollection benefits, and to examine whether instruction could alleviate age-related deficits, in Experiment 6, the type of processing engaged during the encoding of context-word pairs was manipulated. Younger and older adults studied words presented with a picture of a face under a surface feature or <b>binding</b> feature <b>instruction</b> condition. Both age groups showed higher recollection in the <b>binding</b> than surface <b>instruction</b> condition. Results suggest that older adults do not spontaneously engage in the processes required to boost recollection when visual context information is provided at study, although instructional manipulation during encoding lessens this deficit. This is in line with the Associative Deficit Hypothesis (Naveh-Benjamin, 2000), suggesting that older adults’ recollection deficit involves a specific difficulty in binding item and context information. The final experiment used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of recollection, specifically testing the hypothesis that sensory-specific reactivation of context information occurs during item recollection. In Experiment 7, brain activation for Remember responses given to words studied with and without meaningful context information was compared. Behaviourally, 8 of the 14 participants showed a higher proportion of Remember responses to words studied with faces than scrambled faces, and 6 did not. Whole brain analysis showed that, for only those participants who showed higher memory performance for words studied with faces, activation in the fusiform gyrus and hippocampus was higher, and a region-of-interest analysis showed increased activation in the functionally-defined FFA (identified in a localizer task), for Remember responses given to words studied with faces compared to scrambled faces. A regression analysis additionally showed that activation in the fusiform gyrus increased as the relative recollection benefit for words studied with meaningful (face) compared to non-meaningful (scrambled face) context information increased across participants. Results suggest that encoding context can influence the pattern of recollection responses on a recognition task and that sensory-specific reactivation is related to behavioural performance. The findings of these experiments suggest that participants can use context information high in meaningful content at study to improve subsequent recollection and I suggest that this involves the use of elaborative processes at encoding that integrates item and meaningful contexts. Such recollection benefits can also be observed in older adults when they are provided experimental instructions to bind item and context at encoding. In addition, the brain regions used to process context information are reactivated at retrieval and, importantly, that this neural pattern determines whether a boost in recollection, from the encoding manipulation, is observed. Participants can thus use context information provided at study to boost subsequent recollection, and I suggest that this involves cognitive processes that bind item and context information at encoding and the reactivation of sensory-specific brain regions at retrieval...|$|R
