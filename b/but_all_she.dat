500|$|During the Dive Bar Tour, Gaga {{recalled}} {{that she and}} musician Hillary Lindsey were seated in couches and having a back-and-forth conversation with guitar and piano. The singer asked questions about the men in her life, including her father and boyfriends, wondering why they would give her million reasons to leave them, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> wanted was to have one reason to stay. Lindsey, who previously had experiences in writing country songs in Nashville, was identified by Interscope as a potential collaborator on Joanne. The label's A Aaron Bay-Schuck, who had heard the initial Joanne material, introduced Gaga to Lindsey. They bonded over drinks and Gaga also played initial demos {{of some of the}} tracks she had written. Lindsey remembered that Gaga's personal experiences and stories resulted in many ideas for songs. [...] "Million Reasons" [...] was similarly picked from their conversations, including the title phrase. It was a straightforward songwriting session according to Lindsey, with Gaga using an [...] typewriter.|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{returned}} to the diplomatic scene and responded to the ongoing 2009 Honduran constitutional crisis, in which plans for the Honduran fourth ballot box referendum had led to the 2009 Honduran coup d'état, and which was becoming Latin America's worst political crisis in some years. In early July, she sat down with ousted President of Honduras Manuel Zelaya, who agreed on a U.S.-backed proposal to begin talks with the de facto Roberto Micheletti government. Later, in September, Zelaya {{returned to}} the country, and President of Costa Rica Óscar Arias, who had become a mediator in the matter, as well as Clinton expressed hope that Zelaya's return could break the impasse with the Micheletti government. In particular, Clinton said, [...] "Now that President Zelaya is back it would be opportune to restore him to his position under appropriate circumstances – {{get on with the}} election that is currently scheduled for November, have a peaceful transition of presidential authority and get Honduras back to constitutional and democratic order." [...] At the end of October, Clinton took a leading role in convincing Micheletti to accept a deal – which she termed an [...] "historic agreement" [...] – in which Zelaya would return to power in advance of general elections in which neither figure was running. Micheletti said that Clinton had been insistent on this point: [...] "I kept trying to explain our position to her, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> kept saying was, 'Restitution, restitution, restitution.'" [...] That agreement broke down, despite efforts of the State Department to revive it, and Clinton and the U.S. ended up supporting the winner of the 2009 Honduran general election, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, with Clinton characterizing the elections as [...] "free and fair" [...] and Lobo as holding a strong commitment to democracy and the rule of constitutional law.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come," [...] I said, [...] "I {{shall not}} quarrel with your prophecy so far, Allan. The {{introduction}} of a feminine element here seems a little incongruous, <b>but</b> after <b>all</b> <b>she</b> is very young." ...|$|R
60|$|Jessie turned with a start, {{wondering}} {{who had come}} in; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> saw was her own curious face in the mirror, and Mr. Vane's smiling one above it.|$|E
6000|$|... "She hasn't any of Josie's gimp," [...] was old Cyrus's unspoken fault. Deborah spoke, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> said was, [...] "Polly's a good girl, Father, {{only she}} hasn't any snap." ...|$|E
60|$|Polly did look, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> saw was her {{own face}} in the little mirror of the fan which Tom held up and peeped over with a laugh in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{knelt down}} on the hearth and took her friend's hands excitedly in her own. <b>But</b> after <b>all</b> <b>she</b> did not say when or how {{she had seen him}} or what he had said.|$|R
60|$|Mother {{was almost}} equally bulky, with an unassayed number of garments, <b>but</b> over them <b>all</b> <b>she</b> wore a still respectable Raglan town coat.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>all</b> this <b>she</b> {{looked upon}} as for ever past; believing, that, with the {{dropping}} of the earthly life, these morbid impulses and influences ceased, and that higher nature which he often so beautifully expressed in his poems became the triumphant one.|$|R

6000|$|He had faltered again, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> {{knew she}} now wanted to say. [...] "I'm speaking," [...] she said soothingly, [...] "of {{what he told}} her. It's that that I've taken you as knowing." ...|$|E
50|$|In several {{interviews}} and speeches, Okky stated that she reads Karl Marx and {{is influenced by}} the spirit of his human liberation ideas, <b>but</b> above <b>all</b> <b>she</b> believes in individual freedom and human creativity.

60|$|Aldo. 'Tis at my {{daughter}} Tricksy's lodging; the kept mistress I told you of, the lass of mettle. <b>But</b> for <b>all</b> <b>she</b> carries it so high, I know her pedigree; her mother's a sempstress in Dog-and-Bitch yard, and was, in her youth, as right as she is.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} for several moments. The girl's fingers closed upon the packet. She turned round and faced them <b>all.</b> <b>She</b> faced them <b>all,</b> <b>but</b> <b>she</b> {{addressed}} more particularly Wrayson.|$|R
60|$|She turned {{abruptly}} from Harry; and, {{going outside}} the window, tried to realise and comprehend the tidings, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> could {{have time to}} discover was that Alan's memory was dearer to her than ever, and she was obliged to hasten upstairs.|$|E
6000|$|Mary {{would have}} been a {{wonderful}} person had she not instantly and utterly forgotten all her conclusions from Frampton's having declared him gone to Beauchastel for an unlimited time; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> did was to turn away her crimson tearful face, and reply, 'Your father would not wish it now.' ...|$|E
60|$|Which he did, {{and over}} the walls we went, and the {{fortress}} was ours. Old D'Aulon thought her mind was wandering; <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>she</b> meant was, that she felt the might of fifty thousand men surging in her heart. It was a fanciful expression; but, to my thinking, truer word was never said.|$|E
