50|$|On returning, {{the group}} find Anne {{unconscious}} and Travers gone. The Doctor informs Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart and Captain Knight about {{the intelligence and}} the TARDIS; the Colonel decides to recover the TARDIS from Covent Garden station, hoping that it {{will allow them to}} escape. The Colonel leads the remaining troops overground to Covent Garden, while Arnold, Evans and a third soldier, Corporal Lane, take a <b>baggage</b> <b>trolley</b> through the underground {{at the same time to}} transport TARDIS on. The Doctor and Anne attempt to build a control box to block the signal between the Intelligence and the control spheres, though the Doctor finds that they are low on components and is escorted above ground by Knight to find more.|$|E
50|$|The first bomb on 10 September 1973 {{exploded}} at King's Cross {{railway station}} in the booking hall at 12.24 p.m. The 3 lb (1.4 kg) device was thrown without warning by a youth who escaped into the crowd and was not caught. The witness saw a teenager about 16 or 17 years old throw the bomb that was wrapped in a bag at the booking hall. About 45 minutes later, a second blast damaged a snack bar at Euston railway station, injuring another eight people bringing the total to 13 for the day. The King's Cross bomb - which exploded without any warning - broke glass throughout the old booking hall and threw a <b>baggage</b> <b>trolley</b> several feet into the air. The Euston station explosion happened just five minutes after the Press Association received a telephone warning from {{a man with an}} Irish accent.|$|E
50|$|Arnold and Lane put on {{gas masks}} {{and attempt to}} go through the fungus {{blocking}} Covent Garden with the <b>baggage</b> <b>trolley,</b> but when they enter the web Evans hears piercing screams. On pulling the trolley out on a rope, Evans finds Lane dead and Arnold gone. On the surface, the yeti ambush the soldiers at Covent Garden. Despite downing several robots in the ensuing battle, all except Lethbridge-Stewart perish. While at an electronics store on the surface, Knight is killed in a yeti attack, though the robots leave the Doctor alone. He discovers a Yeti beacon in Knight's pocket, which brought them to the shop. Later, the Colonel returns to HQ alone where the Doctor finds a model Yeti in his pocket. The Doctor deduces that the traitor in HQ slipped the beacon onto the Colonel and Knight. At that moment, two yeti break in with Professor Travers, who is possessed by the Great Intelligence.|$|E

5000|$|An earlier {{series of}} {{paintings}} is 'Saat Samunder Paar'. Baggages, migration and the [...] "return home" [...] have been enduring concerns of Subodh Gupta. It is a theme that crystallised in works such as 'Across the Seven Seas' (2006) where he uses <b>baggage</b> <b>trolleys</b> of modern airports to allude to the grim historical reality of migration from India, especially from {{his home state of}} Bihar.|$|R
500|$|It was {{reported}} that the runway at Ouani Airport close to Mutsamudu was blocked with <b>baggage</b> <b>trolleys</b> and the atmosphere was tense as the island braced itself for the impending assault. [...] Before the telephone lines were cut an Anjouan government spokesperson was quoted as saying: [...] "They have decided to kill {{but we are not}} afraid. We are well prepared. Our forces are ready and it's going to work!" ...|$|R
50|$|Dollies for loose baggage {{are used}} for the {{transportation}} of loose baggages, oversized bags, mail bags, loose cargo carton boxes, etc. between the aircraft and the terminal or sorting facility. Dollies for loose baggage are fitted with a brake system which blocks the wheels from moving when the connecting rod is not attached to a tug. Most dollies for loose baggage are completely enclosed except for the sides which use plastic curtains to protect items from weather. In the US, these dollies are called Baggage Cart, but in Europe Baggage Cart means passenger <b>baggage</b> <b>trolleys.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} manned, from 07:00 to 22:00 on weekdays, with reduced opening hours on weekends. The {{platform}} (but {{not necessarily the}} trains) are wheelchair accessible, and an escort service for disabled persons can be prebooked. <b>Baggage</b> <b>trolleys</b> are available, and {{a wide selection of}} services, including cafes, kiosks, banks and police, are available at the airport terminal, as are taxis. A single local bus route, Ruter no. 855, also serves the airport from Kløfta, Jessheim and Maura. There are many coaches {{from all parts of the}} country that also serve the airport, as well as coach services to Oslo operated by Flybussekspressen and SAS Ground Services.|$|R
2500|$|Nationaltheatret is Norway's only {{underground}} mainline railway station, {{located within}} the Oslo Tunnel on the Drammen Line.

40|$|Abstract—Given a {{directed}} acyclic graph with labeled vertices, {{we consider}} the problem of finding the most common label sequences (“traces”) among all paths in the graph (of some maximum length m). Since the number of paths can be huge, we propose novel algorithms whose time complexity depends only {{on the size of}} the graph, and on the frequency ε of the most frequent traces. In addition, we apply techniques from streaming algorithms to achieve space usage that depends only on ε, and not on the number of distinct traces. The abstract problem considered models a variety of tasks concerning finding frequent patterns in event sequences. Our motivation comes from working with a data set of 2 million RFID readings from <b>baggage</b> <b>trolleys</b> at Copenhagen Airport. The question of finding frequent passenger movement patterns is mapped to the above problem. We report on experimental findings for this data set.
