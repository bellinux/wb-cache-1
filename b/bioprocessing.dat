50|$|Though the {{prospect}} for COBR applications in fields like <b>bioprocessing</b> are very promising, {{there are a}} number of necessary improvements to be made before more global use. Clearly, there is additional complexity in the COBR design relative to other bioreactors, which can introduce complications in operation. Furthermore, for <b>bioprocessing</b> it is possible that fouling of baffles and internal surfaces becomes an issue. Perhaps the most significant needed advancement moving forward is further comprehensive studies that COBR technology can indeed be useful in industry. There are currently no COBRs in use at industrial <b>bioprocessing</b> plants and the evidence of its effectiveness, though very promising and theoretically an improvement relative to current reactors in industry, is limited to smaller laboratory-scale experiments.|$|E
