25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth so narrow receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and single sideband signals require a product detector using a so-called <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator,</b> {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E
2500|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} IF SSB signal, the single sideband must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of baseband frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (BFO). In other words, it is just another stage of heterodyning.(mixing down to base band). For this to work, the BFO frequency must be exactly adjusted.|$|E
5000|$|In electronics, the dynatron oscillator, {{invented in}} 1918 by Albert Hull at General Electric, is an {{obsolete}} vacuum tube electronic oscillator circuit {{which uses a}} negative resistance characteristic in early tetrode vacuum tubes, caused by a process called secondary emission. [...] It was the first negative resistance vacuum tube oscillator. [...] The dynatron oscillator circuit was used to a limited extent as <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillators</b> (BFOs), and local oscillators in vacuum tube radio receivers {{as well as in}} scientific and test equipment from the 1920s to the 1940s but became obsolete around World War 2 due to the variability of secondary emission in tubes.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advantage}} of the dynatron circuit was that it could oscillate over a very wide frequency range; from a few hertz to 20 MHz. [...] It also had very good frequency stability compared to other LC oscillators of that time, and was even compared to crystal oscillators. The circuit became popular after the advent of cheap tetrode tubes such as the UY222 and UY224 around 1928. [...] It was used in <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillators</b> (BFOs) for code reception and local oscillators in superheterodyne receivers {{as well as in}} laboratory signal generators and scientific research. RCA's 1931 prototype television used two UY224 tubes as dynatron oscillators to generate the vertical deflection (28 Hz) and horizontal deflection (2880 Hz) signals for the CRT's deflection coils.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) - This is an {{electronic}} oscillator {{which is only}} found in communications receivers, used in the reception of radiotelegraph (CW) or single-sideband modulation (SSB). [...] It produces a fixed frequency offset from the IF which is mixed with the IF in the demodulator. [...] The IF and BFO frequencies produce a heterodyne (beat) in the audio range which sounds like a musical tone in the speaker. [...] In CW the [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] of the Morse code are audible as beeps.|$|E
2500|$|On reception, the FSK {{signal is}} {{converted}} to the original tones by mixing the FSK signal with a local oscillator called the BFO or <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b> These tones are fed to the demodulator part of the modem, which processes them {{through a series of}} filters and detectors to recreate the original digital signal. The FSK signals are audible on a communications radio receiver equipped with a BFO, and have a distinctive [...] "beedle-eeeedle-eedle-eee" [...] sound, usually starting and ending on one of the two tones ("idle on mark").|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Amplification {{is usually}} {{necessary}} when measuring the frequency instability of microwave signals. In this work, we develop a flicker noise free frequency measurement {{system based on}} a common or shared amplifier. First, we show that correlated flicker phase noise can be cancelled in such a system. Then we compare the new system with the conventional by simultaneously measuring the <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> from two cryogenic sapphire oscillators with parts in 1015 fractional frequency instability. We determine for low power, below − 80 dBm, the measurements were not limited by correlated noise processes but by thermal noise of the readout amplifier. In this regime, we show that the new readout system performs as expected {{and at the same}} level as the standard system but with only half the number of amplifiers. We also show that, using a standard readout system, the next generation of cryogenic sapphire oscillators could be flicker phase noise limited when instability reaches parts in 1016 or better.

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{based on}} cryogenic microwave oscillators [1, 2, 3] have tested the isotropy {{of the speed}} of light (Michelson-Morley experiment) at sensitivities of the order of a part in 1015, which is a similar sensitivity to other best tests [4, 5]. Further improvements of the accuracy in this type of experiment are not expected due to the already long data set and the systematic error limit [3]. We have constructed a new rotating Michelson-Morley experiment consisting of two cylindrical cryogenic sapphire resonators. The temperature of the dual cavity is controlled at approximately 6 K where the <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> between two <b>oscillators</b> is independent on temperature. By rotating the experiment an improvement of several orders of magnitude in our sensitivity to light speed anisotropy is expected, as the relevant time variations will now be at the rotation frequency where the frequency stability of the cryogenic oscillators is the best.

5000|$|The {{receiver}} {{was ahead}} of its time, because when it was invented there was no oscillator capable of producing the radio frequency sine wave fO with the required stability. [...] Fessenden first used his large radio frequency alternator, but this wasnt practical for ordinary receivers. The heterodyne receiver remained a laboratory curiosity until a cheap compact source of continuous waves appeared, the vacuum tube electronic oscillator invented by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner in 1913. [...] After this it became the standard method of receiving CW radiotelegraphy. The heterodyne oscillator is the ancestor of the <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (BFO) {{which is used to}} receive radiotelegraphy in communications receivers today. The heterodyne oscillator had to be retuned each time the receiver was tuned to a new station, but in modern superheterodyne receivers the BFO signal beats with the fixed intermediate frequency, so the <b>beat</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> can be a fixed frequency.|$|E
