5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the early stage of her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E

25|$|Epicanthic folds and oblique palpebral {{fissures}} {{are common}} among Mongoloid individuals. Most exhibit the Mongolian spot {{from birth to}} about age four. Mongoloids in general have straight, <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> dark brown almond-shaped eyes, and have relatively flatter faces in comparison to caucasoid skull.|$|E
25|$|A {{study on}} {{unrelated}} British and Irish individuals demonstrated that over 80% {{of people with}} red hair and/or fair skin that tan poorly have a dysfunctional variant of the MC1R gene. This is compared to less than 20% in people with brown or <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> less than 4% in people showing a good tanning response.|$|E
25|$|The {{very first}} Emily the Strange {{illustration}} dates from 1991, but the 1978 children's book Nate the Great and the Lost List features {{a very similar}} illustration {{of a young girl}} named Rosamond.

25|$|Despite exotic {{claims of}} her nationality, she was later {{identified}} as one Émilie Poupon of Nantey, France. This image—an enticing woman with long, <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> a large snake slithering up between her breasts—apparently caught the imaginations of the Africans who saw it; {{it was the}} definitive image of the spirit. Before long, Mami Wata posters appeared in over a dozen countries. People began creating Mami Wata art of their own, much of it influenced by the lithograph.|$|E
25|$|She was {{estimated}} to be between 20 and 28 years old and had been raped. Basic physical examination showed she was about 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighed about 118 pounds.

She also had a unique scar {{on the back of her}} left hand, which was shaped like the letter T. She also had an inch-long scar on the back of her left thigh.|$|E
25|$|Sirius {{was portrayed}} by Gary Oldman {{in the film}} adaptations of Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, and Deathly Hallows – Part 2.

50|$|Argennina is {{a spider}} genus {{with a single}} species, Argennina unica, found in the {{southern}} United States. Individuals are around 5 mm in body length. The carapace is a pale yellow brown, sparsely covered with short <b>black</b> <b>hairs,</b> <b>and</b> the abdomen is gray to pale yellow with fine pale hairs. The species was described in 1936 by Willis J. Gertsch and Stanley Mulaik, and is known from Texas.|$|R
25|$|Born in Texas, Orbison began {{singing in}} a rockabilly and country and western band in high school. He was signed by Sam Phillips, Sun Records in 1956, but his {{greatest}} success came with Monument Records in the early 1960s. While most male rock and roll performers in the 1950s and 1960s projected a defiant masculinity, many of Orbison's songs instead conveyed a quiet, almost desperate, vulnerability. His voice ranged from baritone to tenor, and music scholars have suggested {{that he had a}} three- or four-octave range. During performances, he was known for standing still and solitary, and for wearing black clothes, to match his jet <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> dark sunglasses, which lent an air of mystery to his persona.|$|E
25|$|After he regains {{his body}} in the fourth book, Rowling {{describes}} Voldemort as having pale skin, a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes and cat-like slits for pupils, a skeletally thin body and long, thin hands with unnaturally long fingers. As mentioned in {{the first chapter of}} the seventh book, he also has no hair or lips. Earlier in life, as seen through flashbacks contained in the second and sixth books, Tom Marvolo Riddle was handsome and tall with pale skin, jet <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> dark brown eyes. He could charm many people with his looks. The transformation into his monstrous state {{is believed to have been}} the result of creating his Horcruxes and becoming less human as he continued to divide his soul. In the films, Voldemort's eyes are blue with round pupils.|$|E
25|$|Heritability {{means the}} {{information}} in a given gene is not always exactly the same in every individual in that species, so the same gene in different individuals does not give exactly the same instructions. Each unique form of a single gene is called an allele; different forms are collectively called polymorphisms. As an example, one allele for the gene for hair color and skin cell pigmentation could instruct the body to produce black pigment, producing <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> pigmented skin; while a different allele of the same gene in a different individual could give garbled instructions {{that would result in}} a failure to produce any pigment, giving white hair and no pigmented skin: albinism. Mutations are random changes in genes creating new alleles, which in turn produce new traits, which could help, harm, or have no new effect on the individual's likelihood of survival; thus, mutations are the basis for evolution.|$|E

25|$|Females usually {{give birth}} to a single infant, {{although}} twins do occur. Most births occur during the night. Infants are born with thin, dark brown or <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> pale skin. Infants spend their first week attach themselves to their mothers' chests and mostly just suckle or sleep. They do not move much in terms of locomotion for {{the first two weeks of}} their life. As they approach their sixth week of life, infants vocalize more. They use squeaks and shrieks to communicate stress. In the following months, the infants are capable of quadrupedal locomotion and can walk, run and jump by the second and third months. Alloparenting occurs among langurs, starting when the infants reach two years of age. The infant will be given to the other females of the group. However, if the mother dies, the infant usually follows. Langurs are weaned by 13 months.|$|E

Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of [...] "The Rail Candidate". In 1860 Lincoln described himself : [...] "I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> gray eyes." ...|$|E
