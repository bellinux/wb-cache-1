5000|$|... 1. Formation Stage of oxides and silicates (OSS): it is {{the most}} {{significant}} stage from an economical point of view, as it is in this one that the formation of wolframite and cassiterite occurs. In this stage, the majority of quartz and muscovite, as well as tourmaline, topaz and a large part of arsenopyrite, are formed in at least two generations. 2. Formation stage of major Sulfide_minerals|sulfides (MSS): the predominant minerals are sulphides, especially pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, stannite and phyrrhotite and, to a lesser extent, galena. One can also find new generations of arsenopyrite, already in a third generation, muscovite and quartz. The final phase of this stage corresponds, essentially, {{to the end of the}} deposition of apatite. 3. Alteration stage of phyrrhotite (PAS): fundamentally characterized by the alteration of phyrrhotite, from which results mainly siderite and marcassite, due to the iron released in the alteration process. Added to this iron is the iron released in the dissolution of the pyrite-I giving rise to a second generation of pyrite, magnetite and hematite. In this phase, alteration of stannite due to reaction with the siderite, forming covellite, chalcopyrite and cassiterite also occurs. It is also at this stage that the silver salts usually associated with <b>bismuthinite</b> and accompanied by sphalerite and / or chalcopyrite are deposited. 4. Formation stage of late carbonates (LCS): characterized by the formation of carbonates, mainly calcite and dolomite, the latter in mixed crystals, that is, with the siderite nucleus, as well as fluorite; it is in this stage that chlorite is formed. Later generations of sulphides were also observed, however, always in small amounts.|$|E

40|$|Stormont, Fletcher's Adit and Ti Tree Creek {{are three}} mineralised, calc-silicate skarns in the Moina district, NW Tasmania. Stormont is a Au and Bi-bearing skarn, Fletcher's Adit {{contains}} minor Cu, Au, Bi, W, Sn and Zn, and Ti Tree Creek contains {{small amounts of}} Sn and Bi. The three skarns are hosted in the basal section of the Ordovician Gordon Limestone and the upper portion of the underlying Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician Moina Sandstone. Metasomatism and mineralisation occurred during the late Devonian intrusion of the ilmenite series, Dolcoath Granite. The granite-to-prospect distance increases to the west, from Ti Tree Creek to Fletcher's Adit, to the most distal (0. 5 - 1 km) Stormont deposit. The three skarn deposits have a similar paragenesis during the metamorphic, metasomatic and early retrograde stages of skarn development Wollastonite and salitic clinopyroxene were formed during the metamorphic stage of skarn development. Andradite (and minor Cr-rich grossular) garnet, salitic clinopyroxene and minor vesuvianite were formed during the infiltration metasomatic phase. Epidote, actinolitic amphibole, quartz and fluorite were the major phases formed during the actinolite replacement stage of retrograde alteration, while chlorite, fluorite, muscovite, calcite and quartz were stable during the later mineralisation stage of retrograde alteration. Differences between the deposits in the late retrograde and mineralisation stages include the intensity of retrograde alteration, the abundance of minor retrograde phases, native gold, native bismuth, <b>bismuthinite,</b> galenobismutite, magnetite and base metal sulphides.

40|$|Cobaltite-rich {{mineralisation}} {{from the}} iron skarns of the Traversella magnetite mine (Western Alps, Italy) was studied by reflected-light microscopy, {{scanning electron microscopy}} and electron microprobe analysis. Cobaltite is found in carbonate–chlorite-rich rocks {{at the margins of}} the main magnetite masses, where it forms disseminations and metasomatic veinlets that postdate the formation of magnetite. The paragenesis includes cobaltite (± arsenopyrite), <b>bismuthinite,</b> pyrrhotite and/or pyrite, chalcopyrite, carbonates, talc, chlorite, and native gold, and is indicative of a low-sulphidation environment. The sulpharsenides show oscillatory and sector zoning, which indicates disequilibrium during crystal growth. Compositional variations are mainly due to variations in the Co/Fe ratio of arsenopyrite and in either the Co/Fe or the Ni/(Fe + Co) ratios of the coexisting cobaltite. The Ni contents are low to very low in the cobaltites (< 2. 4 wt%) and very low in the arsenopyrites (< 0. 16 wt%). The As/S molar ratios in the cobaltites are highly variable (0. 59 – 1. 00) and show a broad negative correlation with the Fe contents. The formation of cobaltite is related to circulation of relatively low-temperature (< ca. 300 °C), (Co, As, Bi) -rich fluids during the retrograde sulphidation stage which followed the formation of magnetite. The apparent restriction of cobaltite (+ <b>bismuthinite</b> ± arsenopyrite) to the margins of the main magnetite columns may reflect the establishment of thermo-chemical gradients around the main direction of infiltration of the retrograde metasomatic fluids...|$|E
40|$|The liquid bismuth {{collector}} {{model was}} first proposed {{as a mechanism}} by which bismuth in a molten state could remove gold from a hydrothermal fluid. This method was suggested to potentially explain the close correlation often observed between gold and bismuth. In this thesis, two different gold- and bismuth-rich deposits are studied to determine whether scavenging of gold by liquid bismuth could {{have played a role}} in the mineralisation of each deposit. The Stormont prospect in central-northern Tasmania has an ore mineral assemblage of native bismuth, <b>bismuthinite,</b> maldonite, galena, native gold and an unknown Bi-Te-S mineral hosted in a calc-silicate assemblage of grandite, hedenbergite, actinolite, magnetite, epidote, quartz, and calcite. Conditions of mineralisation at Stormont included low sulfur fugacity and mineralisation temperatures of > 400 - 500 °C. Here, native bismuth is closely spatially and geochemically related to gold, and high gold content is found almost exclusively with high bismuth content. Thus, it is concluded that the liquid bismuth collector model, played a role in the formation of this deposit. As the liquid bismuth collector model can scavenge gold from fluids of very dilute gold concentration, the model can produce a zone refinement of gold from interaction with different fluid fluxes of variable gold concentration with liquid bismuth droplets. The conditions of mineralisation at the Warrego deposit were found to contrast with those at Stormont. The ore mineral assemblage observed here includes chalcopyrite, <b>bismuthinite</b> and gold, amongst a gangue assemblage of magnetite, hematite, chlorite, pyrite, muscovite and quartz. Despite the moderate geochemical correlation between gold and bismuth, spatially and texturally there is no more association between them than with other ore and gangue minerals. Geochemical analysis revealed high gold concentrations with large variations in bismuth content. No native bismuth was found at Warrego, where bismuth exists mostly in <b>bismuthinite.</b> <b>Bismuthinite</b> is also associated with other sulfides such as chalcopyrite and pyrite in fractures within the host magnetite ironstone lode. Gold is associated with all ore and many gangue minerals. An estimated mineralisation temperature of - 150 ° to 350 °C is interpreted, based on fluid inclusion homogenisation temperatures. Precipitation was not likely temperature dependant. Thus, it is concluded that the higher sulfur content, and lower temperature conditions meant that liquid bismuth scavenging did not occur in the Warrego mineralising system. The Stormont prospect demonstrates that the liquid bismuth collector model is relevant in many ore-forming environments. The similarities and differences between Warrego and Stormont are important for outlining both ideal and detrimental conditions for liquid bismuth formation. Once formed, liquid bismuth will scavenge gold; however the conditions in which it forms must be initially primed and then maintained for effective gold scavenging. Important hydrothermal fluid characteristics include a relatively reduced environment, with low sulfur activity and temperatures above 271 °C, which may be lowered to 241 °C if gold is also present when native bismuth precipitates. This model may play an important part in either primary or secondary enrichment of gold, as unlike other deposition methods, gold can be severely under-saturated in the fluid, and yet still be concentrated by liquid bismuth...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{exploration}} boreholes in the Lousal Mine, {{located within}} the Portuguese sector of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB) yielded marked concentrations in gold/electrum in a section of core consisting of banded metasediments with massive pyrite. Preliminary research indicates that the gold is associated with native bismuth and <b>bismuthinite</b> and is clearly late in the paragenetic sequence occurring in fine chalcopyrite (± covellite) -bismuthinite-gold filled veinlets within the dominant and more massive pyrite. The pale yellow gold grains are fine, seldom reaching more than 6 [...] m in length and half of that in thickness. EPMA results indicate that silver concentrations in gold grains can {{be as high as}} 27 wt. %. The results show similarities with conclusions drawn from the IPB on the Spanish side where gold of Co-Bi geochemical association is found as electrum with abundant to common Co and Bi minerals. These associated with pyrite and/or chalcopyrite are characterized by an abundance of sedimentary facies and show that the gold association formed at high temperature (> 300 °C) during the initial phases of massive sulphide formation...|$|E
40|$|Karavansalija ore zone is {{situated}} in the Serbian part of the Serbo-Macedonian magmatic and metallogenic belt. The Cu–Au mineralization is hosted mainly by garnet–pyroxene–epidote skarns and shifts to lesser presence towards the nearby quartz–epidotized rocks and the overlying volcanic tuffs. Within the epidosites the sulfide mineralogy is represented by disseminated cobalt-nickel sulfides from the gersdorfite-krutovite mineral series and cobaltite, and pyrite–marcasite–chalcopyrite–base metal aggregates. The skarn sulfide mineralization is characterized by chalcopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, bismuth-phases (<b>bismuthinite</b> and cosalite), arsenopyrite, gersdorffite, and sphalerite. The sulfides {{can be observed in}} several types of massive aggregates, depending on the predominant sulfide phases: pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite aggregates with lesser amount of arsenopyrite and traces of sphalerite, arsenopyrite–bismuthinite–cosalite aggregates with subordinate sphalerite and sphalerite veins with <b>bismuthinite,</b> pyrite and arsenopyrite. In the overlying volcanoclastics, the studied sulfide mineralization is represented mainly by arsenopyrite aggregates with subordinate amounts of pyrite and chalcopyrite. Gold is present rarely as visible aggregate of native gold and also as invisible element included in arsenopyrite. The fluid inclusion microthermometry data suggest homogenization temperature in the range of roughly 150 – 400 °C. Salinities vary in the ranges of 0. 5 – 8. 5 [*]wt% NaCl eq for two-phase low density fluid inclusions and 15 – 41 [*]wt% NaCl eq for two-phase high-salinity and three-phase high-salinity fluid inclusions. The broad range of salinity values and the different types of fluid inclusions co-existing in the same crystals suggest that at least two fluids with different salinities contributed to the formation of the Cu–Au mineralization. Geothermometry, based on EPMA data of arsenopyrite co-existing with pyrite and pyrrhotite, suggests a temperature range of 240 – 360 °C for the formation of the arsenopyrite, which overlaps well with the data for the formation temperature obtained through fluid inclusion microthermometry. The sulfur isotope data on arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrite and marcasite from the different sulfide assemblages (ranging from 0. 4 ‰ to + 3. 9 ‰ δ 34 SCDT with average of 2. 29 δ 34 SCDT and standard deviation of 1. 34 δ 34 SCDT) indicates a magmatic source of sulfur for all of the investigated phases. The narrow range of the data points to a common source for all of the investigated sulfides, regardless of the host rock and the paragenesis. The sulfur isotope data shows good overlap with that from nearby base-metal deposits; therefore the Cu–Au mineralization and the emblematic base-metal sulfide mineralization from this metallogenic belt likely share same fluid source...|$|E
