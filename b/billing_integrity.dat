40|$|MBA - WBSThe South African mobile {{telecommunications}} market is very mature {{and close to}} saturation. The decline in subscriber growth rates coupled with regulatory pressures to reduce tariffs could have {{a serious negative impact}} on revenue growth and profitability for operators. The mobile operators, Vodacom and Cell C, have invested heavily in infrastructure deployment and data networks. Cell C is currently investing in the roll-out of its own data network. Consumer mobile entertainment services, which are delivered on the data networks, are a potential revenue stream which can provide the additional operators of revenues to compensate revenue lost due to decreases in voice tariffs that are being advocated by Parliament and the regulator, ICASA. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that affect the usage of consumer mobile entertainment services in South Africa. Data was collected using a questionnaire survey that was administered in Gauteng. It was found that individuals between the age groups of 18 to 45 were currently the key users of consumer mobile entertainment services. However, the age group 46 - 55 showed the greatest propensity to adopt these services in the future. The mobile entertainment service categories that were the most frequently used were: Personalisation, Mobile and Infotainment services. However, Mobile TV, Infotainment, Mobile Video and Mobile Games showed the highest potential for future adoption. It was concluded from descriptive analysis and factor analysis that the five factors namely <b>billing</b> <b>integrity,</b> privacy and ethics associated with the service, iii good access (including bandwidth availability and transmission), availability (the ability to use the service from any location) and simplicity of use coupled with the appeal of the content, were indeed factors that would influence the adoption on consumer mobile entertainment services in South Africa. The ranking of these factors in order of importance were as follows: Accurately billed Private and ethical Easy to access Available anywhere; and Simple and entertaining Hence, when designing and developing consumer mobile entertainment services in South Africa, the offers should be promoted as being accurately billed, private and ethical, easy to access, available anywhere, and simple and entertaining. Network operators should concentrate on developing consumer mobile entertainment services for the following categories: mobile TV, infotainment, mobile video and mobile gaming service categories since they hold the greatest potential for future growth and adoption. Demographic analysis showed that the age group 46 - 55 exhibit the greatest growth potential. Operators should develop targeted campaigns at this segment encompassing the marketing, customer education and relevant content...|$|E

40|$|Middle income American {{households}} – {{broadly defined}} {{here as the}} middle third of U. S. households by income – are struggling. Energy improvements {{have the potential to}} provide significant benefits to these households – by lowering <b>bills,</b> increasing the <b>integrity</b> of their homes, improving their health and comfort, and reducing their exposure to volatile, and rising, energy prices. Middle income households are also responsible for a third of U. S. residential energy use, suggesting that increasing the energy efficiency of their homes is important to deliver public benefits such as reducing power system costs, easing congestion on the grid, and avoiding emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. While middle income Americans have historically invested in improvements that maintain and increase the value of their homes, they have seen an important source of financing – the equity in their properties – evaporate {{at the same time that}} their access to other loan products has been restricted. A number of energy efficiency programs are deploying credit enhancements, novel underwriting criteria, and innovative financing tools to reduce risks for both financiers and borrowers in an effort to increase the availability of energy efficiency financing for middle income households. While many of these programs are income-targeted, the challenges, opportunities, and emerging models for providing access to capital may apply more broadly across income groups in the residential sector.

40|$|The Coalition for National Unity and Rural Advancement (cnura) {{government}} entered 2010 with a {{focus on}} the national general elections several months ahead. In the last two or so years that they were in power, the government recorded passing a higher number of legislations than any other government since independence. They also stabilized diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, and the case of a former attorney generalâ�”which was instrumental for the downfall of the government before cnuraâ was brought before relevant authorities. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have set up offices in Honiara and are working well with the government. The first half of 2010 was occupied with the registration of voters and preparation for the national elections. This review concentrates on events leading up to the national elections, government formation, and some notable developments and events that occurred throughout the year. Just before the dissolution of Parliament in 2010, then Prime Minister Dr Derek Sikua attempted to push through what was called the Political Parties <b>Integrity</b> <b>Bill,</b> which was aimed at reducing political instability in governmentâ�”an endemic feature of Solomon Islands politics (ssn, 22 April 2010). Unfortunately (or fortunately), it was defeated because of what Dr Sikua believed to be a move orchestrated by some of his own ministers and backbenchers. This occurred on 24 April, two days before the dissolution of Parliament (ssn, 13 July 2010), and signaled an end to the solidarity of the cnura, which was enthusiastic to enter the national election as a political group. At their meeting on 5 April 2010, the political parties that had been running the cnura government (ie, National Party, Solomon Islands Democratic Party, Solomon Islandsâ�™ Party for Rural Advancement, Liberal Party, Peopleâs Alliance Party, and the Association of Independents) had agreed to sign a preelection coalition agreement {{that would allow them to}} regroup after elections (sto, 7 April 2010). They felt that the cnura government under Sikuaâs leadership had achieved a lot and therefore should continue with its good work. The defeat of the Political Parties <b>Integrity</b> <b>Bill</b> ended what could have been a road to political stability in the legislature. Consequently, many more parties emerged to contest the elections, as will be discussed later. While the cnura government was still in caretaker mode, a second mobile service provider in the country established its infrastructure. This became possible after the monopoly over telecommunication services was removed in 2009. The Be-mobile company erected towers and set up an office in the country. It also promised to offer coverage for 25 percent of the population by mid-June 2010. There were concerns earlier that the company seemed like it was not making progress after it had obtained a license to operate. Indeed, the company was fined us 1. 5 million for failing to launch its network on time (sto, 30 June 2010). Nevertheless, Be-mobile installed its towers and network, and by the end of August it launched its network with the tagline â mifala long hia naoâ�(we are now here) (sto, 31 Aug 2010). Solomon Islands Prime Minister Danny Philip praised Be-mobile, claiming that â�œthe launch of Be-mobileâs network has brought the country to a new threshold of a new partnership and a new beginning for governments, the private sector and other stakeholdersâ (sto, 9 Nov 2010). ...|$|R
