25|$|In a first phase, the 7th and 21st {{divisions}} were {{to capture}} high ground {{either side of}} the Willow Stream and Mametz. In the second phase, Fricourt was to be occupied and the advance pressed over the spurs to the first German intermediate line; the British were to dig in along the second intermediate line, which ran across the valley south of Mametz Wood. The troops were to gain touch with the XIII Corps at White Trench and at Quadrangle Trench, to the west, with III Corps. The second phase position was considered to be easy to defend against a counter-attack and provide a good view for artillery observers and covered positions for field artillery. If the two phases succeeded, the 17th (Northern) Division would join the attacking divisions to attack through Mametz Wood and up Caterpillar Valley to take Ginchy, Longueval and Bazentin-le-Grand. To avoid a frontal attack against Fricourt and the wood behind, the village was to be isolated by the first attacks and captured later. The right-hand brigade of the 7th Division was to capture Mametz and advance to White Trench and the centre brigade was to form a defensive flank {{on the south side of}} Willow Stream. The left-hand brigade of the 21st Division was to cross the Fricourt spur and advance to <b>Bottom</b> <b>Wood</b> as the central brigade formed another defensive flank opposite the village and Fricourt Wood, ready for both brigades to attack as decided by the corps commander.|$|E

Haig wanted to exploit the success on the right flank by advancing from Mametz Wood and Contalmaison towards the German second position on the Longueval–Bazentin le Petit ridge.

Horne ordered an attack on Fricourt at [...] on 2 July, after a [...] bombardment, the 17th Division to link with the 7th Division north of Mametz. Soon afterwards a 7th Division patrol reported that Fricourt had been entered unopposed at midnight. A patrol from the 51st Brigade took [...] from Reserve Infantry Regiment 111 and Major-General Pilcher ordered the brigade to enter the village immediately. In the confusion the village was not occupied until noon on 2 July, where eleven German stragglers were captured. The attack continued behind a creeping barrage with <b>Bottom</b> <b>Wood</b> as the final objective. The advance moved through Fricourt Wood where fallen trees, thick undergrowth and German machine-gun fire slowed progress.

The 50th Brigade was to be ready to attack Fricourt, if the enveloping attacks on the flanks failed, except for the left-hand battalion, which was to attack to form a defensive flank facing the village. The 21st Division brigades were to advance to the first objective at Crucifix Trench, the German intermediate line and then continue to the second objective at <b>Bottom</b> <b>Wood</b> and Quadrangle Trench, in the second German intermediate line, to link with troops from the 7th Division.

The two companies were practically annihilated and only a few troops reached the front trench. The companies at Red Cottage were overrun later in the morning, only a few groups managing to reach the 63rd Brigade to the north.

The attack was repulsed by machine-gun fire and an artillery barrage and a battalion trying to advance from Peake Woods, midway between Shelter Wood and the village to join with the 68th Brigade was also defeated. Another 3 Squadron aircraft was aloft to watch the attacks and reported that when the British barrage began, rockets were fired from the German trenches, which brought forth from German artillery batteries a wall of fire from <b>Bottom</b> <b>Wood</b> to Bailiff Wood, west of Contalmaison.
