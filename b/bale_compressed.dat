This article focuses on thermal, moisture and biological properties of thermal insulating materials based on vegetal and animal fibres. There {{is a lack of}} data regarding natural building materials and furthermore the properties of these types of materials can be site-dependent. Therefore the natural insulating materials have been tested for thermal, moisture and biological properties. In the research array, there were following materials: treated sheep wool, raw sheep wool, wood fibre, hemp, flax, straw <b>bale</b> and <b>compressed</b> straw panel. The main examined parameters are the thermal capacity, thermal conductivity, volume density and sorption isotherm, which are stated and compared. In addition to that, the microbiological identification tests were made together with the mould growth observation. The results of all tests and measurements are stated and discussed in the article with the emphasis on the situation in the real building stock where the test bordering conditions possibly occu...|$|R

Sudangrass hay previously worth only $ 30 – 50 per ton on the U. S. market can now be double compressed and exported to Asia (F. O. B. ports of California) netting $ 80 – 120 per ton (including commissions, compression, containerization, and freight to ports beyond California). The <b>compressed</b> <b>bale</b> hay is shipped in 40 -foot sea-going containers exported primarily to Japan.

40|$|Taking High quality {{alfalfa hay}} as the {{research}} object, we {{carried out the}} test at herbage material baling test bench in different cross sections, and we had emplaced two sets of mobile pressure sensing device and three types of displacement sensor, and we also had collected the signals of thickness, compression force and location of grass sheet through virtual instrument acquisition system {{in the process of}} compression. Through the data analysis and processing, we obtained compression and dynamic distribution law of grass sheet on alfalfa in the process of baling. Results show that: the compressed area of grass sheet can be divided into three sections in the process of <b>baling</b> - <b>compressed</b> section, stable density section, density recovery section. Noted that there is a process of stress relaxation which is natural formation in stable density section, and the process made the elastic recovery stress of grass sheet decreasing, therefore, it is best to conduct baling in this section, because it helps to improve the stability of the bale shape. The test results provide a theoretical basis for optimization design of herbage material baler and improving the performance stability of the bale. ...|$|R
40|$|Since 1989, {{high demand}} for fine-stemmed sudangrass hay by Pacific Rim {{countries}} {{has created a}} market opportunity for Arizona and hay producers. The <b>compressed</b> <b>bale</b> hay is shipped in 40 -foot seagoing containers. Foreign sudangrass hay buyers want dust-free hay with a bleached light green color and a stem diameter less than one quarter of an inch. Generally, Japanese hay buyers prefer sudangrass hay that resembles their familiar rice straw hay in appearance. Additionally, they will reject sudangrass hay with a nitrate-nitrogen concentration exceeding 1, 000 parts per million. Hay growers have learned to adapt to these strict Japanese standards by using sudangrass seeding rates in excess of 120 pounds per acre to reduce stem size, by lengthening field curing time to give hay a bleached color, by carefully managing nitrogen and irrigation water to reduce nitrate accumulation, an...|$|R
5000|$|Clothing can be {{made from}} plastics. Seventy percent of plastic-derived fabrics come from {{polyester}}, and the type of polyester most used in fabrics is polyethylene terephthalate (PET). [...] PET plastic clothing come from reused plastics, often recycled plastic bottles. The Coca-Cola Company, for example, created a [...] "Drink2Wear" [...] line of T-shirts made from recycled bottles. Generally, PET plastic clothing are made from recycled bottles as follows: plastic bottles are collected, <b>compressed,</b> <b>baled,</b> and shipped into processing facilities where they will be chopped into flakes, and melted into small white pellets. Then, the pellets are processed again, and spun into yarn-like fiber where it {{can be made}} into clothing.One main benefit of making clothes from recycled bottles is that it keep the bottles and other plastics from occupying landfill space. Another benefit is that it takes 30% less energy to make clothes from recycled plastics than from virgin polyesters.|$|R

40|$|Straw bale {{construction}} has recently gained more confidence {{to be used}} as structural elements. A number of laboratory tests worldwide, show this system to be capable of supporting substantial service loads in case of proper baling, stacking, and plastering. In Egypt, growing attention is focused on examining this new trend of construction in order to solve the environmental pollution caused by burning millions of tons of straw every year. Two types of mobile straw baling mechanical powered press machines are commonly used in Egypt, private local small sized iron baling machines and Cicoria straw baling machines. These two baling systems have major differences in their end product physical properties, baling, and mainly their compressing techniques. Rare information is available about the mechanical characteristics of local bales. This paper is part of a pioneer national project aiming to use rice straw bales in building. The research aims to identify the specifications and characteristics of locally produced rice straw bales used for building. The <b>bales</b> are <b>compressed</b> under various compressibility conditions to identify the settlement that is expected to happen in most of the types of bales available in the market. Experimental studies are carried out on the effect of compressibility and baling on the quality of single un-rendered straw bales in general, and particularly it's displacement under vertical load. These experiments are conducted on single un-rendered bales from different sources, by applying incremental vertical load, reaching 50 tons. Results of corresponding displacements of different types of bales from different sources are recorde...|$|R

The museum claims the oldest <b>compressed</b> <b>bale</b> of cotton in existence in the United States. This cotton display {{is believed to have}} been baled about 1930. Adjacent to the cotton exhibit is the [...] "Black Gold", a replica of an oilfield roughneck—a general laborer worker who loading and unloads cargo from crane baskets and keeps the drilling equipment clean—employed in the early 1930s by the Sinclair Oil and Gas Company. The exhibit has a recording which explains how a farm family, growing mostly cotton and corn faced great economic travail in Mississippi but relocated to Claiborne Parish to take advantage of the oil and natural gas boom. [...] "Oil changed our lives forever. We owe a lot to the men, mud, and mules that made it happen," [...] concludes the recorded message. In 1921, oil was discovered in Homer; in 1921, another strike followed in Haynesville in northern Claiborne Parish. The boom continued through the 1930s and brought many customers to the then booming Hotel Claiborne, which had been established in 1890 and declared a state historic site in 1984.|$|R

40|$|To reduce {{storage space}} and {{transportation}} cost for alfalfa and straw bales, recompressing of the bales is recommended. In order to design different units and elements of double compressing device, some physical and rheological properties of desired products were determined. A factorial experiment with a randomized complete block design with three replications was {{used during the}} tests. Confined compression tests for three levels of axial strain (25, 35 and 45 % of initial length) on alfalfa and straw bales were performed. In this study, {{the influence of the}} materials and strain on pressure, modulus of elasticity and required energy were investigated. The results showed that the effect of materials type and strain levels on the determined parameters were highly significant (P&lt; 0. 01). The highest value of the measured parameter was obtained for straw bales at 45 % strain. The Fabroad’s model (expressing the relationship between pressure and density) and two other models, namely, Sitki and Osbof which were used to describe the relationship between modulus of elasticity and density were fitted to the measured values, and then constants were determined for each model individually. The coefficients of friction for alfalfa and straw bales on steel and galvanized surfaces at three levels of perpendicular loads were determined. Effect of bales and surface types on frictional coefficient were not significant (P&lt; 0. 05), however, the effect of perpendicular load was highly significant (P&lt; 0. 01). Tensile strength of hemp and nylon ropes, which are usually used to knot <b>compressed</b> <b>bales,</b> was measured. The results indicated that hemp ropes had more strength than nylon...|$|R
40|$|Cotton is {{harvested}} as seed cotton, {{which includes}} fiber attached to seeds mixed with extraneous matter like leaves and stems. A module builder {{is used to}} compress the seed cotton into large rectangular modules that allow in-field storage until being transported to a ginning facility, where the fiber and seed are separated and cleaned. On-board module-building systems are now being used on harvesters and offer virtually continuous harvesting, without the need to transfer seed cotton to a separate module builder. With their smaller size and shape, these packages could possibly be transported more economically by loading multiple packages on a truck. However, their density is similar to traditional modules, so any transport advantage is minimal. Transportation costs could be reduced significantly by creating higher-density cotton packages at harvest. Compression of seed cotton to levels observed with module-building systems has not proven to damage cottonseed, but some {{research has shown that}} higher compression levels could cause damage. Moisture content and storage duration may also influence the effect of compression on the seed. The objective of this research was to quantify the effects of these factors, individually and in combination, on cottonseed across two cotton varieties. Humidity chambers were used to achieve desired experimental seed cotton moisture levels. A miniature bale press (16. 6 x 8. 3 x 6. 2 in.) was used to <b>compress</b> <b>bales</b> of seed cotton to different densities. Germination and seed crackage were quantified to determine the impact on the cottonseed. Data analyses indicated that compression density, moisture content, storage time and position of the sample in the bale were all significantly related to seed damage; however, cotton variety was not significantly related. Moisture was most strongly related to reduction in germination, while compression density was most strongly related to increasing crackage. Compression above 24 lbs/ft^ 3 was clearly associated with higher percentages of cracked seed...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanization}} {{of production}} and marketing procedures for burley tobacco had experienced little change in several decades prior to 1980. Burley tobacco production required large amounts of hand labor with minimum mechanization. Both the availability and cost of intensive hand labor required at peak seasons began forcing many producers to seek labor-saving tech niques. About one-half of the labor required {{for the production of}} burley tobacco prior to the late 1970 s involved stripping and preparation for market. Leaves of air cured burley tobacco were removed from the stalk, held in an oriented fashion and tied with a wrapper leaf into "hands " or bundles. Studies indicated that considerable farm and warehouse labor and time might be saved if burley tobaGco could be successf ully marketed in an untied or loose-leaf form. Flue-cured tobacco was marketed in a loose-leaf, unoriented manner, packaged in a burlap sheet. Canadian and other types of tobacco were packaged and marketed in a <b>compressed</b> <b>bale.</b> lnterest by many producers in loose-leaf methods for packaging and handing burley tobacco coincided with this increased interest. Further information was gained from various experiments on labor requirements for packaging by conventional and loose-leaf methods, on moisture variables in the loose-leaf package, and on the technical and mechanical aspects of loose-leaf handling. These studies and experiments by industry and public agencies led to the approval of unlimited sale of baled burley by the Secretary of Agriculture beginning in the 1981 - 82 marketing year. Widespread adoption of the bale method has been made by producers and the industry since that time. This publication provides educational information and plans for packaging and handling burley at the farm in the approved bale form. * *See References for further information. totr l|ao...|$|R
