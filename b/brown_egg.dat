5|$|The pyjama shark is {{primarily}} nocturnal, {{spending most of}} the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation. It often forms groups, particularly during summer. This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds {{on a wide variety of}} fishes and invertebrates; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo reynaudi). When threatened, it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying rectangular, dark <b>brown</b> <b>egg</b> cases two at a time year-round. This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums. It is often caught as a bycatch of commercial and recreational fisheries. Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests. Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range.|$|E

The New York Times reported during the Second World War that housewives in Boston preferred <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> and those in New York preferred white eggs. In February 1976, the New Scientist magazine, in discussing issues of chicken egg color, stated [...] "Housewives are particularly fussy about the colour of their eggs, preferring even {{to pay more for}} <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> although white eggs are just as good". As a result of these trends, <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> are usually more expensive to purchase in regions where white eggs are considered 'normal', due to lower production. In France and the United Kingdom, {{it is very difficult to}} buy white eggs, with most supermarkets supplying only the more popular <b>brown</b> <b>eggs.</b> By direct contrast, in Egypt it is very hard to source <b>brown</b> <b>eggs,</b> as demand is almost entirely for white ones, with the country's largest supplier describing white eggs as [...] "table eggs" [...] and packaging <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> for export.|$|R

50|$|This {{species has}} a {{distinct}} colony cycle, with primary egglayers only {{being part of the}} colony for a limited amount of time. Reproductives of L. dorsata consist of primary yellow egg layers and subordinate <b>brown</b> <b>egg</b> layers. The yellow females have longer ovaries than the brown females. This is likely due to the brown egglayers being former worker wasps that have become egg layers in the colony. All of the yellow egg layers are older females, but there is usually a mix between ages in the <b>brown</b> <b>egg</b> layers. This occurs when a colony is deprived of its yellow egg layers, the brown workers are signaled to become replacements, an example of cyclical oligogyny. Eventually, the older yellow egg layer population recovers and the workers aggressively prevent other females from becoming egg layers.|$|E

50|$|When the {{population}} of primary egg layers is robust, workers aggressively suppress reproduction by other workers. This aggression is exhibited between nest mates, through deying food and physically biting rivals. Older mature primary egglayers will suppress reproduction in the younger brown egglayer population. However, if the colony begins losing its primary reproductives then it is advantageous for the colony if the subordinate (<b>brown)</b> <b>egg</b> layers reproduce, and they will do so since {{they are no longer}} suppressed by the yellow egglayers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} some quality parameters of commercial hen’s eggs according to egg shell color. A total of 5, 424 eggs were purchased from 113 supermarkets situated in 14 cities from the east-center of Entre Rios, Argentina; 3, 475 were white eggshell and 1, 949 <b>eggs</b> were <b>brown</b> eggshell. The values of Egg Weight (EW), Eggshell Weight (ESW), Eggshell Thickness (EST), % eggshell (% ES) and Total Shell Surface Area (TSSA) were greater in <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> than in white eggs. There was a significant positive correlation between EW and ESW and EW and TSSA, but EW had negative correlations with % ES. There were no significant differences in yolk (Y) and albumen (Al) pH between <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> and white eggs. The range of Yolk Color (YC) was 2 - 11 for white eggs and 2 - 14 for <b>brown</b> <b>eggs.</b> However, in general, eggs had similar YC in a package. This is the first report about the quality of commercial hen’s eggs from supermarkets in Argentina. Although eggs can belong to different hen's breeding systems and ages, there are some differences in the quality parameters studied between white and <b>brown</b> <b>eggs...</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{accompanied}} by a guardian beast, the player can press the second action button to send the companion to attack nearby enemies or pick up items. However, the beast has his life gauge and will die if he takes too much damage. The player can press the button to call the beast back to his side and allow him to regenerate his own health. There are three guardians available: Goblin (a small armored warrior in a blue egg), Rollin (an armadillo-like creature in a <b>brown</b> <b>egg)</b> and Garuda (a flying baby dragon in a purple egg). Each beast has his own attack pattern. When the player picks an egg of the same color while his or her companion is still around, his companion's maximum health will increase. However, if the player picks a different colored egg, his companion will be replaced with one inside the egg.|$|E

50|$|Breeding mostly occurs between June-December {{with some}} {{geographic}} variation in timing. Little {{is known about}} sexual behaviour, although the species appears to breed in pairs. Nests are relatively large for a bird of its size (9-14 cm), often domed, spherical or domed with a round entrance near the top (2.5-4 cm). Usually constructed of bark strips and bark fibre, often lined with feathers, fur or soft plant material. Nests are located on or {{close to the ground}} among shrubs, grass tussocks, at the base of trees, in fallen logs or in small depressions. Two to four eggs are laid and the female is solely responsible for incubating the eggs. The redthroat and the closely related apeckled warbler are the only members of the acanthizids which have a solid coloured chocolate <b>brown</b> <b>egg.</b> Furthermore, the redthroat (and the speckled warbler) are the primary host species of some brood parasites such as the black-eared cuckoo and fan-tailed cuckoo which remove redthroat eggs from the nest and lay their own similar looking eggs.|$|E

25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The <b>brown</b> <b>eggs,</b> called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed {{on top of the other}} cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> are cooked separately in a metal pot on the all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light <b>brown,</b> giving the <b>egg</b> a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, <b>brown</b> <b>eggs</b> are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|R
5000|$|In 1906, Anne Goldthwaite {{traveled}} to Paris to explore {{her interest in}} the early modern painting styles of Fauvism and Cubism. She met Gertrude Stein while sketching in the Luxembourg Gardens. According to Charlotte Rubinstein in American Women Artists, Goldthwaite explained that Stein [...] "looked something like an immense dark <b>brown</b> <b>egg.</b> She wore, wrapped tight around her, a brown kimono-like garment and a large flat black hat, and stood on feet covered with wide sandals." [...] Stein invited Goldthwaite to visit her home, yet she hesitated due to Stein's [...] "shabby" [...] appearance. But Goldthwaite soon realized Stein's presence {{in the art world}} when encountering the extensive contemporary painting collection hung on the walls of her apartment. Meeting {{one of the most influential}} pre-war avant-garde persons of the time gave Goldthwaite an opportunity to join the art circle of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. She later said, [...] "Fate gave me several years in Paris at the most exciting time: during the great reconstruction from art to modern art." [...] During her time in Paris, Goldthwaite drifted to different studios in an attempt to find the right teacher. After much difficulty, she joined a small group of young artists who worked at 86 Notre Dame des Champs. Their work was periodically critiqued by Charles Guerin, a disciple of Cézanne. The group called themselves the Académie Moderne and held an exhibition each spring.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in order to investigate the possibility of utilizing hazelnut kernel oil meal (HKOM) in layer diets as a replacement for soybean oil meal (SBM). Two hundred and sixteen <b>brown</b> <b>egg</b> layers raised in contiguous wire cages were used. The duration of the experi-ment was 24 wk consisting of six periods of 4 wk. In the trial, six diets containing different levels of HKOM replacing 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % of SBM protein, respectively, were utilized as the treatments. Differences among the diets in terms of egg yield, feed consumption, feed efficiency ratio, egg weight, egg yolk and albumen ratios, shell thickness, shell weight, and Roche color values of the yolk were not statistically significant (P>. 01). Results indicated that SBM could be replaced totally by HKOM in layer diets. However, replacement of more than 40 % of SBM with HKOM is not recommended.
