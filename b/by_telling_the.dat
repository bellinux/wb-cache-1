5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E

He attempts to use magic (goena-goena) to win her heart, and asks an egg merchant, Mak Boejoeng, to frighten Dasima <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> young woman that she has committed the sin of zina (extramarital sex).|$|E
5|$|Having {{played the}} final year of his {{existing}} contract, Bieksa addressed his pending unrestricted free agency <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> media he was ready to re-sign for less than market value in order to remain with the Canucks. Shortly thereafter, on June 27, 2011, Bieksa signed a five-year, $23 million contract extension. The deal came with a no-trade clause and was reported to be front-loaded, with Bieksa making $7 million in his first year, followed by $4.5 million, $5 million, $4 million and $2.5 million annual salaries. The deal kept the popular defenceman amongst the core for another chance at winning a Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} before the Second World War (1939–1945) the British wanted to reduce growth of Egyptian {{influence}} in Sudan, {{which had become}} more likely {{as a result of}} the 1936 treaty, while also suppressing the ultra-nationalist neo-Mahdist movement. They gave their support to Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani of the Khatmiyyah sect as a counterpoise to Sayyid Abd al-Rahman. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman responded <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> British that Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani was pro-Italian due to his family commitments in Eritrea, but this was not accepted by the British.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Athena Polias (the city's eponymous goddess) {{was central}} to Athenian society, {{reinforcing}} morality and maintaining societal structure. Women {{played a key role}} in the cult; the priestesshood of Athena was a position of great importance, and the priestess could use her influence to support political positions. According to Herodotus, before the Battle of Salamis the priestess of Athena encouraged the evacuation of Athens <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> Athenians that the snake sacred to Athena (which lived on the Acropolis) had already left.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{his actions}} in leaving Lyon, Ben Arfa {{responded to the}} {{statement}} <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> French sports newspaper L'Equipe {{that he would not}} be returning to La Commanderie, Marseille's training facility, and would not play with the team for the remainder of the season. He also stated that his relationship with Deschamps had turned sour and was beyond repair. Ben Arfa confirmed his intentions by travelling to Newcastle upon Tyne, without authorization, with hopes that Newcastle and Marseille would come to an agreement. After returning to Marseille, he missed several training sessions with his parent club and was, subsequently, left off the match day squad for two league matches against Valenciennes and Lorient. Ben Arfa's number 10 was later given to new signing André-Pierre Gignac, which signaled a transfer was imminent.|$|E
5|$|The Burys {{travelled}} {{north as}} second-class {{passengers on the}} steamer Cambria. They arrived at Dundee {{on the evening of}} 20 January 1889, and the following morning they rented a room above a bar at 43 Union Street. The Burys stayed for only eight days before they moved on 29 January to a squat at 113 Prince's Street, a basement flat under a shop. William had obtained the key under false pretences <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> letting agents that he was a viewer interested in renting the property. Meanwhile, Ellen found a job as a cleaner at a local mill, but she quit after a day. William continued to drink heavily, often with a decorator called David Walker, who was re-painting the public house frequented by William.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each {{season with a}} monologue, giving glimpses of the show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. <b>By</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show {{with a lot of}} subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E

5|$|With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero {{begin to}} ascend the throne, but the {{ceremony}} {{is interrupted by}} the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive ("Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!"), saved from death by Otho, {{the commander of the}} army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the tables on Otho <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne.|$|E

25|$|The Manuscript is Everhard's {{autobiography}} as {{she tells}} of: her privileged childhood as {{the daughter of}} an accomplished scientist; her marriage to the socialist revolutionary Ernest Everhard; the fall of the US republic; and her years in the underground resistance from the First Revolt through the years leading to the Second Revolt. <b>By</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> story of Avis Everhard, the novel is essentially an adventurous tale heavily strewn with social commentary of an alternative future (from a 1907 perspective). However, the future perspective of the scholar Meredith deepens the tragic plight of Everhard and her revolutionary comrades.|$|E

25|$|In Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read {{either on}} Shemini Atzeret (by Yemenites, Italians, some Sepharadim, and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) {{or on the}} Shabbat of the Intermediate Days of Sukkot (by Ashkenazim). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot, even the Ashkenazim read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, for Ashkenazim in the Land of Israel, on the first Shabbat of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a {{reminder}} to not get too {{caught up in the}} festivities of the holiday, as well as to carry over the happiness of Sukkot {{to the rest of the}} year <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> listeners that, without God, life is meaningless.

25|$|The series The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa had a direct-to-video film named Around the World with Timon and Pumbaa, with Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella reprising {{their roles}} as Timon and Pumbaa respectively. The story tells of Pumbaa getting struck by {{lightning}}, losing all his memory, and Timon helps refrain every moment they spent. After Pumbaa gets his memory back, lightning strikes Timon losing his memory this time, making Pumbaa break the fourth wall <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> viewers to rewind the tape {{to start at the}} beginning, being {{it was the only way}} to help Timon remember.

25|$|The four {{remaining}} teams {{stood on}} the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge. Olmec began the round <b>by</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> remaining teams the episode's legend of the featured artifact, which became the theme {{for the remainder of}} the episode. The legend centered on an artifact which the winning team searched for in the final round. At the end of the legend, Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found. After finishing, he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory. Each multiple-choice question had three possible answers. A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on a button on their step, causing the front of the step to illuminate (if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question, he stopped talking immediately). A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level. If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time (three seconds after being called upon), the other teams were given a chance to answer. The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the bottom level advanced to the next round.|$|E
