5|$|Many {{allopatric}} forms previously {{regarded as}} conspecific are treated by Rasmussen and Anderton as full species. Most of these {{had previously been}} proposed elsewhere, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> introduced a number of innovations of its own. Experts on Asian birds, Nigel Collar and John Pilgrim, in 2008 analysed Rasmussen and Anderton's proposed changes, indicating which had previously been proposed by other authors, and which were novel, and required further justification.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} manuscript before {{an editor at}} the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed. Some praised the novel as a powerful paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were slow, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects and right-libertarians.|$|E
5|$|Covered Bridges Today {{provides}} information on 412 bridges in the states of Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. The book is geographically focused on Krekeler's home state of Ohio and includes all 142 remaining covered bridges in the state {{at the time of}} writing. However, the book is not a complete inventory of each state's extant bridges. When it was written, 76 of an estimated 228 Pennsylvania's bridges were included, 68 of Indiana's 98 covered bridges, and 43 of Vermont's estimated 100 bridges were also featured. Krekeler's use of estimations stems from the facts that covered bridges are lost periodically and that the bridges detailed include those restored or in immediate danger of collapse. Within a year of the publication of the book, 30 bridges were lost. Known bridges in states that are not in the listing are not named or cited. For example, West Virginia had 17 remaining bridges at time of publication, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> only covers 10 of them.|$|E
5|$|Potter biographer Linda Lear {{notes that}} none of the rabbit books {{subsequent}} to Peter Rabbit appealed to Potter with the passion she experienced for the original, but, in Benjamin Bunny, she successfully wrote a simple, didactic tale for very young children that was less complicated than The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin and The Tailor of Gloucester. Benjamin Bunny however lacked the vitality of her previous efforts because it was made to order rather than allowed to flower from a picture letter to real children in the manner of Peter Rabbit and Squirrel Nutkin. The weak story line of Benjamin Bunny is evidence of her dwindling interest in continuing the Peter Rabbit saga, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> displays a delight in place, a deep understanding of rabbit anatomy and behaviour, and beautifully miniaturized illustrations of vegetable gardens. Benjamin Bunny presented demands upon Potter she had not encountered in her previous three tales. She had depleted all her sketchbook backgrounds in the production of the other tales and was forced to create new ones, but the greatest challenge to Potter's artistry was consciously working to satisfy both her publisher's demand for another commercial success and her public's expectation of a tale as delightful as her others while labouring under the pressure to produce a sequel to a work of genius.|$|E

25|$|MacDonald {{believes}} the illustrations {{are some of}} Potter's best, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> suffers from its small format and would be better suited to the larger format Potter originally intended.

25|$|Flowers for Algernon {{is on the}} American Library Association's list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999 {{at number}} 43.

25|$|Ben-Hur made Wallace {{a wealthy}} man and {{established}} {{his reputation as a}} famous author. Sales were slow at first; only 2,800 copies were sold in the first seven months after its release, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> became popular among readers around the world. By 1886, it was earning Wallace about $11,000 in annual royalties (equivalent to $290,000 in 2015 dollars), and provided Wallace’s family with financial security. By 1889, Harper and Brothers had sold 400,000 copies and the book had been translated into several languages.|$|E
25|$|The Riverworld series {{originated}} in a novel, Owe for the Flesh, written {{in one month}} in 1952 as a contest entry. It won the contest, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was left unpublished and orphaned when the prize money was misappropriated, and Farmer nearly gave up writing altogether. The original manuscript of the novel was lost, but years later Farmer reworked the material into the Riverworld magazine stories mentioned above. Eventually, {{a copy of a}} revised version of the original novel surfaced in a box in a garage and was published as River of Eternity by Phantasia Press in 1983.

25|$|I {{have not}} worked with YA editors; my work {{has never been}} marketed that way until Tor put a YA cover and a new ISBN on Ender’s Game—fifteen years after the book first came out, and long after it had become popular with young readers. Ender's Game was written with no {{concessions}} to young readers. My protagonists were children, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was definitely not aimed at kids. I was perfectly aware that {{the rule of thumb}} for children’s literature is that the protagonist must be a couple of years older than the target audience.

25|$|Twain's next venture was {{a work of}} {{straight}} fiction that he called Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc and dedicated to his wife. He had long {{said that this was}} the work that he was most proud of, despite the criticism that he received for it. The book had been a dream of his since childhood, and he claimed that he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan of Arc when he was an adolescent. This was another piece that he was convinced would save his publishing company. His financial adviser Henry Huttleston Rogers quashed that idea and got Twain out of that business altogether, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was published nonetheless.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{scholars}} {{agree that}} the Book of Joshua holds little historical value for early Israel and most likely reflects a much later period. Although Rabbinic tradition holds that {{the book was written}} by Joshua, it is probable that it was written by multiple authors and editors far removed from the times it depicts. The earliest parts of the book are possibly chapters 2–11, the story of the conquest; these chapters were later incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king Josiah (reigned 640–609BCE), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was not completed until after the fall of Jerusalem to the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE, and possibly not until after the return from the Babylonian exile in 539 BCE.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that {{the three types of}} material interspersed through the book – poetic, narrative, and biographical – come from different sources or circles. Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably {{to be found in the}} poetic sections of chapters 1–25, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by followers (including perhaps the prophet's companion, the scribe Baruch) and later generations of Deuteronomists. The date of the final versions of the book (Greek and Hebrew) can be suggested by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the Masoretic (i.e., Hebrew) shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE.|$|E
25|$|The last {{sentence}} {{of the passage}} is of great interest for navigation at sea, since the magnetic compass used for seafaring navigation was not used until the time of Shen Kuo (10311095). Although the Song Shu text describes earlier precedents of the south-pointing chariot before the time of Ma Jun, this is not entirely credible, as there are no pre-Han or Han Dynasty era texts that describe the device. In fact, the first known source to describe stories of its legendary use during the Zhou period was the Gu Jin Zhu book of Cui Bao (c. 300 CE), written soon after the Three Kingdoms era. Cui Bao also wrote that the intricate details of construction for the device were once written in the Shang Fang Gu Shi (Traditions of the Imperial Workshops), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> was lost by his time.|$|E
25|$|Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why: The Science of Sexual Orientation (2010; {{second edition}} 2016) {{is a book}} about the {{development}} of sexual orientation by the neuroscientist Simon LeVay, in which the author argues that sexual orientation is an aspect of gender that emerges from the prenatal sexual differentiation of the brain, and criticizes Freudian and behaviorist explanations of sexual orientation. Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why received numerous positive reviews, praising it for LeVay's wide-ranging overview of scientific research on sexual orientation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> also received some mixed or negative reviews, criticizing it on grounds such as LeVay's willingness to rely on studies with inadequate sample sizes.
