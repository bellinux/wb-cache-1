2500|$|The sleeper serves {{mainly to}} keep the wearer warm at night, {{even in the absence}} of {{blankets}} and bed covers. [...] The sleeper covers the entire body except for the head (except in certain cases where a hood is present) and (in most cases) hands (except in cases where a sleeper has attached mitts, mostly on infant sizes), where it is snug at the neck and wrists. [...] The use of a zipper closure in place of buttons or snap fasteners also further retains warmth by eliminating drafts. [...] This is especially important for infants, for whom loose blankets may pose a safety hazard (including increasing the risk of SIDS), and possibly for older children, who may still be too young to be relied upon {{to keep the}}ir own sleepwear or bed covers adjusted so as to prevent exposure to the air of bare skin. [...] This is reflected in advertisements by blanket sleeper manufacturers, which often emphasize that their garments [...] "can't be kicked off", or that [...] "no other covers are needed". The permanently attached feet can also be a beneficial feature for children who are prone to get out of <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> before their parents are awake, and are too young to be relied upon to put on slippers or other footwear to keep their feet warm, as well as for adults who find putting on, and/or wearing socks in bed too bothersome, yet still want their feet covered when getting out of <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> [...] Blanket sleepers without feet allow more room for growth and reduce the possibility of slipping. [...] Also, children with larger or smaller feet find a better fit.|$|E
2500|$|Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) – The {{most common}} cause of vertigo. [...] It is {{typically}} described as a brief, intense sensation of spinning that occurs when there are changes in the position of the head with respect to gravity. An individual may experience BPPV when rolling over to the left or right, upon getting out of <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> or when looking up for an object on a high shelf. The cause of BPPV is the presence of normal but misplaced calcium crystals called otoconia, which are normally found in the utricle and saccule (the otolith organs) and are used to sense movement. If they fall from the utricle and become loose in the semicircular canals, they can distort the sense of movement and cause a mismatch between actual head movement and the information sent to the brain by the inner ear, causing a spinning sensation.|$|E

After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E
