Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E

500|$|As {{molten iron}} cools past its {{freezing}} point of 1538°C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, {{which has a}} body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to 1394°C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or austenite. At 912°C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770°C (the Curie point, Tc) iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, {{but there is a}} change in [...] "domain structure", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the <b>body-centered</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E

40|$|To {{speak about}} {{fundamental}} measure theory obliges to mention dimensional crossover. This feature, inherent to the systems themselves, was {{incorporated in the}} theory almost from the beginning. Although {{at first it was}} thought to be a consistency check for the theory, it rapidly became its fundamental pillar, thus becoming the only density functional theory which possesses such a property. It is straightforward that dimensional crossover connects, for instance, the parallel hard cube system (three-dimensional) with that of squares (two-dimensional) and rods (one-dimensional). We show here that there are many more connections which can be established in this way. Through them we deduce from the functional for parallel hard (hyper) cubes in the simple (hyper) <b>cubic</b> <b>lattice</b> the corresponding functionals for the nearest-neighbor exclusion lattice gases in the square, triangular, simple cubic, face-centered <b>cubic,</b> and <b>body-centered</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>lattices.</b> As an application, the bulk phase diagram for all these systems is obtained.

The correlation induced electronic spectrum narrowing and a comparison with a generalized Hartree-Fock approximation allow one to estimate the strength of correlation effects.

In contrast with metallic state, possessing strong band narrowing, insulator one is only weakly correlated. The magnetic (Slater) scenario of MIT is found to be superior over the Mott one. Unlike simple and <b>body-centered</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>lattices,</b> MIT is the first order transition for most $t'/t$.
