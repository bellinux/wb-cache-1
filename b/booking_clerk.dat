5|$|In 1903, {{the station}} {{employed}} 11 men, but {{the post of}} station master was abolished on 27 August 1909 as a cost-cutting measure, with responsibility passing to Clifton Down. There were six staff by 1938. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. Services to Fishponds ended on 31 March 1941. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, when it came {{under the aegis of}} the Western Region of British Railways. The signal box closed in 1950, and by 1958 there were only three staff members: a <b>booking</b> <b>clerk</b> and two porters. Through services to Pilning and Henbury ceased with the Beeching Axe in 1964, with services terminating at , and from December that year the station was unstaffed after 2pm. Staff were withdrawn completely on 17 July 1967, a fate shared by most of the other stations on the Severn Beach Line. The southern running line was lifted on 19 October 1970, and the adjacent platform abandoned and its shelter demolished. The ticket office and footbridge were also demolished, with a replacement entrance opened through the South Road garages.|$|E
500|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Clifton Down {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways, and there remained a strong staff presence in 1958, with a station master, chief <b>booking</b> <b>clerk,</b> four other clerks, six porters, a shunter, a checker and a weighbridge assistant. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers, and saw the withdrawal of a special schoolchildren's service. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested that all services along the Severn Beach Line be withdrawn. Following meetings with staff, it was decided to keep the line open to Severn Beach, but to close the section to Pilning, and also end services via Henbury. These services duly ended, and in July 1965 the goods yard at Clifton Down also closed. The line however was still threatened, and on 10 February 1967 it was announced that all services between [...] and Severn Beach would be discontinued. An enquiry followed, and in June that year the decision was reversed, on the condition that tickets be issued on the trains. Thus, on 17 July 1967, all stations along the line, including Clifton Down, had their staff withdrawn. The decrease of costs allowed a reduction of ticket prices, but the line was still under threat until in June 1969 it was decided that the line's closure would result in significant hardship, and so a grant was allocated to ensure continued services. Service levels however still declined: though the [...] "Monkey Specials" [...] were still going strong into the 1960s, with 340,000 excursion passengers arriving between 1958 and 1966, the closure of many of the Welsh Valley Lines and the construction of the Severn Bridge led to their demise in the early 1970s. Most of the Severn Beach Line was reduced to single track in late 1970, leaving Clifton Down as one of the few passing places. The glass platform canopies were completely removed in May 1971, and the glass-covered footbridge was also removed, leaving a set of steps from Whiteladies road as the only access to the southern platform. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the Clifton Down Shopping Centre was built over most of the goods yard, the rest covered by a housing development.|$|E

6000|$|A row of {{passengers}} were waiting their turn, {{and as he}} took {{his place in the}} line a man crossed the floor and stood behind him.

50|$|The {{number of}} other {{employees}} at a railway station varies according to size. A historic station master would typically manage a number of <b>booking</b> <b>clerks</b> (responsible for ticket sales and financial auditing), porters (responsible for platform safety, luggage transportation, and cleaning), and often ancillary staff in catering, left luggage, and maintenance roles. Although technically part of the engineering department, a station master might also have day-to-day management of signalmen in the station's signal box.|$|R

6000|$|It {{was with}} perfect sincerity that I {{answered}} [...] "Nothing," [...] {{and having a}} great repugnance to consider murder as a factor of politics, I dismissed the subject. It fitted with my ethical sense that an act cruel and absurd should be also useless. I had also {{the vision of a}} crowd of shadowy Archdukes in the background, out of which one would step forward {{to take the place of}} that dead man in the light of the European stage. And then, to speak the whole truth, there was no man capable of forming a judgment who attended so little to the march of events as I did at that time. What for want of a more definite term I must call my mind was fixed upon my own affairs, not because they were in a bad posture, but because of their fascinating holiday-promising aspect. I had been obtaining my information as to Europe at second hand, from friends good enough to come down now and then to see us. They arrived with their pockets full of crumpled newspapers, and answered my queries casually, with gentle smiles of scepticism as to the reality of my interest. And yet I was not indifferent; but the tension in the Balkans had become chronic after the acute crisis, and one could not help being less conscious of it. It had wearied out one's attention. Who could have guessed that on that wild stage we had just been looking at a miniature rehearsal of the great world-drama, the reduced model of the very passions and violences of what the future held in store for the Powers of the Old World? Here and there, perhaps, rare minds had a suspicion of that possibility, while they watched Old Europe stage-managing fussily by means of notes and conferences, the prophetic reproduction of its awaiting fate. It was wonderfully exact in the spirit; same roar of guns, same protestations of superiority, same words in the air; race, liberation, justice--and the same mood of trivial demonstrations. One could not take to-day a ticket for Petersburg. [...] "You mean Petrograd," [...] would say the <b>booking</b> <b>clerk.</b> Shortly after the fall of Adrianople a friend of mine passing through Sophia asked for some cafe turc at the end of his lunch.|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{sexual and}} reproductive health package {{is widely regarded}} as essential for meeting the needs of both men and women. The practical realities of integration in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were examined from the perspective of both providers and clients. Only minorities of clients received any assessment of reproductive and sexual health needs over and above their main presenting need or problem. The majority would have welcomed such assessments and many were classified as being in need, particularly for advice and services with regard to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Most providers were positive about integration, but their ability to practice an active form of integration was limited by inadequate training and time constraints. While training defects can be remedied, the time constraints posed by heavy patient loads are less tractable. More skilful use of <b>booking</b> <b>clerks</b> or the introduction of lay counsellors are also possible solutions...|$|R

Previously the MS&LR, perennially short of money, had vacated their offices and booking facilities, the LNWR having agreed to operate them. Now the MS&LR wanted to return. Of the first two <b>booking</b> <b>clerks</b> to arrive, one was refused entry and the other ejected. For a while the LNWR were arresting MS&LR passengers as they arrived. By 1858, a price war was raging for both passengers and freight, that was alarming other railway companies. When, however, the co-operative agreement between the MS&LR and the GNR was ratified by Parliament, while it declared past private agreements with the LNWR as void, the stage was set for the peacemakers. At a meeting of nineteen different railway companies at the Railway Clearing House most, if not all, of the disagreements were overcome. A meeting at Euston Square saw agreement between the GNR, the MS&LR and the LNWR on the matter of fares and handling of traffic, with disputes settled by arbitration. While the first two became closer however, they remained wary of the LNWR's intentions.|$|R
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Montpelier {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels were reduced further, down to two <b>booking</b> <b>clerks,</b> four porters, a checker and a weighbridge operator by 1950. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. The goods yard at Montpelier closed on 18 November 1965, with the signal box following on 10 May 1967. Staff were completely withdrawn on 17 July 1967 with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the northern track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the southern platform. The former goods yard is now a small industrial estate. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} {{station was}} modest, with four sidings {{and a single}} platform, plus additional run around facilities sandwiched between the hillside and Hubberston Pill. [...] Initial services comprised a local service running {{back and forth between}} Milford and Johnston, where passengers could connect with Great Western services from New Milford. [...] By 1871, services had grown to seven daily in each direction, many connecting with passenger services from New Milford at Johnston. [...] The trains using the line were operated by Great Western Railway who had part funded the original railway. [...] It initially rented use of the line, although in 1896 absorbed The Milford Railway Company. [...] In the 1930s many improvements were made, including narrowing the course of the Pill, extra side loops and goods yards. By 1923 the Milford Station Master was re-graded as a special class post, supported by twelve <b>booking</b> <b>clerks</b> and up to ten porters.Up until 1947, three daily 'vacuum fish' express services transported fish from the Haven to various destinations in the UK, including London Paddington, Yeovil and the north of England. [...] Fish vans were often attached to passenger trains. Goods traffic remained dominant over passenger traffic until the commercial decline of the docks in the late twentieth century. Into the twentieth century, direct services to London Paddington were in operation, and a sleeper service remained in place until the 1960s. [...] The sidings were reduced substantially in 1968, although goods traffic continued until the 1980s. [...] High speed train services from London Paddington to Milford ran until the early 1990s, terminating in 1994.

5000|$|The first Workington {{station on}} the Cumbrian Coast Line {{was built in the}} area known as Priestgate Marsh for the Whitehaven Junction Railway. Although the WJR was opened from Maryport to Workington in 1845 the WJR was {{advertising}} for tenders for building the station at Workington in October 1846.

The <b>booking</b> office <b>clerk</b> having seen the train approaching, ensured no lives were lost but [...] "the station" [...] reported the Cumberland Pacquet [...] "is of course a perfect wreck" [...] and had to be re-built. (Immediately after the accident, the gas supply to the station was turned off at the meter, but it was noted that three gas lights continued to burn - the town trustees (who owned the town gasworks) declined to restore the supply until the WJR gave a satisfactory explanation or adequate compensation).|$|R
5000|$|The Metropolitan Meat Market Company {{continued}} {{to operate the}} market until June 1974, a total of ninety four years. The Managing Director of the Company in its final years was J.M. (Malcolm) Howlett, who {{was the son of}} James M. Howlett, who with his brother John T. Howlett commenced work with William Reynolds in the 1880s. Malcolm Howlett has remained keenly interested in the market since it became a Craft Centre and has in his writings about it, given us a clear picture of what it was like. [...] "as {{to the use of the}} buildings as a wholesale Meat Market one must remember that it was designed for the use of horse-drawn vehicles. If you look at the stone kerbs in front of the stalls, you can see how they are worn down by the continual backing of the steel-tyred wheels of the lorries against them and although petrol driven trucks started to appear after 1914, it was a gradual change and I remember at least one horse drawn lorry still operating late in the 1940s. [...] The use of horses for transport meant that the market needed someone to see to [...] the orderly bringing in of the various lorries and carts as they arrived. In the busy early morning there would be many outside in the street awaiting their turn to [...] come in. This function was in the hands of the caretaker whose many duties included keeping the central area swept and clean as well as the opening and closing of the Market on time and responsibility to the company for the orderly running of the place. The builder engaged in the construction of the Market was a Mr. Launder [...] of Hawthorn and presumably it was his son, Thomas Launder, who [...] became the first caretaker. He not only filled the duties mentioned above but acted as Meat Inspector as well. It is interesting that Thomas Launder was succeeded in the post by his son Mr. Ern Launder, who in turn was followed by his son Mr. Jack Launder. Four generations of one [...] family covering one hundred years.” (When Jack Launder retired in March 1986 he turned the first sod to plant a Blackwood tree in the activities courtyard as a permanent reminder of his Families' contribution to the Market). “The Market opened at 5.00am every day including Saturdays until Saturday work was cut out. It was from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock in the [...] morning that the market was at its busiest and a stranger would have been amazed at the crescendo of sound inside the building. The rattle and clatter of the lorries on the cobbled floor, the cries of the lumpers [...] calling the weights to the <b>booking</b> <b>clerks,</b> the bargaining between [...] salesmen and customers and not infrequently a violent argument ending in a fight. To a stranger quite deafening and crazy but the natural atmosphere to those who worked there. In later years [...] unfortunately, this atmosphere was lost. The advent of motor trucks [...] and the departure of the horse lorry, the increased turnover in labour [...] and the closing up of some of the smaller businesses caused much of the personality of the Market to go. Over the years, there was a gradual change in the firms, though many were there for long periods. Some of the names worth recording were - Reynolds, Ogden, Birtwistle, Mark Morris, Stone, Oldmeadow, Pridham, McAllister, Mehegan, [...] Howlett, Spillane, Laming, Borthwick and Brooklea. In the 1970s the market was facing a critical situation. Built 90 years before in the horse and cart era, the petrol driven vehicles having to load and unload inside the building with the exhaust fumes in close proximity to the meat in the stalls, health regulations demanded some means of separation and further refrigeration and with the space available to manoeuvre this was impossible. Eventually in 1974 the firms operating there either moved to other premises or closed up and the Market ceased as a Meat Market”.|$|R
