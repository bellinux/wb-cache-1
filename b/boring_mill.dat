50|$|In Pennsylvania, the {{earliest}} gunsmiths {{that can be}} documented are Robert Baker and Martin Meylin. Robert Baker formed a partnership with his son, Caleb and on August 15, 1719 erected a gun <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> on Pequea Creek. In the tax records of Berks County, Pennsylvania, there were several gunsmiths plying their trade {{along the banks of}} the Wyomissing Creek.|$|E
50|$|This furnace {{was built}} in 1695 by William Benge. In 1700 the owner was Samuel Gott. The furnace {{produced}} 200 tons of iron in 1717 and John Legas was working it in partnership with William Harrison. William Collins and George Matthews leased the furnace in 1782 but it ceased production c. 1787. There was a <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> marked on Budgen's map of 1795.|$|E

50|$|The widow Catharine Smith began {{building}} a sawmill and a gristmill on White Deer Creek in 1774 and completed the construction in 1775. Smith established a <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> {{at the mouth}} of White Deer Creek in the summer of 1776. The mill was used to make gun barrels for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. An early settlement near the creek was destroyed by the British in 1777.|$|E
50|$|The {{company had}} modern shops for mill work, {{pulp and paper}} machinery, general machine shop work, {{structural}} steel, power and heating, boilers and tanks, iron, and brass and aluminum castings. At {{the time of its}} construction, the machine shop contained the largest vertical <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> between Toronto and Vancouver. The plant covered 35 acres and was located at the north of Lakehead Harbour. There were 76 buildings with a roofed area of 300,000 ft2 m2.|$|E
50|$|In 1782, Bacon (as a Member of Parliament) {{had to give}} up {{government}} contracts and passed the forge and <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> with the gunfounding business to Francis Homfray. However, he gave it up in 1784 to David Tanner, so that his sons could establish the Penydarren Ironworks. However David Tanner also did not stay long, giving up the works in 1786, the year of Bacon's death. Tanner's managers were James Cockshutt, Thomas Treharne, and Francis William Bowzer.|$|E
50|$|In machine-shop terminology, the {{complete}} Digital Read Out system (consisting of a computer, axis-position encoders, and a numeric display) {{is referred to}} by the acronym DRO. Such a system is commonly fitted to machines in today's shops, especially for metal working — lathes, cylindrical grinders, milling machines, surface grinders, <b>boring</b> <b>mills</b> and other machine tools — to allow the operator to work faster and with greater accuracy. Use of DROs {{is not limited to}} manually operated machines. CNC machines can usually be switched to manual operation, and in this case a form of DRO is simulated on its control panel.|$|R
5000|$|Boring {{machines}} {{come in a}} large {{variety of}} sizes and styles. Boring operations on small workpieces {{can be carried out}} on a lathe while larger workpieces are machined on <b>boring</b> <b>mills.</b> Workpieces are commonly 1 to 4 m in diameter, but can be as large as 20 m. Power requirements can be as much as [...] Cooling of the bores is done through a hollow passageway through the boring bar where coolant can flow freely. Tungsten-alloy disks are sealed in the bar to counteract vibration and chatter during boring. The control systems can be computer-based, allowing for automation and increased consistency.|$|R
2500|$|Having secured these contracts, Roach {{set about}} {{equipping}} the Etna Iron Works {{for its new}} role. He began by hiring Thomas Main, a leading engineer with experience {{in a number of}} the world's most advanced engine works, as the plant's superintendent. Roach then began reorganizing the Works, adding a boilershop, machine shop, coppersmith shop and blacksmith, and equipping the plant with a host of new machines including traveling and swing cranes and the steam engines to power them, along with planers, lathes, <b>boring</b> <b>mills,</b> punches, shears and rollers. Amongst the new equipment was a planer capable of finishing 100-ton iron plates, and a lathe capable of boring a [...] cylinder—the two largest machine tools in the entire country.|$|R
50|$|This factory {{had some}} of the largest machine tools in the UK. One, a {{vertical}} <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> had a turntable 36' in diameter, used for machining the gun turret gear rings. This and other machines lent themselves to the machining of large turbine casing castings for the hydro-electric schemes. The building had three tiers of overhead cranes and could together lift several hundred tons. The building still continues to manufacture automotive parts under the ownership of Albion, now a subsidiary of American Axle.|$|E
50|$|Mahon {{continued}} to work at her <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> job following her graduation in 1937, until an aunt offered to pay her a college education at Winthrop College. Mahon accepted the generous proposition and began her freshman year on the campus in 1938. She finished college in 1942 {{with a degree in}} physical education, and spent one year in Whitmire, South Carolina, teaching all subjects to a class of seventh graders. She returned to Greenville in 1944 and took a job in the U.S. Post Office.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the course}} of the centuries the boiling houses had to be moved several times into the {{surrounding}} villages {{due to the lack of}} fuel. All the peat in the vicinity of Sülze had already been used up and productive operation in the village itself was no longer possible. From 1673 to 1678 the boiling houses were transferred to Bornrieth Moor, where there were two salt houses and a graduation tower 200 metres long and 7 metres high. A <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> was also built here for the manufacture of water pipes from tree trunks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMachining is {{a complex}} process in which many {{variables}} can detrimental the desired results. Among them, tool vibration is the most critical phenomenon which affects {{the life of the}} cutting tool, quality of the components machined and functional behaviour of the machined tools. This familiar phenomenon is recognized in many operations including <b>boring,</b> <b>milling</b> and drilling. The causing factors are related to the machine tool itself, tool clamping, length and diameter of the tool holder and the cutting data to be used. One way to avoid vibration problem during boring process is the location of boring tool holder in the relevant position for increasing the precision of the machining process. The present investigation aims at determining the optimum position of tool shank overhang for a boring tool holder S 25 T PCLNR/L 12 and also to study the effect of damping force on tool vibration using Analytical, computational and experimental methods...|$|R
50|$|He {{published}} a book of rules for roller skate Polo, as well as 16 rules for skating with your sweetheart. With a high quality product and great promotions, the space in the stable was extended 5 times. In 1880 he purchased the house at 201 N 14th Street, and doubled his shop space by including the carriage house there. His nephew suggested using ball bearings in the wheels which they patented in 1884. Product demand went wild; so he built a large two story factory on N 16th Street, which occupied most of a city block, and the Henley Bicycle Works was born. All three buildings are still standing in 2017. Under the leadership of Henley, the workers at Henley Bicycle Works manufactured bicycles; roller skates; scooters; lawn furniture and lawn swings; iron working machinery; tools; <b>boring,</b> <b>milling</b> and screw driving machines used in wood manufacturing; gas meters; fence machines and lawn mowers. The company also provided nickel plating services.|$|R

50|$|The {{source of}} the {{returned}} water {{was one of the}} lower ponds, the <b>Boring</b> <b>Mill</b> Pool. This was enlarged to provide a greater reservoir capacity, around the time this engine was installed. From here an underground passageway was dug, 0.8 km long to the engine house pump. Although this was heading up the dale, the passage had a slight fall to the North, to encourage the water flow. At the pump shaft, the shaft was now 120 ft deep. This tunnel was just {{one of a number of}} culverts, sluices and similar works built at the Coalbrookdale site around this time.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "vertical turret lathe" [...] (VTL) {{is applied}} to {{machines}} wherein the same essential design of the horizontal version is upended, which allows the headstock {{to sit on the}} floor and the faceplate to become a horizontal rotating table, analogous to a huge potter's wheel. This is useful for the handling of very large, heavy, short workpieces.

In 1579 it was leased by Henry and Thomas Darrell to Thomas Dyke, with Brattle having {{an interest in the}} property. In 1588 the furnace was leased by William Ashburnham and sub-leased to Thomas Johnson, a gun-founder. In 1596 the furnace was owned by Sir Thomas Waller, and leased to John Iden and Robert Pothill. The furnace was leased by Thomas Browne in 1604 and later by John Browne, who held the office of King's Gunfounder from 1615 to 1681. Some 200 men were employed at the furnace in 1613. The furnace was working to at least 1667 and in 1744 there was a <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> run by one Harrison.|$|E
50|$|Between 1673 and 1678, boiling {{houses were}} {{built on the}} edge of the moor for the Sülze Saltworks, because the bogs in the {{vicinity}} of Sülze had been exhausted. Two salt houses were constructed here, each with two salt pans and a graduation tower, 200 m long and 7 m high. A <b>boring</b> <b>mill</b> was also built to manufacture water pipes from tree trunks. Peat was delivered by boat along canals excavated for the purpose. The brine was transported in wooden pipes from Sülze. As early as 1719 the first discussions were held about moving the boiling sites again because Bornrieth Moor had been exhausted. In 1723 the new pipeline to the Scheuer Bruch was ready and in 1725 brine was boiled in the newly established village of Altensalzkoth.|$|E
