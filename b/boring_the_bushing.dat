5000|$|The Tower {{contains}} a [...] "Peal of Bells", {{the largest of}} which (the tenor bell) bears the symbol of <b>the</b> burning <b>bush.</b> <b>The</b> tower bells were manufactured by John Taylor & Co in Loughborough, England, and were donated by Miss Amy Ethel Maud Peirson in memory of deceased members of her family. At {{the time of its}} construction St Andrew's reputedly was the first Presbyterian Church in Australia, and one of only seven Presbyterian Churches in the world, to have a carillon. It was also {{believed to be the first}} Presbyterian Church in Australia to have a bell that <b>bore</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterian symbol of <b>the</b> burning <b>bush.</b> <b>The</b> bells have since become a local feature and their ring can be heard throughout the central business district and surrounding suburbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{proceeding}} farther, let {{us consider}} the supposed scene of the assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule. This thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road. Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool. On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief, were also here found. <b>The</b> handkerchief <b>bore</b> <b>the</b> name, 'Marie Rogêt.' Fragments of dress were seen on the branches around. The earth was trampled, <b>the</b> <b>bushes</b> were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent struggle.|$|R

2500|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} some years before <b>the</b> accident, <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> at Station 143 {{had been pushed}} upwards so the chamfer and 0.055-inch (1.40mm) of the parallel-sided portion protruded beyond the upper surface of the boom. [...] The exposed end of <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> was then struck with a conical tool applied to <b>the</b> <b>bore.</b> [...] This action slightly flared the exposed end and left the external diameter 0.0038 inch (0.097mm) oversize. <b>The</b> <b>bush</b> was then pushed upwards {{out of the hole}} and re-inserted from the lower surface. [...] As <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> was being re-inserted its flared end broached the anodised material and a small amount of aluminium from the wall of the hole. [...] This broaching action scored the wall of the hole and left its diameter slightly oversize so <b>the</b> <b>bush</b> was not an interference fit anywhere except at its flared end. [...] Scoring of the wall of the hole and the absence of an interference fit left the inner lower boom vulnerable to developing fatigue cracks at Station 143.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> bimetal <b>bushing,</b> {{which is}} locked into <b>the</b> <b>bore</b> of <b>the</b> chock, {{has a high}} tin Babbitt lining in a steel shell. Loading of the bearing is always vertical, with the load bearing section {{at the top of}} the upper bearing and at the bottom of the lower bearing. The bearing lining is {{undercut}} on the horizontal centerline (the rebore) so that oil entering the bearing is drawn in by the rotation and eccentricity of the journal. Oil is generally supplied to the rebore following the minimum film thickness, then drawn through the unloaded half of <b>the</b> <b>bushing</b> before entering <b>the</b> load zone, where the hydrodynamic oil film and pressure field are formed. The total oil flow is specified to optimize the cooling of the bearing. Oil flow and feed pressure are specified for each individual mill during the design phase and each mill has specific documentation defining these parameters.|$|R
