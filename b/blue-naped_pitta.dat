25|$|Atypically for {{forest floor}} species, the plumage of pittas is often bright and colourful. Only one species, the eared pitta, has entirely cryptic colours in the adults of both sexes. In the same genus, Hydrornis, are three further species with quite drabber than average plumage, the <b>blue-naped</b> <b>pitta,</b> blue-rumped pitta and rusty-naped pitta. Like the other Hydrornis pittas they are sexually dimorphic in their plumage, with the females tending towards being drabber and more cryptic than the males. Across {{most of the}} family the {{brighter}} colours tend {{to be on the}} undersides, with the bright colours on the rump, wings and uppertail coverts being concealable. Being able to conceal bright colours from above is important as most predators approach from above.|$|E
