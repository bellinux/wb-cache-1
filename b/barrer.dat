25|$|Forfang {{made his}} {{international}} debut in November 2001, with a seventh and eleventh place in two Continental Cup events in Kuusamo. He {{followed up with}} a seventh place in Lahti one month later, {{as well as several}} good results after New Year, including a third place in Courchevel in January. He had made his WorldCup debut in Predazzo in December, and achieved a fourteenth place in Hakuba and a seventh place in Sapporo in January. The 2002–03 season saw Forfang continue his good Continental Cup run, with a double victory in Zakopane in February. However, he did not make it to the final of any World Cup event, the closest being two 32nd places. He did win a silver medal at the Norwegian normal hill championships, albeit in the absence of Romøren, Pettersen, Ljøkelsøy and Bystøl. In the 2003–04 season he only competed in one World Cup event, and achieved a second place as the best result in the Continental Cup. Citing personal problems as well as economic hardships (there was little money to be made from the sport), he stated that he had contemplated retirement; however, in March 2004 he made progress as he broke the 200-metre <b>barrer</b> in the hill Vikersundbakken. He was the first person from Northern Norway to achieve this feat.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} July, Wilson {{left the}} film because of {{scheduling}} conflicts {{brought on by the}} filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and Kevin Weisman were cut in McKay's revised script. Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco. The next month, Reed revealed that Scott Lang's daughter would appear in the film, and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew <b>Barrer</b> were hired to make further revisions to the script. Eric Pearson, a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the Marvel One-Shot films, did uncredited work on the film as well. After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was [...] "pulled" [...] more into the MCU than Wright's version which [...] "was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films." [...] She added that, while Wright's version was [...] "incredible" [...] and would have been great to film and watch, [...] "it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built." ...|$|E
