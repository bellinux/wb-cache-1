5|$|The {{combined}} {{population of}} brown and Peruvian pelicans {{is estimated at}} 650,000 birds, with around 250,000 in the United States and Caribbean, and 400,000 in Peru. The National Audubon Society estimates the global population of the <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> at 300,000. Numbers of <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> plummeted in the 1950s and 1960s, largely {{as a consequence of}} environmental DDT pollution, and the species was listed as endangered in the US in 1970. With restrictions on DDT use in the US from 1972, its population has recovered, and it was delisted in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the area}} around Green Lake there are forests of pecan, black willow, cedar, American elm, {{hackberry}} and green ash. To the south, the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife Management Area serves as a wetland habitat for thousands of permanent egrets, and other birds, including the <b>brown</b> <b>pelican,</b> reddish egret, white-faced ibis, wood stork, bald eagle, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, and the whooping crane. American alligators reside in the area as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{following}} the major decline in <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> numbers in Louisiana from DDT poisoning, 500 pelicans were imported from Florida to augment and re-establish the population; over 300 subsequently died in April and May 1975 from poisoning by the pesticide endrin. About 14,000 pelicans, including 7500 American white pelicans, perished from botulism after eating {{fish from the}} Salton Sea in 1990. In 1991 abnormal numbers of brown pelicans and Brandt's cormorants died at Santa Cruz, California, when their food fish (anchovies) were contaminated with neurotoxic domoic acid, produced by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia.|$|E

5|$|DDT {{pollution}} in the environment was {{a major cause of}} decline of <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> populations in North America in the 1950s and 1960s. It entered the oceanic food web, contaminating and accumulating in several species, including one of the pelican’s primary food fish – the northern anchovy. Its metabolite DDE is a reproductive toxicant in pelicans and many other birds, causing eggshell thinning and weakening, and consequent breeding failure through the eggs being accidentally crushed by brooding birds. Since an effective ban on the use of DDT was implemented in the US in 1972, the eggshells of breeding brown pelicans there have thickened and their populations have largely recovered.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans have mainly light-coloured plumage, the {{exceptions}} being the brown and Peruvian pelicans. The bills, pouches and bare facial skin of all species become brighter before breeding season commences. The throat pouch of the Californian subspecies of the <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> turns bright red, and fades to yellow after {{the eggs are}} laid, while the throat pouch of the Peruvian pelican turns blue. The American white pelican grows a prominent knob on its bill that is shed once females have laid eggs. The plumage of immature pelicans is darker than that of adults. Newly hatched chicks are naked and pink, darkening to grey or black after 4 to 14 days, then developing a covering of white or grey down.|$|E
5|$|A diverse {{collection}} of birds {{sustained by the}} water life, such as the black skimmer, <b>brown</b> <b>pelican,</b> great blue heron, egret, laughing gull, roseate spoonbill, tern, and the white ibis, {{can be found in}} the bay, especially near the mouth of Rincon Bayou. Local efforts by the Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries program have benefited bird populations by adding crushed oyster shells to the bay's small islands for improved nesting conditions, and the restoration of marsh near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase fish populations to satisfy the birds' dietary requirements. At the nearby Nueces Delta Preserve, countless birds have been observed, as well as bobcats, coyotes, feral hogs, mountain lions, rattlesnakes, Texas spiny lizards, western diamondbacks and white-tailed deer.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{movements}} and habitat use of <b>Brown</b> <b>Pelicans</b> (Pelecanus occidentalis) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We attached satellite transmitters to 18 adult <b>Brown</b> <b>Pelicans</b> (nine males, nine females) that were captured on Grand Isle along the Louisiana coast during 31 August- 2 September 2010. Their movements and habitat use were tracked between September 2010 and March 2012. Nine of the <b>Brown</b> <b>Pelicans</b> remained proximate to the Louisiana coast; four ranged along the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana; three moved from Louisiana to Texas; and two migrated across the Gulf of Mexico to the Yucatan Peninsula. Annual 99 % home range estimates varied widely (= 10, 611 km 2, SE = 2, 370), and males had larger ranges (= 15, 088 km 2, SE = 2, 219) than females (= 6, 133 km 2, SE = 1, 764). Habitats used by <b>Brown</b> <b>Pelicans</b> were primarily open water, estuarine emergent wetland, grassland, unconsolidated shore, and deep water habitat types...|$|R
50|$|Other threats include {{damage from}} the {{activity}} of nesting <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans,</b> erosion, and introduced plant species.|$|R
5|$|Healthy {{pelicans}} {{can usually}} {{cope with their}} lice, but sick birds may carry hundreds of individuals, which hastens their demise. The pouch louse Piagetiella peralis, which occurs in the pouch and therefore cannot be removed by preening, is usually not a serious problem, even when present in such numbers that it covers the whole interior of the pouch, but sometimes inflammation and bleeding may harm the host. The <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> has a similarly extensive range of parasites. The nematodes Contracaecum multipapillatum and C. mexicanum and the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae have caused illness and mortality in the Puerto Rican population, possibly endangering the pelican on this island. In May 2012, hundreds of Peruvian pelicans {{were reported to have}} perished in Peru from a combination of starvation and roundworm infestation.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, $1 {{million of}} federal {{stimulus}} money was delegated to {{the restoration of}} the marshland near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase the population of birds and fish. The Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service collaborated to place soil and plant marsh near the causeway to allow a larger nursing location for fish and provide greater quantities of food for water birds. Over 490 species of birds have been found in the area including the <b>brown</b> <b>pelican,</b> black-billed whistling duck, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, pauraque, buff-bellied hummingbird, golden-fronted woodpecker, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, Neotropic cormorant, laughing gull, Franklin's gull, ring-billed gull, herring gull, gull-billed tern, common loon, brown-crested flycatcher, hooded oriole, peregrine falcon and piping plover. Bird populations are protected and can be viewed at the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge on Oso Bay.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Madre {{is home to}} more finfish than {{anywhere}} else on the Texas coast, with such species as blue catfish, hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, black drum, red drum, southern flounder, alligator gar, houndfish, crevalle jack, southern kingfish, ladyfish, Atlantic midshipman, mojarras, striped mullet, pinfish, Florida pompano, smooth butterfly ray, spotted seatrout, blacktip shark, sheepshead, bigmouth sleeper, gray snapper, common snook, southern stargazer, southern stingray and tripletail. Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75% of all redhead ducks. Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon, piping plover, roseate spoonbill, long-billed curlew, crane, egret and the <b>brown</b> <b>pelican.</b> Sea turtles and dolphins {{can be found in}} the bay, while cattle, white-tailed deer, nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore.|$|E

5|$|The {{great white}} pelican is the {{national}} bird of Romania. The <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> {{is the national}} bird of three Caribbean countries—Saint Kitts and Nevis, Barbados and Sint Maarten—and features on their coats of arms. It is also the state bird of the US state of Louisiana, which is known colloquially as the Pelican State; the bird appears on the state flag and state seal. It adorns the seals of Louisiana State University and Tulane University, and is the mascot of the New Orleans Pelicans NBA team, Tulane University, and the University of the West Indies. A white pelican logo {{is used by the}} Portuguese bank Montepio Geral, and a pelican is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian 1 lek coin, issued in 1996. The name and image were used for Pelican Books, an imprint of non-fiction books published by Penguin Books. The seal of the Packer Collegiate Institute, a pelican feeding her young, has been in use since 1885.|$|E
5|$|Saint Charles Bay {{serves as}} a habitat for {{approximately}} 300 species of birds. Birders venture to the site between November and March, when the creatures winter near the bay. The endangered whooping crane, the largest bird in North America, is the most highly prized sight as {{only a few hundred}} remain, including three families on St. Charles Bay. The bird was near extinction in the early 20th century, as only two flocks between Canada and Texas remained. The population increased following the organization of the Aransas Migratory Waterfowl Refuge in 1937, after the Federal government purchased the land of the St. Charles ranch from San Antonio oilman Leroy G. Denman, using funds from commemorative stamps. The Refuge later became known as the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. Whooping cranes are also protected by Goose Island State Park, which was established by the State of Texas in 1931. Other birds that migrate to the bay include the sandhill crane, American white pelican, <b>brown</b> <b>pelican,</b> roseate spoonbill, great blue heron and Canada goose. The blue crab and other shellfish, help sustain the bird population. Thirty seven species of mammals are found on Blackjack peninsula, including white-tailed deer, nine-banded armadillos and collared peccaries. The spotted seatrout and redfish are the common finfish that reside in the bay. While trout are generally found in the bay's deeper waters, redfish live in shallow waters; their tail fins can be spotted above the surface during the peak summer and fall months. The bay also supports a healthy population of American alligators, which reside in shallow waters. Signs alert visitors to be careful.|$|E
25|$|However, on December 4, 2012, it was {{reported}} that the Hornets would change their name to the New Orleans Pelicans beginning with the 2013–14 season. The team name is inspired by Louisiana's state bird, the <b>brown</b> <b>pelican.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Aviary: about 13 {{species of}} birds that inhabit the State of Sinaloa are displayed: peacocks, mallards, white <b>pelicans,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans,</b> quails, pichichin ducks, white wing doves, and others.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans</b> {{is a very}} gregarious bird; {{it lives}} in flocks of both sexes {{throughout}} the year. It is exceptionally buoyant due to the internal air sacks beneath its skin and in its bones, and it is as graceful {{in the air as}} clumsy on land. In level flight, the <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans</b> fly in groups, with their heads held back on their shoulders and the bills resting on their folded necks. They may fly in a [...] "V", but usually in regular lines or single file, often low over the water's surface.|$|R
50|$|The IBA was {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because it supports a small breeding colony of least terns as well as populations of common terns and <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans.</b>|$|R
25|$|The zoo {{features}} {{several species}} of parrots, owls, and raptors, {{as well as a}} wetland aviary.

5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans</b> had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans</b> had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|R
5000|$|Nesting {{birds are}} a common sight along the rocky coast line. [...] The two cays have been {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of their breeding seabirds. These include red-billed tropicbirds, <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans,</b> <b>brown</b> boobies, laughing gulls and least terns. Brown noddies and bridled terns also occur. Resident landbirds include Caribbean elaenias and yellow warblers.|$|R
50|$|The Satilla {{enters the}} Atlantic Ocean about 10 mi south of Brunswick, at the 31st {{parallel}} north. Satilla River Marsh Island {{is one of}} the few places in Georgia for observing nesting sites of <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many {{varieties}} of seabirds and waterfowl also call it home, including seagulls, cormorants, willets, sandpipers, oystercatchers, guillemots and many others. Andrew Molera State Park has over 350 {{different species of}} birds. The peregrine falcon, <b>brown</b> <b>pelican,</b> Brandt's cormorant and other seabirds are very easy to see along the coast.

25|$|Unlike the <b>brown</b> <b>pelican</b> (P. occidentalis), the American {{white pelican}} does not dive for its food. Instead it catches its prey while swimming. Each bird eats more than 4 pounds of food a day, mostly fish such as Cypriniformes like Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Lahontan Tui chub (Gila bicolor obesa) and shiners, Perciformes like Sacramento perch (Archoplites interruptus) or Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), Salmoniformes like Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Siluriformes (catfish), and jackfish. Other animals eaten by these birds are {{crayfish}} and amphibians, and sometimes larval salamanders. Birds nesting on saline lakes, where food is scarce, will travel great distances to better feeding grounds.|$|E
50|$|Species {{found at}} Lake Jackson and the {{surrounding}} watershed are the snowy egret, little blue heron, wood stork, bald eagle, least tern, American alligator and round-tailed muskrat. <b>Brown</b> <b>pelicans,</b> rare inland, have also been found on occasion.|$|R
50|$|Pelican Island {{was a small}} {{uninhabited}} {{island that}} once existed off {{the west coast of}} Bridgetown and Fontabelle, in St. Michael, Barbados. According to historical record, the island received its name from <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans</b> that would nest there.|$|R
50|$|Fauna in {{the reserve}} include harpy eagles, three-toed sloths, capybaras, {{bottlenose}} dolphins, crocodiles, jaguar, and humpback whales. Bird species include black oropendola, <b>brown</b> <b>pelicans,</b> frigate birds, terns, oystercatchers, willet, whimbrel, and spotted sandpiper, kingfishers, white ibis, heron, and laughing gulls.|$|R
