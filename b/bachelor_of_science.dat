The criteria, indicators and levels <b>of</b> competence <b>of</b> <b>bachelors</b> <b>of</b> computer <b>science</b> concerning the use of OSNTs are defined and the model of its formation is developed. The main components of OSNTs using technique for future <b>bachelors</b> <b>of</b> computer <b>science</b> are described and its effectiveness is experimentally verified. The experimental implementation of the study results showed that the use of OSNTs in training <b>of</b> <b>bachelors</b> <b>of</b> computer <b>science</b> based on the developed technique promotes the competence formation <b>of</b> <b>bachelors</b> <b>of</b> computer <b>science</b> concerning the use of OSNTs...|$|R
