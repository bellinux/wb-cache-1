6000|$|Mark Twain's {{interest}} {{in history and}} in the depiction of historical periods and characters is revealed through his fondness for historical reading in preference to fiction, and through his other historical writings. Even in the hilarious, youthful days in San Francisco, Paine reports that [...] "Clemens, however, was never quite ready for sleep. Then, as ever, he would prop himself up in <b>bed,</b> <b>light</b> his pipe, and lose himself in English or French history until his sleep conquered." [...] Paine tells us, too, that Lecky's 'European Morals' was an old favorite.|$|E
60|$|Thereupon Cesare withdrew to Forli with 150 lances and 2,500 foot, {{and here}} he affords a proof of his considerateness. The town had already endured several occupations and the severities of being the seat of war during the siege of the citadel. Cesare was {{determined}} that it should feel the present occupation as little as possible; so he issued an order to the inhabitants upon whom his soldiers were billeted to supply the men only with <b>bed,</b> <b>light,</b> and fire. What more they required must be paid for, and, to avoid disputes as to prices of victuals and other necessaries, he ordered the Council {{to draw up a}} tariff, and issued an edict forbidding his soldiers, under pain of death, from touching any property of the townsfolk. Lest they should doubt his earnestness, he hanged two of his soldiers on December 7--a Piedmontese and a Gascon--and on the 13th a third, all from the windows of his own palace, and all with a label hanging from their feet proclaiming that they had been hanged for taking goods of others in spite of the ban of the Lord Duke, etc.|$|E
60|$|Eva's bed-room was {{a spacious}} apartment, which, {{like all the}} other rooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah. The room communicated, on one side, with her father and mother's apartment; on the other, with that {{appropriated}} to Miss Ophelia. St. Clare had gratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was intended. The windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in Paris, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of rose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses. The bedstead, chairs, and lounges, were of bamboo, wrought in peculiarly graceful and fanciful patterns. Over the head of the bed was an alabaster bracket, on which a beautiful sculptured angel stood, with drooping wings, holding out a crown of myrtle-leaves. From this depended, over the <b>bed,</b> <b>light</b> curtains of rose-colored gauze, striped with silver, supplying that protection from mosquitos which is an indispensable addition to all sleeping accommodation in that climate. The graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of rose-colored damask, while over them, depending from the hands of sculptured figures, were gauze curtains {{similar to those of the}} bed. A light, fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room, where a Parian vase, wrought in the shape of a white lily, with its buds, stood, ever filled with flowers. On this table lay Eva's books and little trinkets, with an elegantly wrought alabaster writing-stand, which her father had supplied to her when he saw her trying to improve herself in writing. There was a fireplace in the room, and on the marble mantle above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of Jesus receiving little children, and on either side marble vases, for which it was Tom's pride and delight to offer bouquets every morning. Two or three exquisite paintings of children, in various attitudes, embellished the wall. In short, the eye could turn nowhere without meeting images of childhood, of beauty, and of peace. Those little eyes never opened, in the morning light, without falling on something which suggested to the heart soothing and beautiful thoughts.|$|E

50|$|Homasote is {{frequently}} used by model railroading for the sub-roadbed or roadbed, {{because of its}} noise-deadening qualities, ease of forming into shapes used as roadbed for tracks, ease of driving nails to hold track sections to the <b>bed,</b> <b>light</b> weight and retention of form under plaster scenery. Cork, plywood, hardboard, drywall, and foam insulation are common alternatives to Homasote.|$|E
5000|$|Quigley Stadium is {{a stadium}} in West Haven, Connecticut, United States. It was {{originally}} built in 1947 from surplus bleachers {{that were once}} installed on flat <b>bed</b> <b>light</b> rail cars and towed alongside the Yale crew team as they competed off of nearby Orange Avenue. Maurice P. Quigley purchased these surplus bleachers off the rail cars and had them hauled approximately 1 mile to the current site which gave the field a capacity of 2,000 people. It opened on June 20, 1947. [...] It was originally called Exhibition Stadium but subsequently renamed for Maurice P. Quigley, who built the ballpark and owned the semi-professional West Haven Sailors who played there, as well as Ship's Tavern in West Haven, a popular hangout among sports fans. [...] Quigley sold the ballpark to the Town of West Haven in 1951.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{original}} buildings was a large log cabin. The interior of the cabin, including the accessories, was built entirely from logs and branches of trees. The <b>beds,</b> <b>light</b> fixtures, towel racks, door openers, even the toilet paper holders, are made from logs and tree branches. These pieces were gathered by the brother of Elbert Hubbard, of Roycroft fame, who spent untold hours walking through the woods looking for branches of just the right shape for various purposes in the cabin.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some of the}} justifications and {{excuses for}} committing rape; and why these linguistic strategies occur and are used. The {{data were collected from}} a feminist sociological doctoral research project which explored of the language used by convicted rapists serving sentences in an English prison. Six men were interviewed over a period of six months. Life History interviews were undertaken which were on average 2 ½ hours each, with each man interviewed an average of 5 times each, and due to their ‘open’ nature, the interviews amassed vast amounts of data. Four of the men raped current or former partners; the remaining two raped strangers. One of whom was a sex worker in a <b>‘red</b> <b>light</b> district’; the other woman was raped in her own home. This paper draws on the narratives of two of the participants: Andrew and Eddie. Andrew raped a stranger who was a sex worker in a local <b>‘red</b> <b>light</b> district’, whilst Eddie raped his partner six times in one night. The paper explores how in reconstructing a post-conviction identity, the men draw on constructing justifications and excuses for their rapacious behaviour to linguistically exonerate them from wearing the badge of dishonour that announces their status ‘rapists’, or ‘guilty’. In order for them to do so, they must re-frame the protagonist as the victim, who ultimately, in their view, is responsible for the men’s downfall in ‘respectability’...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of context in constituting health is recognized as a key challenge facing contemporary health psychology. However, few models or theories are available which pinpoint the processes linking individual health with community or societal contexts. This article draws on dialogical and sociocultural psychological theory, to make context concrete by proposing the concepts of ‘mediating moments’ and ‘reflected mediating moments’. These concepts are further developed through their application to the empirical case of the constitution of condom use in sex-worker–client interactions in Calcutta. Interviews and group discussions with sex workers and other <b>‘red</b> <b>light</b> area’ residents are interpreted to examine at what moments the societal phenomena of poverty and gender relations come to mediate condom use behaviour...|$|R

The coverlid was drawn carefully up over the pillow, but it moulded {{the outline of a}} human body lying motionless; and when he dashed forward and flung aside the sheets, he beheld the blond young man whom he had seen in the Bullier Ball the night before, his eyes open and without speculation, his face swollen and blackened, and a thin stream of blood trickling from his nostrils.|$|R

That she arose thereupon, muffled herself up in a wrapper, put on her shoes, and went out on the staircase, much surprised, to look for Jeremiah.|$|R

5|$|The {{area was}} the focus of a Portland Development Commission urban renewal based on a 1982 master plan, {{becoming}} an urban renewal district in 1985, and expiring in July 2008. The park blocks underwent serious renovations in 1987, adding plazas, large flower <b>beds,</b> <b>lighting</b> and irrigation, and newly paved sidewalks. Several apartment complexes specifically aimed at the middle class were built, including the University Park Apartments (125 units, $10.5 million, quickly sold and converted to condos), South Park Square Apartments (184 units, $16 million, completed May 1988), and Tom Mesher's Gallery Park Apartments (31 units, $3 million). In 1987, the New Theater Building of the Portland Center for the Performing Arts was completed immediately next door to the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall. The South Park Blocks Association, a commercial and institutional association, was started at that time, to attract residents and consumers to the area and to address security concerns.|$|R

We also discuss how patterns of walking and waiting mediated by this reading of the environment contribute to the emergence and persistence of a ‘beat’ space...|$|R
