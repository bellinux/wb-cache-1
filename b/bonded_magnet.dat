40|$|In the {{preparation}} of a miniaturized rotor, a composite <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> was fabricated {{by taking advantage of}} self-recoverability. A preformed magnet was synthesized by using incomplete three-dimensional network molecular structure which was formed under the optimum conditions at a temperature of 433 K, an alignment field of 1. 4 MA/m, and a low compacting pressure of 50 MPa, respectively. The preformed ones were extruded and compressed into a ring-shaped magnet by using the self-recoverability at a pressure of 200 MPa and a temperature of 423 K under non-alignment-field. Through the process, a composite <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> rotor {{in the shape of a}} ring could be prepared without a bonding layer.

40|$|Both {{analytical}} and computational methods have been, {{for the first}} time, employed to study the demagnetising factors for bonded magnets. The demagnetising factors for bonded NdFeB magnets are dependent on the external shape of the <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet,</b> the shapes of magnetic particles, the magnetic loading percentage and the distributions of magnetic particles. Particularly, {{it has been shown}} that the demagnetising factor along the length of an infinitely long <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> is not equal to zero but that it also depends on the shapes of the magnetic particles, magnetic loading percentage and the distribution of magnetic particles. However, the sum of the demagnetising factors along the x, y and z directions is, as expected, unity for all bonded magnets. The demagnetising factor for a fully dense magnet, which is dependent only on the external shape of the magnet, can be considered as a special case of bonded magnets in which the magnetic loading is 100 %. Simplified formulae for calculating the demagnetising factors for simple shaped magnets such as cuboid, cylindroid and ellipsoid shapes were obtained and the values are in reasonable agreement with precise analytical solutions. A Lorentz ''sphere'' concept has, for the first time, been employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for hollow magnets and bonded NdFeB magnets. The simplified formulae for hollow magnets and bonded magnets were derived. Computer programmes based on the basic energy method were developed and employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> models, such as a one-dimensional NdFeB ribbon array, two-dimensional bonded magnets and three-dimensional bonded magnets. A finite difference method and a finite element method have been, for the first time, employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for two-dimensional <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> models and the results are comparable with those obtained using the basic energy method. Procedures for calculating demagnetising curves (J vs H) for bonded magnets were developed. The calculated demagnetising curves for bonded magnets, based on these procedures, are in reasonable agreement with experimental results.

The performence of a Runge-Kutta method and a semi-implicit backward difference method for the time integration of the Gilbert equation of motion are compared. In an array of closely packed patterned elements, the magnetostatic interactions lead to a spread in the switching field depending on the magnetic state of the neighbors.

The R element is chosen to develop high anisotropy parameters {{and a small}} amount of a light element X (e. g. B, C, N) is present to stabilize the axial crystal structure and (or) to reinforce the two previous intrinsic characteristics (magnetization and anisotropy). Three main families of hard magnet materials, effective and potential, are derived from Nd(2) Fe(14) B, Sm(2) Fe(17) N(3) and Nd(Fe,M) (12) N structure types.

Recent additions of titanium carbide and zirconium to the permanent magnet (PM) alloy design in HPGA powder (using He atomization gas) {{have made it}} possible to achieve highly refined microstructures with magnetic properties approaching melt spun particulate at cooling rates of 105 - 106 K/s. By producing HPGA powders with the desirable qualities of melt spun ribbon, the need for crushing ribbon was eliminated in <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> fabrication. The spherical geometry of HPGA powders is more ideal for processing of bonded permanent magnets since higher loading fractions can be obtained during compression and injection molding. This increased volume loading of spherical PM powder can be predicted to yield a higher maximum energy product (BH) max for bonded magnets in high performance applications.;Passivation of RE-containing powder is warranted for the large-scale manufacturing of bonded magnets in applications with increased temperature and exposure to humidity. Irreversible magnetic losses due to oxidation and corrosion of particulates is a known drawback of RE-Fe-B based alloys during further processing, e. g. injection molding, as well as during use as a <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet.</b> To counteract these effects, a modified gas atomization chamber allowed for a novel approach to in situ passivation of solidified particle surfaces through injection of a reactive gas, nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3). The ability to control surface chemistry during atomization processing of fine spherical RE-Fe-B powders produced advantages over current processing methodologies. In particular, the capability to coat particles while 2 ̆ 2 in flight 2 ̆ 2 may eliminate the need for post atomization treatment, otherwise a necessary step for oxidation and corrosion resistance. Stability of these thin films was attributed to the reduction of each RE 2 ̆ 7 s respective oxide during processing; recognizing that fluoride compounds exhibit a slightly higher (negative) free energy driving force for formation. Formation of RE-type fluorides on the surface was evidenced through x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

40|$|Project Summary Transportation energy usage is {{predicted}} to increase substantially by 2020. Hybrid vehicles and fuel cell powered vehicles are destined to become more prominent as fuel prices rise with the demand. Hybrid and fuel cell vehicle platforms are both dependent on high performance electric motors. Electric motors for transportation duty will require sizeable low-speed torque to accelerate the vehicle. As motor speed increases, the torque requirement decreases which results in a nearly constant power motor output. Interior permanent magnet synchronous motors (IPMSM) are well suited for this duty.,, These rotor geometries are configured in straight lines and semi circular arc shapes. These designs are of limited configurations {{because of the lack}} of availability of permanent magnets of any other shapes at present. We propose to fabricate rotors via a novel processing approach where we start with magnet powders and compact them into a net shape rotor in a single step. Using this approach, widely different rotor designs can be implemented for efficiency. The current limitation on magnet shape and thickness will be eliminated. This is accomplished by co-filling magnet and soft iron powders at specified locations in intricate shapes using specially designed dies and automatic powder filling station. The process fundamentals for accomplishing occurred under a previous Applied Technology Program titled, ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂMotors and Generators for the 21 st CenturyÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ. New efficient motor designs that are not currently possible (or cost prohibitive) can be accomplished by this approach. Such an approach to motor fabrication opens up a new dimension in motor design. Feasibility Results We were able to optimize a IPMSM rotor to take advantage of the powder co-filling and DMC compaction processing methods. The minimum low speed torque requirement of 5 N-m can be met through an optimized design with magnet material having a Br capability of 0. 2 T. This level of magnetic performance can be met with a variety of <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> compositions. The torque ripple was found to drop significantly by using thinner magnet segments. The powder co-filling and subsequent compaction processing allow for thinner magnet structures to be formed. Torque ripple can be further reduced by using skewing and pole shaping techniques.

40|$|Turbomolecular pumps {{require a}} motor {{to drive them}} at speeds of up to 90, 000 rpm. These {{high-speed}} motors are typically brushless permanent magnet motors that are specifically designed for the application. Intellectual property rights over the design lock the company into one single supplier. Also low manufacturing volumes make the motor expensive to produce. To stay competitive continuous cost reductions or product improvements are necessary. This can only be achieved by looking at new materials, alternative manufacturing methods and simplified assembly processes. The aim of this project is to replace an existing laminated, high-speed (60, 000 rpm) motor with a new low-cost design. Special considerations need {{to be given to}} the motor design with regards to minimising losses due to the high operating speed {{and the fact that the}} motor operates in a vacuum. A machine design employing a simple, 3 -tooth segmented stator made from soft magnetic composites (SMC) and using non-overlapping coils, and a `deep' plastic <b>bonded</b> <b>magnet</b> on the rotor is proposed to deliver low rotor losses and low manufacturing costs. Four SMC prototype motors have been built, which have led to the following discoveries: (1) Bulk eddy currents in the SMC material cannot be neglected and need to be taken into account separately as a function of the actual component size and shape. (2) A process is suggested to improve the iron loss calculation in SMC, which is evaluated against the prototypes built. (3) SMC material properties are adversely affected by prototype machining, leading to higher iron losses than initially expected. (4) The segmented SMC design has proven to be commercially very attractive. During testing a large sensitivity of the magnetically supported pump shaft to the inherent unbalanced magnetic pull (UMP) force of the 3 -tooth, 2 -pole design was discovered. This led to a practical and theoretical study into the effects of UMP in this application. An alternative design that avoided the inherent UMP was required, and a 6 - tooth, 4 -pole motor has been designed and built. For reasons of minimising risks laminations were chosen as the stator material rather than SMC. Test results of this motor in the pump have been successful and the motor has been selected to go into the next generation of turbomolecular pumps.

40|$|Purpose: {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{presents}} results of corrosion wear of bonded and sintered hard magneticmaterials Nd-Fe-B and magnets covered by protective polymer, lacquer and metal coatings. Design/methodology/approach: Corrosion tests were made in two corrosive environments in water and in 5 %NaCl solution. Findings: It {{was found that the}} <b>bonded</b> <b>magnets</b> with the polymer matrix demonstrate better corrosion resistancethan the sintered magnets. Employment of the protective coatings on the Nd-Fe-B <b>bonded</b> <b>magnets</b> surfaces mayfeature the effective protection of the substrate material from the corrosive action of the aggressive agent. Practical implications: Magnets covered by protective polymer, lacquer or metal coating are less susceptible tocorrosion so employment of these coatings can lower the losses caused by the corrosion of magnets. Corrosionprotection of Nd-Fe-B magnets needs further investigations. Originality/value: Analysis of the surface topography of the deposited protective coatings makes it possible todetermine coating defects resulting from the action of the aggressive agent. The obtained results can be use inpractice to decrease the corrosion wear of these materials...|$|R

The values of charge transfer resistance of materials made of powder coated with binder (encapsulation with epoxy resin) in relation to the value of the resistance of materials made of powder after biencapsulation (with NiP/epoxy resin, phosphate/epoxy resin) are larger, reflecting the inhibition of corrosion.

40|$|A {{major factor}} {{limiting}} {{the use and}} longevity of rare earth based magnetic materials is their susceptibility to aqueous corrosion and associated detrimental effects upon the magnetic properties of the material. This process was investigated {{through a combination of}} exposure to simulated environmental conditions and hydrogen absorption/desorption studies (HADS) in conjunction with magnetic characterisation. This study utilises NdFeB MQP-B melt-spun ribbon manufactured by Magnequench, in the form of MQI <b>bonded</b> <b>magnets</b> and also in its unbonded state as MQ powder. Specifically, it was concerned with how effective a variety of bonding media (epoxy resin,PTFE, zinc) and surface coatings (PTFE, Qsil, zinc LPPS, Dex-Cool) were at limiting the impact of aqueous corrosion in MQI <b>bonded</b> <b>magnets.</b> To characterise the effect of hydrogen absorption upon the magnetic properties of the MQP-B, hydrogen uptake was induced followed by a series of outgassing heat treatments with subsequent magnetic characterisation accompanied by HADS techniques performed after each outgas. This allowed comparisons to be made between the effects of aqueous corrosion process and hydrogen absorption upon the magnetic properties of the alloy. This study has clearly demonstrated the link between the abundance of environmental moisture and rate of Hci losses in MQI <b>bonded</b> <b>magnets.</b> In addition to this the key mechanism responsible for the degradation of magnetic properties has been identified. These losses have been attributed to the absorption of hydrogen generated by the dissociation of water in the presence of NdFeB during the aqueous corrosion process. It has been shown that the use of a bonding media that is impermeable to water can limit the effects of aqueous corrosion by limiting water access to the Magnequench particles (MQP) and also the positive effects of the use of suitable surface coatings {{has been shown to be}} effective for the same reason...|$|R
