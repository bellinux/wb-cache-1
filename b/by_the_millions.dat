5|$|Amman is the 4th most visited Arab {{city and}} the ninth highest {{recipient}} of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city. The expansion of Queen Alia International Airport {{is an example of}} the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of annual visitors to the city.|$|E
5|$|Large fruitings of {{the fungus}} are often {{associated}} with damage to the host tree, such as that which occurs with burning. A field study conducted in Norway demonstrated that fruit bodies {{were more likely to}} be found in areas that were heavily burned, compared to locations with light to moderate burning where the trees remained viable, or in clearcut areas. Fruiting was much denser in spruce forests—with up to 700–1000 fruitbodies per square meter—than in pine forests, where fruitbodies were sporadic. Fruitbodies grew <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> in the year following the Yellowstone fires of 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{species in}} all {{probability}} {{has little or no}} direct impact or influence on human interests and concerns but agricultural and real estate development are a threat to the species' very narrow habitat. Collecting specimens in the dry ridges is complicated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of ants which eat the bait in the trap the moment it is set on the ground. Live collecting is the alternative, but the bait is usually digested by the time the animal is taken from the trap, making food research difficult if not impossible.|$|E

5|$|More than 11,000 years ago, prehistoric Native Americans lived {{along the}} Snake. Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> in the river. These fish were {{central to the}} lives of the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls. By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a Snake tributary, the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most {{powerful}} peoples in the region. Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans, which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement. Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin. At one point, a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake, giving the Snake River its name.|$|E
25|$|A {{particularly}} noteworthy {{annual event}} is the rising of fishflies, {{a kind of}} mayfly endemic to the Mississippi valley in the region. These are aquatic insects attracted to light, which rise <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> as adults to mate, only to die within hours.|$|E

25|$|Through this time, Raskin {{continually}} wrote memos {{about how}} the personal computer could become a true consumer appliance. While the Apple III was under development in 1978 and '79, Raskin was lobbying for Apple to create a radically different kind of computer that was designed from the start {{to be easy to}} use. In Computers <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Millions,</b> he stated that expandable computers like the Apple II were too complex, and development was difficult due to the unknown nature of the machine the program ran on. The machine he envisioned was very different from the Macintosh that was eventually released and had much more in common with PDAs than modern desktop-based machines.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of Portuguese in Brazil is {{a legacy of}} the Portuguese colonization of the Americas. The first wave of Portuguese-speaking immigrants settled in Brazil in the 16th century, but the language was not widely used then. For a time Portuguese coexisted with Língua Geral—a lingua franca based on Amerindian languages that was used by the Jesuit missionaries—as well as with various African languages spoken <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of slaves brought into the country between the 16th and 19th centuries. By the end of the 18th century, Portuguese had affirmed itself as the national language. Some of the main contributions to that swift change were the expansion of colonization to the Brazilian interior, and the growing numbers of Portuguese settlers, who brought their language and became the most important ethnic group in Brazil.|$|E

25|$|Before the Spanish {{discovered}} the New World (continental America), the deadly infections of smallpox, measles, and influenza were unheard of. The Native Americans {{did not have}} the immunities the Europeans developed through long contact with the diseases. Christopher Columbus ended the Americas' isolation in 1492 while sailing under the flag of Castile, Spain. Deadly epidemics swept across the Caribbean. Smallpox wiped out villages in a matter of months. The island of Hispaniola had a population of 250,000 Native Americans. 20 years later, the population had dramatically dropped to 6,000. 50 years later, it was estimated that approximately 500 Native Americans were left. Smallpox then spread to the area which is now Mexico where it then helped destroy the Aztec Empire. In the 1st century of Spanish rule in what is now Mexico, 1500–1600, Central and South Americans died <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions.</b> By 1650, the majority of New Spain (now Mexico) population had perished.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{construction}} {{and maintenance of}} existing lines was deferred, and graffiti and crime were very common. Trains frequently broke down, were poorly maintained, and were often late, while ridership declined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> each year. As {{in all of the}} city, crime was rampant in the subway in the 1970s. Thefts, robberies, shootings and killings became more frequent. The rolling stock was very often graffiti-painted or vandalism-damaged both inside and outside. As the New York City Police Department was completely overwhelmed, the public reacted with unease, and the subway was deliberately avoided. Around 1980, the reliability of the vehicles was a tenth of their reliability in the 1960s, and 40 percent of the network required speed restrictions. Because there had been no further studies of the subway since 1975, one third of the fleet was out of use during rush hours due to serious technical defects. In addition, signs were fitted incorrectly, and spare parts were missing or were bought in too large quantities, could not be found, or could not be installed due to lack of repairmen.|$|E
500|$|... "Deep Blue" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison, {{released as}} the B-side to his 1971 charity single [...] "Bangla Desh". Harrison wrote the song in 1970, midway through the recording sessions for All Things Must Pass, and recorded it in Los Angeles the following year while organising the Concert for Bangladesh. The composition {{was inspired by the}} deteriorating condition of his mother, Louise, before she succumbed to cancer in July 1970, and by Harrison's feelings of helplessness as he visited her in hospital in the north of England. Given the subject matter of his lyrics, [...] "Deep Blue" [...] also served to convey the suffering endured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of refugees from war-torn Bangladesh in 1971, as sickness and disease became widespread among their makeshift camps in northern India.|$|E

2500|$|Between the 17th and 18th century a florid woodcarving {{industry}} {{started in}} the Gardena valley, which is now located in the Italian province of South Tyrol. [...] A network of people from that valley traveled on foot to all European cities, {{as far as to}} Lisbon and Saint Petersburg, to sell the products of hundreds of carvers. Finally in the 19th century in Gardena, mainly wooden toys and dolls known also as Dutch dolls or penny dolls, were carved <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of pieces.

Sold and homemade <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions,</b> the inexpensive and reliable crystal radio was a major driving force in the introduction of radio to the public, contributing {{to the development of}} radio as an entertainment medium with the beginning of radio broadcasting around 1920.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{classroom}} {{scene of the}} film, the rapid employment of school desks, as an improvised shelter following the observance of the detonations light Flash, is primarily to offer protection from potential ballistic window glass lacerations when the slower moving blast wave arrived. However, in higher blast pressure zones, where partial-to-total building collapse may occur, it would also serve a similar role to that borne-out from experience in Urban search and rescue, where voids under the debris of collapsed buildings are common places for survivors to be found. More rigid examples of void-forming-tables to shelter under, include the [...] "Morrison indoor shelter", which was widely distributed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> in Britain as a protective measure against building collapse, brought about by blast pressures generated during the conventional bombing of cities in World War II.|$|E
2500|$|South Florida in the 1920s was {{experiencing}} an unprecedented population surge that was answered by {{real estate development}} and speculation. Coe {{was one of the}} victims of such speculation as he lost a significant investment. As a result of the land boom, portions of the Everglades began to be drained and turned into residential and business zones. Wading birds were slaughtered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> for their colorful feathers that were used in women's hats. Rare orchids were plucked from their habitats, and hunting of animals was unchecked. [...] Meetings of the Florida Society of Natural History began to focus on this destruction and how to prevent it and many ideas were floated about how to preserve a portion of the Everglades, resulting in the establishment of Royal Palm State Park in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|One famous stretch near Times Square, where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue {{in midtown}} Manhattan, {{is the home}} of many Broadway theatres, housing an ever-changing array of commercial, {{large-scale}} plays, particularly musicals. This area of Manhattan is often called the Theater District or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline [...] "Found on the Great White Way" [...] in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the New York Evening Telegram. The journalistic nickname was inspired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> of lights on theater marquees and billboard advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto red-light district in the 1960s and 1970s (as {{can be seen in the}} films Taxi Driver and Midnight Cowboy), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being Disneyfied following the company's purchase and renovation of the New Amsterdam Theatre on 42nd Street in 1993.|$|E
