5000|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These types of welds require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a butt weld are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of welding material possible. <b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as submerged-arc welding, due to their relative ease of preparation. [...] When metals are welded without human guidance, there is no operator to make adjustments for non-ideal joint preparation. Because of this necessity, <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> can be utilized for their simplistic design to be fed through automated welding machines efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Single-J <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> {{are when}} {{one piece of}} the weld is {{in the shape of}} a J that easily accepts filler {{material}} and the other piece is square. A J-groove is formed either with special cutting machinery or by grinding the joint edge into the form of a J. Although a J-groove is more difficult and costly to prepare than a V-groove, a single J-groove on metal between a half an inch and three quarters of an inch thick provides a stronger weld that requires less filler material. Double-J <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> have one piece that has a J shape from both directions and the other piece is square.|$|E
50|$|Single-U <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> are welds {{that have}} both {{edges of the}} weld surface shaped like a J, but once they come together, they form a U. Double-U joints have a U {{formation}} on both {{the top and bottom}} of the prepared joint. U-joints are the most expensive edge to prepare and weld. They are usually used on thick base metals where a V-groove would be at such an extreme angle, that it would cost too much to fill.|$|E
50|$|The Tee <b>Butt</b> <b>Weld</b> {{is formed}} when two bars or sheets are joined {{perpendicular}} {{to each other}} in the form of a T shape. This weld is made from the resistance <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> process.|$|R
50|$|Below {{are listed}} ideal joint {{thicknesses}} {{for the various}} types of <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> joints. When the thickness of a <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> is defined it is measured at the thinner part and does not compensate for the weld reinforcement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{is usually}} {{performed}} {{using one of}} several methods. The first, and most common, is <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> or <b>butt</b> fusion, which {{is a type of}} hot plate welding. This technique involves heating two planed surfaces of thermoplastic material (typically polyethylene) against a heated surface. After a specified amount of time, the heating plate is removed and the two pieces are pressed together and allowed to cool under pressure, forming the desired bond. <b>Butt</b> <b>welding</b> outside of manufacturing is usually performed to join pipes.|$|R
5000|$|... 5356 {{aluminium}} alloy is an alloy in the wrought aluminium-magnesium family (5000 or 5xxx series). Unlike most aluminium-magnesium alloys, {{it is primarily}} used as welding filler. It {{is one of the}} most popular aluminium filler alloys, alongside 4043. It possesses relatively high strength, but at the expense of being more vulnerable to cracking. It is the preferred filler when making lap or <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> on the popular 6061 {{aluminium alloy}}, or when the welded parts are to be anodized.|$|E
50|$|In common welding practices, {{the welding}} surface {{needs to be}} {{prepared}} to ensure the strongest weld possible. Preparation is needed for all forms of welding and all types of joints. Generally, <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> require very little preparation, but some is still needed for the best results. Plate edges can be prepared for butt joints in various ways, but the five most common techniques are oxyacetylene cutting (oxy-fuel welding and cutting), machining, chipping, grinding, and air carbon-arc cutting or gouging. Each technique has unique advantages to their use.|$|E
5000|$|Selection of {{the right}} weld joint depends on the {{thickness}} and process used. The square welds are the most economical for pieces thinner than 3/8”, because they don’t require the edge to be prepared. [...] Double-groove welds are the most economical for thicker pieces because they require less weld material and time. The use of fusion welding is common for closed single-bevel, closed single J, open single J, and closed double J butt joints. The use of gas and arc welding is ideal for double-bevel, closed double-bevel, open double-bevel, single-bevel, and open single-bevel <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>weld</b> {{connection}} {{is one of}} the most commonly used connection types in steel structures, and its post-fire mechanical property is crucial for the estimation of the residual mechanical capacity of steel structures after building fires. To study the mechanical properties of <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> connections after being exposed to high temperatures, Q 235 and Q 345 <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens were designed, heated to various high temperatures between 400 °C and 800 °C, and then naturally cooled to room temperature. Tensile tests were conducted on these <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens to obtain the force–displacement curves and relevant mechanical properties (yield and ultimate strengths) at various temperatures. The following conclusions were obtained from the test results: (1) The post-fire mechanical properties of the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens were affected by material grade and heating temperature; (2) when the temperature exceeded 600 °C, the yield and ultimate strengths of the Q 235 and Q 345 <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens began to decrease; the strength reduction of the latter was greater than that of the former; (3) when the temperature was 800 °C, the yield strength and ultimate strength of Q 235 decreased to 87 % and 91 % of the ambient-temperature yield and ultimate strengths, respectively; and (4) the yield and ultimate strengths of Q 345 decreased to 83 % and 87 % of those at room temperature. Computational formulas for the yield and ultimate strengths of the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> specimens at high temperatures were also fitted and verified with test data to provide a safety evaluation method for steel structures after a fire...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} a comparative assessment of composite materials performance, based on 80 %Al+ 20 %CrC, 82 %CuNiAl+ 18 %WC and 82 %CuZn 48 + 18 %CrC, <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> and fillet welded. This comparative assessment resulted in {{information regarding the}} chemical content of the welded joints in percent, macro-microstructure estimation of specific areas of the welded edge joints, and determination of HV 5 hardness of specific areas of the welded joints, both for <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> and fillet welding.

40|$|Purpose: The {{effects of}} flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{parameters}} on mechanical properties were explored for mooring chain for offshore structure. Design/methodology/approach: Through the tensile strength, impact energy, hardness of weld, macrosection, microstructure and waveform {{analysis of the}} flash <b>butt</b> <b>weld,</b> following the change of the flash mode, flash length, upset mode, and upset length which are {{the parameters of the}} flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding,</b> the weld quality has been assessed. Findings: It is confirmed that even if the mechanical properties of the weld are satisfied through experiments, a weld defect may exist, and in case of using force mode in upset process, the mechanical characteristics of the weld is superior to position mode. Research limitations/implications: The optimal welding condition presented in this study may be changed in accordance with the chemical composition of the material, size of mooring chain. Practical implications: In this study, the suitable welding conditions were presented for securing a good weld quality of the high strength steel mooring chain for the offshore structure. Originality/value: Through this study, the correlation between the weld parameters and the weld quality in the flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> was confirmed.

50|$|The typical {{intermediate}} {{rings are}} designed for wind bending stresses, reduced {{as required by the}} yield stress reduction at working temperatures. The typical rings are fabricated from rolled steel plate, angles or tees's welded together to create the ring cross section required. Rings are fabricated from any combination of plate, tee or W shape that the shop can roll. Rings are usually mild carbon steel, ASTM A36 plate, or equivalent. The location of ring <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> should preferably be offset 15 degrees(+/-)from point of maximum stress to minimize the effect of weld porosity on weld allowable stress.|$|E
50|$|Arc sensors are {{evaluating}} the stable working points in arc welding. Disturbance variables {{of the process}} must be compensated via suitable filtering and evaluation strategies which are not susceptible to disturbances.In {{the case of a}} simultaneous height and side control attention must be paid to the fact that only those groove geometries are suitable for arc sensor systems whose geometry allows the lateral position determination via comparative measurement of the fusion faces. V-type welds and fillet welds are suitable without any restrictions. Square <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> without gap are not suitable for side/lateral control. Commercially available arc sensors are, so far, not applicable for aluminium materials.|$|E
50|$|Single <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> {{are similar}} to a bevel joint, but instead of only one side having the beveled edge, {{both sides of the}} weld joint are beveled. In thick metals, and when welding can be {{performed}} {{from both sides of the}} work piece, a double-V joint is used. When welding thicker metals, a double-V joint requires less filler material because there are two narrower V-joints compared to a wider single-V joint. Also the double-V joint helps compensate for warping forces. With a single-V joint, stress tends to warp the piece in one direction when the V-joint is filled, but with a double-V-joint, there are welds on both sides of the material, having opposing stresses, straightening the material.|$|E

50|$|The square-groove is a <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> joint {{with the}} two pieces being flat and {{parallel}} to each other. This joint is simple to prepare, economical to use, and provides satisfactory strength, but is limited by joint thickness. The closed square <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> {{is a type of}} square-groove joint with no spacing in between the pieces. This joint type is common with gas and arc welding.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> but all fall within one of these categories: single welded butt joints, double welded butt joint, and open or closed butt joints. A single welded butt joint is the name for a joint that has only been welded from one side. A double welded butt joint is created when the weld has been welded from both sides. With double welding, the depths of each weld can vary slightly. A closed weld {{is a type of}} joint in which the two pieces that will be joined are {{touching}} during the welding process. An open weld is the joint type where the two pieces have a small gap in between them during the welding process.|$|E
50|$|Any {{impairment}} {{of the electric}} contact between sensor scanning element and workpiece is, {{in the case of}} electric-contact sensors, problematic, e.g. welding spatters at the shielding gas nozzle, scale and rolling skin on the workpiece surface or through a wire electrode end which has molten spheroidally and has adherence of slag.When mechanical-contact sensors are used, the scanning elements must be adapted to the respective groove shapes. <b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> with a square butt joint preparation must have a groove gap of more than 3 mm; in overlap joints the top plate must have a thickness of more than 3 mm.The sensor must be mounted separately from the welding torch.Thus, the groove scanning is mainly carried out in a leading position in front of the torch. If the welds are mainly straight, this adjustment is no problem. It is also possible to use scanning element arrays (e.g. fork callipers or separated scanning elements for height and lateral scanning which allow scanning in the torch level and thus weld scanning which is almost free from errors. Apart from the torch guidance along a weld groove, mechanical contact sensors can also be applied for detection of the weld start and end of the weld.|$|E

40|$|Flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} economical process for solid state <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> It consists indirect electrical heating of {{the ends of the}} work pieces to be welded and forging them together. While heating, a thermal distribution characterized by a steep temperature gradient is established along the axial length of the pieces. Flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> is widely used for steel band welding m wheel industry. Major advantages are economical in operation, suitable for mass production and high in joint strength. Loadstar (pvt) Ltd has six flash butt machines in different production lines for rim and band manufacturing. The major problem is considerably high amount of scrap percentage due to welding cracks. This problem severely affects the lines which have severe forming or stretching operations in latter stages. For this investigation the line 05 was selected which has high scrap percentage. The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyze the flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> cracks in rim manufacturing and to find out the main reasons for the defects. The analysis of flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> cracks in nm manufacturing is done m five stages. In the first stage, attention is paid to literature survey, in which the present stage of the researches carried out in the industry regarding the flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> is discussed. Only few literature sources are available although there are many wheel manufacturing companies- [...] in the world.

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of 25 mm aluminium-alloy {{full and}} partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> were investigated. Strain controlled fatigue {{tests of the}} 5083 aluminium-alloy base and 5183 weld metal were carried out to determine the monotonic and cyclic stress-strain properties. Crack propagation measurements were performed using center crack tension specimens. The weldments were tested under axial loading for R= 0 and - 1. For the full-penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack initiated at the weld toe, while for the partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack started at the weld root. The high stress concentration at the weld root decreases the fatigue strength of the welds with UP {{as compared to the}} full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> In presence of a tensile mean stress, the fatigue life is significantly shorter than under fully reversed loading. An analytical model was used to predict the lifetime of the weldments. The total lifetime is composed of crack initiation and crack propagation. Because of the high stress concentration at the weld root the period of crack initiation is negligible for the weldments with UP. The lifetime based on crack propagation can be simply described using the geometry factor of the center crack tension specimen. Considering of the extra material provided by the weld reinforcement is suggested. The model predictions agreed with the experimental results for the full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> While for R= 0, the most lifetime was spent in crack initiation (and small crack growth), for R=- 1 the relative amount of crack propagation is more dominant due to crack closure under compressive loading...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to argue whether the {{certification}} process used in Finland for <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> products is sufficient for ensuring quality welds. This topic was approached by reviewing the plastic joining technical codes for <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{in order to understand}} the correct <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> process, the weld testing procedures and the common weld im-perfections.

40|$|The {{presence}} of residual stress in steel members can significantly compromise the stiffness and fatigue life of steel structural components. This influence becomes more serious for the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> {{in the construction}} of large-sized steel members due to the different residual stress distribution from the normal size <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> This paper experimentally studied the residual stress in the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> through an 8 -experiment test program. High residual stress was produced during the wide butt welding and this stress was observed to be even higher than the yield strength of the steel. Moreover, this residual stress in the steel plate was firstly compressive and then transferred into tensile stress with the increase in the distance away from the butt weld line. The magnitude of the residual stress increased with the increase in the width of the welding seams. This paper also developed a finite element model by SYSWELD to simulate the residual stress produced by the wide butt welding. The accuracy of the FE simulation was checked by the reported test results. In order to reduce the residual stress, the ultrasonic peening method was adopted.
