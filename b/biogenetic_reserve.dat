50|$|Nowadays {{the island}} {{has only two}} {{permanent}} human inhabitants, both nature reserve keepers. In addition, agents of the State Forestry Corps from Follonica live there in alternating shifts of two weeks at a time. The state nature reserve Isola di Monte Cristo is a <b>biogenetic</b> <b>reserve</b> of 1,039 hectares established in 1971 by ministerial decree to protect the unique nature of the island. Today {{it belongs to the}} Tuscan Archipelago National Park. It was also awarded the European Diploma of Protected Areas in 1988, and recognized as a site of pan-European interest.|$|E
40|$|The present {{paper is}} focused on the {{diversity}} of wood-inhabiting fungi in a poorly investigated habitat: a Mediterranean forest dominated by maritime pine. The sampling area lies in Tocchi <b>biogenetic</b> <b>Reserve,</b> located in the province of Siena (Tuscany, Italy). The monitoring campaign was carried out in 10 permanents plots, taking note of all the fungal species found on each piece of dead wood, irrespective of size and stage of decay. Over one year of surveys, 56 taxa of wood-inhabiting fungi were recorded, among which 39 are corticoids species, 16 polypores and 1 Heterobasidiomycetes. The fungal community seems to be dominated by a small number of species, which are more abundant than the others. Moreover, there are some specific features of deadwood influencing the species composition, such as the presence of coarse woody debris at the first decay stage and fine woody debris at the late decay stages. The results allowed characterizing the wood-inhabiting fungal community in this forest reserve, broadening our knowledge on several species and providing a preliminary database for further studies in Mediterranean areas...|$|E
50|$|Scattered {{across the}} country, are various areas defined {{due to their}} European {{ecological}} interest, and have been classified {{within the context of}} the Nature 2000 network. Meanwhile, other areas fall within international nature conservation networks, such as <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Reserves</b> (Council of Europe), Ramsar Sites (Ramsar Convention), Biosphere Reserves (MAB/UNESCO) and sites covered by the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage (UNESCO).|$|R
25|$|In 1997, Peneda-Gerês was {{included}} in the Natura 2000 network, and in 1999, designated a Special Protection Area for Wild Birds. Moreover, it also encompasses an important area of natural forest, which forms part of the European Network of <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Reserves,</b> and is recognized as a national park by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In 2007, it was accepted in the PAN Parks network that certifies the quality protected areas, according to rigorous criteria of nature conservation, cultural services and sustainability.|$|R
40|$|To {{aid in the}} of {{environmental}} and landscape recovery quarries integrated in the Arrábida Natural Park (PNA) a contract involving official Portuguese entities was celebrated since 1998 to produce autochthonous plants. This contract {{was supported by the}} project “Valorisation of waste heat from Setúbal Power Plant in protected cultivation” that had the main goal to demonstrate the practical application of low temperature waste heat from power plant in greenhouses environmental conditioning. The contract was developed in partnership with EDP the major Portuguese energy operator as leadership, LNEG as scientific coordinator, PNA as technical partner and the municipalities of Setúbal and Palmela as institutional partners. The production of thousands of autochthonous plants have been cultivated in greenhouses equipped with heating systems allowing the circulation of low-temperature effluent waste heat were resulting plants with adapted characteristics that increased their adaptability to adverse environments. Located on the Setúbal Peninsula (Portugal west coast) the Arrábida Natural Park was created on 1976 and represents a place of special interest in the panorama of national protected area with protected natural, cultural and landscape values and promoting the economical development and the life quality of the resident populations. Its scientific value and state of conservation has led to this protected area being included in the European Network of <b>Biogenetic</b> <b>Reserves.</b> This Natural Park encloses some coastal mountains and Sado estuary that constitute a paradise not only for lovers of Nature, but also as an inexhaustible source of joy for geologists and biologists. The climate is temperate and illustrates its features more Mediterranean. Associated human activities as fishery, agricultural and mineral activities easily justify the special attention given to the preservation of this protected environment. There are 11 licensed quarries dated before the creation of the PNA subjected to environmental and landscape recovery plans according to national laws that obliged topographical regularization with inert wastes from their extractive activities and the ecological restoration implemented with autochthonous species. Currently, legal protection and management plan for the PNA prohibits the expansion of existing quarries and the beginning of new...|$|R
