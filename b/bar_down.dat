500|$|Hollister, the {{original}} [...] "burn architect" [...] {{who invented the}} technique in 1989, was asked to lead the 2016 burn, which was many times bigger than the first. He acknowledged that ivory doesn't really burn: [...] "we have to raise {{the temperature in the}} fires {{to such a degree that}} it actually disintegrates. We're going to create [...] by combining kerosene and diesel and compressed air, pushing it at very high pressure, about 16 <b>bar,</b> <b>down</b> a pipe." [...] The question of the effectiveness of the destruction – even the possibility that some of the partially combusted ivory may find its way back to the black market – is a touchy subject. [...] "It's heresy to consider any other form of destruction, leave alone finding any other way to use the ivory or utilise wildlife resources." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 20, 2014, the U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee {{learned that}} every one of the 470 senior {{executives}} in the VA received performance evaluations that indicated they were at least [...] "fully successful" [...] {{in each of the past}} four years. Congressional representatives argued that the data shows that senior management in the VA is out of touch with the problems in the department. Republican Representative Phil Roe said, [...] "Do you think that’s normal in business, that nearly every executive is successful? That means you put the <b>bar</b> <b>down</b> here, so anybody can step over it." [...] Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster compared the situation to grade inflation. Senior executives were paid a total of $2.4 million in bonus compensation in the most recent year. Gina S. Farrisee, VA assistant secretary for human resources and administration, admitted in her written comments that the department needed to do better at holding executives accountable.|$|E

Lean, muscular bodies strained and bent, the dew of effort dripped from them; and, as he heaved with lips set, the hollows grew deeper in Jefferson's grim face. No one spoke; {{there was only}} a deep, stertorous gasping, until the puncheon moved a little, and Jefferson, stooping, drove his bar a trifle lower. Then, while he strained every muscle and sinew in strenuous effort, the great, slimy barrel rose again, tilted, and rolled out on its fellows. For a moment it left a space of oily black water where it had been, and then the puncheons closed in with a crash again. Jefferson flung the <b>bar</b> <b>down</b> and straightened himself.|$|E

He descended, and, devouring his share of the meal in ten minutes, which is about the usual time in that country, strolled leisurely into the great general room, which had a big stove in the middle and a <b>bar</b> <b>down</b> one side of it.
