5000|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s, cameras {{did not have}} <b>built-in</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters,</b> andmany photographers did not have {{external}} <b>exposure</b> <b>meters.</b> Consequently,it often was necessary to calculate exposure fromlighting conditions.

50|$|Use of APEX {{required}} logarithmic {{markings on}} aperture and shutter controls, however, and these never were incorporated in consumer cameras. With {{the inclusion of}} <b>built-in</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>meters</b> in most cameras shortly after APEX was proposed, the {{need to use the}} exposure equation was eliminated, and APEX saw little actual use.|$|R

50|$|The Fujifilm FinePix S1 Pro was an {{interchangeable}} lens digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in January 2000. It {{was based on}} a Nikon F60 (Nikon N60 in the U.S.) film camera body that was modified by Fujifilm to include its own proprietary image sensor and electronics. Because of the Nikon body, it had a Nikon F lens mount and so could use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It was autofocusing, had an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/2000 sec. and <b>built-in</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> and pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents ranged from 320-1600. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro in January 2002.|$|R

5000|$|... 1953: Zeiss Ikon Contaflex I (West Germany): first leaf shutter 35 mm SLR. Had Synchro-Compur leaf shutter {{and front}} cell {{focusing}} 45mm f/2.8 Tessar lens, <b>built-in</b> selenium-coupled <b>exposure</b> <b>meter.</b> For many years, reliable focal-plane shutters were very expensive and SLRs equipped with Compur or Prontor leaf shutters were strong competitors. As FP shutters improved, their faster available speeds won {{out in the}} late 1960s and leaf shutter 35 mm SLRs disappeared around 1976.|$|R
5000|$|The OM-4 was {{the first}} camera with a <b>built-in</b> multi-spot <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> (2% of view; 3.3˚ with 50 mm lens) which could take up to eight spot {{measurements}} and average them. Another unique feature was the selectable option to assess the darkest or brightest part of the scene, the camera adjusting the exposure based on that measure. The light meter used a dual-concentric segmented silicon photodiode to provide spot or center-weighted readings. It used a graduated, linear LCD shutter speed display {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder to precisely indicate its readings versus the actual camera settings.|$|R

50|$|Canon's sudden {{switch from}} professionally {{oriented}} SLR cameras to advanced amateur cameras happened in March 1964 {{when they left}} the Canon Canonflex range and launched the Canon FX with the FL lens mount. It has a built in CdS <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> with a circular window on the right-hand camera front. The Canon FP without <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> was added later the same year. The cameras were well built, but the metering technology was several years behind the Minolta SR-7 which pioneered that technology in 1962. Then just half a year later, in the spring of 1965 Canon surprised the camera community with the remarkable Pellix. The new camera featured the much-expected TTL <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> facility, albeit employing the stop-down metering method.|$|R

50|$|The <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> uses a {{circular}} CdS cell 8.5 mm in diameter (coverage with 50 mm lens = 21°), {{and having a}} sensitivity of -0 (some estimates claim -1) - 20 Ev at 100 ASA (0.3-0.4 asb at f/1.4 to 200 000 asb; 0,06 to 32.000 cd/m2). Information from the <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is displayed using a dual match needle system {{at the bottom of}} the viewfinder. An additional illuminator window at the top of the viewfinder illuminates the readout bar. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> can be set from ISO 6/9° to ISO 3200/36°. The ASA/DIN film speed knob is designed to prevent inadvertent change. The meter's circuit is powered up by winding the camera, and shuts down when the shutter is released. The M5 <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> required the PX625 1.35 V mercuric oxide coin type cell which was banned because of its mercury content. The M5 continues to run on a number of alternatives including the WeincellTM MRB625. The battery compartment is located between the strap lugs. It is accessed by using a coin slot type threaded cap and is superior in design to that of the bayonet caps that surfaced as of the M6.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is to {{estimate}} the subject's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it {{has to make a}} number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> is taken as the [...] "reference" [...] exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies.|$|R

50|$|The Pen EM, {{produced}} from 1965 to 1966, is a motorized Pen model. It has a 35mm f/2 lens, and a CdS <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> allowing automatic or manual exposure.|$|R
50|$|However, by the 1960s the clamour for in-camera <b>exposure</b> <b>metering</b> was rising. It was {{possible}} to attach an external CdS (Cadmium sulfide) <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> to the later AP-derived models, but in 1960 the next breakthrough arrived. At the 1960 photokina camera show, Asahi exhibited the Spot-matic prototype. This camera took exposure measurements, via a spotmeter, through the taking lens, an incredible innovation. The camera excited tremendous attention and in 1964 the first production Spotmatic (hyphen dropped) emerged. The Spotmatic was virtually identical to the prototype; however, the spotmeter was replaced with an all-over average-reading <b>exposure</b> <b>meter</b> {{in order to give}} more consistent results. The camera was an instant success and was snapped up by the thousands, although Asahi had been beaten into production by the Topcon RE Super which went on sale in April 1963; the Topcon failed to attract the same degree of commercial success. The Spotmatic was replaced by the Spotmatic II with many upgrades 1971 - 1976.|$|R
