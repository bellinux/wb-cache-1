En route to the quarterfinals, Söderling had a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> on the fact that two of his opponents retired, including the Russian, who retired when Söderling led 7–5, 3–6, 6–2. Söderling went on to face five-time defending champion and 1st seed Roger Federer for the fourth time this year (three of them in a Grand Slam event). Söderling was defeated by Federer 0–6, 3–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–7(6–8). This was the second time in the pair's 12 meetings that Söderling took a set against Federer.|$|E

In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned {{to work in the}} Sonderkommando. They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. Unterscharführer Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: [...] "We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / We want to keep working, working, / until a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> beckons us some time.

500|$|Arsenal {{remained}} unbeaten throughout February, winning {{all five}} matches. In a home match against Manchester City, Reyes {{made his first}} appearance for the club, coming on as a substitute in the second half. He had no part in the winning goal, a [...] "crunching, beautifully judged 25-yarder" [...] scored by Henry. Arsenal recorded an away win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 7 February 2004, their 24th league match, which bettered a club record of games unbeaten {{from the start of}} the season (originally held by George Graham's team of 1990–91). Wenger in his post-match press conference played down the record, and said of the unbeaten run: [...] "You need a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> and mental qualities." [...] Henry reached a personal landmark against Southampton three days later, scoring his 100th and 101st Premier League goals. The victory moved Arsenal five points clear at the top, although they had played one more game than Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|Local {{favourite}} Sergio Pérez, who {{had been}} on a one-stop strategy, said after the race that it had been the safety car period that [...] "destroyed" [...] his chances at a better result, but added: [...] "What I could do, I did perfectly, so I'm happy with that." [...] His teammate Nico Hülkenberg had finished the race in front of him, and said after the race: [...] "The Safety Car ended up playing into my hands, which is the little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> you always need to get a good result". Speaking about the race, 14th-placed Jenson Button said: [...] "Painful, I think, is the word. I was on the harder tyre at the start but still it was just waving goodbye to everyone in front really." [...] He also stated that he believed that McLaren were more affected by the high altitude than the other teams. On his one-lap outing, Fernando Alonso explained that the problem that caused his retirement had been discovered the night before. He added: [...] "We had two possibilities, retire the car without even starting the race or try our maximum, knowing that maybe one or two laps was the maximum we could achieve [...] We did one lap, for respect of the fans because they were amazing all weekend." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the third}} Test, Vaughan's poor run of form was {{attracting}} increasing criticism. But {{during the third}} Test at Old Trafford he answered the critics, albeit with a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> during a Glenn McGrath over. In the second ball of the over, when Vaughan was on 41, he cut hard at a wide delivery from McGrath and Gilchrist allowed it to slip through his gloves and run away for four runs. The very next ball McGrath clean bowled Vaughan with a superb off cutter, but this was in vain as the umpire called a no-ball for overstepping the line. Vaughan went on to strike 166, punishing in particular the lacklustre bowling of Jason Gillespie. Vaughan was eventually caught by Glenn McGrath off a full-toss delivery from occasional slow left-armer Simon Katich.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{was chosen}} to make his Test debut against India at Bangalore, in October 2004, despite having a {{first-class}} average below 40. He succeeded on debut, scoring 151 and consequently helping Australia to victory, invoking comparisons to past Australian batsmen such as Doug Walters and Mark Waugh. [...] The innings, felt Peter Roebuck, was especially notable for its aggression and freedom. [...] "Not that the assault was reckless," [...] he added. [...] "Indeed the control was impressive. [...] Clarke calculated the risks and took his brains with him down the track. [...] Of course he need a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck,</b> was plumb in front in the nineties, but few begrudged him his hundred. [...] And everyone except his weary foes celebrated {{with him and his}} tearful family when he reached three figures. [...] After all, he had advanced both the match and the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Georgia {{still held}} an overall {{advantage}} in the series, Florida enjoyed a 10–2 streak from 1952 to 1963 under head coaches Bob Woodruff and Ray Graves. [...] That changed {{with the arrival of}} Vince Dooley as the new head coach of the underdog 1964 Georgia Bulldogs. [...] In a game where the Bulldogs' quarterback failed to complete a single pass and was intercepted twice, Dooleys' 'Dogs relied on their running game, a staunch second-half defense, and a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> to beat Graves' tenth-ranked Florida Gators. [...] With the game tied at 7–7 in the fourth quarter, Bulldogs placekicker Bob Etter lined up for a potential game-winning field goal. [...] Instead, in a wild broken play, the Bulldogs' center and placeholder mishandled the snap, but Etter picked up the bobbled ball and ran it for a touchdown to win the game 14–7.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the fourth}} day, Robert Croft and Darren Thomas held Warwickshire briefly at bay with a {{partnership}} of 75, but this wasn't enough as Glamorgan succumbed for 323. Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, [...] "Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch {{they were always}} going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive. We had a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> so {{we are not going}} to start going around saying that we are going to win the Championship just because we have won one match." [...] John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, [...] "Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make sure that we did not get back into the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Browns {{broke into}} the ranks of the NFL's elite—particularly on defense—with a 12–4 showing in [...] Behind Kosar's 3,854 yards passing and one of the league's stingiest {{defenses}} featuring five Pro Bowlers (Chip Banks, Hanford Dixon, Bob Golic, Clay Matthews, and Frank Minnifield), the Browns dominated the AFC Central with {{the best record in the}} AFC and clinched home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Browns needed some serious heroics (and a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck)</b> to overcome the New York Jets. The Jets were leading 20–10 with less than four minutes to play, with the Browns in a dire third and 24 situation. Mark Gastineau was called for roughing the passer, which gave Cleveland a first down. The drive ended with Kevin Mack running into the end zone for a touchdown. After going three-and-out, the Jets went back on defense, but allowed the rejuvenated Browns to again drive the ball deep into their end of the field. With 11 seconds remaining in regulation, Mark Moseley kicked a field goal to tie the game. In the first of two ensuing overtime periods, Moseley missed his next attempt, but later redeemed himself by ending what had become the second-longest game in NFL history, a 23–20 victory for the Browns.|$|E
2500|$|The batting captain {{is allowed}} seven minutes of rolling before his innings and Freddie Brown {{asked for the}} heavy roller to press down the wicket and {{take some of the}} demons out of it. In those days the Woolloongabba still used an old heavy roller drawn by a horse called Dobbin. As it had to be unhitched and led round after each pull of the roller over the pitch, most of the seven minutes was wasted and Brown didn't get much of the rolling he asked for. This was of great {{importance}} as if he had insisted on seven minutes actual rolling instead of messing about at either end the wicket would have been much less dangerous and England would have had less time to bat out before stumps. Though as Bill O'Reilly pointed out the time limits were devised when horse-drawn rollers were the norm and mechanical rollers were unheard of. Initially it made no difference as Reg Simpson was bowled first ball by a full toss from Ray Lindwall (2/21). The veteran England scorer Bill Ferguson was using his famous Ferguson Charts to record the details of each innings; how many runs a batsman had scored, how many balls, how many minutes, how many boundaries, etc. when Simpson was out one wag called out [...] "How long Bill, and how many fours?" [...] which produced a roar of laughter from the press box that astonished the crowd. Cyril Washbrook (6) and John Dewes (9) were determined to see out the day with dead bats and the wicket showed no signs of danger, but Sam Loxton took a superb catch {{to get rid of the}} Lancastrian off Lindwall. Jack Iverson was called up to bowl his first Test over 27 minutes before stumps and had Trevor Bailey in all kinds of trouble as his poked and prodded and could have been out five or six times in the mystery spinner's maiden over. Dewes was bowled by Keith Miller and with one over from Iverson remaining, Alec Bedser came out and immediately appealed against the bad light, but was turned down as he had yet to face a ball. He holed out to Neil Harvey off Iverson, Bailey gave a simple catch to Bill Johnston and Godfrey Evans ran out his fellow wicket-keeper Arthur McIntyre when he called for an unnecessary third run. Brown had fed in nightwatchman after nightwatchman in order to save Hutton, Compton and himself for the next day, but the Man from Pudsey still had to come out at 30/6 to survive the last two balls of an extraordinary day. When asked for his opinion that night Hutton said they might win [...] "if the others will stay till lunch and it doesn't rain again". It didn't rain again, but needing 163 to win with only four wickets in hand there was no room for mistakes. In the morning Brown, the umpires and a stopwatch ensured that England got their full 10 minutes rolling at the start of the day, which took nearly half an hour to complete. Evans (5) helped Hutton add 16 runs before he was caught by Loxton off Bill Johnston (2/30). Denis Compton came to the crease, but lasted one ball as he departed like Evans [...] "c Loxton, b Johnston". Brown came in at number 10 and held on grimly as Hutton peeled off 3 boundaries, though in the end the captain made 17 of their 29 runs together before he became Loxton's fourth victim when he was caught off Iverson (4/43). Doug Wright was the last man in at 77/9 and his batting tended to be a hit and miss affair which rarely reached double figures. Hutton (62 not out) farmed the bowling ruthlessly, making 43 of the 45 runs added for the last wicket. Wright managed to hold a straight bat up to the few balls he was left to face until the last four balls from Iverson before lunch. He kept out the first three, but spooned the last to Ray Lindwall at square leg and the match was over. The 12,000 strong crowd gave Hutton an heroic ovation and after lunch he replied to the congratulations showered on him with by admitting that [...] "with a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>luck</b> I'd have won the game".|$|E
