5|$|Simmering {{tensions}} between the UK and Argentina increased {{during the second half}} of the century, when Argentine President Juan Perón asserted sovereignty over the archipelago. The sovereignty dispute intensified during the 1960s, shortly after the United Nations passed a resolution on decolonisation which Argentina interpreted as favourable to its position. In 1965, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2065, calling for both states to conduct <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiations</b> to reach a peaceful settlement of the dispute. From 1966 until 1968, the UK confidentially discussed with Argentina the transfer of the Falklands, assuming its judgement would be accepted by the islanders. An agreement on trade ties between the archipelago and the mainland was reached in 1971 and, consequently, Argentina built a temporary airfield at Stanley in 1972. Nonetheless, Falklander dissent, as expressed by their strong lobby in the UK Parliament, and {{tensions between}} the UK and Argentina effectively limited sovereignty negotiations until 1977.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} border {{conflicts}} between Colombia and Peru {{in the early}} part of the 20th century, and in 1922, their governments signed the Salomón-Lozano Treaty in an attempt to resolve them. As part of this treaty, the border town of Leticia and its surrounding area was ceded from Peru to Colombia, giving Colombia access to the Amazon River. On 1 September 1932, business leaders from Peruvian rubber and sugar industries who had lost land as a result organised an armed takeover of Leticia. At first, the Peruvian government did not recognise the military takeover, but President of Peru Luis Sánchez Cerro decided to resist a Colombian re-occupation. The Peruvian Army occupied Leticia, leading to an armed conflict between the two nations. After months of diplomatic negotiations, the governments accepted mediation by the League of Nations, and their representatives presented their cases before the Council. A provisional peace agreement, signed by both parties in May 1933, provided for the League to assume control of the disputed territory while <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiations</b> proceeded. In May 1934, a final peace agreement was signed, resulting in the return of Leticia to Colombia, a formal apology from Peru for the 1932 invasion, demilitarisation of the area around Leticia, free navigation on the Amazon and Putumayo Rivers, and a pledge of non-aggression.|$|E

40|$|Abstracts: This paper {{examines}} the optimal trade negotiation {{strategies in the}} trade negotiation involving multi-parties such as Doha Development Agenda, which is characterized by asymmetric multiple negotiators with multi-trade issues. Due to the consensus rule, which is the formal decision making rule of WTO, bilateral bargaining formula is often taken simultaneously with the multilateral bargaining formula. We demonstrate that the large economy, which might pose a fundamental objection, prefers the sequential <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiation,</b> while multilateral negotiation from the initial stage of bargaining is welfare dominant for small economies. World welfare is also improved with the adoption of multilateral negotiating regime from the initial stage of <b>negotiation</b> compared to <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiation...</b>|$|R

An automated negotiation may alleviate the difficulties inherent in human negotiations. To avoid a deadlock {{in which both}} agents are unwilling to concede may arise in the traditional alternating-offer pattern, a mediator agent is introduced. After outlining the negotiation workflow, we aim to analyze the correlation of price and quantity in a <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> in different situations; then propose the negotiation methods how negotiate price and quantity for different situations.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{sequential}} Nash bargaining solution {{and apply it}} to a dynamic bargaining game on exhaustible-resource extraction. The government and two agents bargain via the asymmetric Nash bargaining solution. Should the trilateral negotiation fail, the government chooses one agent for a <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiation.</b> In this negotiation, the disagreement point is to bargain with the other agent. Finally, should this second <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> break down, the government chooses the welfare maximizing policy. In our dynamic bargaining game, the environmental organization is willing to pay for less extraction, because of stock-pollution effects, while the extraction firm is willing to pay for extraction per se. The government dislikes extraction, because of flow-pollution effects, but is willing to accept some if it is paid for it. It turns out that the disagreement point in the trilateral negotiation is always to bargain with the environmental organization. This is because there is no conflict of interest {{between the government and the}} environmental organization concerning extraction. However, as long as stock pollution is still low, it might be optimal for the environmental organization to let this <b>bilateral</b> <b>negotiation</b> break down. We demonstrate how these considerations shape the payments in case of agreement and disagreement, in total and over time...|$|R
