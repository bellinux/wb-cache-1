40|$|There are innumerable 'biological {{complexity}} measure's. While some patterns {{emerge from}} these attempts to represent <b>biological</b> complexity, a single measure {{to encompass the}} seemingly countless features of <b>biological</b> systems, still eludes the students of Biology. It is the pursuit of this paper to discuss the feasibility of finding one complete and objective measure for <b>biological</b> complexity. A theoretical construct (the 'Thread-Mesh model') is proposed here to describe <b>biological</b> reality. It segments the entire <b>biological</b> space-time {{in a series of}} different <b>biological</b> organizations before modeling the property space of each of these organizations with computational and topological constructs. Acknowledging emergence as a key <b>biological</b> property, it has been proved here that the quest for an objective and all-encompassing <b>biological</b> complexity measure would necessarily end up in failure. Since any study of <b>biological</b> complexity is rooted in the knowledge of <b>biological</b> reality, an expression for possible limit of human knowledge about ontological <b>biological</b> reality, {{in the form of an}} uncertainty principle, is proposed here. Two theorems are proposed to model the fundamental limitation, owing to observer dependent nature of description of <b>biological</b> reality. They explain the reasons behind failures to construct a single and complete <b>biological</b> complexity measure. This model finds support in various experimental results and therefore provides a reliable and general way to study <b>biological</b> complexity and <b>biological</b> reality.

40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} <b>biological</b> {{rectification}} originated {{from the study}} of physiological processes of the human body. <b>Biological</b> processes are defined by certain structures; <b>biological</b> rectification is achieved by <b>biological</b> structures too. These rectifying <b>biological</b> structures are the <b>biological</b> rectifying valves, a definition adopted from physics. An extension of this notion leads to a generalization of the rectification phenomena in <b>biological</b> systems. The practical value of this theoretical concept is widely presumed. Here we show that the loss of rectification may result in dysfunction or even destruction of the <b>biological</b> system, the rectification implies the simplification of <b>biological</b> processes, reduce the utilization of energy in <b>biological</b> systhems and in general can help in understanding the processes in the human body and biology better. We hope that experts of different scientific fields will probably confirm or disprove this hypothesis...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for conserving a <b>biological</b> deep-sea organism, comprises collecting the <b>biological</b> organism in a deep-sea trapping device (110), cooling the <b>biological</b> organism with a cooling device (120), where the <b>biological</b> organism is put in a frozen condition, moving the frozen <b>biological</b> organism with the trapping device, to a normal-pressure environment, detecting the <b>biological</b> organism in the trapping device and/or supplying a cryoprotectant in the trapping device, dismantling the <b>biological</b> organism in frozen condition under normal pressure, and thawing or cultivating the <b>biological</b> organism or a part of <b>biological</b> organism under normal pressure or high pressure. The <b>biological</b> organism is frozen together with sea water (2) in a chamber of the trapping device. The <b>biological</b> organism is collected by alluring and/or actively flushing the <b>biological</b> organism in the trapping device. The cooling is carried out by introducing a liquid cooling medium in a hollow interior wall of the trapping device and/or forming a thermal contact of the cooling medium over a thermal bridge with an internal wall of the trapping device. The introduction of the liquid cooling medium is carried out by changing a liquid filling medium from the hollow interior wall of the trapping device. The cooling is enabled to a determined cool advent. The cooling is actuated dependent upon a signal of a sensor arrangement. The movement of the trapping device is carried out through lift that is caused through a transfer of cooling medium in a gaseous condition. The cooling is maintained in the environment with normal pressure. The movement of the frozen <b>biological</b> organism is {{carried out in the}} environment with normal pressure.
