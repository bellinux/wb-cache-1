5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of unemployment (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce unemployment by doing so. Unemployment may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run unemployment will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are toxoplasmosis, which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze how {{aggregate}} activity in Lebanon fluctuates with regard to recurrent shocks. The research starts by identifying the Lebanese economic business cycle from the first quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 2015 adopting a statistical method. Furthermore, this research studies the relationship between the capacity utilization rate and the inflation rate to explore theoretically and empirically how monetary and real shocks account for the disturbances that affect the economic activity. Findings prove that, over the studied period, the Lebanese economy performs largely under its full capacity and that the capacity utilization rate is related to inflation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short run, <b>but</b> not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run. <b>In</b> other terms, findings prove that monetary factors account for business cycle disturbances of <b>the</b> Lebanese economy <b>in</b> short run, <b>but</b> not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run.|$|R

25|$|Tattooing {{involves}} {{the placement of}} pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.|$|E

500|$|At the {{negotiations}} with the French, Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown, the intended bride being Louis XI's sister-in-law, Bona, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy. This marriage was not to be, however, because in September 1464, Edward revealed that he was already married, to Elizabeth Woodville. The marriage caused great offence to Warwick: not only {{due to the fact}} that his plans had been sabotaged, but also the secrecy with which the king had acted. The marriage – contracted on 1May of the same year – was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting, and in the meanwhile Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king was serious about the marriage proposal. For Edward the marriage may very well have been a love match, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick's influence.

The ambassador said that US support for South Vietnam would end if he was expelled, and the generals backed down, but Khánh said the military did not need US aid. The Americans were aware of Khánh's tactics and exploited it by persistently trying to scare his colleagues with the prospect of a military heavily restricted by the absence of US funding.
