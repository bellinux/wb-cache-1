500|$|In January 2015, {{following}} {{the closure of}} the 12 Bar Club and clearance of Enterprise Studios on Denmark Place, a group of musicians and supporters squatted in the club's premises and staged a demonstration in the street, protesting against redevelopment.

[...] However, a report in The Independent judged the protest to be misguided, as most shops along the street were still trading.|$|E

After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person has a <b>bad</b> <b>word</b> to say about him, he was a gentleman... even people who haven't met him know how much of a nice man he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E
500|$|Primary Colours {{received}} generally positive critical reception, {{so much so}} that Eddy Current Suppression Ring's front man, Current, {{remarked that}} it was [...] "weird" [...] because he didn't [...] "know if anyone's said a <b>bad</b> <b>word</b> about it". Bevan awarded Primary Colours a rating of 8.2 out of 10. Robert Christgau gave the album a rating of A−, which, according to him, corresponds to [...] "the kind of garden-variety good record that is the great luxury of musical micromarketing and overproduction". He also wrote that they do [...] "the same thing punk bands have always done" [...] and described the album as a [...] "recurring miracle." [...] Chris Richards compared the album to many early punk and post-punk bands such as [...] "a breezier Stooges" [...] or [...] "The Fall with less squall". He concluded that the album was [...] "the most righteous rock-and-roll moment of 2008". A more mixed review written by Emily Mackay awarded Primary Colours a rating of 7 out of 10 and criticised it for its lack of originality.|$|E

[...] He {{found it difficult to}} discover anyone who had a <b>bad</b> <b>word</b> to say about him, either during his life or since. Brassey expected a high standard of work from his employees; Cooke states that his [...] "standards of quality were fastidious in the extreme". There can be no doubt about some of his qualities. [...] He was exceptionally hardworking, and had an excellent memory and ability to perform mental arithmetic. [...] He was a good judge of men, which enabled him to select the best people to be his agents. He was scrupulously fair with his subcontractors and kind to his navvies, supporting them financially at their times of need. He would at times undertake contracts of little benefit to himself to provide work for his navvies. The only faults which his eldest son could identify were a tendency to praise traits and actions of other people he would condemn in his own family, and an inability to refuse a request. No criticism of him could be found from the engineers with whom he worked, his business associates, his agents or his navvies. [...] He paid his men fairly and generously.|$|E

No one had a <b>bad</b> <b>word</b> to say about Jennifer Aniston", with whose performance audiences instantly fell in love. Aniston's performance has been consistently praised since her debut in the pilot, about which Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker wrote that the actress portrays Rachel with [...] "prickly intelligence". Writing for The Baltimore Sun, David Zurawik cited Aniston among the show's [...] "very strong cast", while Varietys Tony Scott agreed that [...] "All six of the principals ... appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills"; Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette praised the work of show's female cast equally. TV Guide wrote that Aniston [...] "instantly charmed audiences with her perfect looks and endearingly flawed persona", while Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast referred to Aniston's tenure on Friends as not [...] "a leading lady performance" [...] but instead [...] "the work of a brilliant character actress." [...] The Guardian's Ryan Gilbey highlighted Aniston as the cast member [...] "least reliant on goofball caricature", observing that [...] "Playing the only character with whom a sane viewer might reasonably identify also meant that she got the lion's share of attention". Writing that the actress [...] "quickly stole our hearts as the daddy’s girl and aspiring fashionista," [...] Andrew Collins of Radio Times hailed Aniston as a [...] "natural comic performer, as adept with a subtle nose wrinkle as a full-on pratfall, and fluent in quick-fire patter". In 2002, Aniston won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2003, the actress won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress In A Television Series– Comedy Or Musical. Dominc Willis of TalkTalk believes that Aniston won these awards because of [...] "her brilliant comic performances in the show." ...|$|E

Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E

Dukakis responded by {{saying that he was}} a [...] "proud liberal" [...] and that the phrase should not be a <b>bad</b> <b>word</b> in America. Bush, a graduate of Yale University, derided Dukakis for having [...] "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique."

[...] Bush said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was [...] "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it.... Harvard boutique to me has the connotation of liberalism and elitism," [...] and said Harvard in his remark was intended to represent [...] "a philosophical enclave" [...] and not a statement about class.

And guess what? We didn't miss it. There may be hope yet for MTV to remember just what the 'M' in their name actually stands for." [...] Writing about the performance, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound concluded that [...] "Someone like You", [...] "highlighted the power a bare-bones, booming performance can have in netting people's attention. Simple is not a <b>bad</b> <b>word,</b> pop music." [...] Giving the performance an A+, Lindsey Ward of Jam! said: [...] "When I learned British chart-topper Adele would be performing at Sunday's awards I thought, 'Whew – at least we're guaranteed five solid, meaningful minutes of quality music television'. I was right; her frill-free performance of breakup ballad Someone Like You was just that." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the performance calling it [...] "one of the best performances of the show." [...] Another writer of the same publication gave the performance a grade of A+ and wrote: [...] "It takes a real super power to make the seizure-inducing lasers stop, and that power's name is Adele. The broadcast temporarily abandoned its frantic mission of nonstop overstimulation, bowing to the 23-year-old English soulstress's soaring, nearly a cappella (well done, subtle piano man) rendition of her heart-wrecking ballad [...] "Someone Like You." [...] In a modest black dress and with a few spare hand movements, she delivered all the shock and awe of a million-watt showstopper. Who needs special effects, when God gave you your own? Even Britney Spears looked like she had to fix her mascara {{when it was all}} over." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{began with}} all the wrestlers, managers, referees and agents of the WWF (except WWF Champion The Undertaker and Kane) {{standing}} on the entrance ramp. [...] Howard Finkel called for a ten-bell salute. Hart's former Nation of Domination comrades were emotional, most notably Mark Henry, who wept as he read a poem that he wrote in memory of Hart. A tribute video narrated by Vince McMahon then played on the Titan Tron. Throughout the broadcast, personal thoughts on Hart {{in the form of}} shoot interviews with various WWF Superstars were played. Before the first commercial break, such thoughts were aired from Mick Foley and Bradshaw. Foley noted that Hart was his son's favorite wrestler and had proudly gotten a haircut like Owen's, although he also said his son did not quite understand that [...] "nugget" [...] was not a term of endearment. Bradshaw talked about how Hart spent less money on the road than most wrestlers because he wanted to retire early and spend time with his family. Owen's friend and Nation of Domination partner The Rock also made a short speech before engaging in a short match against Val Venis. Test then spoke about a rib Owen pulled on him. [...] The broadcast ended with Stone Cold Steve Austin coming out for a special salute to Hart by climbing the turnbuckle and performing his famous [...] "beer-bash" [...] routine, ending with him giving a toast to Owen (whose picture was displayed on the TitanTron throughout the entire show) and leaving one beer in the ring (for Owen). The only notable absence from this show was The Undertaker as he decided to visit his real-life friend, Bret Hart. The tribute show scored a 7.2 Nielsen rating, making it the highest-rated special episode [...] in Raw history and the third highest-rated show overall. Shawn Michaels, in his Heartbreak and Triumph autobiography, notes that [...] "Owen is the only guy you could have a two-hour show for, and no-one would say a <b>bad</b> <b>word</b> about him." [...] The next day, WWF taped the episode of Raw for May 31, 1999. During that show, Jeff Jarrett defeated The Godfather to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship, the title Hart was booked to win for a third time at Over the Edge.
