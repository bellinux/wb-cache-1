The support groups themselves often bar discussion about the fraudulent perpetrator, {{in order to avoid}} further argument and negativity. Many forums do not recover, splintering or shutting down. In 2004, members of the <b>blog</b> <b>hosting</b> service LiveJournal established a forum dedicated to investigating cases of members of online communities dying—sometimes while online. Writer Howard Swains referred to the online deaths as [...] "pseuicides" [...] in Wired.com.

2500|$|Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, {{an online}} shared {{diary of a}} person's {{personal}} life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a wearable computer and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text {{was referred to as}} sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters. Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites. However, the evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of [...] "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated <b>blog</b> <b>hosting</b> services, or they can be run using blog software, or on regular web hosting services. Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.|$|E
