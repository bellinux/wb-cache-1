40|$|Abstract: Considering {{that there}} were very a few {{varieties}} of 3 D <b>braided</b> materials at present, some novel 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures were derived based on symmetry group theory. Group theory {{was used for the}} first time to describe the 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures was discussed. The whole analyzing procedure from the existing <b>braided</b> geometry structure to the <b>braided</b> symmetry group was described in detail. It is found that because the reflection operation does not exist in some point groups and space groups of <b>braided</b> structure and some odd lattices appeared, the <b>braided</b> symmetry group is not always the same as symmetry groups of crystallographic. The representative volume element of 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structure was deduced from <b>braided</b> space point group, and 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structure was obtained from <b>braided</b> space group. 3 D <b>braided</b> geometry structures can not only be classified based on <b>braided</b> group theory, but some of novel 3 D <b>braided</b> structures can be deduced through the group's symmetry operators. It is proved that some novel 3 D <b>braided</b> processes are feasible. <b>Braided</b> symmetry theory is an effective mathematical method for developing more and rational 3 D <b>braided</b> materials.

The other sections of the river flow through far more rugged terrain and are characterized by <b>braiding,</b> low nutrient content, shifting channels and coarse sediments, making it difficult for riparian zones to be established, as is with most of its upper and lower tributaries. Wetlands are found primarily where the river broadens into a series of sloughs, side-channels, marshes and small lakes before entering Kootenay Lake. This biologically diverse area, the Kootenay Flats, once supported over 1 million migratory birds every year, before the river was diked and many of the wetlands converted to agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{structure}} of the virtual <b>braid</b> group. It is shown that the virtual <b>braid</b> group is a semi–direct product of the virtual pure <b>braid</b> group and the symmetric group. Also, it is shown that the virtual pure <b>braid</b> group is a semi–direct product of free groups. From these results we obtain a normal form of words in the virtual <b>braid</b> group. We introduce the concept of a universal <b>braid</b> group. This group contains the classical <b>braid</b> group and has as its quotient groups the singular <b>braid</b> group, virtual <b>braid</b> group, welded <b>braid</b> group, and classical <b>braid</b> group. Recently some generalizations of classical knots and links were defined and studied: singular links [1, 2], virtual links [3, 4] and welded links [5]. One of the ways to study classical links is to study the <b>braid</b> group. Singular <b>braids</b> [6, 2], virtual <b>braids</b> [3, 7], welded <b>braids</b> [5] were defined similar to the classical <b>braid</b> group. Theorem of A. A. Markov [8, Ch. 2. 2] reduces the problem of classification of links to some algebraic problems of the theory of <b>braid</b> groups. These problems include the word problem and the conjugacy problem. There are generalizations of Markov theorem for singular links [9], virtual links, and welded links [10]. There are some different ways to solve the word problem for the singular <b>braid</b> monoid and singular <b>braid</b> group [11, 12, 13]. The solution of the word problem for the welded <b>braid</b> group follows from the fact that this group is a subgroup of the automorphism group of the free group [5]. A normal form of words in the welded <b>braid</b> group was constructed in [14]. In this paper we study {{the structure of}} the virtual <b>braid</b> group V Bn.

50|$|<b>Braided</b> area rugs can be {{constructed}} {{in a variety of}} different ways including a banded <b>braid</b> construction, cloth <b>braid</b> construction, flat <b>braid</b> construction and yarn <b>braid</b> construction.

A cloth <b>braid</b> construction is indicative of a time when outgrown clothing was cut into strips and then hand <b>braided</b> into a floor covering. This particular construction is unique to one manufacturer, Thorndike Mills. A flat <b>braid</b> construction is a common construction as it's one of the easier and more classic methods. Simply intertwine three ropes of fabric and/or yarn, and you'll have yourself a <b>braided</b> rug. A yarn <b>braid</b> construction evolves from yarn in its initial state to a uniquely finished area rug.|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies matter {{emergent}} as topological excitations {{of quantum}} geometry in quantum gravity models. In these models, states are framed four-valent spin networks {{embedded in a}} topological three manifold, and the local evolution moves are dual Pachner moves. We first formulate our theory of embedded framed four-valent spin networks by proposing a new graphic calculus of these networks. With this graphic calculus, we study the equivalence classes {{and the evolution of}} these networks, and find what we call 3 -strand <b>braids,</b> as topological excitations of embedded four-valent spin networks. Each 3 -strand <b>braid</b> consists of two nodes that share three edges {{that may or may not}} be <b>braided</b> and twisted. The twists happen to be in units of 1 / 3. Under certain stability condition, some 3 -strand <b>braids</b> are stable. Stable <b>braids</b> have rich dynamics encoded in our theory by dual Pachner moves. Firstly, all stable <b>braids</b> can propagate as induced by the expansion and contraction of other regions of their host spin network under evolution. Some <b>braids</b> can also propagate actively, in the sense that they can exchange places with substructures adjacent to them in the graph under the local evolution moves. Secondly, two adjacent <b>braids</b> may have a direct interaction: they merge under the evolution moves to form a new <b>braid</b> if one of them falls into a class called actively interacting <b>braids.</b> The reverse of a direct interaction may happen too, through which a <b>braid</b> decays to another <b>braid</b> by emitting an actively interacting <b>braid.</b> Thirdly, two neighboring <b>braids</b> may exchange a virtual actively interacting <b>braid</b> and become two different <b>braids,</b> in what is called an exchange interaction. <b>Braid</b> dynamics implies an analogue between actively interacting <b>braids</b> and bosons. We also invent a novel algebraic formalism for stable <b>braids.</b> With this new tool, we derive conservation laws from interactions of the <b>braid</b> excitations of spin networks. We show that actively interacting <b>braids</b> form a noncommutative algebra under direction interaction. Each actively interacting <b>braid</b> also behaves like a morphism on non-actively interacting <b>braids.</b> These findings reinforce the analogue between actively interacting <b>braids</b> and bosons. Another important discovery is that stable <b>braids</b> admit seven, and only seven, discrete transformations that uniquely correspond to analogues of C, P, T, and their products. Along with this finding, a <b>braid's</b> electric charge appears to be a function of a conserved quantity, effective twist, of the <b>braids,</b> and thus is quantized in units of 1 / 3. In addition, each $CPT$-multiplet of actively interacting <b>braids</b> has a unique, characteristic non-negative integer. <b>Braid</b> interactions turn out to be invariant under C, P, and T. Finally, we present an effective description, based on Feynman diagrams, of <b>braid</b> dynamics. This language manifests the analogue between actively interacting <b>braids</b> and bosons, as the topological conservation laws permit them to be singly created and destroyed and as exchanges of these excitations give rise to interactions between <b>braids</b> that are charged under the topological conservation rules. Additionally, we find a constraint on probability amplitudes of <b>braid</b> interactions. We discuss some subtleties, open issues, future directions, and work in progress at the end...|$|R
