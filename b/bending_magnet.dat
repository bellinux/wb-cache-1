25|$|Medical grade linacs {{accelerate}} electrons using a tuned-cavity waveguide, {{in which}} the RF power creates a standing wave. Some linacs have short, vertically mounted waveguides, while higher energy machines {{tend to have a}} horizontal, longer waveguide and a <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> to turn the beam vertically towards the patient. Medical linacs use monoenergetic electron beams between 4 and 25MeV, giving an X-ray output with a spectrum of energies up to and including the electron energy when the electrons are directed at a high-density (such as tungsten) target. The electrons or X-rays can be used to treat both benign and malignant disease. The LINAC produces a reliable, flexible and accurate radiation beam. The versatility of LINAC is a potential advantage over cobalt therapy as a treatment tool. In addition, the device can simply be powered off when not in use; there is no source requiring heavy shielding – although the treatment room itself requires considerable shielding of the walls, doors, ceiling etc. to prevent escape of scattered radiation. Prolonged use of high powered (>18MeV) machines can induce a significant amount of radiation within the metal parts of the head of the machine after power to the machine has been removed (i.e. they become an active source and the necessary precautions must be observed).|$|E

5000|$|Undulators {{can provide}} several orders of {{magnitude}} higher flux than a simple <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. For an undulator with N periods, the brightness can be up to [...] more than a <b>bending</b> <b>magnet.</b> The first factor of N occurs because the intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. The usual pulse is a sine with some envelope. The second factor of N comes from {{the reduction of the}} emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced as 1/N. When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively, the undulator stays dark. The same is true, if they come as a bead chain.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, if we {{know the}} particle's motion, cross {{products}} term, and phase factor, we could calculate the radiation integral. However, calculations are generally quite lengthy (even for simple cases as for the radiation emitted by an electron in a <b>bending</b> <b>magnet,</b> they require Airy function or the modified Bessel functions).|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of LEP, with long <b>bending</b> <b>magnets</b> and little {{access to the}} vacuum chamber between them, required distributed pumping. This is an early prototype for the LEP vacuum chamber, made from extruded aluminium. The main opening is for the beam. The small channel to the right is for cooling water, to carry away the heat deposited by the synchroton radiation from the beam. The 4 slots in the channel to the left house the strip-shaped ion-getter pumps (see 7810255). The ion-getter pumps depended on the magnetic field of the <b>bending</b> <b>magnets,</b> too low at injection energy for the pumps to function well. Also, a different design was required outside the <b>bending</b> <b>magnets.</b> This design was therefore abandoned, in favour of a thermal getter pump (see 8301153 and 8305170) ...|$|R
50|$|Linear accelerators {{are also}} {{widely used in}} medicine, for {{radiotherapy}} and radiosurgery. Medical grade linacs accelerate electrons using a klystron and a complex <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> arrangement which produces a beam of 6-30 MeV energy. The electrons can be used directly or they can be collided with a target to produce a beam of X-rays. The reliability, flexibility and accuracy of the radiation beam produced has largely supplanted the older use of cobalt-60 therapy as a treatment tool.|$|E

A FODO lattice with 24 <b>bending</b> <b>magnets</b> has been selected, offering low circumference and {{a high degree of}} flexibility in terms of lattice functions and working point. The large number of <b>bending</b> <b>magnets</b> provides a low beam emittance, appropriate to injection into the storage ring, and furthermore reduces the maximum required field of the cycled dipole <b>bending</b> <b>magnets.</b> The beam properties of the chosen solution allow RF power to be supplied using only two cavities, and relatively long free straights are available to accommodate the large septum demanded by 3 GeV beam extraction. Alternative "missing dipole" schemes to provide space for extraction have also been assessed; these do not provide a superior or more economical solution and lack the operating flexibility of the preferred design. ...|$|R
50|$|If an F {{quadrupole}} and a D quadrupole {{are placed}} immediately {{next to each}} other, their fields completely cancel out (in accordance with Earnshaw's theorem). But {{if there is a}} space between them (and the length of this has been correctly chosen), the overall effect is focusing in both horizontal and vertical planes. A lattice can then be built up enabling the transport of the beam over long distances—for example round an entire ring. A common lattice is a FODO lattice consisting of a basis of a focusing quadrupole, 'nothing' (often a <b>bending</b> <b>magnet),</b> a defocusing quadrupole and another length of 'nothing'.|$|E
5000|$|Fixed-Field Alternating Gradient accelerators (FFAG)s, {{in which}} a very strong radial field gradient, {{combined}} with strong focusing, allows the beam to be confined to a narrow ring, are {{an extension of the}} isochronous cyclotron idea that is lately under development. [...] They use RF accelerating sections between the magnets, and so are isochronous for relativistic particles like electrons (which achieve essentially the speed of light at only a few MeV), but only over a limited energy range for protons and heavier particles at sub-relativistic energies. Like the isochronous cyclotrons, they achieve continuous beam operation, but without the need for a huge dipole <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> covering the entire radius of the orbits.|$|E
50|$|A wiggler is an {{insertion}} device in a synchrotron. It {{is a series}} of magnets designed to periodically laterally deflect ('wiggle') a beam of charged particles (invariably electrons or positrons) inside a storage ring of a synchrotron. These deflections create a change in acceleration which in turn produces emission of broad synchrotron radiation tangent to the curve, much like that of a <b>bending</b> <b>magnet,</b> but the intensity is higher due to the contribution of many magnetic dipoles in the wiggler. Furthermore, as the wavelength (λ) is decreased this means the frequency (ƒ) has increased. This increase of frequency is directly proportional to energy, hence, the wiggler creates a wavelength of light with a larger energy.|$|E

50|$|In the Hyde {{design for}} a space {{fountain}} a stream of projectiles is shot up through the bore of a hollow tower at around 14 km/s. As the projectiles travel upward through the tower they are slowed down by electromagnetic drag devices that extract kinetic energy from the upgoing stream {{and turn it into}} electricity. As the projectiles are braked they also transfer some of their upward momentum to the tower structure, exerting a lifting force to support some of its weight. When the projectiles reach the station {{at the top of the}} tower they are turned around by a large <b>bending</b> <b>magnet.</b> In the turnaround process they exert an upward force on the station at the top of the tower, keeping it levitated above the launch point.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advantages}} of using synchrotron radiation for spectroscopy and diffraction have been realized by an ever-growing scientific community, {{beginning in the}} 1960s and 1970s. In the beginning, accelerators were built for particle physics, and synchrotron radiation was used in [...] "parasitic mode" [...] when <b>bending</b> <b>magnet</b> radiation had to be extracted by drilling extra holes in the beam pipes. The first storage ring commissioned as a synchrotron light source was Tantalus, at the Synchrotron Radiation Center, first operational in 1968. As accelerator synchrotron radiation became more intense and its applications more promising, devices that enhanced the intensity of synchrotron radiation were built into existing rings. Third-generation synchrotron radiation sources were conceived and optimized from the outset to produce brilliant X-rays. Fourth-generation sources that will include different concepts for producing ultrabrilliant, pulsed time-structured X-rays for extremely demanding and also probably yet-to-be-conceived experiments are under consideration.|$|E
