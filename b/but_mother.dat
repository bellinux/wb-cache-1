The percentage of the population with Hungarian as its mother tongue grew from 46.6% in 1880 to 54.5% in 1910.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Applause" [...] {{is about}} how Gaga is {{dependent}} upon her fan's adoration, while also serving as [...] "a kiss-off to critics". Bradley Stern of MuuMuse opined that [...] "Unlike 'Born This Way', 'Applause' is about celebrating no one <b>but</b> <b>Mother</b> Monster herself". According to Gaga, the song's lyrics highlight {{the difference between an}} artist and a celebrity. She elaborated, [...] "I live for the applause but I don't live for the attention in the way that people just love you because you're famous.

Their affair caused great scandal at court, with Alexander's heir (the Tsarevich) in particular protesting, though it was to be in vain. The tsar was devoted to Catherine and promised to marry her {{as soon as he was}} [...] "free," [...] meaning when his estranged and sickly wife Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna finally died. George ("Gogo") was the first child of Catherine and Alexander and was born in the tsar's study on 12 May 1872, in a difficult birth that almost killed his mother. Alexander had ordered that if the circumstances called for it, Catherine, and not the child, must be saved; <b>but</b> <b>mother</b> and son both lived, and the father happily wrote [...] "The Lord is so generous. I praised God, in tears I thank Him". Three more siblings later followed: Olga, Boris, and Catherine. Their births further tied the couple together.|$|E

[...] On September 24, the public ceremony followed filled with 'sadness and bitterness'. [...] "Thérèse found herself young enough, alone enough, to weep over the absence of Bishop Hugonin, Père Pichon, in Canada; and her own father, still confined in the asylum." [...] <b>But</b> <b>Mother</b> Marie de Gonzague wrote to the prioress of Tours, [...] "The angelic child is seventeen and a half, {{with the sense of}} a 30 year old, the religious perfection of an old and accomplished novice, and possession of herself, she is a perfect nun." ...|$|E
