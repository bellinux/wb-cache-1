A case of kyphosis has been observed in a North Carolina marsh rice rat.|$|E
5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of equine encephalitis, and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease,</b> infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E

He enlisted the aid of prisoner Dr. Berthold Epstein, a Jewish pediatrician and professor at Prague University. Mengele isolated the patients in a separate barrack and had several afflicted children killed so that their preserved heads and organs could be sent to the SS Medical Academy in Graz and other facilities for study.

5|$|The Gram-negative <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> {{brucellosis}} occasionally affects elk in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{the only}} place in the U.S. where the disease is still known to exist. In domesticated cattle, brucellosis causes infertility, abortions and reduced milk production. It is transmitted to humans as undulant fever, producing flu-like symptoms which may last for years. Though bison are more likely to transmit the disease to other animals, elk inadvertently transmitted brucellosis to horses in Wyoming and cattle in Idaho. Researchers are attempting to eradicate the disease through vaccinations and herd management measures, which are expected to be successful. Nevetheless, research has been ongoing since 2002, and a successful vaccine has yet to be developed as of 2016.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Enteric {{bacterial}} {{infections in}} poultry {{pose a threat}} to intestinal health and can contribute to poor feed efficiency and livability of a flock. A variety of enteric <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> are recognized in poultry. Three of these <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases,</b> necrotic enteritis, ulcerative enteritis, and spirochetosis, primarily infect the intestine, whereas other <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as salmonellosis, colibacillosis, mycobacteriosis, erysipelas, and fowl cholera, affect a variety of organ systems in addition to the intestine. Diagnosis of bacterial enteritis requires monitoring of clinical signs in the flock and proper use of diagnostic methods such as necropsy, histopathology, bacteriology, and serology...|$|R

500|$|The Yellowstone Park bison herd is {{the largest}} public herd of American bison in the United States. The {{relatively}} large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit bovine diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison {{have been exposed to}} brucellosis, a <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> that came to North America with European cattle that may cause cattle to miscarry. The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated that bison are the [...] "likely source" [...] of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and North Dakota. Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The Yellowstone Park bison herd reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are the Henry Mountains bison herd of Utah, at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota and in Elk Island National Park in Alberta.|$|E

40|$|The {{control and}} {{treatment}} of food crops <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> remain problematic due to a scarcity of effective phytotreatments. As traditional agricultural practices may represent an attractive venue to explore new treatments, Malagasy traditional practices were investigated for their effectiveness on potato plants. A survey was conducted among Malagasy farmers to collect information on diseases observed on potato crops and on traditional disease control practices. Twelve treatments against potato <b>bacterial</b> <b>diseases</b> were tested on two potato varieties, in experimental plots naturally infected by <b>bacterial</b> wilt <b>disease.</b> The information collected from 52 farmers (i) showed that leaf spots and <b>bacterial</b> wilt <b>disease</b> are the most frequently identified threats for potato crops; and (ii) allowed to identify 12 traditional treatments among which five exhibited protective properties on potato <b>bacterial</b> wilt <b>disease.</b> Moreover, one recipe (R 07) was effective on the two potato varieties after two applications per week for 10 weeks, with 50 % and 72 % effectiveness rate, respectively. Valorization of traditional practices may provide an effective, safe, economic and standardized phytotreatment against potato <b>bacterial</b> wilt <b>disease.</b> SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R

[...] Other uses include spray application in horticulture for protecting plants and vegetable produce from decay {{and the spread of}} <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease.</b> Other applications for bacteriophages are as biocides for environmental surfaces, e.g., in hospitals, and as preventative treatments for catheters and medical devices before use in clinical settings. The technology for phages to be applied to dry surfaces, e.g., uniforms, curtains, or even sutures for surgery now exists. Clinical trials reported in Clinical Otolaryngology show success in veterinary treatment of pet dogs with otitis.|$|E
2500|$|Pertussis (also {{known as}} {{whooping}} cough or 100-day cough) {{is a highly}} contagious <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease.</b> Initially, symptoms are usually {{similar to those of}} the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough. This is then followed by weeks of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase [...] "100-day cough". A person may cough so hard that they vomit, break ribs, or become very tired from the effort. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods where they do not breathe. The time between infection and the onset of symptoms is usually seven to ten days. Disease may occur in those who have been vaccinated, but symptoms are typically milder.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{vaccines}} contain live, attenuated microorganisms. Many {{of these}} are active viruses that have been cultivated under conditions that disable their virulent properties, or that use closely related but less dangerous organisms to produce a broad immune response. Although most attenuated vaccines are viral, some are bacterial in nature. Examples include the viral diseases yellow fever, measles, mumps, and rubella, and the <b>bacterial</b> <b>disease</b> typhoid. The live Mycobacterium tuberculosis [...] vaccine developed by Calmette and Guérin is not made of a contagious strain but contains a virulently modified strain called [...] "BCG" [...] used to elicit an immune response to the vaccine. The live attenuated vaccine containing strain Yersinia pestis EV is used for plague immunization. Attenuated vaccines have some advantages and disadvantages. They typically provoke more durable immunological responses and are the preferred type for healthy adults. But {{they may not be}} safe for use in immunocompromised individuals, and may rarely mutate to a virulent form and cause disease.|$|E
