5|$|The orchestral ritornello punctuates the {{movement}} for a third and last time, the upper strings playing the semiquaver figures, with the detached quavers on the <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oboes and off the <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> alto recorders. It leads directly into the homophonic coda {{in the last seven}} bars of {{the movement}}. With the same orchestral pairings as the fugato episode, the sopranos joyously sing out the beginning of the second fugue theme below trilling recorders before joining the polyphony of the other voices—with a last emphatic sospirans figure in the basses—for the final exultant rendition of the text.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{when the}} player confronts an enemy officer, the officer will {{challenge}} {{them to a}} one-on-one duel. If the player accepts, they will be transported to a small arena away from the main battlefield where a one-on-one fight with the officer will take place until either is victorious or time runs out. If the player declines, your morale will drop. If the player wins, their morale will rise and the enemy officer will {{be removed from the}} battlefield. If you accept the officers challenge they do become more difficult to <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> duel.|$|E

5|$|The song uses two-measure phrases that, {{aside from}} the choruses, use a i–III–IV–VI chord progression. The B minor chord is held for 1⅓ of a beat, and a {{relative}} transformation is then used to produce a second-inversion D major chord, which is held for 1⅔ of a <b>beat.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second measure, a first-inversion E major chord with an added ninth precedes a G major major seventh chord; the chords are held for the same durations as the previous two.|$|E
5|$|Lobates {{have eight}} comb-rows, {{originating}} at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond {{the body to}} the lobes; in species with (four) auricles, the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia {{in four of the}} comb rows. Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water, using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion, although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion. Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes, so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly. Unlike cydippids, the movements of lobates' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia, yet combs on the same row <b>beat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids. This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egg-like.|$|E
