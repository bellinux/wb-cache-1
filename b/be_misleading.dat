There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E

25|$|Note that {{shipments}} (to stores) do {{not mean}} sales to consumers (not necessarily {{in the year of}} shipment), so the use of the numbers as a popularity guide could <b>be</b> <b>misleading.</b>|$|E
25|$|Journal editors should {{consider}} issuing a correction if {{a small portion}} of an otherwise reliable publication proves to <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> (especially because of honest error), or the author / contributor list is incorrect (i.e. a deserving author has been omitted or somebody who does not meet authorship criteria has been included).|$|E
5000|$|The PSLRA {{requires}} a plaintiff to identify in his complaint [...] "each statement {{alleged to have}} <b>been</b> <b>misleading,</b> the reason or reasons why the statement <b>is</b> <b>misleading,</b> and if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed." [...] 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1). If a plaintiff's complaint does not specifically identify the allegedly fraudulent statements and explain why they <b>were</b> <b>misleading,</b> the complaint will be dismissed. By requiring plaintiffs to set forth their theory regarding why a particular statement <b>was</b> <b>misleading,</b> the PSLRA enables defendants to put forth arguments {{as to why the}} challenged statement was not, in fact, misleading. Note that Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure already required that allegations of fraud be pleaded with particularity.|$|R

25|$|The {{incidence}} of iatrogenesis may <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> in some cases. For example, ruptured aortic aneurysm is fatal in most cases; the survival rate for a ruptured aortic aneurysm is under 25%. Patients who die {{during or after}} an operation will still be considered as iatrogenic deaths, but the procedure itself remains a better bet than the 100% probability of death if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, the BBC's Whistleblower {{programme}} revealed security failures at the airport, including faulty {{metal detectors}} {{and a lack}} of regular random baggage checks. Many of the claims made on the programme were later discredited and much of the camera work was found to <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> (filming from a raised footpath was used to suggest there was no security fence on the southern perimeter of the site).|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} for identifying <b>misleading</b> advertising <b>is</b> presented, {{based solely on}} measured consumer beliefs. An advertisement <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> if an exposed group holds more false beliefs than a comparison group. When ten allegedly <b>misleading</b> advertisements <b>were</b> tested, two were identified as incrementally misleading, and four others were shown to <b>be</b> exploitively <b>misleading.</b> Determining whether an ad <b>is</b> <b>misleading</b> continues to prove difficult and controversial. Naturally, advertis-ers and consumer advocates rarely agree on whether a par-ticular ad <b>is</b> <b>misleading.</b> More disappointing, however, is the failure of researchers {{to agree on a}} broadly applicable definition of misleadingness or a {{procedure for}} identifying it (Gardner 1975; Jacoby and Small 1975; Preston 1976). The problem is further complicated by the conflict between the behavioral paradigm of researchers and the jurispruden-tial view of regulatory organizations...|$|R

25|$|Ringbone is {{exostosis}} (bone growth) in the pastern or coffin {{joint of}} a horse. In severe cases, the growth can encircle the bones, giving ringbone its name. It {{has been suggested}} by some authors that such a colloquial term, whilst commonly used, might <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> {{and that it would}} be better to refer to this condition as osteoarthritis of the inter-phalangeal joints in ungulates (Rogers and Waldron, 1995: 34-35).|$|E
25|$|One {{should also}} keep {{the purpose of}} the {{analysis}} in mind when choosing the prior distribution. In principle, uninformative and flat priors, that exaggerate our subjective ignorance about the parameters, may still yield reasonable parameter estimates. However, Bayes factors are highly sensitive to the prior distribution of parameters. Conclusions on model choice based on Bayes factor can <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> unless the sensitivity of conclusions to the choice of priors is carefully considered.|$|E

25|$|Voluntary, non-voluntary and {{involuntary}} types can {{be further}} divided into passive or active variants. Passive euthanasia entails the withholding treatment necessary for the continuance of life. Active euthanasia entails the use of lethal substances or forces, (such as administering a lethal injection), and is the more controversial. While some authors consider these terms to <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> and unhelpful, they are nonetheless commonly used. In some cases, such as the administration of increasingly necessary, but toxic doses of painkillers, there is a debate {{whether or not to}} regard the practice as active or passive.|$|E
25|$|In United States {{business}} law, a forward-looking statement or {{safe harbor}} statement {{is a statement}} that cannot sustain itself as merely a historical fact. A forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibilities. These statements can often <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> {{as they can be}} mistaken for factual statements, while they are actually speculation. According to United States Code 15 Section 78u-5, a forward-looking statement may include future economic performance such as revenues or income, plans for future operations, or use of a report written by an outside reviewer.|$|E
25|$|The {{median income}} for a {{household}} {{in the city}} was $30,463, and the median income for a family was $48,289. Males had a median income of $31,396 versus $24,611 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,566. About 8.7% of families and 24.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.1% of those under age 18 and 7.8% of those age 65 or over. However, traditional measures of income and poverty can <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> when applied to cities with high student populations, such as Manhattan.|$|E

25|$|However, {{anatomical}} comparisons can <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> as not all anatomical similarities {{indicate a}} close relationship. Organisms that share similar environments will often develop similar physical features, {{a process known}} as convergent evolution. Both sharks and dolphins have similar body forms, yet are only distantly related—sharks are fish and dolphins are mammals. Such similarities are a result of both populations being exposed to the same selective pressures. Within both groups, changes that aid swimming have been favored. Thus, over time, they developed similar appearances (morphology), even though they are not closely related.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia has a {{population}} of just over 27million. As of the 2010 Population and Housing Census, 61.3 percent of the population practices Islam; 19.8 percent Buddhism; 9.2 percent Christianity; 6.3 percent Hinduism; and 1.3 percent traditional Chinese religions. The remainder is accounted for by other faiths, including Animism, Folk religion, Sikhism, Baha'i and other belief systems. However, these figures may <b>be</b> <b>misleading</b> as professing the religion of Islam is a requirement for being a Malay {{in the sense of the}} Malaysian Constitution. Moreover, Muslims who wish to leave Islam face strong disincentives.|$|E
25|$|Culture or PCR are {{the current}} means for {{detecting}} {{the presence of}} the organism, as serologic studies only test for antibodies of Borrelia. OspA antigens, shedded by live Borrelia bacteria into urine, are a promising technique being studied. The use of nanotrap particles for their detection is being looked at and the OspA has been linked to active symptoms of Lyme. High titers of either immunoglobulin G (IgG) or immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to Borrelia antigens indicate disease, but lower titers can <b>be</b> <b>misleading,</b> because the IgM antibodies may remain after the initial infection, and IgG antibodies may remain for years.|$|E

They also note that the choice of the 1992 start date <b>is</b> <b>misleading,</b> because the largest increase in the number of tort cases occurred between 1970 and 1992.
