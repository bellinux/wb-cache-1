5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} {{untouched by the}} Civil War. Missouri, as a slave state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of <b>Boone</b> <b>County</b> and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, a black man, was lynched in 1889.|$|E

5|$|Ancient DNA and {{radiocarbon}} data {{indicates that}} local genetic populations {{were replaced by}} others within the same species or by others within the same genus. Both the dire wolf and the Beringian wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive, which may have outcompeted the dire wolf. Dire wolf remains having the youngest geological ages are dated at 9,440YBP at Brynjulfson Cave, <b>Boone</b> <b>County,</b> Missouri, 9,860YBP at Rancho La Brea, California, and 10,690YBP at La Mirada, California. Dire wolf remains have been radiocarbon dated to 8,200YBP from Whitewater Draw in Arizona, However, one author has stated that radiocarbon dating of bone carbonate {{is known to be}} unreliable, and that while many dire wolf remains are found in fossil assemblages dated to the terminal Pleistocene, there are no confirmed Holocene finds.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Rebecca and {{he moved}} back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first {{governor}} of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued {{to make their way}} through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer paid attention to the process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named <b>Boone</b> <b>County</b> in his honor.|$|E

A $3.5 million project to renovate and expand the Wabash Station, a rail depot built in 1910 and converted into the city's transit center in the mid-1980s, was completed in summer of 2007. In 2007, a Transit Master Plan was created to address the future transit needs of the city and county with a comprehensive plan to add infrastructure in three key phases.

5|$|The {{roots of}} Columbia's three {{economic}} foundations—education, medicine, and insurance—can {{be traced back}} to incorporation in 1821. Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became Stephens College. Columbia College, distinct from today's and later to become the University of Missouri, was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any other competing city and James S. Rollins donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle. Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became the current Columbia College. The city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the Santa Fe and Oregon trails, and later from the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. In 1822, the first hospital was set up by William Jewell. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first agricultural fair was held. By 1839, the population of 13,000 and wealth of <b>Boone</b> <b>County</b> was exceeded in Missouri only by that of St. Louis County, which, at that time, included the City of St. Louis.|$|E
