Tor Mohun {{takes its name from}} the tor or {{conspicuous}} hill known as Tor Hill today, and its suffix from the Mohuns who acquired the manor from the Brewers in the 13th century. The Mallocks resisted the changes convulsing Torquay for a long time because they did not want a town on their rural property, and they threw away a fortune rather than have it. It was not until 1865 that one of them consented to grant a <b>building</b> <b>lease,</b> and that only to a family connection.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being burned out {{from the rest of}} their tour, the band members were growing tired of the encompassing drug scene at their studio space and had entertained selling Bad Earth Studio to Ash before the <b>building</b> <b>lease</b> ran out on them. As they closed down the studio and moved their gear out, the reality of an indefinite hiatus sunk in. Franklin embarked on a solo career that would come to rival his previous band's creative output, first as the experimental electronic pop/folk group Toshack Highway, whose releases ranged from six-piece ensemble works to four-track bedroom recordings, and then as a more traditionally guitar-driven solo artist, continuing to this day as Adam Franklin & Bolts of Melody. Hartridge went on to establish a distribution company. Hindmarsh turned to managing bands full-time under Badearth management, which he founded in March 1998, eventually contracting with Scottish rock band Terra Diablo.|$|E
500|$|The {{club was}} founded in 1916 and {{experienced}} its first coverage in the Chicago Tribune on March 16, 1916. [...] It had office space in the Fine Arts Building that became too limiting to serve the club's mission. [...] In 1918, the club elected Rue Winterbotham Carpenter to replace Mrs. Robert McGann as president. [...] She moved the club to 610 South Michigan Avenue [...] [...] The first exhibition included portraits by Whistler, Renoir, Cassatt, August Johns and others. [...] By 1922, the club had outgrown its quarters and sponsored supplementary space at the Art Institute of Chicago until 1927 when {{the cost of doing}} so became prohibitive. [...] In 1924, the club moved to the north tower of the Wrigley Building. [...] Among its first exhibitions at the Wrigley building was the first major United States show (seventeen sculptures, nineteen drawings and a painting) of Brâncuși. [...] The show was installed by Marcel Duchamp. [...] Rue Carpenter died on December 7, 1931, and Mrs. Charles Goodspeed was elected president in 1932. [...] The club moved to more spacious accommodations at the Wrigley Building in 1936. [...] "Bobsy" [...] Goodspeed served as president until 1940. [...] Then, Rue Winterbotham Carpenter's niece Rue Winterbotham Shaw was elected President. In 1947, the club scaled down its operations for four years after losing its Wrigley <b>Building</b> <b>lease.</b> [...] In 1951, it moved to 109 East Ontario in quarters built to specification that were designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. [...] Using Arts Club furniture, he designed a gallery, dining room, and lecture hall in a pre-existing building. [...] The gallery was built around Constantin Brâncuși's The Golden Bird and the stairway was renowned for its simple elegance. [...] Shaw died in January 1979 and James Phinney Baxter was elected to serve until 1981 when Stanley Freehling was elected. [...] The club struggled financially in the 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Construction {{began in}} April 1963 on his Brawner Building (888 17th Street NW), a 12-story office {{building}} on Farragut Square which incorporated dark bronze panels and solarized windows {{much as his}} 1234 19th Street building had. By the late 1960s, {{it was one of}} his best-known designs. In January 1964, Koubek designed what was then the D.C. metropolitan region's tallest office building, the 19-story steel-and-black glass clad Barlow Building (5454 Wisconsin Avenue). In August, the Freed family commissioned him to build the eight-story Chatham Apartments, the first high-rise, medium-income apartment building to be constructed among the two-story Georgian-style townhouses that comprised the [...] Buckingham Historic District. His first major D.C. residential structure was a nine-story apartment building (now turned to condominiums) at 1800 R Street NW, which opened in October 1964. In April 1965, construction began on the seven-story 1325 Massachusetts Avenue NW, a Modernist building with broad horizontal swaths of grey brick and glass. (The structure was home to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in 2011.) Another major office building, 1200 17th Street, [...] NW (at the time, the headquarters of the American Psychological Association), opened in October 1965. It was a neo-Brutalist structure featuring repetitive polished concrete panels and deeply recessed rectangular windows, {{and one of the first}} high-rise office buildings on the downtown business district portion of Connecticut Avenue. That same year his 18-story Ross Building (now known as Wytestone Plaza) in Richmond, Virginia, opened—the first high-rise built in the city since 1928, and the first glass-curtain wall building constructed in the city. Koubek was also lead architect for and an investor in a syndicate ("Reservation Eleven Associates") which designed a new United States Department of Labor (DOL) building at 2nd Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW in 1966. The group proposed an arrangement in which it would construct the <b>building,</b> <b>lease</b> it to the federal government for 30 years, and then donate it to the government. Congress, cutting back on construction funds as well as interested in the build/lease/donate proposal, refused to appropriate funds for the DOL structure. Eventually, however, Koubek's syndicate lost the commission, and a new DOL building (jointly designed by the firm of Brooks, Barr, Graeber & White and the firm of Pitts, Mebane, Phelps & White) was completed in 1974.|$|E

6000|$|Exactly {{opposite}} to this house, in {{the angle of}} the road, stands an old house in a moderate-sized garden (Cambridge Lodge). Francis Bartolozzi, the celebrated engraver, who arrived in England in 1764, came to reside here in 1777. He was born at Florence in 1730, and died at Lisbon in 1813. His son, Gaetano Bartolozzi, father to the late Madame Vestris, was born in 1757, and died August 25th, 1813. Passing up the road, beside market gardens, is the old garden wall of Normand House, with some curious brick gates (now closed in): the house is very old; the date, 1661, is in the centre arch, over the principal gateway, and it {{is said to have been}} used as a hospital for persons recovering from the Great Plague in 1665. [Picture: Bartolozzi’s House] Sir E. Bulwer Lytton has resided here. In 1813 “it was appropriated for the reception of insane ladies” (Faulkner), and it is now a lunatic asylum for ladies, with the name of “Talfourd” on a brass plate. A little further on the road, out of which we have turned, is a cottage to the right named Wentworth Cottage. Here Mr. and Mrs. S. C. Hall once resided. The willow in front of the cottage was planted by them from a slip of that over the grave of Napoleon at St. Helena. The land opposite this cottage is now to be let on <b>building</b> <b>lease.</b> This district, now known as “Fulham Fields,” was formerly called “No Man’s Land,” and according to Faulkner, the local historian, contained, in 1813, “about six houses.” One of these was “an ancient house, once the residence of the family of Plumbe,” which was pulled down about twenty-three years ago, and replaced by a cluster of dwellings for the labourers in the surrounding market gardens, which extend from Walham Green nearly to the Thames in a north-west direction; “the North End Road,” as it is called, forming the eastern boundary of “Fulham Fields.” To establish the connection of Sylvester’s lines, quoted in the late Mr. Crofton Croker’s Paper on the “Golden Lion,” with this locality, the antiquary who pointed it out observed that— ...|$|E
