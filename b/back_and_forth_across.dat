5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control paddles {{on either side}} of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped {{from the top of the}} screen. The players bounce the ball <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally {{across the bottom of}} the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the screen as they advance toward {{the bottom of the screen}}. The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E
5|$|Farther to the west, {{a complex}} island arc {{assemblage}} formed above a subduction zone. To the east, in western Colorado, a mountain range similar to today's Himalayas called the Uncompahgre Mountains bordered the Utah lowland. The interfingering of the Kaibab with the White Rim Sandstone, now exposed in Capitol Reef National Park area, {{to the east}} suggests that the marine facies of the Kaibab migrated eastward {{in response to a}} relative sea-level rise, or transgression (the White Rim is not exposed in the Zion area). The sea moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> Utah, but by the Middle Permian, the sea had withdrawn and the Kaibab Limestone was exposed to erosion, creating karst topography and channels reaching 30m (100ft) in depth.|$|E

5|$|In the Battle of the Monongahela, the French {{and their}} Indian allies ambushed Braddock's reduced {{forces and the}} general was mortally wounded. After {{suffering}} devastating casualties, the British panicked and retreated in disarray. Washington rode <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the battlefield, rallying {{the remnants of the}} British and Virginian forces into an organized retreat. In the process, he demonstrated bravery and stamina, despite his lingering illness. He had two horses shot from underneath him, while his hat and coat were pierced by several bullets. Two-thirds of the British force of 976 men were killed or wounded in the battle. Washington's conduct in the battle redeemed his reputation among many who had criticized his command in the Battle of Fort Necessity.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking {{the entrance to the}} canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and {{it was not until the}} third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E
50|$|The Allen Scythe {{does not}} {{resemble}} a hand scythe but serves the same purpose. The engine drives a 2 ft or 3 ft or 4ft wide toothed blade sliding <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> horizontally <b>across</b> stationary teeth {{to produce a}} scissor action, and also drives two large wheels for forward travel. There are handles to allow the machine {{to be controlled by}} an operator walking behind it, controls comprise throttle and clutch. Separate ratchets allow either one or both wheels to be driven. In normal use only one is engaged so that turning is easier. The machines are extremely robust and many from the 1950s are still in regular use. They can be dangerous, as the clutch system only disengages the wheel drive from the engine: the blades cut all the time the engine runs.|$|R

5|$|The Arab–Khazar wars were {{a result}} of the {{attempts}} of the Umayyad Caliphate to secure control of Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus, where the Khazars were already established. The first Arab invasion, in the 640s and early 650s, ended with the defeat of an Arab force led by Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah outside the Khazar town of Balanjar. Hostilities broke out again with the Caliphate in the 710s, with raids <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the Caucasus. Led by the distinguished generals al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah and Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, the Arabs were able to capture Derbent and even the southern Khazar capital of Balanjar, but this had little impact on the nomadic Khazars, who remained able to launch devastating raids deep into Transcaucasia. In one such raid in 730, the Khazars inflicted a major defeat on the Umayyad forces at the Battle of Ardabil, killing al-Jarrah, but were in turn defeated the next year and pushed back north. Maslama then recovered Derbent, which became a major Arab military outpost and colony, before being replaced by Marwan ibn Muhammad (the future caliph Marwan II) in 732. A period of relatively localized warfare followed until 737, when Marwan led north a massive expedition that reached the Khazar capital Atil on the Volga. After securing some form of submission by the khagan, the Arabs withdrew.|$|E
5|$|M-72 starts its trans-peninsular journey at M-22 in the {{community}} of Empire on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. From there it runs easterly uphill through mixed farmland and forest to cross the base of the Leelanau Peninsula. As the highway approaches the city of Traverse City, the roadway runs downhill and weaves <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the Leelanau– Grand Traverse county line. M-72 merges with M-22 to run concurrently in the section of Traverse City in Leelanau County and immediately cross the county line into Grand Traverse County. The two highways run along Grandview Parkway, a four-lane boulevard on the shore of the West Arm of Grand Traverse Bay. At the intersection of Grandview Parkway and Division Street, M-22 ends. US31/M-37 run north along Division Street and turn east onto Grandview Parkway to join M-72. These three highways stay merged in a triple concurrency along the length of Grandview Parkway and across the Boardman River along the bay, bypassing downtown. They then follow Front Street until reaching Garfield Avenue east of downtown. At Garfield, M-37 turns north to run up the Old Mission Peninsula which separates the west and east arms of Grand Traverse Bay. US31/M-72 continues east along the shores of the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay and northward to a junction in Acme. M-72 turns east to cross rural eastern Grand Traverse County along rolling hills through the communities of Williamsburg and Barker Creek.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{attacks by}} Lee's army had done barely {{anything}} to accomplish Confederate objectives, {{but this did}} not deter Magruder, who rode <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours, {{with little or no}} organization. The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far right, near the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably farther up the hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 1933 Cochet turned professional, {{signing a}} {{contract}} with the Tilden Tennis Tour for a guaranteed annual payment of £25.000 and joined the team of Bill Tilden and Martin Plaa. Although he was still featured on the amateur world rankings published on the 20th of the month, where he was listed one spot behind Ellsworth Vines at number six, Cochet was also on Pierre Gillou's list in fourth place, also right after Vines. Cochet made his professional debut in a Franco-American match on 22 September and defeated Bruce Barnes. Three days later he lost to Tilden in straight sets. He also made appearances at the French Riviera with Plaa with <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> matches <b>across</b> France. On 10 October Tilden signed Vines to the pro tour and from then Cochet's archrival and him competed within the same league again.|$|R

25|$|Fascist Italy {{aimed to}} carve out a new Roman Empire, while British forces aimed {{initially}} to retain the status quo. Italy launched various attacks around the Mediterranean, which were largely unsuccessful. With the introduction of German forces, Yugoslavia and Greece were overrun. Allied and Axis forces engaged in <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> fighting <b>across</b> North Africa, with Axis interference in the Middle East causing fighting to spread there. With confidence high from early gains, German forces planned elaborate attacks to be launched to capture the Middle East and then to possibly attack the southern border of the Soviet Union. However, following three years of fighting, Axis forces were defeated in North Africa and their interference in the Middle East was halted. Allied forces then commenced an invasion of Southern Europe, resulting in the Italians deposing Mussolini and joining the Allies. A prolonged battle for Italy took place between Allied and German forces, and as the strategic situation changed in south-east Europe, British troops returned to Greece.|$|R

25|$|The {{effect is}} similar to a storm surge like that caused by hurricanes along ocean coasts, but the seiche effect can cause {{oscillation}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>across</b> the lake for some time.

50|$|Generally insects {{associated}} with carrion are strong and fast fliers, but with practice can be caught using an aerial net. The sweeping technique involves making quick <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> sweeps <b>across</b> {{the body in}} succession. Each time direction is changed {{the mouth of the}} net must be flipped 180 degrees to maintain one entrance. Speed is important not only for capturing insects, but for keeping those already caught inside. Generally 6-10 sweeps are sufficient, and on the last sweep the opening of the net is lifted so that is horizontal at about chest height, and then flipped 180 degrees to close the net. The tail end of the net can then place into a kill jar with the lid closed. After about 2 to 5 minutes the insects can be preserved. This procedure should be repeated approximately 3 times to ensure a good sample of flying insects in the area. Note that {{it may be necessary to}} use a sturdier net it wooded or brushy areas, so that the net won't tear.|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{and regulatory}} mechanisms of T cell migration through the endothelium {{have not been}} fully defined. In experimental, filter-based assays in vitro, transmigration of lymphocytes takes hours, compared with minutes, in vivo. We cultured endothelial cell (EC) monolayers on filters, solid substrates, or collagen gels and treated them with TNF-α, IFN-γ, or both prior to analysis of lymphocyte migration in {{the presence or absence}} of flow. PBL, CD 4 + cells, or CD 8 + cells took many hours to migrate through EC-filter constructs for all cytokine treatments. However, direct microscopic observations of EC filters, which had been mounted in a flow chamber, showed that PBL crossed the endothelial monolayer in minutes and were highly motile in the subendothelial space. Migration through EC was also observed on clear plastic, with or without flow. After a brief settling without flow, PBL and isolated CD 3 + or CD 4 + cells crossed EC in minutes, but the numbers of migrated cells varied little with time. Close observation revealed that lymphocytes migrated <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> continuously <b>across</b> endothelium. Under flow, migration kinetics and the proportions migrating <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> were altered little. On collagen gels, PBL again crossed EC in minutes <b>and</b> migrated <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> but showed little penetration of the gel over hours. In contrast, neutrophils migrated efficiently through EC and into gels. These observations suggest a novel model for lymphoid migration in which EC support migration but retain lymphocytes (as opposed to neutrophils), and additional signal(s) are required for onward migration...|$|R
50|$|On lap 58, {{just behind}} Al Unser (who {{was about to}} make a pit stop of his own), Savage, pushing hard in {{anticipation}} of a coming rainstorm, lost control as he exited turn four. Savage's car twitched <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> then slid <b>across</b> {{to the inside of the}} track at nearly top speed, hitting the angled inside wall nearly head-on. The force of the impact, with the car carrying a full load of fuel, caused the car to explode in a 60-foot-high plume of flame. Savage, still strapped in his seat in a large piece of the car, was thrown back across the circuit. He came to rest adjacent to the outer retaining wall, fully conscious and completely exposed while he lay in a pool of flaming methanol fuel.
