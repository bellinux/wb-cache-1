5|$|These all-infantry {{units were}} {{modelled}} on the cohorts of the legions, {{with the same}} officers and sub-units. They were typically considered to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a light infantry than proper legionaries. Some auxiliaries may however have been equipped with the lorica segmentata, the most sophisticated legionary body-armour, although scholars dispute this.|$|E
5|$|Early {{forecasts}} remarked {{the potential}} to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a threat to Hawaii than Pauline because Rick was further south than Pauline and thus less likely to weaken since Rick was over of warmer sea surface temperatures than Pauline. It did indeed approached the islands, coming close enough to require a high surf advisory. Even though Rick's intensity was much greater than Pauline's, Hurricane Pauline re-curved sooner than Rick. While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were {{significantly lower than the}} heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{adjectives}} {{change in}} meaning entirely {{depending on the}} verb used, sometimes meaning almost the opposite.

5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|Machete {{turned out}} to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a success {{at the box office}} than Grindhouse, {{grossing}} $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.|$|E
5|$|The Flash {{version of}} Flow {{received}} 100,000 downloads within {{its first two}} weeks of release, and had been played over 3.5million times by 2008. Its PlayStation 3 re-release was the most downloaded game on the PlayStation Network in 2007, and won the Best Downloadable Game award at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards. It was nominated for awards by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA). Reviewers praised Flows visual and audio appeal, but noted the simplicity of its gameplay; several considered it to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an art piece than a game.|$|E

5|$|The {{police force}} {{comprised}} around 200 {{men at the}} start, and Gens appointed Salk Dessler as his deputy commandant. Other chief subordinates included Joseph Muszkat and Meir Levas. Dessler was a Revisionist Zionist, and Muszkat and Levas had been members of the Betar, the youth movement of the Revisionist Zionists. The police force included many other former Betar members, and {{this may have been}} because Gens favored people coming from his own political leanings. This led to a conflict with the Bund, another Jewish political group. The Bund appears to have wanted the police force to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a militia, with Gens and his supporters wishing it to be a more conventional police force. After some initial political wrangling, Gens' faction won, but the Bundists remained strong in the Judenrat.|$|E
5|$|This is {{not always}} the case, however. In sexually dimorphic species, one sex may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a threat than the other, which could mimic the {{protected}} sex. Evidence for this possibility is provided by the behaviour of a monkey from Gabon, which regularly ate male moths of the genus Anaphe, but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female.|$|E

This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.|$|E

Pan was {{originally}} to be voiced by an older actor, but they called in Highmore instead, {{as it would}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an intimate relationship if Pan and Lyra were the same age, and also would underscore the contrast between Lyra's relationship with him versus her relationships with older male characters such as Lord Asriel, Lee Scoresby, and Iorek.|$|E
25|$|Lowell was at {{one time}} a sizable mining town located just to the {{southeast}} of Old Bisbee. The majority of the original townsite was consumed by the excavation of the Lavender Pit mine during the 1950s. All that is left today is {{a small portion of}} Erie Street, along with Evergreen Cemetery, Saginaw subdivision and Lowell Middle School. These days Lowell is considered by most of the local residents to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a place name than an operating community.|$|E

25|$|From {{the modern}} perspective—with most {{children}} now made safe from several terrible diseases by vaccination—it {{is easy to}} make the superficial interpretation that Leopold was acting foolishly, relying on divine will when direct action was available that would have helped his children. However, since in Leopold's day it was not firmly established that inoculation was beneficial, his remarks {{can be seen to}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> appeal to religion to resolve what must have seemed an impossible dilemma.|$|E
25|$|There would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> {{the same}} during the {{following}} tour of New Zealand in '86 under Jones. After winning the first Test in Wellington, the Wallabies were robbed of a series victory in the second Test when Welsh referee Derek Bevan disallowed a legitimate try by Steve Tuynman. The enigmatic Jones was Campo's greatest admirer, but after a wretched day at fullback, that relationship soured. 'Today we played without a fullback,' commented Jones {{to a group of}} exhausted players in the Australian dressing room.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Felt {{moved to}} Santa Rosa, California, from Alexandria, Virginia, his home since the 1970s. In 1992, {{he bought a}} house in Santa Rosa and after that lived with his {{daughter}} Joan Felt. He suffered a stroke before 1999, reported Ronald Kessler in his book The Bureau. According to Kessler's book, in the summer of 1999, Woodward showed up unexpectedly at the home of Felt's daughter and took him to lunch. Joan Felt, who was taking care of him at her home, told Kessler her father greeted Woodward like an old friend, and their mysterious meeting appeared to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a celebration than an interview.|$|E

25|$|Despite these problems, one of {{the main}} {{achievements}} of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3% of the total workforce. In fact labour shortages proved to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a problem. One area where the government was not quite as successful was in housing, which was also the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built.|$|E
25|$|A bust and {{historical}} plaque marks her birthplace in Toronto, now {{the site of}} the Hospital for Sick Children. The plaque was unveiled by her husband Buddy Rogers in 1973. The bust by artist Eino Gira was added ten years later. Her date of birth on the plaque is April 8, 1893. This can only be assumed to be because her date of birth was never registered – and throughout her life, beginning as a child, she led many people to believe that she was a year younger so she would appear to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> an acting prodigy and continue to be cast in younger roles, which were more plentiful in the theatre.|$|E
25|$|The {{trousers}} worn by Indiana Jones in {{all three}} films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks {{they are based on}} the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for Raiders are said to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for Temple of Doom and Last Crusade were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, pleated with seven belt loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.|$|E
