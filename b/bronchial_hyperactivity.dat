40|$|AbstractCystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) -related {{lung disease}} {{is characterized by}} a broad spectrum of pathologic changes. Most of these changes relate to progressive bronchiectasis and airway destruction due to recurrent infections. Other airway pathologies include {{but are not limited to}} nasal polyposis, <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity,</b> pneumothorax and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Constrictive obliterative bronchiolitis (COB) in CF is usually seen in post-transplant settings including lung and heart–lung transplants. We report a 13 -year-old boy with CF and intractable deterioration in lung function that was ultimately diagnosed as COB...|$|E
40|$|Asthma is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by airway chronic inflammation and <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity,</b> involving the imbalance of oxidative and antioxidative agents. There is an increased free radical generation and a decreased antioxidant enzyme activity, which correlate with {{the severity of the}} disease. The oxidative stress triggers specific physiopathological changes in the respiratory tract as a result of proinflammatory molecule formation, such as isoprostanes and PAF- like lipids. The synthesis of these mediators is dependent on the availability of lipid substrates, such as PUFAs, which are present in cell membranes. Therefore, lipid oxidation may have {{an important role in the}} perpetuation and amplification of the asthmatic inflammatory response. This article will make considerations about how oxidative stress contributes to asthma pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Children with {{sickle cell}} anemia (SCA) are prone to {{invasive}} infections caused by S. pneumonia, H. influenzae, and Plasmodium falciparum. The presence of asthma {{increases the risk of}} mortality, and it has been shown an association between the presence of <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> and the onset of acute chest syndrome. Like thalassemia, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative in most individuals with SCA. We report pulmonary function analyzed by spirometry, before and after transplantation, in a group of Nigerian SCA children. Our results indicate that restrictive pulmonary pattern (RVP) is a common finding in these patients. Although we do not observe significant improvements in lung function after 3 - 6 months of transplantation, it is useful to perform a spirometric evaluation of these patients at the time of transplant...|$|E
40|$|Yellow nail {{syndrome}} (YNS) {{is a rare}} occurrence, {{characterized by}} yellow nails together with lymphedema and/or chronic respiratory disorders. This syndrome was first described in 1964 by Samman et al. 1 Etiology is still unknown. The disease starts {{with the appearance of}} ungual anomalies. Patients generally suffer from chronic bronchitis and in some cases chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and recurrent pneumonia. Pleural effusions (30 % of cases) and <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> may also occur. 2 YNS is associated with several conditions, included autoimmune 3 and immunodeficiency disorders, 4 nephrotic syndrome, and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. 5 Occurrences in association with tumors such as endometrium cancers, 6 Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, 7 melanoma, 8 and breast 3 cancers have been reported. We report the second case, to our knowledge, of lung cancer associated with YNS registered in the world; Thomas et al 9 described the first one in 1987...|$|E
40|$|Allergic asthma is {{a complex}} {{inflammatory}} disorder characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilic inflammation and hypersecretion of mucus. Current therapies include &# 946; 2 -agonists, cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 antagonists and corticosteroids. Although these drugs demonstrate beneficial effects, their adverse side effects limit their long-term use. Thus, {{the development of new}} compounds with similar therapeutic activities and reduced side effects is both desirable and necessary. Natural compounds are used in some current therapies, as plant-derived metabolites can relieve disease symptoms {{in the same manner as}} allopathic medicines. Quercetin is a flavonoid that is naturally found in many fruits and vegetables and has been shown to exert multiple biological effects in experimental models, including the reduction of major symptoms of asthma: <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity,</b> mucus production and airway inflammation. In this review, we discuss results from the literature that illustrate the potential of quercetin to treat asthma and its exacerbations...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin {{converting}} {{enzyme inhibitors}} cause cough in some patients, but {{the mechanism of}} this effect is not known. Six patients in whom these inhibitors had caused cough and a further two patients in whom they were suspected to have caused worsening of bronchial asthma were studied. Nine patients in whom angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors had not been associated with cough served as controls. In the controls lung function and bronchial reactivity were measured once; for the study patients these and the cough index were measured twice before rechallenge for two weeks with an angiotensin enzyme inhibitor and once afterwards. Rechallenge with drug for two weeks caused {{a significant decrease in}} the mean concentration of histamine causing a 35 % fall in airways conductance and {{a significant increase in the}} cough index. Patients with cough showed <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> compared with the controls, which increased after rechallenge with the inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} an {{ovalbumin}} (OVA) model of inflammatory airway disease {{to explore the}} role of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> (BHR) and inflammation associated with asthma. OVA treated mice exhibited a 60 - 80 % reduction in steady-state mRNA levels of sGC subunits compared to control mice as determined by real-time PCR. Similarly, protein levels of the sGC subunits were reduced by 50 - 70 % in animals with asthma. In addition, inhibition of sGC activity using the selective inhibitor 1 H-[1, 2, 4] oxydiazolo[4, 3 -ea]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) lead to increased basal bronchial tone and airway reactivity to methacholine. ODQ-treated mice, also exhibited {{a significant increase in}} macrophage number in the bronchiolar lavage (BAL) that was not accompanied by changes in lung histology and interleukin- 13 production. These data indicate that sGC inhibition is accompanied by an inflammatory response that is qualitatively different from that observed in asthma (eosinophil infiltration and increased IL- 13 production). We conclude that sGC inhibition contributes to the BHR seen in asthma...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{histories of}} four children {{with a history of}} adverse reactions to local anesthesia and who required dental treatment are reviewed retrospectively. The children described had been referred to the allergy unit for evaluation between 1984 and 1985 and are representative of the dilemma of cases of suspected hypersensitivity to local anesthetics. The first two cases had been previously treated without the use of regional anesthesia because of a family history of atopic reactions as well as equivocal skin testing to local anesthetic. The third child had experienced bizarre adverse reactions to a variety of foods and detergents erroneously interpreted as possible deterrents to the use of local anesthetics. All four children were challenged with progressively increasing concentrations of lidocaine according to a described protocol. In three cases no reaction was observed and dental procedures were performed without difficulty using lidocaine for local anesthetics. A history of bronchoconstriction in the fourth child and the contradictory results of skin tests to local anesthetics, prompted the administration of pretreatment medication aimed at preventing <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> related to dental anesthesia...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Wood dust is a known {{occupational}} allergen that may induce, in exposed workers, respiratory diseases including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Samba (obeche, Triplochiton scleroxylon) is a tropical tree, which grows in West Africa, therefore, Polish workers are rarely exposed to it. This paper describes {{a case of}} occupational asthma caused by samba wood dust. Material and Methods: The patient with suspicion of occupational asthma due to wood dust was examined at the Department of Occupational Diseases and Clinical Toxicology in the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine. Clinical evaluation included: analysis of occupational history, skin prick tests (SPT) to common and {{occupational allergen}}s, determination of serum specific IgE to occupational allergens, serial spirometry measurements, metacholine challenge test and specific inhalation challenge test with samba dust. Results: SPT and specific serum IgE assessment revealed sensitization to common and occupational allergens including samba. Spirometry measurements showed mild obstruction. Metacholine challenge test revealed {{a high level of}} <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity.</b> Specific inhalation challenge test was positive and cellular changes in nasal lavage and induced sputum confirmed allergic reaction to samba. Conclusions: IgE mediated allergy to samba wood dust was confirmed. This case report presents the first documented occupational asthma and rhinitis due to samba wood dust in wooden airplanes model maker in Poland...|$|E
30|$|With 30  % {{estimated}} {{prevalence of}} <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> (Poirier et al. 2001), HIV infected men who smoke are frequently exposed to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. To reduce airway inflammation treatment guidelines for asthma and chronic obstructive airway disease (COPD) recommend the routine use of inhaled corticosteroid {{alone or in}} combination with long acting bronchodilators (National Asthma Education and Prevention Program 2002; Vestbo et al. 2013). Fluticasone is a potent glucocorticoid commonly used in reactive airway disease. Compared with other available inhaled steroids, it has high glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity, is highly lipophilic, a large volume of distribution (318  L) (Wuerthwein et al. 1992; Mackie et al. 1996) and a longer elimination half-life (t 1 / 2 7 – 8  h). Less than 1  % of swallowed fluticasone is bioavailable due to its high first pass metabolism and rapid metabolism in liver by CYP 3 A 4 enzyme system and conversion to inactive 17 B-carboxylic acid derivative (Harding 1990). Concomitant use of fluticasone with potent CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors such as ritonavir can lead to systemic accumulation of fluticasone and suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Ritonavir increased the area under concentration–time curve (AUC) of serum fluticasone by 350 -fold in healthy volunteers (Laboratories 2006). For this reason manufactures and the FDA recommend against routine use of combination of ritonavir and fluticasone unless benefits outweigh risks.|$|E
40|$|Background: A unique {{feature of}} {{alveolar}} mast cells is their low high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) expression. Recent discoveries in uncontrolled asthma {{suggest that the}} appearance of FcεRI-expressing alveolar mast cells may be a novel disease-specific feature of allergic asthma. This study investigates whether increased FcεRI-expressing alveolar mast cells are present in patients with mild allergic asthma or even in non-asthmatic allergic rhinitis patients (AR) who have developed <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> (BHR). Methods: Bronchial and alveolar tissues were obtained from healthy controls, AR patients with or without BHR, and AR patients with concurrent asthma. Samples were processed for immunohistochemical identification of MC(T) and MC(TC) and expression of FcεRI and surface-bound IgE. Results: Bronchial mast cell expression of FcεRI was high in all groups. In contrast, in the alveolar tissue, the expression of FcεRI on mast cells was low in healthy controls and in the AR patient groups, whereas a high expression was present in AR patients with concurrent asthma (P = 0. 006 compared to controls). The asthmatics had a 29 -fold increase in numbers (P = 0. 006) and a 19 -fold increase in proportion (P = 0. 007) of alveolar mast cells that expressed surface-bound IgE. Conclusions: The present data show that alveolar mast cells in patients with mild atopic asthma, but not atopic patients with AR, have turned into a highly FcεRI- and IgE-expressing phenotype. These data {{support the hypothesis that}} increased FcεRI expression on alveolar mast cells is a novel disease-specific feature of allergic asthma that is important for understanding asthma phenotypes and designing new therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity,</b> a {{key feature}} of active asthma in children, {{is a risk}} factor for {{respiratory}} adverse events in the peri-operative period. The presence of activated eosinophils in the lungs and mast cell degranulation can contribute to bronchial hyperreactivity. Eosinophil cationic protein is released by activated eosinophils and tryptase reflects mast cell degranulation. This study focused on the relationship of respiratory mechanics, eosinophil cationic protein and tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in asthmatic and healthy children under general anaesthesia. We measured eosinophil cationic protein and tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 21 asthmatic and 21 healthy children following induction of general anaesthesia. Respiratory system resistance and dynamic compliance were measured during mechanical ventilation. Eosinophil cationic protein was more common in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from asthmatics (12 / 21) than from controls (4 / 21, p = 0. 01) and was present at higher levels (p = 0. 002). Tryptase was also more common in the asthmatics (8 / 21 vs 1 / 21, p = 0. 01). Respiratory resistance was significantly higher in asthmatic children with detectable eosinophil cationic protein levels than in those with undetectable eosinophil cationic protein levels (p = 0. 019). Furthermore, 50 % of the asthmatics with detectable eosinophil cationic protein exhibited bronchospasm after sampling their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These findings suggested that high levels of eosinophil cationic protein in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are associated with irritable airways, presumably secondary to airway inflammation, and this might be a useful marker for respiratory adverse events in the peri-operative period...|$|E
40|$|Xenobiotics {{can trigger}} degranulation of eosinophils and mast cells. In this process, the cells release several {{substances}} leading to <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity,</b> the main feature of atopic asthma (AA). GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 genes encode enzymes {{involved in the}} inactivation of these compounds. Both genes are polymorphic in humans and have a null variant genotype in which both the gene and corresponding enzyme are absent. An increased risk for disease in individuals with the null GST genotypes is therefore, but this issue is controversial. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of the GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 genotypes on the occurrence of AA, as well as on its clinical manifestations. Genomic DNA from 86 patients and 258 controls was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The frequency of the GSTM 1 null genotype in patients was higher than that found in controls (60. 5 % versus 40. 3 %, p = 0. 002). In individuals with the GSTM 1 null genotype the risk of manifested AA was 2. 3 -fold higher (95 %CI: 1. 4 - 3. 7) than for others. In contrast, similar frequencies of GSTT 1 null and combined GSTM 1 plus GSTT 1 null genotypes were seen in both groups. No differences in genotype frequencies were perceived in patients stratified by age, gender, ethnic origin, and severity of the disease. These results suggest that the inherited absence of the GSTM 1 metabolic pathway may alter the risk of AA in southeastern Brazilian children, although this must be confirmed by further studies with a larger cohort of patients and age-matched controls from the distinct regions of the country...|$|E
40|$|In an {{introduction}} to our study we reviewed the different phases of human work related to grain and grain dust, the nosology resulting from exposure {{and the role of}} immune mechanisms involved in its pathogenese. The aim of th study was: 1. To evaluate the level of dust exposure of our population. 2. To analyze the contaminants of grain and its constituents. 3. To evaluate respiratory symptoms prevalence in workers exposed to cereal, in different phases of their work. 4. To correlate the symptoms with professional exposure. 5. To evaluate relevance of factors related to the exposed workers in symptoms prevalence. 6. To evaluate the presence of hypersensibility to grain and grain dust and its role in the pathogenese of symptoms and diseases indentified in our population. In our study we included four groups of workers: workers of a grain silo in the harbor of Lisbon, mill workers exposed to grain and flour, malt workers from a distillery and clerks who were used as control group. The work environment of exposed workers was studied, namely the manufacturing cycle, the level of grain dust in the atmosphere and the presence of fungi, bacteria and parasites in various samples of cereals. In what concerns the study, it consisted of the application of a questionnaire in order to verify the prevalence of respiratory, nasal, eye, systemc and skin complaints, chest Xray, pulmonary function testing, skin testing with commercial allergens and with extracts made with grain samples from the work place, and laboratorial studies. Conclusion: - In every work place with exposure, grain dust levels are higher than those admitted internationally and than those with harmful effects. - Grain and by-products contaminantion was intense and assorted being worrying the prsence of bacteria, fungi and acarus with proved pathogenic action. - The high prevalence of symptoms in all studied populations and the fact of being related, by a great number of workers, with the exposure to grain, reveal the aggressiveness of these products. The higher prevalence of Chronic Bronchitis, the appearence of Hay Fever and Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis, the ventilation disorders and the higher prevalence of <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> support this statement. - The existence or not of atopy has no relation with the appearence of symptoms. - The higher prevalence of positive skin tests with allergens related with exposure, the evidence of postive precipiting to some of the used extracts, show a hypersensitivity to grain and its by-products in exposed population. However, the lack of correlation between hypersensitivity and the existence of symptoms relted with exposure, exclude the hypothesis that the complains have an exclusive immunological genesis. - In what concerns the mechanisms of grain pathogenic action in humans, the identification, in our samples, of different micro-organisms, the proved allergizing power of some of them (Sitophilus granariua) and the pathogenic action of endotoxins produced by some identified bacteria (Erwinia herbicola), suggest the presence of various immunological and non-immunological mechanisms in the genesis of the reported complaintsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Asthma bronchiale is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} airways, connected to <b>bronchial</b> <b>hyperactivity</b> leading to shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness and cough. It effects people of all age categories and cannot be efficiently cured nor prevented. The incidence ranks this disease among the most common children´s chronic diseases. It affects {{a significant part of}} the global population - records say about 300 million people. Its prevalence has dramatically increased over the last 20 years. It is estimated that in 2025 about 400 million people will suffer from asthma. Cornerstones of asthma control are based on early diagnostics, efficient treatment, adherence to lifestyle changes and proper use of inhalation devices. Once the treatment is effective and check-ups and the use of inhalation therapy are regular, the prognosis of asthma is very favourable and it is possible to improve the patient´s quality of life. The control over asthma and its maintenance is the main objective of treatment. This can be achieved by using anti-inflammatory therapy, especially in inhalation form. This Bachelor´s thesis focuses on mapping inhalation systems with patients with asthma bronchiale. To a large extent it deals with the issue of use of inhalation systems, keeping to lifestyle changes and the role of the nurse in asthma-specialized outpatient´s departments. We see the relevance of this topic in the fact that, despite all available literature and medical advice, many asthmatics still make mistakes in the inhalation technique. Wrongly selected inhalation systems or wrongly selected inhalation techniques results in therapeutic failures and problems of patients get worse. This does not maintain control over asthma. The fact that many asthmatics do not know their exact diagnosis and underestimate some symptoms is very alarming. In the introduction, the theoretical part focuses on the definition of the disease. Other chapters include causes and symptoms of asthma, its classification, diagnostics and treatment. It also provides information about the treatment of acute asthma attacks - exacerbation and the role of the nurse in examination of an asthmatic patient. A great part of the thesis deals with inhalation systems, their types and effects. The preparation for the use of manual handheld inhalers and nursing care for the asthmatic patient in outpatient and inpatient care is developed at the end of the theoretical part. The objective of this part was to summarize the current knowledge about this issue. The objective of the Bachelor´s thesis was to map the use of inhalation systems in patients with asthma bronchiale. The following research questions were used: How do nurses inform patients about the use of inhalation systems? What type of inhaler do patients like? What is the nurse´s involvement in the examination of asthmatic patients? What are the most common mistakes in the application with an inhaler? How do asthmatics keep to lifestyle changes? The practical part of the thesis contains the results of qualitative research which was made on the basis of the semi-structured interview. Final interviews were transcribed and subsequently processed by the technique of open coding. The research sample was made of 12 asthmatics and 9 nurses working in selected asthma-specialized outpatient´s departments. With respect to the results found, an information brochure was created - see Annex 7 - which is intended for use by asthmatics. We believe that the results of this thesis will be helpful for asthmatics and increase the interest of experts in this issue and will also address other people willing to take part in its solution...|$|E
