Interaction takes place when the different metal ions compete for the same sorbent active sites. In this work, sorption of Cu(II), Cd(II), Ni(II) and Pb(II) onto grape stalks waste in single and <b>binary</b> <b>mixtures</b> has been investigated. Sorption {{studies were carried out}} in continuous mode by using packed columns with grape stalks waste.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{proposed}} a QSAR model to predict joint effects at non-equitoxic ratios for <b>binary</b> <b>mixtures</b> containing reactive toxicants, cyanogenic compounds and aldehydes. Toxicity of single and <b>binary</b> <b>mixtures</b> {{was measured by}} quantifying the decrease in light emission from the Photobacterium phosphoreum for 15 min. The joint effects of <b>binary</b> <b>mixtures</b> (TUsum) can thus be obtained. The {{results showed that the}} relationships between toxic ratios of the individual chemicals and their joint effects can be described by normal distribution function. Based on normal distribution equations, the joint effects of <b>binary</b> <b>mixtures</b> at non-equitoxic ratios (TUsumn:m) can be predicted quantitatively using the joint effects at equitoxic ratios (TUsum 1 : 1). Combined with a QSAR model of TUsum 1 : 1 in our previous work, a novel QSAR model can be proposed to predict the joint effects of mixtures at non-equitoxic ratios (TUsum n:m). The proposed model has been validated using additional mixtures other than the one used {{for the development of the}} model. Predicted and observed results were similar (p 3 ̆e 0. 05).
