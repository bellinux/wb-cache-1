5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist {{was built}} {{on the site of the}} former Nos.49–50 in 1885, and was consecrated on 23 November. The <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> £5,100 (now £) and catered for {{services}} in the local parish that had previously been held in rooms or temporary buildings. The church covered a district between Oxford Street, Poland Street, Brewer Street, Bridle Lane, Carnaby Market and Argyll Street.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{multi-storey}} car parks provide lower <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> per parking slot, as {{they typically}} require less building volume and less ground area than a conventional facility {{with the same}} capacity. However, {{the cost of the}} mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs {{to be added to the}} <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> to determine the total cost. Other costs are usually lower too, for example there is no need for an energy-intensive ventilating system, since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed.|$|E

25|$|The airport's {{long term}} {{expansion}} opportunities {{are subject to}} variables. An HKD 80 billion proposal to build a third runway has been under feasibility study and consultation but would be very expensive as it would involve additional reclamation from deep waters, and the <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> of the third runway may {{be as high as}} the <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> of the entire airport. On the other hand, there exists only one airway between Hong Kong and mainland China, and this single route is often and easily backed up causing delays on both sides. In addition, China requires that aircraft flying the single air route between Hong Kong and the mainland must be at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. Talks are underway to persuade the Chinese military to relax its airspace restriction in view of worsening air traffic congestion at the airport. Other than that, Hong Kong Airport Authority is co-operating with other airports in the area to relieve air traffic and in the future, Shenzhen may act as a regional airport while Hong Kong receives all the international flights.|$|E

A large portion of the funds came from Ella M. Smith, daughter of Benjamin F. Smith, in 1889. The library was staffed by D. F. W. Bursch, the library's first trained librarian, who oversaw the implementation of the Dewey Decimal system. It contained 20,000 volumes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recently the {{potential}} development of green architecture {{in our country}} is huge, but inaccurate control of green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost</b> is the key reason for restricting its development. After analyzing influencing factors of green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost,</b> four influencing factors are put forward:technical measures, project regions,fixed position and time to research feasibility. On basis of the factors, the ways are proposed to reduce green <b>building’s</b> incremental <b>cost,</b> which provides theoretical basis {{for the development of}} green architecture. introduction China has promoted green building thoroughly,but people still have misunderstanding about green <b>building’s</b> <b>cost</b> at present: <b>cost</b> of <b>building</b> will increase much when connecting with “green”. Green <b>building</b> signifies high <b>cost.</b> Professionals in architecture and real estate also overestimate green <b>building’s</b> <b>cost</b> that even reaches up to 300 %. The reason that causes misunderstanding is the choice of pilot projects with relatively high price in previous green real estate; the theory of high technological mansion is propagated greatly. Although the primary investment <b>cost</b> of green <b>building</b> is higher than normal building, we should also notice the profit brought by green <b>building</b> except incremental <b>cost.</b> （ 1 ）direct benefit-energy conservation and expense-saving produced by incrementa...|$|R

Trigg's will established a Trigg-C.M. Russell Foundation and donated these items to the city provided that the city built a museum to house the collection within two years. Leonard Regan, an executive with the Montana Power Company, led a fundraising drive which netted $75,000, and in 1953 the Trigg-Russell Memorial Gallery (as the museum was originally known) opened on September 26, 1953. The <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> $58,175 to construct.|$|E
25|$|This is a Grade II* listed {{building}} in Church Lane, Hartshead, West Yorkshire. This Anglo-Norman church of 1120 was heavily and completely restored by Barber at a <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> of £2,530 in 1881, {{and his work}} {{is included in the}} English Heritage listing description. The south door, the west tower and the chancel arch are original 12thcentury features. In the churchyard is a sundial of 1610 and a watch house or bier house of around 1828 which {{has been used as a}} school room. On the opposite side of the road are stocks; these three items are also listed.|$|E
25|$|This {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{reinforced}} concrete churches in the UK. It stood on Rochdale Road, Triangle, Thorpe, Halifax, West Yorkshire. Barber designed it for a congregation of 300 at a <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> of £7,000 in 1880. It was consecrated on 23 September of that year. It had a carved, Caen stone altarpiece and stained glass windows by Heaton, Butler and Bayne of London. The building sustained severe fire damage in 1917; it cost £5,000 to restore, and was reconsecrated on 17 June 1923. It closed on 9 June 1968 and was demolished in 1973.|$|E

40|$|Orb-web spiders build {{vertically}} asymmetric webs, {{in which}} the lower part {{is larger than the}} upper part. One hypothesis explaining this asymmetry suggests that the spiderís mass imposes higher <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> in {{the upper part of the}} web, causing the spider to reduce this part of the web. We tested this hypothesis by assessing <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> of different parts of the web. We found that the specific time-cost of building (i. e. the time required to build a certain length of silk) differed between the two parts of the web and that the difference in time-costs influenced web asymmetry. Contrary to predictions, however, <b>building</b> <b>costs</b> were larger in the lower part of the web, suggesting that additional factors affect the spiderís decisions while building the web, which are likely to be prey-capture considerations...|$|R

25|$|In 1920, American Renaissance {{architect}} Charles A. Platt {{had designed}} the gallery of the LAA, a service he {{donated to the}} group. Due to the fact the artists were self-funding and the resources were limited, the artists asked him to lower the skylights of his initial design, which he reluctantly agreed to do. New London-based contractors Canning & Leary were awarded the contract to construct Platt's final design, for a <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> of $20,000. Artist Lawton S.

25|$|This was a Grade II listed {{building}} {{which had a}} spire. It was sited {{on the corner of}} Lister Lane and Rhodes Street, Halifax, West Yorkshire. It was designed by Mallinson & Barber to accommodate a congregation of 800, at a <b>building</b> <b>cost</b> of £10,000, and consecrated on 4 July 1870 by the Bishop of Ripon. It contained an organ built by William Hill. In 1952 the congregation was joined with St James to become the combined Church of St Mary and St James. The church was declared redundant and closed in 1986, and was demolished in January–February 2001 and replaced by a housing development.|$|E
25|$|Sophisticated 3-D {{building}} energy simulation {{tools are}} available to model how a building will perform {{with a range of}} design variables such as building orientation (relative to the daily and seasonal position of the sun), window and door type and placement, overhang depth, insulation type and values of the building elements, air tightness (weatherization), the efficiency of heating, cooling, lighting and other equipment, as well as local climate.
