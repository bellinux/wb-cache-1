5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and Jesus of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|The mind of William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) still {{possesses}} Olivia's (Anna Torv) body {{after several}} failed attempts to extract it to recently deceased corpses. Walter (John Noble) and William <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{less than a}} day before Olivia's mind will be lost. They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) will enter Olivia's mind with the aid of LSD to locate her ego and help it to regain dominance in her mind, while Walter hopes to download William's mind into a computer.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack of condom use during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
25|$|The most {{efficient}} way to handle a pollen allergy is by preventing contact with the material. Individuals carrying the ailment may at first <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a simple summer cold, but hay fever becomes more evident when the apparent cold does not disappear. The confirmation of hay fever can be obtained after examination by a general physician.|$|E
25|$|Rarely will a {{producer}} use oak for both fermentation and maturation. Grand Cru and Premier Cru wines {{are most likely}} to see oak: proponents <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> necessary structure and enough extract to avoid being overwhelmed by oak influence. While there are style differences among producers, rarely is basic AOC Chablis or Petit Chablis oaked.|$|E

25|$|Converting {{adherents of}} other {{religions}} is widely accepted within Christianity. Many Christian organizations <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{a duty to}} make converts among every people. In recent years, ecumenism and dialogue between different religions has been endorsed by many official representatives of the Christian churches, {{as a way of}} effecting reconciliation between Christian people and people of other faiths, leading to many cases of reconciliation. In some cases, this endorsement is accompanied by a complete disavowal of all proselytizing efforts under the banner of religious pluralism.|$|E
25|$|Some {{heterosexual}} feminists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been unfairly {{excluded from}} lesbian feminist organizations. The lesbian quarterly Common Lives/Lesbian Lives had {{a policy that}} all work published in CL/LL was produced by self-defined lesbians, {{and all of the}} project's volunteers were lesbians. Due to this policy, a complaint was filed with the University of Iowa Human Rights Commission by a heterosexual woman who believed she was discriminated against when not hired to be an intern. A complaint was also lodged with the collective by a bisexual woman whose submission to the magazine was not published.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{cause of}} shyness varies. Scientists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> located genetic data {{supporting}} {{the hypothesis that}} shyness is, at least, partially genetic. However, {{there is also evidence}} that suggests the environment in which a person is raised can also be responsible for their shyness. This includes child abuse, particularly emotional abuse such as ridicule. Shyness can originate after a person has experienced a physical anxiety reaction; at other times, shyness seems to develop first and then later causes physical symptoms of anxiety. Shyness differs from social anxiety, which is a broader, often depression-related psychological condition including the experience of fear, apprehension or worrying about being evaluated by others in social situations to the extent of inducing panic.|$|E

25|$|The CPC don't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{abandoned}} Marxism. The party {{views the}} world as organized into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that socialism, {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Marx wrote that capitalists, in their search for profit, would travel the world in a bid to establish new international markets – hence, it is generally assumed that Marx forecasted globalization. His writings on the subject is used to justify the CPC's market reforms, since nations, according to Marx, have little choice in the matter of joining or not. Opting not to take part in capitalist globalization means losing out in the fields of economic development, technological development, foreign investment and world trade. This view is strengthened by the economic failures of the Soviet Union and of China under Mao.|$|E
25|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the difference between the hot-hand and gambler's fallacy. The gambler's fallacy is the expectation of a reversal following a run of one outcome. Gambler's fallacy occurs mostly in cases in which people feel that an event is random, such as rolling a pair of dice on a craps table or spinning the roulette wheel. It is caused by the false belief that the random numbers of a small sample will balance out the way they do in large samples; this is known as the law of small numbers heuristic. The difference between this and the hot-hand fallacy is that with the hot-hand fallacy an individual expects a run to continue. There is a much larger aspect of the hot hand that relies on the individual. This relates to a person's perceived ability to predict random events, which is not possible for truly random events. The fact that people <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> this ability is in line with the illusion of control.|$|E
25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate George Soros warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, he cautions, Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E

500|$|Billen {{called the}} episode [...] "distressing comedy to watch", {{but said that}} [...] "the acting, the scripting, the satisfactions of one-act {{resolution}} and the laughter it generated" [...] were redeeming qualities, and gave the episode four {{out of a possible}} five stars. Dessau felt that parts of the script were predicable, but some twists [...] "catch you completely unaware", while the ending [...] "may haunt [...] for days". Jack Seale, of the Radio Times, suggested that viewers will <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> guessed the plot by the half-way point in the episode. However, he said that the writers [...] "give their story of how we're all one slip away from the gutter a chilling sense of rising dread" [...] which counteracts this. [...] "Nobody", he said, [...] "plays wicked games with the audience more skilfully." [...] Larushka Ivan-Zadeh and Carol Carter, writing in Metro, suggested that viewers would want to rewatch the episode in an attempt to pick up clues to the plot twists that they originally missed.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the episode}} is a {{reference}} to the 1989 comedy film Weekend at Bernie's, in which two young insurance executives try to convince people that their deceased boss is alive. The last part of the episode, in which Homer and Smithers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> killed Burns, is based on the film's plot. While under the influence of marijuana, Homer shaves his beard, causing blood to pour out from his face. To Homer, the blood looks like psychedelic rainbows, and the song that plays during the scene is [...] "Wear Your Love Like Heaven" [...] by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. When speaking at the Phish concert, Homer stands in front of a large picture of himself. The scene is {{a reference to the}} 1941 drama film Citizen Kane, in which the main character Charles Foster Kane makes a political speech in front of a large picture of himself. In another scene, Homer and Smithers smoke marijuana in order to find Mr. Burns' jokes funny. While high, Smithers wears a suit similar to one worn by American actress and singer Judy Garland. While talking to Homer, Smithers forgets to take Mr. Burns out of his bathtub. Horrified, Smithers thinks that the unconscious Mr. Burns has drowned. The scene is a reference to [...] "The Big High", an episode of the television crime drama Dragnet in which a married couple accidentally drown their baby while they are smoking marijuana.|$|E

2500|$|In {{personality}} psychology, {{locus of}} control {{is the degree to}} which people <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality studies. A person's [...] "loci" [...] (plural of [...] "locus", Latin for [...] "place" [...] or [...] "location") are conceptualized as internal (a belief that one's life can be controlled) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which they cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).|$|E
