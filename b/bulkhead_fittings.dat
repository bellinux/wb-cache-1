50|$|A {{scheme for}} unitised engine {{installations}} was {{initiated by the}} Air Ministry in 1937 and after consultation with the Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) a system was devised allowing standardised dimensions and <b>bulkhead</b> <b>fittings</b> for both inline and radial engine installations of similar power.|$|E
40|$|Computer program simulates {{specific}} <b>bulkhead</b> <b>fittings</b> by subjecting {{the desired}} geometry configuration to a membrane force, an external force, an external moment, an external tank pressure, or {{any combination of}} the above. This program generates a general model of <b>bulkhead</b> <b>fittings</b> for the Saturn booster...|$|E

5000|$|Tank Connectors are {{basically}} {{a type of}} tank fitting which {{is also known as}} Tank Inlet or may be called tank outlet or <b>bulkheads.</b> This <b>fitting</b> must be leakage proof as the water supply (Inward and Outward) depends on the same. There exist many different varieties of Tank Connectors, This variation is of its design which is different for different type of applications.

40|$|Hypersonic {{research}} {{aircraft design}} requires careful consideration of thermal stresses. This paper relates {{some of the}} problems in a heat sink structural design that can be avoided by appropriate selection of design options including material selection, design concepts, and load paths. Data on several thermal loading conditions are presented on various conventional designs including <b>bulkheads,</b> longerons, <b>fittings,</b> and frames. Results indicate that conventional designs are inadequate and that acceptable designs are possible by incorporating innovative design practices. These include nonintegral pressure compartments, ball-jointed links to distribute applied loads without restraining the thermal expansion, and material selections based on thermal compatibility...|$|R
