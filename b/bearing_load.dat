The designed head of the generator is [...] The flow rate varies between [...] depending on the head available. The greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines. Turbine diameter is 9.7/10.4m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and rotation speed is 75revolutions per minute. This means {{that in order to}} generate power at 50Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles per phase, for a total of 240 poles per rotor to generate 50Hz three-phase power. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20kV. The electricity generated is then stepped-up to 500 kV for transmission at 50Hz. The outer diameter of the generator stator is 21.4/20.9m. The inner diameter is 18.5/18.8m.

5000|$|If the {{lubricant}} is removed, {{the bearings}} and races can touch directly. While bearings and races appear smooth to the eye, they are microscopically rough. Thus, high points of each surface can touch, but [...] "valleys" [...] do not.

40|$|LecturePg. 33 - 44 Turbomachines {{that run}} well above their {{fundamental}} lateral critical speeds (super-resonant), {{and are not}} heavily influenced by higher vibrational modes, can often benefit from reductions in shaft stiffness to lower the running-speed <b>bearing</b> <b>loads</b> and vibration. This is because an unbalanced rotor running in the super-resonant regime tends to orbit eccentrically about its offset center of gravity, causing high <b>bearing</b> <b>loads</b> if the shaft is rigid. A more flexible shaft can deflect and reduce the dynamic force transmitted into the bearings, resulting in better bearing life and lower system vibration.

50|$|The bearing has {{sectional}} shoes, or pads on pivots. When {{the bearing}} is in operation, the rotating {{part of the}} bearing carries fresh oil in to the pad area through viscous drag. Fluid pressure causes the pad to tilt slightly, creating a narrow constriction between the shoe and the other bearing surface. A wedge of pressurised fluid builds behind this constriction, separating the moving parts. The tilt of the pad adaptively changes with <b>bearing</b> <b>load</b> and speed.

50|$|The {{motion of}} the {{surfaces}} will then cause the fluid to flow over the grooves and a pressure ripple, perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} motion, is formed. Between the surface of the bearings and the fluid, a net pressure rise occurs because this flow is limited by a plain bearing section or another set of grooves producing a pressure rise that acts to counter the pressure rise created by the first set of grooves (herringbone pattern). At a sufficient speed the internal pressures create enough force to support the applied load and the bearing surfaces are completely separated.

Sometimes an extra disc known as a balance piston has to be added inside the rotor. An early turbojet example with a balance piston was the Rolls-Royce Avon.|$|E
