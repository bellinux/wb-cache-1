5000|$|Double <b>bevel</b> or {{compound}} <b>bevel</b> — A back <b>bevel,</b> {{similar to}} a sabre or flat grind, is put on the blade behind the edge <b>bevel</b> (the <b>bevel</b> which is the foremost cutting surface). This back <b>bevel</b> keeps the section of blade behind the edge thinner which improves cutting ability. Being less acute at the edge than a single <b>bevel,</b> sharpness is sacrificed for resilience: such a grind is much less prone to chipping or rolling than a single <b>bevel</b> blade. This profile is commonly found in Japanese swords, such as the familiar katana. The shape of the <b>bevel</b> is much more efficient in reducing drag than the sabre grind typically found on Western sword blades. In practice, double <b>bevels</b> are common {{in a variety of}} edge angles and back <b>bevel</b> angles, and Western kitchen knives generally have a double <b>bevel,</b> with an edge angle of 14-16° (included angle of 28-32°) and a maximum of 40° as specified by International standard ISO 8442.1 (knives for the preparation of food).|$|R

The furcula is broad and more or less U-shaped with its two branches angled at 125°. The forelimb is rather long; its length is equal to 48% of the body length {{in front of the}} pelvis. Especially the hand is elongated as is typical for compsognathids; for a member of that group Scipionyx has a relatively short hand, however. The humerus is straight with a moderately developed deltopectoral crest. The ulna is slender and cylinder-shaped with a length of 70% of that of the humerus. The wrist consists of two elements only: a radial bone capping {{the lower end of the}} radius and a disc-shaped bone below it; this is either the enlarged first lower carpal or a perfect seamless fusion of the first and second lower carpal. The metacarpus is compact and moderately elongated. Its three elements mirror the shape of the fingers they bear: the first is the shortest en thickest; the second the longest; and the third is intermediate in length and thickness. The third finger is exceptionally long for a comspognathid, with 123% of thumb length. As the lower joint of the first metacarpal is <b>bevelled,</b> the thumb diverges medially. Its claw is no larger than that of the second finger. The hand claws are moderately curved.|$|E

500|$|The {{mirror is}} a {{perfectly}} defined unbroken pale rectangle within a broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws {{the attention of the}} viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the dwarf in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the opalescent sheen of the mirror's surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. Jonathan Miller points out that apart from [...] "adding suggestive gleams at the <b>bevelled</b> edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with the dimness of the surrounding wall that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen".|$|E
500|$|When {{the known}} {{specimens}} of K. langenbergensis were first {{described in a}} preliminary fashion by a 2006 paper from Hans-Volker Karl et al., they were referred to the genus Theriosuchus. This was {{on the basis of}} the short skull, divided nostrils, large eye sockets compared to the supratemporal fenestrae, and the <b>bevelled</b> side of the squamosal. Specifically, they recognized its similarity to T. pusillus on the basis of its osteoderms and teeth, although they noted that the orientation of the back of the skull was different and that leaf-shaped teeth were absent. These differences were attributed to K. langenbergensis probably representing a different life stage of T. pusillus compared to the type specimen. A 2016 analysis of the relationships of the Atoposauridae, from Jonathan Tennant et al., tentatively supported the affinity of these specimens with T. pusillus on account of the teeth being situated in a groove (a trait uniting T. pusillus and [...] "T." [...] guimarotae in their analysis), the presence of pseudocaniniform teeth, and the lance head-shaped teeth near the back of the jaw. However, they noted that the nasals essentially completely divide the nostrils to the exclusion of other bones, which is not seen in the genus of Theriosuchus.|$|E

2500|$|Tinner's snips, {{also known}} as tinner snips or tin snips, {{are one of the}} most popular type of snips. They are defined by their long handles and short blades.

They can be ranged in length from [...] long. There are two main types: straight-pattern and duckbill-pattern. Straight-pattern are best for straight cuts, but can handle gentle curves. Duckbill-pattern snips, {{also known as}} trojan-pattern snips, have blades that taper down from the pivot to the tip of the blades. The blade edges are also <b>bevelled</b> to more easily cut curves and circles or shapes. They are a lighter duty snip that can only cut up to 25 gauge mild steel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, a Beaker period copper dagger blade was {{recovered}} from the Sillees River near Ross Lough, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. The flat, triangular-shaped copper blade was [...] long, with <b>bevelled</b> edges and a pointed tip, and featured an integral tang that accepted a riveted handle. Flint arrow-heads and copper-blade daggers with handle tangs, found in association with Beaker pottery in {{many other parts of}} Europe, have a date later than the initial phase of Beaker People activity in Ireland. Also the typical Beaker wristguards seem to have entered Ireland by cultural diffusion only, after the first intrusions, and unlike English and Continental Beaker burials never made it to the graves. The same lack of typical Beaker association applies to the about thirty found stone battle axes. A gold ornament found in County Down that closely resembles a pair of ear-rings from Ermegeira, Portugal, has a composition that suggests it was imported. Incidental finds suggest links to non-British Beaker territories, like a fragment of a bronze blade in County Londonderry that has been likened to the [...] "palmella" [...] points of Iberia, even though the relative scarcity of beakers, and Beaker-compatible material of any kind, in the south-west are regarded as an obstacle to any colonisation directly from Iberia, or even from France. Their greater concentration {{in the northern part of}} the country, which traditionally is regarded as the part of Ireland least blessed with sources of copper, has led many authorities to question the role of Beaker People in the introduction of metallurgy to Ireland. However, indications of their use of stream sediment copper, low in traces of lead and arsenic, and Beaker finds connected to mining and metalworking at Ross Island, County Kerry, provide an escape to such doubts.|$|E

2500|$|A final {{layer of}} adornments {{added to the}} helmet a crest, eyebrows, nose and mouth piece, and three dragon heads. A hollow iron crest ran {{across the top of}} the cap and {{terminated}} at front and back. It was made of [...] "D-sectioned" [...] tubing and consisted of two parts, an inverted [...] "U-shaped" [...] piece into which a [...] "flat bottom strip" [...] was placed. As no traces of solder remain, the crest may have been either forged or shrunk on to the cap. From either end of the crest extended an iron tang, to each of which was riveted a gilded dragon head. That on the front was made of cast bronze, while the one on the rear was made of [...] "a different alloy, and now consists largely of tin oxide." [...] A third dragon head, also of cast bronze, faced upwards on the front of the helmet and broke the plane between face mask and cap; its neck rested on the face mask, while under its eyes it was held to the cap by [...] "a massive rivet shank." [...] To either side of the neck projected a hollow cast bronze eyebrow, into each of which was inlaid parallel silver wires separated by niello. Terminal boar heads were gilded, as were the undersides of the eyebrows, where individual bronze cells held square garnets. The eyebrows were riveted on, both to the cap at their outer ends and to the tang of a nose and mouth piece which extended upwards underneath the neck of the dragon head. This tang was itself riveted to the cap, one of five attachment points for the cast bronze nose and mouth piece. Both sides of the nose featured [...] "two small round projecting plates," [...] connected by fluted and swaged strips, and concealing rivets. An inlaid strip of wire extended the length of the nasal ridge, next to which the [...] "background was punched down" [...] and filled with niello, leaving [...] "triangles in relief" [...] that were silvered. A tracer (a [...] "rather blunt chisel [...] [...] [...] used chiefly for outlining") was used to provide a grooved border on each side. Running horizontally aside the nasal bridge were three punched circles per side, inlaid with silver and surrounded by niello. Beneath these circles, also running horizontally from the center of the nose to its sides were chased [...] "alternate rows of plain flutings and billeted strips which run obliquely between the central strip and a billeted lower edge." [...] This same pattern is repeated in vertical fashion on the moustache. The curve along the <b>bevelled</b> lower lip, in turn, repeats the circled pattern used on the nasal bridge. Excepting the portions covered by the eyebrows and dragon head, or adorned with silver or niello, the nose and mouth piece was heavily gilded, which is suggested by the presence of mercury to have been [...] "applied by the fire-gilding technique." ...|$|E
