5|$|Alfred Thayer Mahan's book The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660–1783, {{published}} in 1890, was very influential in justifying the naval {{program to the}} civilian government and to the general public. With {{the closing of the}} frontier, some Americans began to look outwards, to the Caribbean, to Hawaii and the Pacific, and with the doctrine of Manifest Destiny as philosophical justification, many saw the Navy as an essential part of realizing that doctrine <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of the American continent.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Ox, {{catching}} him alone, reveals Georges's true parentage, and persuades him {{to drink}} a magic potion {{that allows him to}} go <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of the probable and journey through the impossible. Eva, realizing what has happened, takes the potion and drinks some as well, so as not to desert Georges. A family friend, the dancing master Tartelet (from The School for Robinsons), is seduced by the opportunity to travel and drinks his own share of the potion before anyone can stop him. Ox sets off with all three travelers, while Volsius makes secret plans to come along and protect Georges from Ox's influence. Along the way, another Dane, Axel Valdemar, also gets mixed up into the journey and becomes a friend of Tartelet.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an intergovernmental organization established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

5|$|Fincantieri {{was awarded}} the {{contract}} to construct Shakti in April 2008, {{at a cost of}} US$300 million. The Deepak-class tankers were the first warships constructed for India by Fincantieri. The construction of the ship began in November 2009 at Fincantieri's Sestri Ponente shipyard in Italy. The sea trials started in December 2010. The ship was formally handed over to the Indian Navy on 23 September 2011, in under two years. Admiral Nirmal Verma, the chief of the Naval Staff, commissioned the tanker at Visakhapatnam, the home of the Eastern Naval Command, saying that the ship enhanced the reach of the navy well <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Later, in December 1942, the 27th Battalion was {{transferred}} from the 3rd Brigade to the 23rd Brigade. This unit had previously been a 2nd AIF unit, but the loss of several of its battalions when they had been deployed to Ambon, Timor and Rabaul, had resulted in it being re-formed with Militia battalions and the 27th joined the 7th and 8th Battalions to round out its establishment. In March 1943, after having endured several bombings by Japanese aircraft since their arrival in Darwin the previous year, the battalion was replaced in the Darwin garrison and its personnel returned Adelaide for leave. In December, they regrouped on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland for jungle training, as the 23rd Brigade—then part of the 3rd Division—was converted to the jungle establishment, in preparation for them undertaking active service in New Guinea. Around this time the battalion was gazetted as an AIF battalion, meaning that because more than 65 per cent of its personnel had volunteered for service outside of Australian territory, it could be deployed <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> {{set out in the}} Defence Act (1903).|$|E
5|$|Malcolm's kingdom did {{not extend}} over the full {{territory}} of modern Scotland: {{the north and west}} of Scotland remained under Scandinavian, Norse-Gael, and Gaelic rule, and the territories under the rule of the Kings of Scots {{did not extend}} much <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> established by Malcolm II until the 12th century. Malcolm III fought a series of wars against the Kingdom of England, which may have had as its objective the conquest of the English earldom of Northumbria. These wars did not result in any significant advances southward. Malcolm's primary achievement was to continue a lineage that ruled Scotland for many years, although his role as founder of a dynasty {{has more to do with}} the propaganda of his youngest son David I and his descendants than with history.|$|E

5|$|Slow-motion {{photography}} {{shows that}} the muscles have passive flexibility. They are first stretched while the frog {{is still in the}} crouched position, then they are contracted before being stretched again to launch the frog into the air. The fore legs are folded against the chest and the hind legs remain in the extended, streamlined position {{for the duration of the}} jump. In some extremely capable jumpers, such as the Cuban tree frog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) and the northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), the peak power exerted during a jump can exceed that which the muscle is theoretically capable of producing. When the muscles contract, the energy is first transferred into the stretched tendon which is wrapped around the ankle bone. Then the muscles stretch again at the same time as the tendon releases its energy like a catapult to produce a powerful acceleration <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limits</b> of muscle-powered acceleration. A similar mechanism has been documented in locusts and grasshoppers.|$|E

40|$|This work is Part 2 of the {{extensive}} theoretical study of an inviscid transonic flow near a discontinuity in wall curvature, focusing on the flow regimes with <b>the</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristic. <b>The</b> closed-form solutions obtained in Part 1 using the hodograph method are extended <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristic by means of analytical continuation, {{and the results are}} analysed using the phase portrait technique. It is shown that if the flow can be extended <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristic, it subsequently develops a shock wave. This leads to multiple solutions and a wider variety of flow regimes, including the ones with a concave downstream wall. As a consequence, a fundamental link between the local and the global flow patterns is observed in our problem...|$|R
