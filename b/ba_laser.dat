40|$|High-power broad area (<b>BA)</b> <b>laser</b> diodes in the NIR around 1500 nm {{become more}} and more {{interesting}} for material processing, medical and security applications, and pumping of crystals to realise solid state lasers. Efficient light coupling is a stringent requirement in all these applications and necessitates lasers with a narrow and preferably symmetric optical far-field...|$|E
40|$|Lossless {{reshaping}} of multimode emission from broad-area {{laser diodes}} enables compact, highly efficient sources {{for a large}} variety of wavelengths. Broad-area (<b>BA)</b> <b>laser</b> diodes are the most efficient light sources known and are widely used today. Kilowatts of multimode power can easily be extracted from arrays of the devices to pump fiber lasers for remote-sensing and industrial-processing applications, to give just two examples. However, owing to the planar nature of laser diodes and related optical effects, the ideal (i. e., diffraction-limited) output of each individual device can-not exceed several watts. Consequently, for higher powers, beam focus and performance are suboptimal. The current {{solution to this problem}} combines light from many laser diodes in a high-power beam using a secondary active (laser) medium such as erbium- or thulium-doped fibers. Unfortunately, it is indirect...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years there has been an {{increasing}} demand for high-power diode lasers emitting in the infrared wavelength region around 2 mu. The (AIGaIn) (AsSb) material system is the most promissing candidate to cover this spectral range. High output powers exceeding 1 W in cw mode at room temperature based an broad-area (<b>BA)</b> <b>lasers</b> have been reported by different groups. In many applications such as material processing, laser surgery or pumping of solid-state lasers it is desirable to have light-sources which show simultaneously both high output powers and a good beam quality. Because of their poor beam quality <b>BA</b> <b>lasers</b> do not fulfill the latter requirement whereas tapered diode lasers do so...|$|R
40|$|The homo- and copolymerizations of styrene (STY) and methylmethacrylate (MMA) {{have been}} studied in the {{presence}} of several levels of benzyl alcohol (<b>BA).</b> From pulsed <b>laser</b> polymerizations it has been found that the apparent propagation rate constant increased with increasing BA for all systems. In copolymerization it has been found that the reactivity ratios for STY decrease somewhat, but those for MMA change little with increasing BA. The tacticity of poly(MMA) formed {{in the presence of}} BA is affected, the amount of mm diads increasing with increasing BA. The results are interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that BA forms a strong complex with radical chain ends terminating in MMA and a weak complex with those terminating in STY...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of photoconversion systems, such as organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, is largely {{controlled by a}} series of fundamental photophysical processes occurring at the interface before carrier collection. A profound understanding of ultrafast interfacial charge transfer (CT), charge separation (CS), and charge recombination (CR) is the key determinant to improving the overall performances of photovoltaic devices. The discussion in this dissertation primarily focuses on the relevant parameters that are involved in photon absorption, exciton separation, carrier transport, carrier recombination and carrier collection in organic photovoltaic devices. A combination of steady-state and femtosecond broadband transient spectroscopies was used to investigate the photoinduced charge carrier dynamics in various donor-acceptor systems. Furthermore, this study was extended to investigate some important factors that influence charge transfer in donor-acceptor systems, such as the morphology, energy band alignment, electronic properties and chemical structure. Interestingly, clear correlations among the steady-state measurements, time-resolved spectroscopy results, grain alignment of the electron transporting layer (ETL), carrier mobility, and device performance are found. In this thesis, we explored the significant impacts of ultrafast charge separation and charge recombination at donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces on the performance of a conjugated polymer PTB 7 -Th device with three fullerene acceptors: PC 71 BM, PC 61 BM and IC 60 <b>BA.</b> Time-resolved <b>laser</b> spectroscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy can illustrate the basis for fabricating solar cell devices with improved performances. In addition, we studied the effects of the incorporation of heavy metals into Ï€-conjugated chromophores on electron transfer by monitoring the triplet state lifetime of the oligomer using transient absorption spectroscopy, as understanding the mechanisms controlling intersystem crossing and photoinduced electron transfer dynamics is required to improve the device performance of solar cells. Here, we evaluated the effects of incorporating Pt(II) on intersystem crossing and photoinduced electron transfer by comparing and analyzing the photoexcited dynamics of DPP-Pt(II) (acac) and metal-free DPP with different acceptors such as TCNE, TMPyP, and TPyP...|$|R
