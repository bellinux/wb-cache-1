5|$|After his AIF {{appointment}} was terminated, Weir resumed his {{service in the}} Citizen Military Forces (CMF). In 1917, {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Service Order and the Russian Empire Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class, with Swords, and was mentioned in dispatches for his performance at Pozières and Mouquet Farm. From 1917 to 1920, he was aide-de-camp to the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ronald Craufurd Munro Ferguson. Weir retired from the CMF as an honorary brigadier general in March 1921, his last appointment <b>being</b> <b>as</b> commander of the 20th Infantry Brigade. He was only the second South Australia-born officer to reach the rank of brigadier general. On 31 March 1921, Weir was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 10th Battalion, a position he held for many years.|$|E
5|$|Albanian {{intelligence}} groups informed Skanderbeg—the main {{leader of}} the revolt—that a large Ottoman army was preparing to march into Albania, the number of which was reported by some as <b>being</b> <b>as</b> high as 170,000. This army, however, {{is likely to have}} contained no more than 80,000 soldiers. Nevertheless, Murad marched his army into Monastir. Skanderbeg urgently called for material aid Venice. The answer, however, was negative. Instead, the only aid received came from the Neapolitans and the Ragusans. Nonetheless, Murad soon marched into Ohrid and Black Drin valley, traveling near Svetigrad. In response, Skanderbeg strengthened the garrisons of Krujë, Stellushi, Svetigrad, and Berat by ordering the populations around these fortress to take up arms.|$|E

In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as <b>being</b> <b>as</b> much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and beliefs to a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E

She takes the little girl through another picture, displaying mythological and fairytale beings such as dragons, princes and unicorns {{as well as a}} castle where Madonna dances with the moon. An underwater scene with mermaids and fish follows, then a parade of all the girl's toys around her room. As the song wraps, the fairy taps on the girl and causes her to yawn. She falls asleep again and her toys go back to <b>being</b> <b>as</b> they were. The violins and the instruments gradually fade inside the radio and the song ends.|$|E

She is depicted as being young and slim. She {{is described}} as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses or having a single blue lotus near her heart.

5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not <b>being</b> <b>as</b> pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E

The film closed its original box office run having grossed $23 million in the United States and $46 million worldwide. After reissues, the first <b>being</b> <b>as</b> a double feature with Dr. No in 1966, Goldfinger grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States and $73,800,000 elsewhere, for a total worldwide gross of $124,900,000.|$|E

After much negotiation, the LSWR reached agreement with the London Necropolis Company, the owners of the cemetery and the railway: in return for the existing site, the LSWR re-equipped the London Necropolis Railway and supplied it with a new station on Westminster Bridge Road. This new building was designed to contrast with other funeral directors' premises by <b>being</b> <b>as</b> attractive as possible. In 1902 the railway moved into the new building, and the earlier station was demolished.|$|E
5|$|In Mississippi Republican Executive Opinion v. Brooks (1984), the Supreme Court summarily affirmed, {{without a}} written opinion, a lower court's {{decision}} that 1982 amendment to Section 2 is constitutional. Justice Rehnquist, joined by Chief Justice Burger, dissented from the opinion. Their reasoning {{was that the}} case presented complex constitutional issues that should have warranted a full hearing. In later cases, the Supreme Court {{is more likely to}} disregard one of its previous judgments that lacks a written opinion, but lower courts must respect the Supreme Court's unwritten summary affirmances as <b>being</b> <b>as</b> equally binding on them as Supreme Court judgments with written opinions. Partially due to Brooks, the constitutionality of the Section 2 results test has since been unanimously upheld by lower courts.|$|E
