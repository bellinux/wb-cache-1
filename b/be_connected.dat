5|$|On {{the other}} side of Oslo, the North Line (now named the Gjøvik Line) was being built as {{standard}} gauge; it was considered the new mainline northwards, and was to <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> to the mainline through Gudbrandsdalen. By building a branch line from Roa to Hønefoss, the Bergens Line could <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> to Nordbanen, allowing standard gauge trackage all the way to Oslo Østbanestasjon (Oslo Ø). This also gave another advantage, as Oslo Ø was seen as superior to Oslo V; the latter only served limited commuter routes west of town while Oslo Ø was the main station for long-distance trains to Trondheim, as well as Gothenburg and Stockholm in Sweden, with whom Norway was in a union with at the time. Only by terminating at Oslo Ø would direct transfer to trains {{to other parts of the}} country be possible.|$|E

New features, such as double battles and Pokémon abilities along with 135 new Pokémon, have been added. As the Game Boy Advance is more powerful than its predecessors, four players may <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> at a time instead of the previous limit of two. Additionally, the games can <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> to an e-Reader or other advanced generation Pokémon games.|$|E

The travel time from Ahus to Jernbanetorget would be 27 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply <b>be</b> <b>connected</b> to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the {{built-in}} amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
