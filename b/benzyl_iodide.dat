Reliable {{transformation}} of low-cost rare-earth metal oxides to organometallic rare-earth metal complexes {{is a prerequisite}} for the advancement of non-aqueous rare-earth metal chemistry. We have recently developed an in situ method to prepare rare-earth alkyl and halide precursors supported by a diamidoferrocene NN TBS, 1, 1 ′-fc(NSiMe 2 t Bu) 2, as an ancillary ligand. Herein, we extended the scope of this method to other lanthanide ions including those that are redox active, such as cerium, praseodymium, samarium, terbium, thulium, and ytterbium. Specifically, samarium trisbenzyl could be generated in situ and then converted to the corresponding samarium <b>benzyl</b> or <b>iodide</b> complexes in good yield. However, it was found that ytterbium trisbenzyl could not be formed cleanly and the consequent conversion to ytterbium iodide complex was low yielding.

40|$|The {{application}} of the Electrochemical Quartz Crystal Microbalance (EQCM) {{to the study of}} the metal corrosion and its inhibition is quite recent. The sensibility of the technique and the possibility of the simultaneous registration of the mass variations of the electrode and the current density during the voltammogram recording could be valuable for the investigations of the corrosion of metals in conditions of very low corrosion rate. In this paper the preliminary results of tests of corrosion inhibition of Ni in 0. 1 M HClO 4 by means of EQCM are reported. Corrosion rates of electrodeposited Ni in 0. 1 M HClO 4 in the absence and in the presence of different inhibitors in free corrosion conditions were determined. The following inhibitors were used: Potassium <b>Iodide</b> (KI), Tributyl <b>benzyl</b> ammonium <b>iodide</b> (TBNI), Dodecyl quinolinium Bromide (DDQBr), Benzyl quinolinium chloride (Bqc) and Acridin (Acr). The influence of the addition of the inhibitors on the corrosion rate of Ni was also measured. The corrosion rate of Ni was drastically reduced by KI and TBNI. DDQBr showed a good inhibitive efficiency, the Bqc only a small effect, whereas Acr stimulated the Ni corrosion. Voltammograms at different scan rate in the same solutions were recorded and the mass variation registered.

The selectivity of reductive elimination from a metal bonded to three different groups could be studied for the first time. The complexes undergo facile reductive elimination in (CD 3) zCO at 0 °C, in which PdIMezPh(bpy) gives a mixture of ethane and toluene in a 4 :l molar ratio together with PdIR(bpy) (R = Ph, Me), whereas PdXMePh- (CHzPh) (bpy) (X = Br, I) gives exclusively toluene and PdX(CHZPh) (bpy). The analogous tmeda complex, PdMePh(tmeda) (tmeda = N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine), reacts more slowly than PdMePh(bpy 1 with alkyl halides. Methyl iodide reacts cleanly with PdMePh- (tmeda) at 0 °C in (CD 3) zC 0 to form ethane and PdIPh(tmeda), but the expected palladium(1 V) intermediate could not be detected. Benzyl bromide does not react with PdMePh(tmeda) below the decomposition temperature of the latter under these conditions (50 °C, (CD&CO), while <b>benzyl</b> <b>iodide</b> reacts at 40 °C to give a complicated mixture of products of which ethane, diphenylmethane, ethylbenzene, toluene, and PdIR(tmeda) (R = Me, Ph) could be identified. <b>Benzyl</b> <b>iodide</b> reacts with PdMez(tmeda) at - 30 °C in (CD 3) zCO to form PdIMez(CHzPh) - (tmeda), for which lH NMR spectra showed the benzyl group to be trans {{to one of the}} N-donor atoms. However, PdIMez(CHzPh) (tmeda) is unstable and undergoes facile reductive elimination to form ethane and PdI(CH 2 Ph) (tmeda).

The mechanism of the transfer reactions is discussed in terms of the mechanism suggested earlier for alkyl halide transfer from palladium(1 V) to platinum(II), palladium(I 1) to palladium(O), cobalt(II 1) to cobalt(I), and rhodium(II 1) to rhodium(1).

40|$|Homogenous acid {{catalysts}} are prevalent {{throughout the}} chemical industry but all have the drawback of requiring post reaction neutralization and subsequent downstream removal of the product salt. The use of a base to neutralize the acid and the processing of the salt are ancillary to {{the process and the}} disposal of the salt is an environmental concern. The work presented here shows the use of alkylcarbonic acids, which form in situ with CO₂ pressure and neutralize on loss of CO₂ pressure rather than requiring a base. Thus CO₂ can be used to "switch" the acid on and off. The properties of alkylcarbonic acids are explored to gain understanding of the mechanisms by which they act. The acids are also used to catalyze the synthesis of α-pinene, methyl yellow, and <b>benzyl</b> <b>iodide.</b> These reactions are examples of common acid catalyzed reactions where this technology could be implemented.

The radioactive iodine containing products are sufficiently stable to allow their storage for later use.

40|$|For many {{countries}} nuclear fission {{is an important}} part of their energy portfolio. However, a great concern is the occurrence of nuclear reactor accidents, which can result in the emission of radioactivity into the environment. It has been proven in the past that the release of radioactivity can have environmental and health effects both locally, as well as in more distant locations, including those in other countries. As a result, severe nuclear accidents are of interest even to those countries that do not use nuclear fission as an energy source. One of the most important volatile fission products is iodine. In the event of a severe nuclear reactor accident iodine can be released from nuclear fuel and enter the containment. Iodine can be in different inorganic and organic chemical forms. The volatility of some iodine species is of importance as this enables the iodine to escape from a nuclear power plant and result in exposure of the general public. Radioiodine is re-concentrated in the small but vital thyroid gland and can induce cancer. While inorganic forms of iodine can be retained and their release into the environment to a large extent be prevented, organic iodides cannot be retained with the same efficiency by the filter systems used today. 	 In this work the processes by which organic iodides can be formed inside the containment were studied. To this end methods were developed to produce I- 131 labeled organic iodides that were used in the experiments. The formation of alkyl iodides other than methyl iodide, such as ethyl-, isopropyl-, butyl- and <b>benzyl</b> <b>iodide</b> from organic materials present in reactor containments was observed. It was found that organic materials can act as sources of organic iodides, but also consume them. The ability of a paint to retain and to generate organic iodides was found to decrease with thermal ageing of the paint. The iodine chemistry in paint films was investigated and organic iodides were found to bind to hydroxyl groups to form alkyl ethers with the iodine leaving group not being chemically bonded. A modified epoxy paint formulation was developed that can capture and retain more iodine than the bisphenol-A based epoxy paint Teknopox Aqua VATM that is currently used in Sweden. The removal of organic iodides from gas streams using solid absorbers was investigated but found to be not sufficient.

The analogous N-dibenzylchloramine compound (C(_ 6) H(_ 5) CH(_ 2)) (_ 2) NC 1. IC 1 has also been prepared. Various adducts of N-halami es have been reacted with arge cation halides. he reaction between (CH(_ 3) 0 (_ 2) NC 1. IC 1 and (CH(_ 3)) (_ 4) N(^+) I(^-) yields (CH(_ 3)) (_ 4) N(^+) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) N (IC 1) (_ 2) (^-), and analogous reactions have produced the now compounds Cs(^+) (CH(_ 3)) N(IC 1) (_ 2) (^-), (C(_ 6) H(_ 5)) (- 2) I(^+) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) N(IC 1) (_ 2) (^-). Attempts to synthesise these and related compounds from N-halamine adducts and large cation tri-iodides have yielded the novel T 1 (^+) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) N(IC 1) (_ 2) (^-) besides providing a faster route to (CH(_ 3) (_ 4) N(^+) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) N(IC 1) (_ 2) (^-) and (CH(_ 3)) (_ 4) N(^+) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) NI(_ 4) (^=). A number of halide insertion reactions have been tried and have been shown to produce simple polyhalides or polyhalide mixtures in the majority of cases. Reaction of (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) NC 1. J(_) 2) with (CH(_ 3)) (_ 4) N(^+) Br(^-) yielded the new substance (CH(_ 3) (_ 4) N(^+) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) NIBrCl(_ 2) (^-), while with (CH(_ 3)) (_ 4) N(^+) I(^I), the similarly novel (CH(_ 3) (_ 4) N(^+) (CH(_ 3) (_ 2) NI(_ 3) Cl(^-) is formed. Reaction of N-dimethyliodamine with iodomethane gives excellent yields of (CH(_ 3)) (_ 4) N(^+) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) NI(_ 4) (^-), but various attempts to alkylate N-halamines with allyl iodide failed. <b>Benzyl</b> <b>iodide,</b> on the other hand, produced complex mixtures or simple polyhalides, one such being (CH(_ 6) H(_ 5) CH(_ 2)) (_ 2) (CH(_ 3)) (_ 2) N(^+) I(_ 3) (^-) which {{does not appear to have}} been previously reported...|$|E
