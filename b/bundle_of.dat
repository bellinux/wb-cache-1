By ultrastructural (TEM and SEM) and biochemical analyses it was found that individual <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> the net are similar to elastic ligaments. Although elastic fibres predominate, they are integrated and aligned in parallel with small <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> collagen. A reticulum of fibroblasts, joined by focal junctions, forms a cellular framework throughout each <b>bundle.</b> Because <b>of</b> the unique features <b>of</b> the fibre <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> the bat's wing, in particular their accessibility, and the parallel alignment of the collagen fibrils and elastic fibres in each easily isolatable fibre bundle, they should prove a most valuable model for connective tissue studies, particularly for the study of collagen-elastin interactions...|$|R

40|$|An {{orthogonal}} bundle over a curve has an isotropic Segre invariant {{determined by}} the maximal degree of a Lagrangian subbundle. This invariant, and the induced stratifications on moduli spaces <b>of</b> orthogonal <b>bundles,</b> were studied for <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> even rank in [4]. In this paper, we obtain analogous results for <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> odd rank. We obtain a sharp upper bound on the isotropic Segre invariant. We show the irreducibility of the induced strata on the moduli spaces <b>of</b> orthogonal <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> odd rank, and compute their dimensions. As a key ingredient of the proofs, we study the correspondence between Lagrangian subbundles <b>of</b> orthogonal <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> even and odd rank.

5|$|Octopuses inhabit various {{regions of}} the ocean, {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E
5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} the <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> His were {{discovered}} {{as early as}} the 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E

Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E

The growth mechanism <b>of</b> the flower-like <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> ZnO nanosheets is discussed based on the morphology evolution with growth times and reaction conditions. It is believed that the formation <b>of</b> flower-like <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> ZnO nanosheets {{is related to the}} shielding effect of OH− ions and the self-assembly process, which is dominated by a preheating time.

His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself {{frequently}} out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer when he was 12. He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his thinking in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so {{they would be more}} adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.|$|E
5|$|The Fasci {{movement}} {{was made up}} of a federation of scores of associations that developed among farm workers, tenant farmers, and small sharecroppers as well as artisans, intellectuals, and industrial workers. The immediate demands of the movement were fair land rents, higher wages, lower local taxes and distribution of misappropriated common land. Between 1889 and 1893 some 170 Fasci were established in Sicily. According to some sources the movement reached a membership of more than 300,000 by the end of 1893. The Fasci constituted autonomous organizations with their own insignia (red rosettes), uniforms and sometimes even musical bands, and their own local halls for reunions and congresses. They were called Fasci (Fascio literally means bundle) because everyone can break a single stick, but no one can break a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> sticks.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} site in Hong Kong's Central District {{was less}} than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World WarII, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in Katonah, New York. There he found himself experimenting with a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen from the line readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E
