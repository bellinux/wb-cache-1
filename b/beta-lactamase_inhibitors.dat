Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as [...] "resistant" [...] to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, {{even if it is}} tested (in vitro) as susceptible. Associated resistance to aminoglycosides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as well as high frequency of co-existence of fluoroquinolone resistance, creates problems. <b>Beta-lactamase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> such as clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam in vitro inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. Cephamycins (cefoxitin and cefotetan) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type β-lactamase. [...] Also, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type β-lactamase.

Currently, carbapenems are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent in vitro activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae expressing ESBLs.|$|E

Most ESBL-PE were resistant or had intermediate susceptibility in vitro to aminopenicillin and <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>inhibitor.</b> Thus, the apparent protective effect of aminopenicillin and <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> on the occurrence of ESBL-PE pneumonia may not be attributed to antimicrobial efficacy, but rather to the selection of P.aeruginosa as a causative agent of pneumonia.|$|R

[...] The gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus produces beta-lactamases, but <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>inhibitors</b> play a lesser role in treatment of these infections because the most resistant strains (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) also use variant penicillin-binding proteins.|$|E

40|$|Forty-three hospitalized {{patients}} {{were treated with}} a new antibiotic combination containing ticarcillin plus the <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> clavulanic acid, in a fixed combination for intravenous use. A variety of infections were treated, including pneumonia, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis. Of 50 episodes of infection in 43 patients, 44 clinical cures were obtained, with 5 patients improving and 1 patient failing to respond to treatment. In vitro susceptibility testing of 101 clinical isolates was notable for the rarity {{of resistance to the}} combination antibiotic. Of specific interest, all 14 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid, whereas only 2 of the 14 isolates were susceptible to ticarcillin alone. Adverse reactions to the study drug were minimal; eosinophilia, unaccompanied by other allergic phenomena, and oral candidiasis were most frequent.

On the other hand, unrelentless use of carbapenem antibiotics will lead to selection of carbapenemaseproducing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) strains. Consequently, the empirical and definite antibiotic treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections deserves a critical revision. Carbapenem antibiotics still remain the first choice for severe infections in the critically ill, but recent data show non-inferiority of betalactam/ <b>beta-lactamase</b> <b>inhibitor</b> combinations in less severe urinary and biliary tract infections. These drugs are especially relevant in definite therapy, when „minimum inhibitory concentration” (MIC) values are low.
