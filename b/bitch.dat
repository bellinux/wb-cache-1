40|$|To {{determine}} which aerobic bacteria exert a marked effect on Cystic Endometrial Hyperplasia-Pyometra complex (CEH-P) {{and to determine}} from where these bacteria originate. About 48 privately owned <b>bitches</b> were diagnosed with CEH-P. Healthy vagina and uterine samples were obtained with cotton pledgets and cumulative uterine fluids from CEH-P cysts were collected with a syringe in utero to isolate and identify aerobic bacterial. A total of 99 isolates were identified and the primary aerobe in the CEH-P <b>bitches</b> {{was found to be}} Escherichia coli (33 / 99). The levels of estrode in <b>bitches</b> with endometritis and in <b>bitches</b> with pyometra and estrus were higher than the levels in diestrus <b>bitches</b> (p< 0. 01). When ranked according to the levels of progesterone in a descending order (i. e., from high to low levels), the ranking was <b>bitches</b> with pyometra, <b>bitches</b> with endometritis, <b>bitches</b> in estrus and <b>bitches</b> in diestrus. These results suggest that in addition to common pathogenic bacteria differential in every area, casual bacterial contamination invariably occurred in <b>bitches</b> with CEH-P and the primary infection ascended from the vagina when the cervix was open. The researchers also inferred that both estrode and progesterone levels in CEH-P <b>bitches</b> were increased relative to the levels in healthy <b>bitches</b> and were even higher than that of the levels observed in estrus <b>bitches.</b> Estrode and progesterone pretreatment and uterine mucosa damage were interpreted as the preconditions for bacterial infection.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure uterine artery blood {{velocity}} daily using Doppler ultrasonography in 10 young and 10 older clinically normal <b>bitches</b> throughout oestrus. Typical arterial waveforms identified in young <b>bitches</b> were characterised by a systolic peak and subsequent flow throughout diastole, whereas in older <b>bitches,</b> flow was sometimes absent in diastole. For 3 days immediately prior to ovulation, at the time of declining plasma oestrogen and increasing progesterone concentrations, resistance index (RI) increased, principally associated with decreased diastolic velocity; in some <b>bitches</b> there was absent late diastolic flow during this time. In older <b>bitches,</b> the waveform appearance was more variable, with absent late and early diastolic flow observed in some cases. Mean RI was higher throughout oestrus for older <b>bitches</b> compared with young <b>bitches,</b> although both groups had a similar 3 -day duration increase before ovulation. Nine of the young <b>bitches</b> and five of the older <b>bitches</b> became pregnant; litter size was smaller for the older <b>bitches.</b> Non-pregnant bitches: (1) were significantly older; (2) had fewer waveforms with continuous diastolic flow 2 days before ovulation; (3) had lower end diastolic velocity, higher RI and fewer waveforms with continuous diastolic flow 2 days after ovulation, and (4) had lower plasma progesterone concentrations 5 days after ovulation. These are the first detailed observations of uterine artery blood velocity and waveform appearance throughout oestrus in <b>bitches,</b> and this is the first description of a link between impaired diastolic flow and reduced fertility. Assessment of uterine artery velocity could be useful to promote understanding of physiological mechanisms and could also become an important tool to assess potential infertility...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether reduced pressure transmission is of {{importance in the}} pathophysiologic mechanism of urinary incontinence in <b>bitches.</b> ANIMALS: 20 sexually intact, continent <b>bitches</b> and 21 spayed, incontinent <b>bitches.</b> PROCEDURE: Urethral pressure profiles before (resting) and after (stressed) insufflation of gas in the abdominal cavity were recorded in <b>bitches</b> under general anesthesia. Differences (stressed minus resting) were calculated for all variables. On {{the basis of these}} values, the pressure transmission ratio was determined. RESULTS: Resting pressure profiles of incontinent <b>bitches</b> indicated significantly (P < 0. 05) lower maximal closure pressure (4. 5 +/- 3. 0 cm of H 2 O) than did those of continent <b>bitches</b> (11. 2 +/- 7. 2 cm of H 2 O). The intra-abdominal pressure increase lead to a shortening of total profile length, which was equal in both groups and caused an increase in maximal urethral pressure. The change in maximal urethral pressure was significantly (P < 0. 05) greater in incontinent <b>bitches</b> (12. 4 +/- 4. 1 cm of H 2 O) than in continent <b>bitches</b> (8. 8 +/- 4. 5 cm of H 2 O). The profile areas and the pressure transmission ratios did not differ significantly (P < 0. 05) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: The effect of decreased pressure transmission on the urethra is not a factor in the pathophysiologic mechanism of urinary incontinence attributable to urethral incompetence in <b>bitches...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential relationship {{between age and}} diagnosis of cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH) in the <b>bitches,</b> 348 ultrasound examinations from 240 <b>bitches</b> (Labradors, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, Flat Coated Retrievers, or crosses of those breeds aged between 1. 6 and 7. 2 years at examination) were examined. A subpopulation of 32 <b>bitches</b> that had completed their breeding careers at 6 years or more of age was also identified. Of all, 18. 3 % of the <b>bitches</b> were diagnosed with CEH; these cases were newly diagnosed when <b>bitches</b> were between 2. 5 years and 7. 3 years of age. The proportion of ultrasound examinations in which CEH was identified increased from 6. 8 % of examinations on 2 -year-old breeding <b>bitches</b> to 60. 0 % of examinations on 6 -year-old <b>bitches.</b> Logistic regression identified {{a positive correlation between}} mean age at the examination and presence of CEH (χ 2 = 30. 74, degrees of freedom = 1, P < 0. 001). For 32 <b>bitches</b> that had completed their breeding career, the prevalence of CEH was 56. 3 %, age at the diagnosis ranged from 3. 8 to 7. 3 years, and the proportion of <b>bitches</b> affected with CEH increased from 6. 3 % at 3 years of age to 56. 3 % at 7 years of age.

5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan <b>bitch</b> in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation efforts is shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts.

40|$|AbstractPyometra is {{a common}} and {{life-threatening}} disease of intact <b>bitches</b> caused by hormonal influence of the uterus in combination with bacterial infection. The treatment of choice is ovariohysterectomy, but several purely medical options are available. Common drugs used for medical treatment in combination with antimicrobials are progesterone receptor blockers, prostaglandins, and dopamine agonists. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate long-term recovery and fertility after treatment with the progesterone receptor blocker aglepristone in <b>bitches</b> with pyometra. Data from 28 <b>bitches</b> with pyometra, admitted to the University Animal Hospital, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, during a 9 -year period, were studied retrospectively and followed up by telephone interviews with the owners. The <b>bitches</b> had been treated with aglepristone at a dose of 10  mg/kg on a median of four occasions. All <b>bitches</b> had also been treated with antimicrobial drugs for a mean duration of 23  days, the most frequently used being enrofloxacin.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to explore if blood lactate levels are {{increased}} in <b>bitches</b> with pyometra, and if the lactate measurement could be used as a prognostic indicator and to determine outcome. The present study included 16 <b>bitches</b> with pyometra that were admitted to the University Animal Hospital, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden. For comparison, a control group consisting of 14 healthy staffowned <b>bitches</b> was also evaluated. In all <b>bitches,</b> a physical examination was performed and blood samples for analysis of haematological and biochemical parameters were obtained. In all <b>bitches</b> with pyometra, surgical ovariohysterectomy was performed and a uterine sample for bacteriological culture and identification was collected. The diagnosis pyometra was subsequently confirmed by post-surgical pathological examination. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in the preoperative blood lactate levels between <b>bitches</b> with pyometra and healthy control <b>bitches.</b> Increased blood lactate levels were not associated with longer hospitalization. According to the results of the present pilot study, a single preoperative lactate measurement is not a valuable prognostic marker for pyometra <b>bitches</b> in general. If the present study had included a larger number of <b>bitches</b> or the selected individuals been more severely affected by their disease, at least a few patients with distinctly increased blood lactate levels could have been expected.

40|$|It can be {{difficult}} to confirm the presence of remnant ovarian tissue (ROT) in <b>bitches</b> that are presumed to be ovariohysterectomised. A GnRH stimulation test can be used to distinguish ovariectomised <b>bitches</b> from those in anoestrus, but it is uncertain whether the GnRH-induced changes in plasma LH and oestradiol concentrations that occur in intact <b>bitches</b> also occur in ROT-bitches. We report here eighteen ROT-bitches and compare the results of GnRH stimulation tests with those of six ovariectomised and six <b>bitches</b> in anoestrus. The basal (n = 17) and/or GnRH-stimulated (n = 18) plasma oestradiol concentration was above the detection limit of the assay, i. e., < 7 pmol/l, in all ROT-bitches but below the detection limit in all ovariectomised <b>bitches.</b> Basal plasma LH concentration was significantly higher in ROT-bitches (4. 1 ± 0. 7 μg/L) than those in anoestrus (0. 64 ± 0. 04 μg/L), and significantly lower than in ovariectomised <b>bitches</b> (20. 2 ± 3. 6 μg/L). Basal plasma LH concentration was relatively high in <b>bitches</b> in which there was a long interval between ovariectomy and appearance of oestrus. GnRH administration resulted in a significant increase in plasma LH and oestradiol concentrations in ROT-bitches. The GnRH-induced increase and subsequent decline in plasma LH concentration were significantly less in ROT-bitches than in either ovariectomised <b>bitches</b> or those in anoestrus. The GnRH-induced increase in plasma oestradiol concentration was significantly smaller in ROT-bitches than in those in anoestrus.

40|$|Abstract Spontaneous luteal {{regression}} and prostaglandin-induced luteolysis in <b>bitches</b> {{were evaluated}} by measuring the apoptotic index for DNA fragmentation and the relative level of Bax gene expression in ovaries removed from nine untreated nonpregnant <b>bitches</b> at selected times during diestrus and in nine pregnant <b>bitches</b> after 1 day of administering abortive doses of a PGF-analog gel formulation given intravaginally at selected times during gestation. Nonpregnant diestrus was divided into three periods (early, mid and late) based on vaginal cytology and plasma progesterone concentration. Pregnant <b>bitches</b> were treated with a PGF-analog gel at corresponding stages of pregnancy (early, mid and late) and evaluated by ultrasound. Another eight pregnant <b>bitches</b> were similarly studied and serum progesterone concentrations were determined after 1, 2, 3 or 4 days of PGF-analog gel. Corpora lutea obtained by ovariohysterectomy were analyzed for apoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation relative {{to that in a}} control cell line (U 937), using an apoptotic DNA ladder kit and gel electrophoresis and for relative expression of the pro-apoptotic Bax gene by RT-PCR and electrophoresis. In nonpregnant <b>bitches,</b> the DNA fragmentation apoptotic index was greater in late than in early diestrus (P < 0. 01). The index after 1 day of PGF-analog gel was higher in early pregnant <b>bitches</b> than in early diestrus <b>bitches</b> (P < 0. 05); it was highest in midpregnancy (P < 0. 05). The degree of apoptosis was related to the number of times PGF-analog gel was administered. Bax mRNA was detected in the corpus luteum (CL) and Bax expression increased from early to middiestrus in nonpregnant subjects (P < 0. 05). Potential elevation in Bax due to PGF-analog gel treatment in pregnancy was only significant in relation to normal diestrus during early pregnancy (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, we inferred that the effects of endogenous or exogenous prostaglandin on CL life span in <b>bitches</b> involved increases in apoptotic activity and that increased apoptosis was implicated in normal luteal regression in nonpregnant <b>bitches...</b>|$|R
