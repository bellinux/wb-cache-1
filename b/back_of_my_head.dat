5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't really know that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
500|$|Eve Myles {{previously}} {{appeared in}} the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "The Unquiet Dead" [...] as Gwyneth, a 19th-century clairvoyant. Gwyneth had {{a connection to the}} Cardiff Rift, which later became a central plot device in Torchwood. In response to questions about the similarity of the characters' names, Russell T Davies denied they were connected, stating they are [...] "just two names beginning with [...] "G"." [...] Subsequently however, Davies' 2008 Doctor Who episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] alluded to a familial relationship between the characters (with the Doctor specifically asking if Gwen was a family name and Gwen replying that it was), explaining their physical resemblance as the result of [...] "spatial genetic multiplicity". Eve Myles said of the two characters, [...] "it was never on the cards as such, but something in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> always said {{that they were going to}} be connected somehow." [...] Davies explained that the relationship between the characters is not literal, stating that [...] "It's not familial as we understand it" [...] instead characterising spatial genetic multiplicity as [...] "an echo and repetition of physical traits across a Time Rift." ...|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure I was compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Yorke said: [...] "It annoys me {{how pretty}} my voice is. That sounds {{incredibly}} immodest, but it annoys me how polite it can sound when perhaps what I'm singing is deeply acidic." [...] In 2013, he said: [...] "Whenever I'm building anything, whether it's on a laptop or drum machine or whatever... there's always a vocal {{going in the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head.</b> It's almost {{impossible for me to}} listen to a dance tune from beginning to end without picturing a voice." ...|$|E

Indistinctly I heard my fellow batsman Bill Edrich saying: 'My God, Lindy, you've killed him!'...I was very, very angry with Ray Lindwall.

5000|$|... "Hung Up" [...] {{is a song}} by Paul Weller {{released}} in 1994. The song was Weller's first top ten hit in seven years.

2500|$|I {{have taken}} up unconstitutional action at this time because of the {{abnormal}} circumstances and because precedent has been given by the British government. I am a socialist, and have been fighting and will fight for an absolute reconstruction of society {{for the benefit of}} all. I am proud <b>of</b> <b>my</b> conduct. I have squared my conduct with my intellect, and if everyone had done so this war would not have taken place. I act square and clean for my principles. .... No matter what your accusations against me may be, no matter what reservations you keep at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> your <b>head,</b> <b>my</b> appeal is to the working class. I appeal exclusively to them because they and they only can bring about the time when the whole world will be in one brotherhood, on a sound economic foundation. That, and that alone, can be the means of bringing about a re-organisation of society. That can only be obtained when the people of the world get the world, and retain the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not {{naturally}} sentimental, as you know, {{and even}} now I am not prepared to admit that I {{fell in love with}} this face. It was not, I think, that kind of attraction. Possibly I should have passed the photograph by had it not suggested old times to me--old times with a veil over them, for I could not identify the face. That I had at some period <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life known the original I felt certain, but I tapped my memory in vain. The lady was a lovely blonde, with a profusion of fair hair, and delicate features that were Roman when they were not Greek. To describe a beautiful woman is altogether beyond me. No doubt this face had faults. I fancy, for instance, that there was little character in the chin, and that the eyes were 'melting' rather than expressive. It was a vignette, the hands being clasped rather fancifully at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the <b>head.</b> <b>My</b> fingers drummed on the album as I sat there pondering; but when or where I had met the original I could not decide. The colonel could give me no information. The album was Jack's, he said, and probably had not been opened for years. The photograph, too, was an old one; he was sure {{it had been in the}} house long before his son's marriage, so that (and here the hard-hearted old gentleman chuckled) it could no longer be like the original. As he seemed inclined to become witty at my expense, I closed the album, and soon afterward I went away. I say, wake up! ...|$|R
2500|$|Billy Strayhorn, {{originally}} {{hired as}} a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed [...] "Swee' Pea" [...] for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly {{of the man and}} their collaborative working relationship, [...] "my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> my brain waves in his head, and his in mine". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or [...] "Duke's doppelganger". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then he says [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind my head in the room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. I could feel the presence of Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>head</b> out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual." ...|$|E
